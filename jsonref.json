[{"url":null,"title":"Governments scientists Covid spread China meeting","story":"Share this article But the panel stood firm and said: \u0027Providing information to travellers and providing effective means for screening febrile travellers attending healthcare settings was likely to be a better option.\u0027 Professor Ferguson, who was one of the experts behind the terrifying Imperial College London projections that spooked No10 into Britain\u0027s first lockdown in March, claimed that modelling suggested the benefit would be \u0027low\u0027.He said it would only detect travellers who were not sick before boarding a flight but became ill during the journey. This is because it can take patients several days before they show any signs of being ill. Minutes from the second meeting on January 21 also show that \u0027NERVTAG felt there was a lack of clarity on the exit screening process in Wuhan\u0027.But the group assumed China was stopping travellers with a fever from departing the nation because of statements released by local authorities. And they said it would have little effect – even if Beijing\u0027s bureaucrats weren\u0027t doing it.Dr James Rubin, a psychologist at King\u0027s College London, also warned that screening could lead to \u0027stigma\u0027 for travellers. Documents say: \u0027It was noted that port of entry screening in the UK would be a significant undertaking, especially as fever may not be a very sensitive method of identifying cases.\u0027Fever wasn\u0027t mooted as a symptom until January 30 – the day after the first two coronavirus patients were diagnosed on British soil. Members \u0027largely agreed\u0027 it was a sign of the disease.NERVTAG also said that direct flights out of Wuhan would not be the only way to travel out of the affected area and that the outbreak zone \u0027appears to be expanding\u0027.At the third meeting on January 28, the experts discussed widening the \u0027case definition\u0027 of a Covid patient – a set of criteria to classify whether someone really has Covid.Department of Health bosses warned keeping it just to patients who had been to Wuhan – which had already banned all flights and trains from leaving the city – was inconsistent with the reality of the \u0027changing geographical spread of the virus\u0027.Data at the time revealed there were at least 30 provinces in China with confirmed cases of WN-CoV – the place-holder name for the coronavirus before it was eventually given a title in early February.NERVTAG said \u0027expanding the case definition to the whole of mainland China at this moment in time was not feasible and did not seem appropriate with the information at hand\u0027.But they agreed it should include the whole of Hubei – which is home to around 60million people – and a wider number of provinces. The list of affected areas should be kept under review, NERVTAG also said.Just two days later at the fourth meeting, the group U-turned on their advice and accepted it was \u0027necessary\u0027 to include all of mainland China on the case definition list.Minutes from the meeting say: \u0027Following a short discussion, NERVTAG agreed with DHSC on expansion of the geographical element of the case definition to include the whole of mainland China.\u0027Professor Chris Whitty also said that \u0027feedback\u0027 and the \u0027evolving nature\u0027 of the crisis meant that it would be better to slap the whole country on the list, instead of just a handful of provinces. Professor Van-Tam also argued that any Britons with tell-tale symptoms of Covid who were seeking to be repatriated from China should not be allowed to board an organised flight back to the UK.During the same meeting, NERVTAG said there was \u0027no evidence\u0027 to support that wearing face masks cuts the risk of spreading the virus.  China denies entry to team of WHO experts due to investigate the origins of Covid-19 pandemic amid growing suspicions of a cover-upChina has denied entry to a team of World Health Organisation (WHO) experts who were due to arrive in the country to investigate the origins of the coronavirus.The news comes amid growing suspicions of a cover-up in the country where Covid-19 is believed to have originated at the end of 2019, although its origins remain bitterly contested as China remains determined to control the narrative.The head of the World Health Organisation says he was \u0027disappointed\u0027 that Chinese officials have not finalised permissions for the arrival of the team of experts.A year after the outbreak started, WHO experts were due in China for a highly politicised visit to explore the origins of the coronavirus, in a trip trailed by accusations of cover-ups, conspiracy and fears of a whitewash.The WHO said China granted permission for a visit by its experts, with a 10-person team expected to arrive this week - but before most could even begin their journeys they faced roadblocks, with Beijing yet to grant them entry.The WHO\u0027s emergencies director Michael Ryan said Tuesday that the problem was a lack of visa clearances, adding that he hoped it was a \u0027logistic and bureaucratic issue that can be resolved very quickly.\u0027World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, in a rare critique of Beijing, says members of the international scientific team have begun over the last 24 hours to leave from their home countries to China as part of an arrangement between WHO and the Chinese government.\u0027Today, we learned that Chinese officials have not yet finalised the necessary permissions for the team\u0027s arrival in China,\u0027 he said at a news conference Tuesday in Geneva.\u0027I am very disappointed with this news, given that two members had already begun their journeys and others were not able to travel at the last minute,\u0027 Tedros told reporters in Geneva, in a rare rebuke of Beijing from the UN body.He added that he has \u0027been in contact with senior Chinese officials\u0027 and that he had \u0027once again made it clear that the mission is a priority for the WHO.\u0027I have been assured that China is speeding up the internal procedure of the earliest possible deployment. We\u0027re eager to get the mission under way as soon as possible,\u0027 he said.Earlier this week Chinese authorities had refused to confirm the exact dates and details of the visit, a sign of the enduring sensitivity of their mission.Covid-19 was first detected in the central city of Wuhan in late 2019, before seeping beyond China\u0027s borders to wreak global havoc, costing over 1.8 million lives and eviscerating economies.But its origins remain bitterly contested, lost in a fog of recriminations and conjecture from the international community - as well as obfuscation from Chinese authorities determined to keep control of its virus narrative."},{"url":null,"title":"Actress refuses appear Womans Hour accusing host Emma Barnett degrading ","story":"Share this article Today\u0027s programme about the \u0027Me Too\u0027 movement\u0027 took place one year on from the start of Harvey Weinstein\u0027s court case in America. Barnett was discussing, \u0027what the #MeToo movement has achieved and the unintended consequences.\u0027But the show also sparked anger among some listeners after one of the actresses claimed some women \u0027lied\u0027 about sexual abuse accusations. She told the show: \u0027There are the bad apples out there that jump on the band wagon and maybe aren\u0027t telling the truth..you hope there aren\u0027t too many liars out there.\u0027 Others took to social media to share frustration about comments made by guest Lionel Shriver on the show. The American author claimed MeToo, \u0027has made women more paranoid, more hostile,\u0027 and, \u0027diminished women in the eyes of men.\u0027        "},{"url":null,"title":"Adorable moment golden retriever got baffled pair slippers","story":"Share this article The video was a huge hit after it was shared on Molly\u0027s own Instagram page which boasts almost 43,000 followers.The video has racked up over 220,00 likes from fans who have fallen in the love with the curious pooch.One user commented: \u0027OMG amazing.

The new strain of the virus is not yet spreading as widely in the North of the country. NHS figures show that on the worst day in the first wave, April 12, there were 18,974 people with Covid-19 in England\u0027s hospitals.On December 29 this was 21,787. It has since spiralled to 26,626 but hospital-by-hospital data is not yet available for the extra 5,000 patients.December\u0027s data shows that London has the greatest number of Covid patients in hospital – in part because it has the biggest population – but there have been far sharper rises in the South East and the East of England.In the East of the country, inpatient numbers are 74 per cent higher than they were in the spring, with 2,922 patients on December 29 compared to 1,679 on April 12.There were 62 per cent more in the South East – 3,796 compared to 2,342.In London, the Midlands and the South West, there were between eight and nine per cent more patients at the end of December than at the country\u0027s peak in April.But the North East, North West and Yorkshire all now have fewer inpatients than they did nine months ago. Many hospitals in the North, however, experienced the same spiralling pressures now being seen in the South at the start of the first wave in September, October and November, when cases were still low in other parts of the country.Mid and South Essex NHS trust, which runs hospitals in Southend, Basildon and Chelmsford, is one of the ones to have seen the biggest spike in patients during the second wave. On December 29 it had 785 people on wards with Covid-19, which was 411 more than double the 374 on April 12, England\u0027s peak.East Kent Hospitals has seen admissions almost three times as high, with 415 patients compared to 143, while the Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells trust had 3.5 times as many patients in December: 299 compared to 85. "},{"url":null,"title":"EU countries face delays

walk-in takeaway service during the new coronavirus lockdown in England.The fast food chain said its dine-in and walk-in takeaway offering would not be available while it reassessed its procedures with an independent health and safety body.However the firm, which has about 1,300 outlets in the UK, said its restaurants would remain open for its drive-through and delivery services.Paul Pomroy, McDonald’s UK and Ireland chief executive, said: “This is a temporary change in our operations to allow us to test and validate any additional measures that may further enhance the safety of our takeaway service.”McDonald’s said it would update customers with any changes to its service via its website and app.Under the January restrictions, which constitute England’s toughest lockdown since March, all non-essential retail and hospitality must close or remain closed.Restaurants, pubs and other hospitality venues are not allowed to offer dining on the premises, but can continue to offer deliveries or takeaways.However, they are no longer allowed to serve takeaway or click and collect alcohol, amid concerns about people congregating around pubs and bars.Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are also in lockdown.Fast food chains including McDonald’s, Burger King and Nando’s initially closed during the first nationwide lockdown last spring, before introducing new safety measures and working practices, which allowed them to gradually reopen restaurants for takeaway, delivery and drive-through services.A spokesman for Burger King said takeaway was still available in some branches but “restaurants operating drive-through, takeaway, click and collect and delivery via Deliveroo, Uber Eats and Just Eat, will continue to operate these services, in line with guidance issued”.Pret a Manger said it would keep some of its branches open for takeaway and delivery services, although some remain closed because of reduced footfall.A spokesperson for the coffee and sandwich chain said keeping 230 of its 389 UK branches open allowed it to “provide convenient access to freshly prepared food to communities and donate more meals to those who need it, with our charity partners”.The firm said it had reviewed its safety processes and believed it had “strong protocols in place to ensure our shops can safely remain open for both takeaway and delivery”.Pret shifted its business to focus on delivery in 2020 and said it had seen a significant increase in the use of delivery by customers since.Deliveroo said in response to the new restrictions it had launched mandatory contact-free delivery to customers, as well as mandatory contact-free pickup from restaurants.However, takeaways are permitted only until 11pm under the government restrictions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9a555a2b94067f7392a7a888ac693e12ed3adbf/0_73_2200_1319/master/2200.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=eab9ee060a87e1e0888d81b57220abe3","title":"uk watchdog investigating nvidia dollar 40bn takeover of arm","story":"Competition and Markets Authority examining deal to buy UK-based chip firmBritain’s competition watchdog has launched an investigation into the $40bn (£29.5bn) takeover of the UK-based chip designer Arm by the US company Nvidia.The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has called for interested parties to submit views on the contentious deal before the launch of a formal investigation later this year.Arm Holdings, which employs 6,500 staff including 3,000 in the UK, is a global leader in designing chips for smartphones, computers and tablets. California-based Nvidia, a graphics chip specialist, announced its plan to buy the British tech group from Japan’s SoftBank in September.SoftBank had acquired Arm for $32bn in 2016, when the Japanese company took advantage of the fall in value of the pound after the Brexit vote. Arm is based in Cambridge but has operations in a number of UK towns and cities, including Manchester, Belfast and Warwick.Its chief executive, Simon Segars, acknowledged at the time of the Nvidia deal that it could take up to 18 months to win approval from regulators around the world.On Wednesday, the chief executive of the CMA, Andrea Coscelli, said: “The chip technology industry is worth billions and critical to many of the products that we use most in our everyday lives. We will work closely with other competition authorities around the world to carefully consider the impact of the deal and ensure that it doesn’t ultimately result in consumers facing more expensive or lower-quality products.”The CMA said it would examine the possible effect of the deal on competition in the UK and whether Arm had an “incentive to withdraw, raise prices or reduce the quality of its intellectual property licensing services to Nvidia’s rivals”.If the investigation finds that the deal breaches UK competition rules, the CMA’s powers include the authority to block the takeover.In October, Hermann Hauser, the co-founder of Arm, wrote to the House of Commons foreign affairs committee arguing that if the deal was allowed to proceed, the combined business would become the next US tech monopoly alongside companies such as Google and Facebook.He has argued that because Nvidia is one of more than 500 users of Arm’s designs worldwide – which include Apple, Samsung and Qualcomm – becoming the Cambridge-based business’s parent company will destroy Arm’s “even-handed” model and ultimately kill the world-leading British tech company.Hauser also told the BBC last year the deal would be “an absolute disaster for Cambridge, the UK and Europe”, adding that Nvidia would inevitably decide to relocate Arm to the US, leading to lost jobs.Hauser has said the government should use its powers to prevent the takeover, but has also backed indefinite legally binding conditions as an alternative. These include a guarantee to keep Arm’s staff in Cambridge, Belfast, Manchester and Warwick, and a promise that Nvidia does not get preferential treatment on new versions of the designer’s chips.The shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, has also expressed concerns about the deal, and has called on the government to intervene to prevent parts of Arm from being moved out of the UK."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a26ccc5e44bf058553434147535772703bbff648/0_46_3150_1890/master/3150.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d5ce34ae53e243bb0d98e2926099843","title":"rishi sunak britain economy families businesses","story":"Families and businesses face ruin. They need more than half measures from the chancellorThe government’s response to Covid has been one of political brinkmanship. It dithered over the enforcement of a first, second and third lockdown – despite scientists warning that restrictions were necessary. It gave businesses little clarity about the continuation of the furlough scheme in the autumn, leading to a wave of redundancies. It informed teachers that schools would remain open through January, before abruptly U-turning on this assertion.The same goes for the economic support it has offered to businesses affected by the third lockdown. Following Boris Johnson’s announcement of new restrictions across England, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced a package of economic measures including £9,000 grants for retail, leisure and hospitality businesses forced to close. These grants will provide a margin of much-needed relief to businesses (especially because they are grants, rather than loans). But they still fall far short of what is needed to stabilise the economy and support people to comply with the new measures.Many businesses have shouldered a huge amount of risk during the pandemic. They have taken on large debts, which they face having to pay off for years if they make it through the crisis. And there’s no certainty over whether the furlough scheme will continue beyond April, even if restrictions remain in place. While the chancellor has offered £4.6bn in support, Bank of England figures from December show firms face a £180bn drop in cashflow, a figure likely to rise as a result of the latest lockdown.A £9,000 grant may keep the landlord from the door in the short term, but it’s unlikely to prevent some businesses owners from shutting up shop in the face of serious uncertainty. And the £594m that has been allocated to businesses outside the retail, leisure and hospitality sectors in these latest measures is a drop in the ocean – particularly for the many businesses that supply these sectors, such as manufacturers. For instance, while car showrooms will receive support because they’re classed as retailers, car manufacturers will be left out in the cold.Although Sunak has said he will review the measures in the early March budget, this will be too late to give businesses and employers the certainty they need. To provide more certainty, he could start by guaranteeing that the furlough scheme will continue during any future restrictions that prevent businesses from opening.Cash support for businesses should be about 10 times more generous to avoid them collapsing under a mountain of debt. This doesn’t mean that we should settle for a stream of government handouts to the private sector. Where risks are socialised, the public should share in the rewards. In countries such as Germany it is the norm for the state to take equity stakes in businesses in return for an injection of cash. This could be done in the UK through a national investment bank, or “Project Birch”, the government’s bailout plan for companies during the pandemic.Ultimately, the future of UK businesses relies on the success of the government’s public health strategy. Sunak has been reportedly cautious of lockdowns for fear of their impact on the economy. This is mistaken. The sooner the virus is controlled, the sooner the economy can reopen, and the sooner we can escape this endless cycle of lockdown and release.There are measures that Sunak could put in place now to help make the lockdown shorter and less painful. Many people face impossible choices between maintaining their family’s income and protecting others by self-isolating. If the government is serious about bringing down the R number, they should start by raising the UK’s woefully inadequate statutory sick pay, which stands at just £95.85 a week, and extending it to workers who aren’t currently eligible. And those who are instructed to self-isolate and can’t do their jobs should be paid the living wage for doing so.Only by addressing these underlying issues will the government ensure this third lockdown is as effective as possible. Rather than using his March budget to firefight, the chancellor could set out a proper recovery plan. His challenge is to stabilise the economy while investing for the future. That should include an ambitious fiscal stimulus – the IPPR estimates £164bn is needed in the next financial year – to invest in measures to reach net-zero emissions, meet pledges to “level up”, and rebuild public services to avoid the NHS reaching breaking point in the future. From the IMF to the OECD, the economic consensus is clear: we can’t cut our way out of the crisis, no matter what the chancellor’s conservative instincts are.Opting for half-measures and delaying the inevitable may help manage the lockdown sceptics within the Conservative party, but it is no way to manage public health or an economy. Instead, the chancellor must offer businesses and families the certainty they need to reach the light at the end of the tunnel.• Carys Roberts is executive director of the Institute for Public Policy Research"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/169ae0b18452d5bc09431977b3170fc9fcdd0310/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=1f2758b69bfce4b3bae51f48c32db06c","title":"a level and gsce students how are you feeling about exams","story":"We would like to hear from students in England about their reaction to summer exams likely being cancelledThe education secretary is due to make a statement in the Commons on Wednesday saying summer exams in core subjects may still go ahead in England.

But what I found was a desert, totally devoid of even common Mediterranean species.”The murex, for example, is a gastropod that has been used throughout the Mediterranean since Roman times for the Tyrian purple clothing dye. Albano said he found no members of this species on the 200km of coastline in the four-year study.The research team took samples at multiple points, then compared living mollusc numbers with previous population sizes, which were estimated from empty shells found in sediment. The shortfall exceeded anything seen before. “This is the largest climate-driven regional-scale ersity loss in the oceans documented to date,” the paper says.The change is visible at scuba-ing depths of between 5 and 40 metres. In deeper waters the temperatures are lower. In intertidal areas, species have evolved to adapt to wider temperature ranges. In between, native molluscs are disappearing.“The ecosystem will be different and it will function in a different way. This is very clear. But the situation is so dynamic it is hard to predict the consequences,” Albano said.The scientists believe the cause of the destruction is human-driven climate disruption. The Israeli coast – which is one of the hottest parts of the Mediterranean – experienced a temperature increase of 3C between 1980 and 2013. The average summer surface temperature is 32C. This is thought to have triggered the eradication of native mollusc populations – a phenomenon detected in previous studies elsewhere.Pollution and the arrival of tropical species through the Suez canal were deemed less significant factors. Pollution tended to be localised around ports such as Haifa, and the canal has existed for over 150 years. Studies of the coastline in the 1970s and 80s showed healthy waters.Albano said the collapse was likely to have occurred in the past 20 years and had affected the entire ecosystem: “The sea is completely changing from temperate Mediterranean to impoverished tropical. This turnover is rapid and in progress. It has not yet reached a stable state.”Albano believed this was part of an irreversible trend as global warming made the relatively cool Mediterranean more like the tropical Red Sea. This echoes similar findings in the far north, where scientists say the cold Arctic Ocean increasingly resembles the warmer Atlantic in terms of biology, chemistry and temperature.As well as stepping up protections of the still relatively pristine deep waters and tackling localised problems like pollution, Albano said the only way to address this shift was to tackle climate change by reducing emissions as soon as possible.“In my opinion we have no choice. This should be first on the list of things to do when we consider how we are changing the planet. It is blind to think this should not be tackled immediately. Exactly like Covid, we need to treat this as an emergency.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c681daa5c85888ede9e24f9db0193c682f2da9ad/1194_1262_5359_3214/master/5359.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=71c455fb3ed6030568d54acdfe764934","title":"fernandinho seals another carabao cup final date for manchester city","story":"Manchester City will take on Tottenham in April’s Wembley showpiece aiming to win the Carabao Cup for a remarkable fourth consecutive year, a feat only Liverpool have achieved.For Ole Gunnar Solskjær and Manchester United this was a fourth successive semi-final reverse: losing at the stage is becoming a habit they have to break. What killed them were the two latest episodes of slack defending from set-pieces. Each presaged John Stones and Fernandinho’s strikes. Here, too, is another bad practice that the manager bemoaned afterwards but the simple fact is that it is on him to eradicate.City are jubilant and rightly so. When it mattered they landed the knockout punches to set up a fascinating tactical showdown between Pep Guardiola and José Mourinho.As the resurgent Stones said: “We tried to be more clinical in the final third and did the job at the end of the day.”Each manager made two changes. Solskjær selected Dean Henderson to continue in goal in the competition, meaning David de Gea was on the bench and Victor Lindelöf replaced Eric Bailly in central defence. Guardiola dropped Rodri and with Bernardo Silva suspended, Fernandinho and Riyad Mahrez came into a City XI with no recognised No 9, Sergio Agüero and Gabriel Jesus among the substitutes.City began how they like: pinging possession around as Phil Foden, Oleksandr Zinchenko, Fernandinho and Stones all took turns. They had the ball in the net when Ilkay Gündogan turned home Foden’s cross from the left but it was correctly ruled offside. The contest had a far higher tempo than last month’s cagey 0-0 draw here. Then Guardiola oversaw an approach that was muted for him and his team. What did still remain, though, was City’s penchant for sloppiness from the back as Stones’ errant pass caused Raheem Sterling to lose the ball, Scott McTominay reverse-passed to Bruno Fernandes and the City goalkeeper, Zack Steffen, flung himself high and left to tip the Portuguese’s goal-bound shot out for a corner.An invigorating spectacle was next decorated by Kevin De Bruyne who, when the ball was rolled to him in a central area, paused, then let fly: the effort left Henderson a spectator and only his right post prevented the opener, the ball smacking back off it.Guardiola had João Cancelo roving in from right-back to make an extra man in midfield, a ploy he uses occasionally, yet it did not seem to confuse United: Paul Pogba often following from his wide left berth and pickpocketing him when he could.What had developed was a contest akin to a boxing match in which each pugilist took turns to aim at the other. Nothing was quite connecting but the sense was it might at any moment. By the interval the sides had become a touch becalmed, much of the action occurring in the middle third, each feinting and hoping for an opening that would prove decisive.United’s start to the second half consisted of a Luke Shaw free-kick that was scrambled clear. City’s opening offensive act was Fernandinho’s foul on Pogba that brought a trademark yellow card for the captain. Brighter from the visitors was how Sterling’s wriggle drew McTominay into conceding a free-kick from which they struck. Foden curled a cute delivery into a crowd of players, a hapless Harry Maguire watched the ball pass, and the delighted Stones bundled in.How might United respond to the threat of another semi-final defeat under Solskjær? A balance had to be found between pressing for an equaliser and not allowing City in to score a second that might be fatal.A warning came when City broke and Sterling forced Henderson to concede a corner. Another had Sterling this time being stymied by Henderson low down. Henderson’s third vital intervention was to palm Riyad Mahrez’s 20-yard shot over. United emerged from this mini-siege to claim a corner and Maguire headed over. A further flicker of hope came from a Fernandes attempt that went straight at Steffen.Fernandinho’s second came when a weak Aaron Wan-Bissaka header from a City corner reached him and he beat Henderson from outside the area. By the close Guardiola’s side deserved victory. For Solskjær’s team it is that sinking feeling again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90dce577f1e8434ee1e444d0dda057b6ef94b522/0_87_4503_2702/master/4503.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e629495c60596e45c163390224db69f","title":"colin bell a life in pictures","story":"The ‘King of the Kippax’ has died aged 74 after a short illness – we take a look back at the career of the legendary Manchester City midfielder"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b90bc0ff6508c54e7209300166451925dc31c6c/0_26_4248_2549/master/4248.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8595ae3dc5fb35d458c4be9a5ba0d708","title":"manchester united v manchester city carabao cup semi final live","story":"Second-half goals from John Stones and Fernandinho sent City to yet another League Cup finalSo congratulations to Manchester City commiserations to Manchester United. It’ll be City v Spurs at Wembley in late April ... hopefully with fans in situ, fingers crossed. Thanks for reading this MBM. Stay safe, and nighty night.Pep Guardiola, wearing a LEGEND BELL t-shirt, talks to Sky Sports. “This is for him, for his family. This person helped to build something special for this club. It is an incredible victory for us, to beat United away, to reach the final, and of course this is for him. The team is ready. It was an outstanding performance. We were tired, they had two more days off to rest, but we achieved something incredible. I know the Carabao Cup is not the Champions League, but four times in a row to reach the final is incredible. I’m so impressed by the boys. The final is not next week. Tottenham is a top, top team but we will have time to think about it.”Ole Gunnar Solskjaer speaks to Sky. “City can score many great goals and you can accept that. But when you concede two set-piece goals, simple ones we should have cleared, you are very disappointed. We were just not good enough in those moments. We didn’t do enough to win the game, didn’t create enough big chances ourselves, we didn’t have the extra finesse in the games we’ve had in the league lately. We played against a very good team, they played well, and when they play well you have to play really well to beat them. That’s just the reality of where we’re at. We were just lacking that little bit. They deserve it. But we are getting closer. This is a much better version of Man United than a year ago. That’s positive, but that’s not enough. It’s not psychological, you meet good teams in semis and we just didn’t have enough. They are probably the best team in England. We wanted a final to look forward to, but it’s not going to happen. There are loads of things to play for.”The managers will be speaking soon. But while we wait for that, Jamie Jackson’s report has landed ...City’s goalscoring hero John Stones speaks to Sky Sports. “I’d like to send our condolences from everyone in the dressing room to Colin Bell and his family. How we played today was a reflection of him. A great moment for us, and I’m sure he’s looking down on the game today. Another final and another great occasion, and a derby won against a top team. They caused us problems but we dealt with them and had so many chances. Set pieces are vital in big games and it was good to get something on it.”Manchester City celebrate their victory with great feeling. A huge team huddle, followed by backslaps and hugs all round. They’ll face Tottenham Hotspur in the final, to be played on Sunday 25 April, all going to plan. If they win that, they’ll equal Liverpool’s record of eight League Cup victories, as well as their record of four consecutive wins, set all the way back in the early 1980s. More history there to be written by Pep Guardiola’s remarkable side, who have rediscovered their form in some style. But let them enjoy tonight for now: another derby win, and a lovely way to say farewell to the great Colin Bell.City reach their fourth League Cup final in a row! They were the better side and deserve their reward. A huge grin plays across Guardiola’s face. His opposite number, a grim-faced Solskjaer, walks off to contemplate a fourth semi-final defeat in a row.90 min +2: De Bruyne curls the resulting free kick into the mixer from the right. Nobody gets near it, but it doesn’t really matter now.90 min +1: Shaw stress-tests the referee’s patience a bit too vigorously, yanking Sterling to the floor. He’s booked.90 min: Three extra minutes separate Manchester City from yet another League Cup final.88 min: Shaw is doing his level best to goad his old foe Cancelo into a reaction that would earn him a second yellow. A couple of sly shoves in the chest, just on the right side of legality, as they compete in a tight space. Cancelo, who snapped fairly easily earlier, does well to keep his cool.87 min: Fred is replaced by the lesser-spotted Van de Beek.85 min: Martial tries to flick the ball around Dias and claims a penalty for handball, but again the referee shows no interest whatsoever. It looked a desperate shout.84 min: City celebrated that goal in the grand style. United had been asking a few questions, but that was some response. Guardiola beams broadly. Yet another League Cup final is within touching distance now.De Bruyne has a dig from the right of the D. The ball’s deflected out for a corner on the right. De Bruyne takes. Wan-Bissaka clears, but not with any power. The ball drops to Fernandinho, just to the left of the D. He meets it sweetly, threading a sensational fizzer into the bottom left, a flat-footed Henderson left with no chance!81 min: Greenwood garrinchas in from the right and nearly dribbles into shooting space. Dias intercepts, just in time, and City launch a counter through Sterling and De Bruyne, the latter crossing to nobody in particular.80 min: Fernandes hoicks a speculative long-range effort miles over the bar. A bit early for Hail Mary attempts like this.79 min: City respond to United’s substitution with a change of their own: the quiet Mahrez is replaced by Rodri.78 min: Cancelo is booked for going forehead to forehead with Shaw, who had knocked him over in the silent-movie style.77 min: United have enjoyed 77 percent of possession during the last five minutes. City seem perfectly happy about it, playing United at their own game, hoping to soak it all up and break dangerously if the chance presents itself.75 min: United make the first change of the evening, throwing on Greenwood in place of McTominay.74 min: It’s a good spell for United, who push City back. Suddenly Martial dribbles his way through a couple of gaps down the middle and enters the box ... before falling to ground over a non-existent challenge by Dias. Martial claims a penalty a furious Dias demands retribution for the e. Referee Martin Atkinson takes the diplomatic route by waving both claims away. We play on.72 min: Pogba busies himself down the left and pulls back for Fernandes, who attempts a curler towards the top right. He finds the top right of the Stretford End.71 min: A reminder that both teams can make up to five subs, in a maximum of three batches. United are playing well enough for things to remain as they are, but time is becoming a factor.69 min: Fred goes into the box for an agricultural swipe through the back of Gundogan. Meanwhile Peter Oh (56 min) scores an open goal: “No second coming, promise.”68 min: Fernandinho has a shot that has enough welly to knock Maguire to the floor. The deflection loops harmlessly into Henderson’s arms. This doesn’t feel like it’s going to end 0-1. But who scores next?67 min: Fernandes drifts in from the left and shapes to curl one towards the top right. He telegraphs his intention, and the resulting floater is easy meat for Steffen. United have responded well to falling behind.65 min: Fernandes has a dig from distance, but sends his shot straight down Steffen’s throat.64 min: Some space for Martial down the left. His low fizzing cross forces Dias to stick out a telescopic leg and poke the ball out for a corner. From the set piece, Maguire rises highest, but under pressure from Stones, can’t steer his header anywhere hear the goal.63 min: Nothing comes of the resulting corner.62 min: Fred has the ball stolen off his toe in midfield by Sterling. He feeds Mahrez, who opens his legs, strides down the middle, and powers a curler towards the top left. Henderson tips over spectacularly. Great football all round, with the exception of Fred, whose leisurely faffing nearly cost United dear.60 min: Martial contests a high ball with Zinchenko in the City box. It clanks off Martial’s chest for a goal kick. Martial claims the ball has hit Zinchenko’s hand, but neither ref nor VAR shows any interest. Then City break upfield, Sterling nearly rounding Henderson on the right, only for the keeper to snaffle just in time.58 min: Foden crosses from the left. Sterling heads towards the top corner. Henderson claws it out. From the resulting corner, the ball’s worked to Cancelo out on the right. He whips towards the far stick. Foden is a toenail clipping away from poking home. Goal kick.56 min: “Stones has come up roses for City,” quips Peter Oh, because somebody had to. But no more, please. This is the one.54 min: That’s the first goal United have conceded in this competition this season. But they’ve not been too shabby at recovering after conceding first this season - 18 points gained from losing positions in the Premier League illustrate that - so there’s no need for the hosts to worry quite yet. City are on top right now, though, playing with something of a swagger.52 min: ... and nearly doubled, as Cancelo drops a shoulder to glide in from the right and pearls a vicious rising shot towards the top left. Henderson can’t get anywhere near it, but the ball shaves the paint on the top of the bar. So close! That would have been a screamer.51 min: VAR sticks its unwanted neb in - of course it does, boys and their toys - but Stones wasn’t offside and the ball didn’t hit his arm. City’s lead is confirmed.It’s dangerous all right. Foden curls it in. The ball makes it all the way to the back post, where Stones - who accidentally trundled the ball into this very net early on - trundles another one into the bottom right off his thigh!49 min: Sterling busies himself down the left and is dragged back by McTominay. This free kick will be in a dangerous position, just to the left of the United box. City load it.48 min: Fernaninho slides in on Pogba from behind, unnecessarily so. The City player receives a double-whammy of punishment: a yellow card, plus he’s clouted on the follow-through as the players tangle on the turf.46 min: Shaw sends in a free kick from the left. Pogba flicks on. There are red shirts lining up at the far post, but Dias hoicks clear. A bright start to the second half by the hosts.United get the second half underway on a chilly night. No changes made by either side. Yet. So will either side finally get round to scoring after three consecutive goal-free halves in Manchester derbies? “What happened to ‘deadly strikers’?” wonders Phillip Wainwright. “It’s a shame that modern tactics lean toward the absence of a ‘proper finisher’ in a team. Even Cavani, arguably someone under this umbrella in modern times, misses a hatful of cleareasy chances every season. See also Rashford, Martial, Bamford, Bergwijn, Sterling, Werner, even Son at Spurs... Is it just my rose-tinted view or did Van Nistelrooy, Henry, Shearer, Fowler etc not miss as many easy chances? I am an enormous fan of Rashford, on and off the pitch, but if him and the enigmatic Martial were to not miss as many easy chances, Man Utd would be an infinitely more dangerous prospect. Imagine if they had KaneSon.”Half-time advertisement. Those siding with the red half of Manchester may be interested in this new podcast, presented by a couple of chaps you may recognise.Both teams have come close - there have been three disallowed goals plus one shot off the post - but it’s goalless at the break.45 min: Fernandes has a chance to release Rashford down the middle, but uncharacteristically makes a royal balls of the through ball. 43 min: Rashford whips a ball into the City box from the right. It rears up and smacks Stones on the arm. Stones had been clumsily leaning into the ball, so there’s a big penalty shout, but his arm was just about in a natural position, and he gets the benefit of the doubt.41 min: De Bruyne strides into space down the right. He hooks into the middle, looking for the so-far-ineffectual Mahrez. Wan-Bissaka volleys clear.40 min: City continue to stroke the ball around, but they’re not forcing Henderson into too much action.38 min: Foden has the beating of Wan-Bissaka down the left. He twice gets past his man in the space of a few seconds, though on neither occasion delivers the killer ball.36 min: Fernandinho sends a glorious diagonal ball towards Sterling on the right. Sterling is in acres, and romps into the box. He just needs to jink past Shaw to make room for a shot from close range ... but clumsily runs slap-bang into the stationary defender, and doesn’t get the penalty he screams for."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/054ec8b64ae6e85b90e65cdda7f8cec74ae61ec0/143_0_3643_2185/master/3643.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=b741e723d992389165bcccfd3b301cee","title":"why do some people find it harder than others to lose weight","story":"After treating thousands of obese people, bariatric surgeon Andrew Jenkinson was left wondering why, when most people eat too many calories, only some become overweight.

Last week parliament was recalled to pass the EU trade agreement. This week it was recalled to allow the government’s third national lockdown to be retrospectively rubber-stamped. From this, you might imagine that the government either leaves important legislation until the last possible minute or doesn’t really have much of a clue what it will be doing from one day to the next. And you wouldn’t be wrong on either account.A recall suggests high drama. The reality was the precise opposite. A general sense of existential ennui until the proceedings reached the conclusion that everyone knew was inevitable. But parliamentary formalities must be observed, so the day kicked off with Boris Johnson giving a statement in which he basically cut and pasted paragraphs of Monday night’s TV address along with a few from Tuesday’s Downing Street press conference.The new coronavirus variant had forced his hand, he began. If rather later than many scientists had wanted, given he had known about the variant for weeks. So he was planning on locking down the country until at least 22 February, even though the regulations gave him the leeway to keep the UK shut down until the end of March.No one wanted to close schools, he continued, before insisting schools were still safe, even though he was closing them. This caused some puzzlement on both sets of benches. We were now in the realm of Schrödinger’s schools. Both safe and unsafe. Unless what he was trying to say was that the schools themselves were safe: it was just the pupils and the teachers in them who weren’t. But not to worry, because this time round we had a way out of the pandemic, with 14m doses of the vaccine being administered to the most vulnerable iniduals by the middle of February. He was rather short on detail on the logistics of this. But then, Johnson has often relied on a wing and a prayer.In reply, Keir Starmer’s only regret was that the government hadn’t acted earlier, as he himself had suggested. The Captain Hindsight, as the prime minister used to call the Labour leader, has morphed into Captain Foresight. But to be fair, most of the country has been consistently ahead of the government on when further restrictions are needed. Keir breezed through a shortlist of the government’s failures over that past 10 months but even he sounded as if he was on autopilot, with the expression of someone who knew he was basically talking to himself.MPs had been advised to stay away from parliament – for their own sanity as much as their health – and to contribute remotely, but only Labour, the SNP and the Lib Dems appeared to have taken the guidance seriously. While the opposition benches were near enough empty, the Tory benches were almost full with MPs who had made a special effort to travel into Westminster to say just how dangerous such travel had become and, though they regretted the measures and would like regular votes between now and March on keeping the restrictions in place, they accepted the need for them at present.The lone dissenter was Desmond Swayne, who described the loss of liberty as “pettifogging malice” – someone needs to let him know the daily Covid death total had just passed 1,000 for the first time since April – but Boris dealt with him easily enough. In fact, by the end Johnson was looking quite chipper. So much so, that he began to overpromise yet again, virtually assuring the house that schools would reopen and life would be more normal next month. After a few days under the cosh, Boris the crowdpleaser was back. Even if it was in reduced circumstances.Still, that statement proved to be the day’s highpoint compared with what followed – a statement from the hapless education secretary, Gavin Williamson, on why there was no inconsistency between him saying last week that exams were still on and schools would remain open and this week announcing the opposite.It was all a far cry from those heady days of 2006 when he won fireplace salesman of the year at the St Albans Travelodge. Back then he had been a somebody. A man going places. Now he’s just a third-rate politician, in a job from which he can’t be sacked because he’s fucked it up so badly that his successor would inevitably also have to resign from the fallout of Gav’s incompetence. So he can do nothing but muddle on, each day making a bad situation worse. His tragedy is that, deep down, he knows he’s useless. His confidence is shot, his self-worth at rock bottom. Only the last vestiges of ego remain. He’s condemned to being the worst education secretary of all time but is powerless to do anything about it.Even the most loyal and unctuous Tory MPs have had it with Williamson. One by one they pointedly failed to congratulate him on a job well done and pointed out his failings, over exams, laptops, everything really. He used to be the cabinet’s Private Pike but that has long since become a gross insult to the Dad’s Army character.“I never wanted to be in this position,” he sobbed. And for the first time, he had most of the country on his side. Because there is no one who values education who wishes he was in his current position either.

Premiership Rugby will announce this week’s test results on Thursday but already this is the third consecutive round to feature cancellations and fears are growing over the integrity of the competition.A similar warning was issued over try celebrations before last season’s restart in August and while it was effectively ignored, it is understood the RFU has since created a role specifically designed to ensure compliance with protocols and will consider action against anyone consistently flouting them.Other measures designed to keep clubs Covid safe include players being banned from eating at their training bases or stadiums, and non-playing squad members can no longer attend matches. Also warm-ups will be filmed to help identify close contacts should an outbreak take place.Asked if he believed the protocols needed to be strengthened, the Exeter director of rugby, Rob Baxter, said: “The problem is while the rugby club is probably the safest place there is, you can’t allow for what happens outside. It’s impossible for me to say that a strengthening of the rules within the club environment would stop more Covid outbreaks because none of us are in complete control of what we do outside the club.“A revitalisation and focus on everything around professional sport is good but for me to say changing the rules will make an improvement, I don’t think anyone can say that because we just don’t know.”Northampton confirmed their match against Leicester was the latest to be cancelled on Wednesday after a number of positive cases led to more players having to self-isolate.Northampton are set to be awarded two match points and Leicester four, which means the Saints have now been awarded six points from two matches that have not taken place after last week’s trip to London Irish was scratched.Amid concerns that so many cancelled matches are skewing the Premiership table, there are growing calls among the clubs to do away with relegation this season.“We are incredibly disappointed and frustrated that we are unable to proceed with such an important fixture for the club,” the Northampton director of rugby, Chris Boyd, said. “It’s also a big blow to have back-to-back matches cancelled, as we had hoped to pick up some momentum again following an important win on Boxing Day.“The club has been absolutely rigorous in how we have followed the protocols laid out for us. We are following the advice we have been given, which was not to play the game and to close our training facility until next week.”Baxter also revealed that Exeter had an undisclosed number of positive cases this week but he remains confident Saturday’s top-of-the-table clash with Bristol will go ahead, with the Chiefs taking it upon themselves to introduce another round of testing this week.Baxter has previously told of the benefits of twice-weekly testing and at the behest of the Top 14 clubs, Premiership clubs are set to do so in European weeks, starting with the forthcoming double header later this month. It is understood that what happens beyond that remains under discussion."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46d2a8107fc676b7f9fe995a11bcc41bb05161e2/0_6_5222_3134/master/5222.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=17496957dd99fca7d04287a9d56a21d5","title":"cake decorating quizzes and remote lunches keeping staff connected in the remote work era","story":"We can’t meet for a chat by the coffee machine right now, so how are firms keeping spirits high? With creative and fun virtual activities, it seemsNurturing a sense of shared purpose with work colleagues is challenging in these days of remote work and video meetings. Gone are post-work pints, sandwich-queue chats, tasting your colleague’s “cake-off” creation, and anything else resembling physical proximity and connection to your team. But with a little ingenuity – and a tolerance for 2D socialising – it’s still possible to keep spirits high and have fun.From virtual magicians and online games to judging cakes purely on how delicious they look on Zoom, employees are finding new ways to bond with colleagues – remotely. Events such as quizzes and lunchtime yoga may even have become more popular now that people can log on from home rather than having to stay late at the office or endure a lunch-hour sweat.Jade Emmons, a London-based communications manager for Degreed, a US education technology company, spent part of Halloween in fancy dress, running around her home seeking random items of clothing and a pumpkin as part of a competitive scavenger hunt. That was one of several online games held during her company’s virtual party.Other companies have been equally imaginative. One media organisation replaced its summer party with a global rendition of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, in which correspondents from around the world took on some of Shakespeare’s most popular roles.Meanwhile, at Kindred, a PR firm, winning the 2020 baking competition hinges on how well you can pipe icing rather than perfect the best rise, as in previous years. Each participant received a Betty Crocker cake mix, so the real challenge was the decoration. A Chris Whitty cake – very 2020 – dreamed up by associate director Beccie Stevenson, made it to the final round. “You can’t taste it so it’s all down to the aesthetic,” she says.Stevenson is also a fan of a monthly initiative called Change Maker that gets people to nominate a colleague of the month. Her last pick was Emma Parrish, who won in October for the effort she put into suggesting books, podcasts and music to celebrate Black History Month. “She tackled quite difficult conversations, head on,” says Stevenson. Each winner gets to virtually spin a wheel to win a prize, which ranges from an alarm clock to a pair of sheepskin slippers.Nick Winham, whose job is overseeing a programme to recruit and train the next generation of talent for the software provider ServiceNow, is one of the California-based company’s culture champions, helping to run initiatives to keep its dispersed workforce feeling connected. He says the shift to remote working has resulted in many more people taking part in events such as quizzes. “When we did them at the office, we’d only get 15 people at most,” he says. “Doing them virtually, we’re getting 40 to 50. Other colleagues join in with their families.” Virtual yoga and meditation sessions are also proving to be much more popular than the real-life versions ever were.For companies keen to introduce their own programmes, Winham’s tips include blocking off time during the working day for non-work sessions. His quizzes, for instance, are at 4pm on Thursdays, with a takeaway pizza prize for the winner. “It gets very competitive,” he says.A “step-up” challenge earlier this summer, where ServiceNow colleagues formed teams to record their daily step counts, proved popular thanks to a novel twist that saw two executive directors volunteer to do something different with their hair depending on how much money was raised during the week-long challenge. “That created engagement,” Winham says. “Step-up September” developed as a result, with teams from across Europe.Other activities encourage people to chat openly about the challenges of working from home, with some offering coping tips. “The main advice has been to take a break,” Winham says, adding that he went for a walk before talking to me.London-based LocalGlobe, which invests in startup tech companies, hosts virtual “lunch and learn sessions” with guests as erse as the founder of the small business supporter Funding Circle and a representative of the anti-poverty group Camden Giving. Emma Phillips, a partner at LocalGlobe, says she wants to do all she can to keep employees engaged and connected. “At the moment people are feeling more cut off and isolated than ever, and there is concern that once we’ve defeated Covid-19, we’ll have an even worse mental health pandemic on our hands.”Often the simplest ideas can help compensate for the lack of in-person interaction. Online channels dedicated to different interests, from cats to physical fitness, work well at Degreed, says Emmons, although she steers clear of the HIIT workout and body-building chat. “Our London office manager has a virtual running club that she’s tried to convince me to join, but I’ve managed to dodge it so far!”ServiceNow gives you the power to make work, work better – no matter the circumstances.

Surely nobody would build on such a place, “out of respect, for fear of desecration,” says McCloud, hamming up the potential for gothic drama. “But that’s exactly what my man’s going to do.”It isn’t exactly what his man is going to do – the prospect of ripping up graves to build a “baronial architectural masterpiece” is a little much, even for Grand Designs – but his man, former army captain Justin Maxwell Stuart, is quite happy to live next to a graveyard, and has a big plan to do so. As series 20 of the ever-soothing, ever-ambitious show begins, we learn that Grand Designs’ latest builderdreamervictim has spent £1.8m on the warden’s lodge in a Victorian cemetery and an old toilet block next door to it. The plan is to knock down the loos, build a new extension where they once sat and then extend the neo-gothic Grade II listed lodge by excavating a hefty amount of ground underneath it, constructing a huge mega-basement.Anyone with a passing interest in the grotesque excesses of London’s richest inhabitants will know all about mega-basements, with floor upon floor being added to old houses by way of digging down, and deeper. Local papers often carry complaints about the practice from residents, but here, Maxwell Stuart’s neighbours are relatively undemanding, since they are buried six feet under.What, then, could go wrong? It’s the question that makes Grand Designs so watchable, the promise of hubris among the rubble, of ambitions made of steel and glass, weakened by human folly. The issues facing Maxwell Stuart are floodlit from the very start. The lodge is listed he is building just next to a burial ground the cemetery itself is a sensitive place for a huge-scale building project to take place, and requires special permits for the necessary machinery. He plans to complete all the work in one year. I would watch a compilation of Kevin McCloud’s attempts to suppress any sort of facial response to the wildly gung-ho plans and financial implications laid out every few minutes.This show refuses to be coy about money, which is a significant reason for its success. As well as the initial purchase, Maxwell Stuart has estimated that the work will cost an additional £1.6m. He raised the first part through savings and a loan from his mother the second part is from a labyrinthine tangle of mortgages that I failed to understand. But as is often the case with these kinds of builds, time drags on, costs mount, and even a private gate into the cemetery becomes a problem. If he worried that he may find himself staring down “a catastrophic financial black hole” in 2016, well, wait and see what happens when the pandemic rolls around.It is a fascinating insight into the strange economics of the aristocracy. A trip to Maxwell Stuart’s 900-year-old ancestral home on the Scottish borders reveals why his ambitions are so grand. “This is what I imagine a proper house to be,” he says, in front of a massive old pile, before he crouches through an escape tunnel used by Mary, Queen of Scots. McCloud explains that old money types are often asset-rich but cash-poor, and as the lodge project stretches on, and on, there is a real question of whether it will be completed at all, particularly when the owner keeps embellishing his plans. We are given the impression that Maxwell Stuart has reached his absolute financial limit, yet there is no question of sacrificing the gargantuan chain-mail waterfall that sits alongside his basement swimming pool.Even McCloud seems shocked by the seemingly unnecessary scale of it all, likening the basement to that of a skyscraper, or a car park. The trick of this whole series, though, is that, despite yourself, you mostly end up hoping it will happen, and rooting for the person who has dared to take on such a task, who has dared to assume that they can do it quickly and relatively cheaply, and who might just, thanks to the absolute dedication of the workers they employ, pull it off. Maxwell Stuart is thoroughly can-do about the whole thing, even when logic suggests he shouldn’t be, and it’s hard not to wish him the best with it. Even if he is a little less chipper and bright-eyed by 2020."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5cc27fe2d5b6e889d333c4931a8d0dc8a0c5247/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=e1f3f0b19bcadb6c6e86060208df8426","title":"georgia senate runoff elections live results","story":"Democrats secure control of the Senate as Jon Ossoff is declared winner of outstanding Georgia raceVoters in the state of Georgia returned to the polls on Tuesday to cast their ballots in two runoff elections that will determine control of the US Senate.

If the Democrats win both races, the president-elect will gain a big opportunity to build a progressive legacy.

Outside the building, they clashed violently with police.In remarks from Wilmington, the president-elect called on Trump to “step up” and “demand an end to this siege”.“It’s not protest, it’s insurrection,” Biden said. “The world is watching.”After initially encouraging his supporters to demonstrate at the Capitol, Trump attempted later to appeal for calm. In a video taped from the White House, Trump, who would not commit to a peaceful transition of power, instructed his followers to “go home”. But he also fueled their grievances by again baselessly claiming the presidential election was “stolen”.In an extraordinary scene unprecedented in modern memory, officers drew their guns on the floor of the House, where just outside an armed protest faced off with Capitol police. Members of Congress were instructed to wear gas masks as they were escorted from the Capitol to their offices nearby. Staffers were advised to stay in place. “If you are in a public space, find a place to hide or seek cover,” an alert from Capitol police to staff said. The DC mayor, Muriel Bowser, imposted a 6pm curfew as national guard troops were deployed to the Capitol.“This is a coup attempt,” said congressman Adam Kinzinger, a Republican of Illinois and a veteran of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.After four years of defending and emboldening Trump, Republicans in Congress were facing their most consequential test of loyalty yet: to indulge the president’s brazen and meritless attempt to overturn the results of an election he definitively lost, or to uphold the democratic process and certify Biden as the next president of the United States.As police and protesters clashed outside, lawmakers had been in the midst of debating an objection, supported by dozens of Republicans, to the certification of Arizona electors, turning what is typically a ceremonial – and largely perfunctory – affair into Trump’s last stand in a reckless, weeks-long effort to reverse his election defeat. When the session is able to resume, the coordinated rebellion is all but destined to fail and Biden will be inaugurated on 20 January.Earlier, in a scathing and emotional denunciation of the Republican effort, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, warned his party against rejecting the will of voters, saying it would “damage our republic forever”.“I’ve served 36 years in the Senate – this will be the most important vote I’ve ever cast,” McConnell said, his voice breaking at times. He insisted that Trump had been given an opportunity to plead his case, and those arguments were rejected.“My colleagues, nothing before us proves illegality anywhere near the massive scale – the massive scale – that would have tipped the entire election,” he said, laying out the choice before them: “Congress will either overrule the voters, the states, and the courts for the first time ever, or honor the people’s decision.”In his increasingly desperate bid to cling to power, Trump, who has not conceded, has spent the last several weeks attempting to enlist allies and pressure public officials to overturn Biden’s 306-232 election win. His machinations escalated this weekend when he pressured the Georgia secretary of state, Republican Brad Raffensperger, to “find” enough votes to reverse Biden’s win in the state.As required by the constitution, the joint session of Congress meets to count the electoral votes. The votes will be delivered to the chamber in mahogany boxes and read aloud in alphabetical order of the states, with Mike Pence presiding over the meeting. At the conclusion of the count, it is the vice-president who finally, formally declares the winner.The rollcall of states began without objection to Alabama’s slate of electoral votes, which went to the president. But when the reached Arizona – a once conservative state that Biden won in 2020 – congressman Paul Gosar rose to object. His challenge was supported by the Texas senator Ted Cruz, triggering the first of several two-hour debates to hear lawmakers’ grievances with the vote. A mix of audible groans and applause filled the chamber.Shortly thereafter, the session was suspended as flag-waving Trump supporters invaded the US Capitol, which has been closed to the public since last March because of the pandemic.Trump has been publicly pressuring Pence, one of the president’s most loyal defenders, to simply reject the vote count, a power the vice-president does not have. Pence reportedly informed the president during a meeting this week that he does not have the power to change the election result. But in a several tweets on Tuesday and Wednesday, Trump continued to cajole his vice-president.“If Vice President Mike_Pence comes through for us, we will win the Presidency,” Trump tweeted overnight.And in a tweet flagged by Twitter on Wednesday, because of Trump’s misinformation wrongly claiming, once again, election fraud, the president added that Pence should send the electoral college vote results back to the states.“Do it Mike, this is a time for extreme courage,” he tweeted.In a lengthy letter to Congress moments before the session convened, Pence said he shared “concerns of millions of Americans about the integrity of the election” but that his role is “largely ceremonial” and precluded him from “claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not”.Based on the president and his closest allies and legal team’s spurious allegations of widespread voter fraud, a handful of Trump loyalists gained support for their revolt from more than 100 members of the House and a quarter of Senate Republicans.In the House, where the effort is led by the Ohio congressman Jim Jordan, a top Trump ally, Republicans said the plan was to voice objections to Biden’s wins in six swing states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.To succeed, an objection must come from both a member of the House and the Senate. Hawley has said he planned to object to the results from Pennsylvania, while Cruz plans to object to the results in Arizona. Both are considered presidential contenders in 2024, seeking to ingratiate themselves with Trump’s fervent base.All 50 states have certified the election results after a number of closely contested states conducted post-election audits and recounts to ensure their accuracy. Courts at every level, including the supreme court, have rejected dozens of lawsuits filed by Trump and his allies to challenge the results."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d2031e41d2f28d66852dadebb383b7c5b6a17c3/0_366_6048_3628/master/6048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bdb629ca4a4b47331d27e043cae499bc","title":"jon ossoff wins georgia runoff election democrats senate","story":" Victory unseats Republican David Perdue, who held the seat for the past six years, and follows fellow Democrat Raphael Warnock’s winThe Georgia Democrat Jon Ossoff has won his Senate runoff election, giving Democrats control of the Senate for the opening of Joe Biden’s presidency.Ossoff’s victory against David Perdue, was called by the Associated Press late on Wednesday, and follows fellow Democrat Raphael Warnock’s victory against incumbent Kelly Loeffler.With the victories of Ossoff and Warnock, the US Senate is now 50-50.Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris will serve as the tie-breaking 51st vote, giving Democrats control of the chamber for the first time since 2015.A pastor who spent the past 15 years leading the Atlanta church where Martin Luther King Jr preached, Warnock’s victory makes him the first Black senator in his state’s history.The results were a stinging rebuke of Donald Trump, who made one of his final trips in office to Georgia to rally his loyal base behind the state’s Republican candidates.In an emotional address early on Wednesday, Warnock vowed to work for all Georgians whether they voted for him or not, citing his personal experience with the American dream. His mother, he said, used to pick “somebody else’s cotton” as a teenager.“The other day, because this is America, the 82-year-old hands that used to pick somebody else’s cotton picked her youngest son to be a United States senator,” he said. “Tonight, we proved with hope, hard work and the people by our side, anything is possible.”The Democrats were propelled to victory in Senate runoff elections by Black voters, young voters and new arrivals to the rapidly ersifying state, a coalition just strong enough to topple a long-dominant GOP and take control of the US Senate.The coalition closely mirrored the one that handed Georgia’s electoral college votes to President-elect Joe Biden, the first Democrat to win the state since 1992. In defeating Republicans Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, Democrats will have half the seats in the chamber, leaving Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris to serve as tie-breaker.The high-stakes runoffs drew hundreds of millions of dollars, media attention and a massive organizing effort. The result was a game of inches – both Republicans and Democrats largely held their voters from November, the survey showed, but Democrats did just slightly better in pushing their voters to the polls."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2e76336a1e8d60865a6abb0bd5035c9cca80c49/0_48_1665_999/master/1665.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=7ca6f401510c41b20c3e59cba845b72c","title":"english schools struggle with demand for key worker places","story":"Parents urged to be honest in requests for children to be allowed to attend classesSchools have pleaded with parents to be “completely honest” about whether they are really key workers after some primaries received requests for hundreds of children to come to class in the latest lockdown.Across England, schools reported struggling to cope with the demand for places in school while also offering remote teaching.One primary headteacher in Greater Manchester said staff had spent all of Wednesday “interrogating” parents after they received 210 applications from key workers, some of whom they discovered were able to work from home.At the start of the first lockdown last March, the school had 30 vulnerable and key worker pupils in attendance, out of a school population of 500.Some schools have decided to ignore government advice, which says children qualify if just one parent is a “critical worker”. They have been asking two-parent households to prove they are both doing essential jobs which they cannot do at home.The Association of School and College Leaders union (ASCL) urged the government to reconsider the eligibility rules, suggesting children should only be offered a place if both parents are key workers.The problem has been exacerbated by the government’s broad definition of critical workers, including university staff and anyone who can claim to be “essential” to the provision of food and other key goods.Universities in London and Manchester have written to staff to advise that their children could be eligible for school places, despite staying at home during the first lockdown.“You’d be hard-pressed to find any job that can’t be fitted into most of the categories,” complained the Greater Manchester head.She said parents were going to great lengths to not have their children at home, with some even making up fake companies to make their case. The deceit did not work, she said, because “other parents found out and rang up to tell us about it”.She said she understood how difficult it was for parents – “I’m a teacher and I don’t want to home-school my kids, but at the minute I have to put the virus first.”At Our Lady of Lourdes primary school in Bury, Greater Manchester, the headteacher wrote to parents asking them to reconsider.She continued: “I would ask for your complete honesty when applying for a critical worker place. If you are working from home or have another adult in the household who is not a critical worker, I would expect your child to access remote learning from home.”If numbers exceeded that, schools were advised to contact their local authorities who would help distribute children across schools to keep numbers down. There is no similar cap now.“At the moment, heads are completely in the dark, not knowing whether they can or should be saying to parents – ‘I’m sorry, we are full.’“They don’t know what ‘full’ means. If the whole point is to reduce community transmission, if we are ending up with half of children coming into school, it seems unlikely that will be achieved.”Garry Bridges, the executive member for children and schools at Manchester city council, said local schools were experiencing extreme demand for places.“In Manchester, we have very high numbers of children in the vulnerable categories as well as high numbers of those who meet the government criteria of critical or key workers,” he said.“Those vulnerable groups of children are some of the most vulnerable children in the country and schools are obviously keen to make sure they have a place offered.”Bridges added: “Instead of properly planning for a period of closure, the government plunged schools into closure overnight leaving many questions unanswered. It is now schools, staff, parents and children who are dealing with the consequences.”A DfE spokesperson was clear that the guidance remained that children with at least one parent or carer who is a critical worker can go to school or college, including parents working from home.They said: “The published guidance on critical worker and vulnerable children is clear about who can still attend school and we expect schools to work with parents to ensure all these children are given access to a place if required.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0652833880a2860b241ed4a5810b415f47305b54/0_85_4377_2627/master/4377.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=7af9f7d3637f9af5165de202cb09e305","title":"key workers in the uk share your experiences of the second wave of coronavirus","story":"We’d like to hear from key workers such as refuse collectors and bus drivers about their experience of the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic in the UKThe number of new cases of coronavirus in the UK topped 60,000 for the first time since the start of the pandemic on Tuesday, with 1 in 50 people in England infected with the virus last week.With the UK still firmly in the throes of the second wave of coronavirus, we’d like to hear from key workers such as refuse collectors, bus drivers and postal workers, about their experience during the current peak.You can get in touch by filling in the form below, anonymously if you wish or via WhatsApp by clicking here or adding the contact +44(0)7867825056.

Still not fully recovered, he talks about what he’s learned from surviving Covid-19Nine months ago Tony Lloyd, the Labour MP for Rochdale, was in a coma in hospital, his lungs so ravaged by Covid-19 that he had been put on life support.For 10 days, a ventilator breathed for him as doctors from Manchester Royal Infirmary struggled to save him from a disease they were only just learning how to treat. After 25 days in hospital, Lloyd was discharged, 12kg (nearly 2 stone) lighter and too weak to walk 50 metres to a waiting car without the arm of a nurse.A few days later, he gave an interview to the , his voice so weakened from the breathing tube that he was sometimes hard to hear. He insisted the experience had not changed him, but simply sharpened his core belief that “our society is disordered. If this pandemic doesn’t make us rethink what kind of world we want to live in then I’m not sure what will.”Talking then, at the end of April, he said he did not know why Covid had hit him so hard. But in June, when he was still in recovery, came a clue when he was diagnosed with a rare form of blood cancer. Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia is a type of slow-growing, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. It causes the body to produce too many abnormal white blood cells that crowd out healthy red blood cells, and could well have affected their ability to get enough oxygen to his organs.Every three weeks for the past five months, Lloyd has been having chemotherapy in hospital, completing his last treatment a few days before Christmas. Yet reflecting on the year he has had, the 70-year-old insists he was one of the lucky ones. Greater Manchester colleagues – such as Andrew Gwynne, the Labour MP for Denton and Reddish, and Jo Platt, the former Labour MP for Leigh – also caught Covid-19 at the start of the first wave and neither are back to full health, complaining of “brain fog” and exhaustion.The government’s joint committee on vaccination and immunisation has published a list of groups of people who will be prioritised to receive a vaccine for Covid-19 in the UK. The list is:1 All those 80 years of age and over and health and social care workers.2 All those 75 and over.3 All those 70 and over.4 All those 65 and over.5 Adults under 65 at high at risk of serious disease and mortality from Covid-19.6 Adults under 65 at moderate risk of at risk of serious disease and mortality from Covid-19.7 All those 60 and over.8 All those 55 and over.9 All those 50 and over.10 Rest of the population.“It seems there is no particular correlation between people like me who had really intense Covid, the intubation and all those things, and long Covid,” he said. “I’ve been lucky for whatever reason.”For the past six months Lloyd has been strong enough to go for walks for half an hour or an hour each day and he pedals on an exercise bike at his home in Manchester. He was shocked by how much his muscles had wasted after his hospital spell. “Once I was conscious, the worst thing was the realisation of how frail I was. I’ve never been Mr Universe or anything, but I’d always been reasonably physically active and suddenly I couldn’t walk unassisted for even a few steps.”There were dark thoughts, he said: “The fear was: is this it now? Is this life as it’s going to be? But of course, actually, the good thing about the human body and maybe the human mind is that you do rebuild.”At his last check-up, about three months ago, doctors said Lloyd’s lung capacity did appear to have been damaged, but he insists he feels essentially fine. He’s not yet back to his pre-Covid weight but is happy to be slightly slimmer than before. He used to be a regular runner but has kept to walking pace after feeling his lungs might burst the one time he did break into a jog.After being discharged, his doctor told him he was probably, but not definitely, immune and advised caution. So although he has been back working as an MP since the summer he has largely been in self-isolation. He has not ventured back into parliament, instead asking questions via Zoom and voting by proxy. He is cross with Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the House of Commons, for insisting only MPs physically in the Commons are able to take part in debates.He insists he had never considered resigning and putting his health first, after spending the best part of 40 years as a politician. “But I did wonder, in the early days, whether I was capable of doing the job simply because I was very tired. And the ability to concentrate was much smaller.”He is frustrated by what he sees as the “brutal incompetence” of Boris Johnson, who was hospitalised with Covid at the same time. Despite knowing firsthand how vicious the virus can be, he says he understands the need to balance the health of the economy with the health of the nation. “At the end of all this, we’ve got to have an economy in Rochdale. You can’t be dismissive of that.”There is nothing like nearly dying to be reminded you’re not immortal, said Lloyd. “I can’t wait to get on a plane somewhere and I want to see my grandchildren grow up. I’ve got two – one is nearly three and the other was only born in June, and I’ve only seen her twice, at a distance. I’ve never even held her.“There’s this recognition that you only have a certain time left … I’m 70 and as such you think, well, I’m probably not going to be around in x years’ time, so use these years wisely. Use these days wisely. That’s probably good advice for us all.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de1e24d2eb04040e8b65fec7398ec66829263e6b/1378_996_5835_3501/master/5835.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01e5ecacad0e0083b08f008df415034e","title":"england prepares for a wintry third lockdown in pictures","story":"Empty streets and shuttered shops as England grits its teeth for a new lockdown, with people allowed to leave their homes for limited reasons only, and measures expected to stay until mid-February or even March"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a45291b4bd69740dd6ac8a6934234e70c5b49a3/0_305_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=486e305a612aa17fd83c81204a7d3848","title":"coronavirus live news who chief very disappointed after china blocks wuhan visit 1 in 50 infected in uk","story":"Ireland registers 7,836 new cases as it shuts down schools and construction work Moderna is second vaccine to get EU approvalWe’ve launched a new blog at the link below – head there for the latest: Here is a quick recap of recent events from the UK and around the world: France is unlikely to avoid the new and more contagious “UK variant” of the coronavirus, and may have to consider more restrictions on people’s movements next week, the government’s chief scientific advisor on the epidemic said on Wednesday.Jean-François Delfraissy said France already had about 22 confirmed cases of the UK variant, Reuters reports.He added that the country needed to be worried about this new variant, even if it is not yet circulating in the country in a major way.“We must do what we can to stop it, but I think we cannot avoid it. We need to slow it down as vaccinate in the mean time,” he said. England and Wales recorded the most deaths in 2020 of any year in more than a century, with the pandemic leading to a rise in the number of excess deaths, a senior statistician has revealed in a sobering analysis.He said only one year since 1900 had seen annual deaths top 600,000, which was 1918, when the Spanish flu pandemic struck.Tunisia recorded 2,820 new confirmed coronavirus cases, the health ministry said on Wednesday, a record since the start of the pandemic last year.Seventy more deaths were reported, taking the death toll to more than 5,000, the ministry added, while the total number of cases has jumped to around 150,000.Tunisia banned travel between the country’s regions, and extended a curfew in October, as it tried to stem a tide of surging Covid cases threatening to exceed hospital capacity.Crystal Palace captain Luka Milivojevic has apologised for an apparent breach of Covid-19 guidelines on New Year’s Eve.Palace manager Roy Hodgson was among those who condemned the Serbian mildfieder’s actions, after social media pictures surfaced of him at a gathering with at least seven other people. At the time, London was under strict tier four Covid-19 restrictions, in which households could not mix.“I want to publicly apologise for my actions on New Year’s Eve,” Milivojevic, 29, said on Wednesday.As captain of Crystal Palace Football Club, I am fully aware that my responsibilities go beyond football, and that in this instance I have let the fans, the club, my manager and team-mates down. In what is a really difficult and challenging moment for everyone, I am truly grateful that I am able to continue to do the job I love and I do not take this for granted. I am very sorry to anyone who has been made to feel angry, hurt or upset by my actions. I am making a donation to the local NHS service to help them continue their incredible work in our community fighting this virus. Arizona has become the Covid “hot spot of the world”, public health experts have warned five months after president Donald Trump held up the US state’s pandemic response as exemplary.“It’s way worse than July already, and it’s going to continue to get worse. We’re probably two weeks behind LA in terms of our situation,” Will Humble, head of the Arizona Public Health Association, said referring to Los Angeles County, where a coronavirus surge has created a shortage of oxygen.The situation has led ambulance crews to stop transporting patients they can’t revive in the field, with one out of every 119 people in the state testing positive in the past week.Arizona, which now has the worst coronavirus diagnosis rate in the country, has seen a triple-digit number of new virus-related deaths for the second day in a row and more than 7,200 daily cases, according to health officials.As hospitals increasingly face being overwhelmed, pressure is mounting for the introduction of more forceful control measures such as mandatory statewide masks.But Humble said he doubts Republican Gov. Doug Ducey- who has rejected calls for tighter curbs by claiming they would risk jobs- will change anything. Under current rules, indoor dining is allowed and gyms are open at limited capacity. Ducey has dismissed a proposal to have all public schools switch to virtual learning for two weeks after the holidays.

His counterpart in South Carolina, meanwhile, says hospitals and health care workers have until 15 January to get a shot or move to the back of the line. Elsewhere, California’s governor wants to use dentists to dispense shots, amid mounting frustration over the sluggish distribution of the vaccine.An NHS hospital doctor has criticised the government’s decision not to bring in a lockdown before Christmas, as she told of “unimaginable” hospital conditions.Speaking on the BBC’s Question Time programme, Dr Rachel Clarke said: We have ambulances queuing up outside - patients we can’t get them out of the ambulances into hospitals because every single bed in intensive care, in the wards, in A\u0026ampE is full. Tonight I had messages from a doctor in London to tell me that police cars are delivering critically-ill Covid patients into his hospital in London because there are no ambulances. That is how bad things are.She added that ministers should not have “ignored” the advice from Sage when they suggested as early as September a “circuit breaker” was required to prevent an explosion of Covid cases.Members of the public breaking Covid rules should first be encouraged to comply with the law, new guidance from the College of Policing and National Police Chief’s Council suggests. “Enforcement can follow without repeated attempts to encourage people to comply with the law,” it says.There are fines of £10,000 for organisers of restricted gatherings.More Americans were hospitalised with Covid-19 on Wednesday than at any time since the pandemic began, as total coronavirus infections crossed the 21 million mark.US coronavirus hospitalisations reached a record 130,834 late on Tuesday, according to a Reuters tally of public health data, while 3,684 reported fatalities was the second-highest single-day death toll of the pandemic.That grim toll meant that on Tuesday someone died from the virus every 24 seconds in the country.Hi everyone.

Photograph: iStockTowards the end of 2020, the double-edged sword of Covid-19 and Brexit pierced the armour of both An Post and the Royal Mail. They saw unprecedented levels of demand and a lack of clarity on changes from what was then a still uncertain trade deal between the EU and UK.On December 31st, in that confused climate, I ordered some items from a retailer in England at a cost of £86.50 (€96). At the time of ordering, Royal Mail had suspended postal orders to Europe due to the uncertainty of any changes Brexit might bring so the only option available was a £15 courier. I went with it.On the morning of Tuesday, January 5th, a courier service sent me an email to say it was delivering my items. The email said import dutytax payment of €38 was due. There was €25.50 in VAT and another €14.50 for an “advanced paymenthandling charge”. When I asked the courier company to explain the latter charge more clearly, they did not get back to me. “We’ve had more questions in the early part of January than we have had in December which we hadn’t anticipated.”Davies believes there is a lack of education for customers regarding payments, particularly when it comes to the unfamiliar terms of Delivered Duty Paid (DDP) and Delivered At Place (DAP). With DDP, the buyer is responsible for just the unloading of goods while the seller takes responsibility for customs clearance, duties, taxes and everything else relating to the order. DAP, however, sees the buyer taking responsibility for customs, duties, taxes as well as unloading. “In hindsight, I recognise my mistake was not to identify those terms and start educating customers about them,” Davies says.While these new terms may not be familiar to the public, he says the consequences of the UK’s departure from the EU are more practical than financial for the Liverpool-based business.“Money always finds a way through. In the end, after a lot of worry about Brexit, I don’t think there’s been any negative impact. It’s not really a political or even economic situation, it’s more logistics.”That’s the view of one business in one part of England and that view will undoubtedly contrast with others in different parts of the UK. What is most striking, however, is the simple lack of certainty even after four years of headlines and bulletins dominated by the result of the 2016 Brexit referendum. When shopping online from a UK business, it would pay for Irish consumers to contact the business before check-out to see if it operates as DAP or DDP and if it is VAT registered in the State.It can only be hoped that things will become a little more straightforward sooner rather than later. For now, I’ll be sticking to my new year’s resolution of buying Irish unless there is absolutely no other option.Then there was Abdullahi. “Before Brexit, online shopping was very easy and deliveries arrive fast. Now I ordered a book three days ago and it says that it’s going to be delivered between the 18th and 20th of January. I also tried to order a stethoscope online and it said it cannot be delivered due to Brexit. It is very tough now.”PJ writes: “My wife bought a coat from ie.burberry on sale. There was no mention of taxes or custom charges. The charges were as follows – €100 taxes, approx €50 in custom duties, and €18 other for a €400 jacket. Refused to pay so UPS won’t release.” Ciarra ordered Charlotte Tilbury make-up on December 27 at a cost of €105. “I got a message from DHL this morning to say my package was on the way. Then I got a follow-up email to say that I had to pay €41.80, broken down, that was €14.50 advance payment?! And €27.30 VAT at import. The email said if I didn’t pay it, I wouldn’t get my package. I’m afraid to pay as I don’t know is it a scam or where they got their figures from, still no sign of the package, although it was due to be delivered today!”"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Company delivered 14m parcels in December, double the level of same period in 2019About 335,600 people will receive the benefit this weekThe first test is for governments to stop subsidising fossil fuel industry which knowingly contributed to global over-heating"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4451808.1609972174!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"covid 19 list of exemptions from construction industry shut down announced","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tConstruction workers on site in Dublin City Centre. Only Ireland, Italy, and the United States shut down construction during earlier lockdowns, according to the Construction Industry Federation. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsAll but essential construction work will shut down from Friday evening as part of the national effort to stop the spread of coronavirus.Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Darragh O’Brien, said the shutdown was “necessary” as part of wider measures aimed at halting the current trajectory of the virus.Some 7,836 new cases of Covid-19 were reported on Wednesday, the highest daily total since the start of the pandemic.A very limited number of essential sites and a small number of designated social housing projects due to be completed within eight weeks will be allowed to continue. The Cabinet also agreed that construction and work relating to the day-to-day operation of water, wastewater, and gas infrastructure remain essential.Outbreaks relating to the industry represent 0.6 per cent of all coronavirus clusters since August.A spokeswoman for Mr O’Brien said around 1,400 social housing units would be completed by the end of next month but the restrictions would “of course” have a negative impact on social housing targets.Under the new restrictions announced on Wednesday, construction will be closed with effect from 6pm on Friday next January 8th except for the construction or development of:- essential health and related projects including those relevant to preventing, limiting, minimising or slowing the spread of Covid-19- A limited number of social housing projects, including voids, designated as essential sites by local authorities based on set criteria (projects due to be completed in the next six to eight weeks)- housing adaptation grants where the homeowner is agreeable to adaptions being undertaken in their home- repair, maintenance and construction of critical transport and utility infrastructure- education facilities sites designated as essential by Department of Education- supply and delivery of essential or emergency maintenance and repair services to businesses and places of residence (including electrical, gas, plumbing, glazing and roofing services) on an emergency call-out basis- certain large construction projects in the exportingFDI sector based on set criteria.In relation to private homes that are practically complete and scheduled for habitation by 31 January 2021, including where snagging, and essential remediation work, such as pyrite works is nearing completion, works should continue to enable homeowners access their homes.Heating, water, broadband and electricity installation should also continue to enable homes be occupied.Existing tenancy protections mean that a tenant cannot be evicted from their home during the period of the 5km travel restrictions.The Minister acknowledged that closing most construction sites will have an impact on 2021 housing delivery targets, but he said his department will do “whatever is necessary to make up as much ground as possible as restrictions ease”.He said the health and safety of 200,000 people working directly and indirectly in construction is the top priority.Only Ireland, Italy, and the United States shut down construction during earlier lockdowns, according to the Construction Industry Federation. Tom Parlon, its director general, said it will take months to calculate the impact the decision to shut down work sites will have on the industry.“The previous lockdown may have resulted in 5,000 fewer homes than expected in 2020,” he said in a statement.Mr Parlon said the industry has had an “excellent track record” at keeping Covid-19 off sites and managing it on sites. He said there was never a point over the last nine months where a site recorded more than 56 cases. The rate of infection among construction workers has been considerably lower than in the general population, he added.The organisation is advocating for the sector to reopen on January 31st.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4451459.1609971952!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"oireachtas comittee chair calls for rt%C3%A9 to remove blasphemous sketch from player","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIn a tweet Aengus Mac Grianna said he wished to apologise for the sketch. “Truly I am deeply sorry for the offence, distress and hurt caused.

I implore the RTÉ Editorial Standards Board who are due to make recommendations this Friday after reviewing the broadcast to remove the offending clip immediately,” she said.RTÉ’s Editorial Standards Board is currently reviewing the broadcast with regard to compliance with its journalism and content guidelines along with RTÉ’s statutory and regulatory obligations under the Broadcasting Act 2009 and the relevant codes of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.RTÉ said recommendations by the board are expected by this Friday.In a tweet Mr Mac Grianna said he wished to apologise about the sketch. “Truly I am deeply sorry for the offence, distress and hurt caused.

But passengers must provide a negative PCR test from the previous 72 hours and isolate for 14 days on arrival. This requirement will then be rolled out to all incoming passengers.Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan said failure to provide a negaative test be subject to a fine of up to €2,500 or six months imprisonment.He said the Cabinet has agreed provisionally to apply these restrictions to other red list countries He said this will be very difficult for the travel industry and for iniduals who may have plans for travelThe Cabinet also agreed that click and collect services for non-essential retail outlets will no longer be permitted with immediate effect in what will be a big blow for the sector. Click and deliver will continue to be permitted.Getting worseThe meeting came against a backdrop of a significant rise in cases of the disease and with hospitals generally and intensive care units coming under pressure.Mr Martin urged people to remember Mariter Tarugo, the Philippines native who worked at a healthcare assistant at St Vincent’s Hospital and died with Covid-19 on Christmas Eve.Tánaiste Leo Vardkar said “This is bad, it’s getting worse, and we’re only beginning to see the impact on our hospitals”He said the Government was engaging with the banks to ensure payment breaks for mortgage holders and those with loans“January is the month in which we all stay in,” he said.Mr Martin said he was “very worried” about the spread of the UK variant of Covid in the State. “The variant is of huge concern to me, because of the potential of what it could do,” the Taoiseach said, adding that there would be extensive work to improve Ireland’s sequencing capacities and provide real time data on the spread of the variant in the weeks ahead.Mr Martin said the vaccine taskforce was significantly more confident on the supply of Pfizer-BioNtech’s vaccine in the coming months, which would mean a smaller “buffer” would be held in reserve. However, he said there was no clear timeline for the delivery of more than 800,000 doses of the Moderna vaccine approved on Wednesday to the State.“The numbers will be a help on top of Pfizer BioNtech,” he said, “but they’re not huge numbers, and we don’t have a clear timeline in terms of the release to us.” He said, however, that the “only issue holding back the vaccine programme will be the supply of vaccines into the country”.Mr Varadkar said that by the end of February, he anticipated the State being able to vaccinate all residents and nursing home staff, as well as healthcare workers on the frontline. If more vaccines come on stream, he said the timeline could speed up.“That’s with Pfizer and Moderna, if AstraZeneca comes in and becomes available we can step that up and step that up more,” he said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4451660.1609955160!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"covid restrictions q a what are the latest changes","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAll schools will close for three weeks from Monday. File photograph: PA Q: We are at Level 5. Why is there a need for more restrictions?A: The dramatic escalation of the outbreak has forced the Government to take further drastic action in an attempt to curb the spread of the virus. With daily numbers rising from the low hundreds in early December to thousands in early January and peaking at 6,000 on Sunday – and with hospital admissions increasing alarmingly – something needed to be done.Q: So what are the main changes?A: The closure of schools for the month of January is the biggest change. Even when most other activity was being shut down in the face of rising numbers, the Government was determined to keep schools open. Last week it delayed reopening schools by three days until next Monday, January 11th. But at the Cabinet meeting Ministers accepted that the new data made the case for schools closure inarguable. Taoiseach Micheál Martin accepted it was a reluctant decision because “education is the great equaliser”. But he said keeping education open involved “one million people on the move” daily.So all schools will close for three weeks from Monday with a review at the end of January. There are exceptions. Leaving Certificate students will be allowed to attend school for three days a week, with remote learning on the other two days. In addition, there will be arrangements put in place to allow children with special needs attend classes.For all other primary and secondary students, the month of January will involve home schooling and remote learning.Q: Will the Leaving Certificate be cancelled?A: The answer to that at this moment in time is no. The fact that Leaving Certificate students are being allowed to attend school for three days a week signals an intention by Government that it wants the exams to proceed this year. This puts the State policy at variance with that in Northern Ireland where its Minister of Education Peter Weir announced earlier on Wednesday that neither A-level exams (equivalent to Leaving Certificate) nor GCSE exams (equivalent to Junior Certificate) will take place this year. The Republic’s Minister for Education Norma Foley said she is confident the Junior Certificate can go ahead.Q: And what about the other sectors?A: The other big sector which has continued through most of the pandemic since last March is construction. However, all but a small section of the industry will shut down at 6pm on Friday with the situation to be reviewed at the end of the month. The exception is that deemed essential – these projects include social housing developments, schools and the National Children’s Hospital.Q: Has non-essential retail also been hit?A: Unfortunately yes. And this will affect smaller retailers who do not have the capacity to operate online delivery services. The click and collect service provided a big boon to many retailers during the restrictions that were in place in the run-up to Christmas. But the rationale behind the new restrictions is to reduce movement and travel by as much as possible. Invariably, people were driving to retail centres and town centres to collect their purchases. The Government is trying to minimise such movements.Q: Is the travel ban from the UK and South Africa being lifted?A: Yes it is. The two highly transmissible new variants have been identified in the UK and in South Africa and many countries have implemented travel bans. An outright ban, said Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan, has not been encouraged by the European Union. Instead, from Saturday the ban will be lifted but it will be replaced by a new regime.Anyone travelling to Ireland from Britain (but not Northern Ireland) will be required to produce a PCR test (used to detect the presence of an antigen) showing they are clear from Covid (taken not more than 72 hours before arriving). There will be stringent penalties for failure to provide evidence of a test (with fines of €2,500 or six months imprisonments for failure to comply).Q: Will childcare continue?A: Only on a limited basis for children of workers who are deemed as essential. It will also be available to vulnerable children. A new category of bubble has been created to assist families in these categories with young children. A household of an essential worker which has no existing childcare arrangements can form a bubble with another household for the purpose of providing childcare.Q: So what supports will be available?A: The Government decided at the Cabinet meeting to extend all the schemes to the end of March (Pandemic Unemployment Payment, Employment Wage Support Scheme and supports to businesses that are closed). Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said that a €2 billion contingency fund in the budget will now be used to administer those payments.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics covid 19 was this inevitable","story":"In our first podcast of the year, Hugh talks to The  health and political editors, Paul Cullen and Pat Leahy, and political analyst and statistician Kevin Cunningham about the social and political ramifications of the recent dramatic rise in Covid-19 cases.

Photograph Nick Bradshaw  The Any notion that new Covid-19 vaccines are being rolled out across the world too quickly, and without sufficient evaluation of their safety does not stand up to scrutiny, according to immunologist Prof Luke O’Neill.Speaking at online BT Young Scientist \u0026amp Technology Exhibition forum on the science of vaccine development, he acknowledged “the speed question” was cropping up.There was a lot of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines being left on the shelf in the US, he pointed out, and the answer coming back from some people not taking it was that it was all happening “too quick”. Prof O’Neill, who is based at Trinity College, rejected any suggestion they were being approved too hastily. The pharmaceutical sector had the highest standards of regulation and validation prior to approval, which were on a par with those of the aviation sector, he noted at the event in which some of Ireland’s leading specialists on vaccines participated.Dr Sarah Hudson of the University of Limerick, who specialises in drug delivery, highlighted the extensive research gone into mRNA vaccines over many years, though the vaccines using this technology developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna were new.It was all about packaging the vaccines correctly in the biological sense and a lot of design strategy had gone into their delivery systems. Developing new Covid-19 vaccines would have been a lot slower if normal development routes were taken, she added.There was much more sharing of research “because the need is great” in the current pandemic. In the past, vaccines were developed in line with securing incremental funding, which inevitably led to delays, said UCC immunologist Dr Anne Moore. With Covid-19 that approach was wiped out because of the urgent need for effective vaccines and there was “an opportunity to do things in parallel”. The lesson from all of this was the need for science to be continuously funded, she believed.Ireland was fortunate to be part of the European Medicines Agency, which did not bend to political pressure on approvals, said Prof Abina Crean of UCC school of pharmacy. “There was no short cuts with this in the face of pressure to get it out there faster.”She underlined the critical need for vaccines with easy storage options. This had to be put in the context of the developing world, “where even a fridge is a potential issue and that last kilometre” before a vaccine is administered.The potential from combining proteins with vaccines and then freeze-drying them was emerging, she confirmed, though new forms of injectables such as self-administered patches or microneedles were some time away.Prof Crean said she expected that Pfizer was testing the possibility of freeze-drying their vaccine – currently it has to be stored at minus 70 degrees. “I would say there is a high chance of success on this.” On the issue of severe allergic reactions to the vaccine, Prof O’Neill said it had arisen in a very small number of cases due to known allergens the additive polyethylene glycol and egg which were often used in delivery systems.Those affected were already carrying EpiPens because of having “a slightly more active immune system”. “The cases were easy to treat, but it’s something to keep an eye on,” he said.As for advice for pregnant women, Dr Moore said they were not included in clinical trials because of “a theoretical risk”, though some women in the Pfizer trial became pregnant soon after getting the vaccine.Studies were due to be submitted to regulators on this issue in coming weeks, she said, adding that she “would be shocked if there’s any risk”. The best advice in the meantime was to “wait a few weeks after vaccination if you want to become pregnant”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4451347.1609969217!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"democrats gain control of us senate after winning two seats in georgia","story":"The Democrats are within touching distance of gaining control of the US Senate after Raphael Warnock won his runoff election in Georgia against Republican senator Kelly Loeffler.

Photograph: Erin SchaffNew York TimesDemocrats have won both senate seats for Georgia giving them control of the chamber and the power to advance US president-elect Joe Biden’s policy goals.Raphael Warnock, a Baptist preacher from the historic church of Martin Luther King jnr, beat Republican incumbent Kelly Loeffler to become the first black senator in the history of the deep South state. Jon Ossoff, a documentary filmmaker who at 33 will become the Senate’s youngest member, also declared victory with a narrow lead over incumbent David Perdue. The results would give Democrats narrow control of both chambers of Congress, making it easier to appoint liberal-leaning judges and advance legislative priorities from coronavirus relief to climate change when Mr Biden takes office on January 20th. “Georgia’s voters delivered a resounding message yesterday: they want action on the crises we face and they want it right now,” Mr Biden said in a statement. He said he would work with both parties to confirm key administration officials quickly. That would amount to a final defeat for outgoing president Donald Trump, who stands to be the first US president since 1932 to lose the White House and both chambers of Congress in a single term. With 98 per cent of the vote counted, Mr Warnock led Ms Loeffler by 1.2 percentage points, roughly 54,600 votes, according to Edison Research. Ossoff led Perdue by more than 17,000 votes, just shy of a 0.5 percent threshold to avoid a recount. Most outstanding votes were from Democratic-leaning areas. Winning both contests would hand Democrats narrow control of the Senate by creating a 50-50 split and giving Vice President-elect Kamala Harris the tie-breaking vote from January 20th.  Georgia has found itself in the firing line since that election, with Donald Trump disputing the results of the presidential election in the state which was narrowly won by Joe Biden. On Saturday, the president pressured Georgia’s secretary of state and officials to “find” extra votes to swing November’s election in his favour. On Tuesday, those same election officials oversaw the Senate run-off races which were conducted smoothly. Tuesday night’s tight races also cement Georgia’s status as a swing-state. Traditionally Republican-leaning, the state has witnessed an influx of new residents in recent years, while local officials like gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams have successfully increased voter registration among the state’s African-American population.

A ided electorate allows for neither.’As ever, Tom Wolfe got there first. Readers had expected the author of The Bonfire of the Vanities to “do” Los Angeles or Chicago after his treatment of 1980s New York. Instead, the place that drew his fine eye for trends was Atlanta. A Man in Full considered the city, and the state that it anchors, as America’s potential future. Some 23 years on, Georgia continues to grow in population as several other states shrink. Once uncompetitively Republican, it is now the nation’s political schism in miniature.Nowhere was closer-fought in the US presidential election two months ago. If the Democrats take both of its Senate seats, to go with Joe Biden’s win there, imagine the symbolism. Here is a party going with the grain of the nation’s evolution.But not, it is worth saying, a party with a suddenly free hand. A split Senate, with the vice-president casting decisive votes, does not assure Biden a radical presidency. His chances of that waned when the “blue wave” of congressional gains failed to materialise in November. His subsequent nominations to the executive – their mildness, their familiarity – admit as much. His flirtations with the left are just a few months old but feel a century ago. His first problem is that a Senate majority is only as good as its internal cohesion. Conservative Democrats are not the force they were but, in a tight vote, it takes just a few to scuttle progressive dreams. West Virginia’s Joe Manchin is one who has to mind his red-state electors. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, Georgia-like in its competitiveness, has no more incentive to rile swing- or right-leaning voters.Any defections on his own side would leave Biden exposed to Republican intransigence. What hope there was of a more co-operative party post-November is embarrassing to recall now. In its bogusness and tenacity, Donald Trump’s quest to overturn his election defeat somehow intensifies by the week. Nothing in his presidency became him less than the leaving of it.But leave it he will. It is the conduct of the Republicans who remain in Washington that promises an ordeal for Biden. A dozen or so senators plan to contest the certification of the election result. That is more than a fifth of the Republicans there. Estimates of like-minded colleagues in the lower chamber exceed 100.And this is three years ahead of a presidential nomination race that will only incentivise such pandering to right-wing grassroots. Some of those activists will march against certification on Wednesday. A party that will not grant the president-elect’s legitimacy is not going to consider his legislation on its merits. Clinton and Obama And so the US is on course for a less than revolutionary administration. But then it has known no other for some time. Bill Clinton and Barack Obama were supernaturally gifted politicians. Both lost Congress at their first mid-term elections, and their domestic programmes with it. Clinton did not even have a landmark statute to show for two years of unified government. As for Trump, he secured a tax cut before losing the House of Representatives at the first time of asking – never to recover.Come to think of it, no US administration since the 1980s could be described as transformative, at least on the home front. Presidents still have their executive orders and discretion in foreign affairs. But social change on the Lyndon Johnson-Ronald Reagan scale tends to entail legislation, and lots of it. With the exception of Obamacare, the boldest versions have not survived Washington’s sieve in recent decades.The evidence nudges us to a conclusion that is no less true for its perverseness. The real winners of the age of partisanship are those who hate it most. The winners are the moderates. Radical laws and sharp ruptures from the status quo require either decisive majorities or support from the other side. A ided electorate allows for neither. America’s bifurcation, once it feeds into legislative numbers and conduct, puts paid to grand schemes. Voters in the middle find themselves in the oddest of predicaments: scandalised by the viciousness of politics and yet served by its results.“Moderate”, to be clear, is not a synonym for “good”. This time last year, immoderate measures against the coronavirus pandemic would have saved lives. Splitting the difference on Trump’s attempt to stay in office would be a nonsense. Equidistance from opposing arguments is no guarantor of sound policy. It is with surprise, then, not elation, that we should record this oddity of modern politics. Our era is one of extreme sentiments and loyalties. It is not always one of extreme outcomes. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2021Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons january 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlTo order The 2020 limited-edition Matt Christmas jigsaw, go to telegraphcartoonjigsawsOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Donald Trump tells supporters to go home after Capitol stormed by rioters - latest news\u0026#39The world is watching\u0026#39: World leaders react as Trump supporters storm CongressYouTube and Facebook remove Trump video telling mob to \u0026#39go home\u0026#39 after opposition Everything we know as US Capitol stormed by Donald Trump\u0026#39s supportersExclusive: Nicola Sturgeon facing pressure to postpone Scottish electionDecorated general forced out of Army after lying about relationship with female subordinateComment: Rhetorical fireworks in the Commons fail to shed any light on lockdown exit routeDemocrats to take the Senate as Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock win Georgia run-off\u0026#39This is insurrection\u0026#39: Joe Biden\u0026#39s speech in full as US Capitol is stormedNicola Sturgeon \u0026#39must agree to postpone Holyrood election\u0026#39 if lockdown continues after JanuaryPrince Harry \u0026#39personally affronted\u0026#39 by claim he \u0026#39snubbed\u0026#39 the Marines, court documents revealWashington stormed: How dark day for American democracy unfoldedExclusive: GPs told to \u0026#39stand down\u0026#39 routine care and focus on Covid vaccinationsComment: Covid has again exposed the fragilityWatch: Trump supporters break into US Capitol building after getting pastBrighton and Hove Council becomes first to defy Government over nurseriesCovid vaccine roll-out advanced in Scotland thanks to Union, says Boris JohnsonPolice to question people who are outside during lockdownChildren can be used as undercover spies to report on parents, covert intelligence bill revealsBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"boys born overweight mothers 40pc likely infertile study suggests","story":"Boys who are born to overweight mothers could be 40 per cent more likely to be infertile in adulthood, new research suggests.Dr Arendt said: Maternal overweight could affect the offspring\u0027s reproductive health through several potential mechanisms.Obesity is also associated with low-grade metabolic inflammation, a proposed factor in programming of reproductive fitness early in life.These findings are believed to be the first of their kind to find a link between maternal weight during pregnancy and infertility in their sons or daughters.Dr Arendt added: This study supports the hypothesis that maternal overweight affects reproductive health in male offspring, but further studies are needed.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"brighton hove council becomes first defy government nurseries","story":"Brighton and Hove Council has become the first in the country to defy the Government over nurseries after it told all early years providers under its control to close from Thursday. The council said that the six nurseries under its direct control should shut their doors to all but the children of key workers and the most vulnerable toddlers. The decision has been made to protect staff, families and children and help reduce the spread of coronavirus in the city, the council said. The Government has said that nurseries should remain open to all children during the national lockdown while primary and secondary schools have been told to move to remote learning.But council chiefs at Brighton and Hove said they have taken the decision to close nurseries in response to concerns from their staff about rising infection rates in the city.Cllr Hannah Clare wrote to Vicky Ford, an education minister, saying: “We believe the same data and science that led to a school closure also applies to the early years sector.“Many early years providers in our city that we have spoken to have expressed that they feel a huge responsibility for their staff safety at this time more than ever. They feel it is the right thing for them to close to all but vulnerable children and the children of key workers.”Cllr Clare asked the Government to provide extra funding for nurseries which are closing since it will result in them suffering financially. She said that closing the nurseries is a temporary measure and that they hope to open them again as soon as possible. Meanwhile, the Early Years Alliance (EYA) has said that a number of nurseries across England have taken the decision to partially close amid concerns about coronavirus transmission risks. Several nursery heads have taken the decision to only open their doors to children of key workers or vulnerable children amid safety fears, according to the charity. Early years leaders say there is fear and confusion over how safe the settings are and they have demanded reassurance from the Government on the evidence behind the decision to keep nurseries open.But vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawi has insisted that nurseries present very little risk.Unions have called on the Government to reconsider its decision to keep nurseries and pre-schools open to all children amid concerns over the new Covid-19 strain.Stuart Fegan, national officer at the union GMB, said: There is no scientific evidence to support the continued opening of nurseries. It is purely a political decision, made by ministers who are failing to take their responsibility to staff, families and the wider community seriously enough.They\u0027ve left nursery staff, childminders and nannies worrying for their safety and sown fear and confusion among parents. It\u0027s time for the Government to step in and correct this dangerous mistake by closing all nursery and pre-school provision to all but key workers and vulnerable children, in line with school closures. A Department for Education spokeswoman said: Early years settings remain low risk environments for children and staff and there is no evidence that the new variant of coronavirus disproportionately affects young children.Keeping nurseries and childminders open will support parents and deliver the crucial care and education for our youngest children.Evidence suggests pre-school children are less susceptible to infection and are not playing a driving role in transmission, the DfE added.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid has exposed fragility precious decadent west","story":"Three times over the past 20 years, the West has been caught out by seemingly shock events that should, in fact, have been widely anticipated. There was 911, the financial crisis and now Covid, ordeals that shook us to our core, with political, economic and cultural repercussions that will last for decades. Each time, we have been exposed as spoilt, emotional and weak – utterly unprepared, psychologically and practically, to cope with such seemingly low-probability, high-impact events. When these sorts of “tail risks”, as statisticians call them, do materialise, we are immediately traumatised: panic sets in as our certainties and assumptions are shattered, and our entire way of life, our freedoms, our prosperity, our health, our self-satisfied sense of superiority are exposed as staggeringly fragile. It turns out that modern life is only possible (or, to many, desirable) if nothing goes wrong in any significant way, and yet there tends to be a major emergency every seven or so years – and three since the end of the Cold War. For a civilisation that sees itself as the most advanced, the most rationalistic ever, and that is obsessed with comparing itself with the unenlightened, backward mores of the past, our proximity to the abyss is not just a humiliating but also a terrifying realisation. Even worse, these events are all, in fact, known unknowns: all have happened many times before, and all will happen many times again. We are not talking about genuine unpredictability, real Black Swans. So why didn’t we see them coming? Why didn’t we prepare properly against the menace of evil terrorists, or viruses, or the economic cycle? Take the coronavirus. It is now clear that this latest variant is spiralling out of control, that deaths are shooting up again and that the NHS is in danger of running out of capacity in some areas once more. The prognosis is much grimmer than it was a few weeks ago: the total number of excess deaths in the UK may now end up breaching 100,000. By some calculations, we have already surpassed the death toll of the Hong Kong flu of 1968-69, which killed 80,000, and that of the Asian flu of 1957-58, which claimed 33,000, in both cases without lockdowns.The reality is that we are going to pull through this pandemic, by the skin of our teeth, despite mass deaths and extreme economic and social damage. The astonishingly speedy discovery of effective and safe vaccines – a scientific miracle – has changed everything, and the Government must now vaccinate 247 and reopen society as soon as the vulnerable are inoculated. But we can’t go through this again and again, being caught out every time and relying on luck and hideous, calamitous lockdowns to bail us out. The costs – in terms of lives, of course, but also in this case in foregone liberties as a result of lockdowns, in massive welfarism, ruined education, huge debt, economic torture, cultural damage and in destroyed families, communities and traditions are far too high. We would have suffered much less had we prepared. What will happen if the next pandemic is much more lethal, or if it kills children rather than the elderly? What if a cyberattack takes out communications and electricity in a major Western capital city, and food and water supplies run out? Or when the great quantitative easing experiment finally implodes? At some point, a rogue nation will detonate a nuclear weapon, or assassinate a world leader, Franz Ferdinand style, or there will be a far more significant accident than Fukushima. How could our decadent societies handle any of this? Simply seeking to muddle through, as we did with the virus, would guarantee Armageddon. Our inability to realise that we haven’t opted out of history, despite Twitter, robotics, AI and the rest, is one of our greatest blind spots. Our society is not robust, it isn’t “normal” (in a historic, global sense) and it won’t necessarily be eternal unless we try a lot harder to make it so. Liberalism, conservatism, capitalism: all could easily be swept away when the next really big crisis hits us.Marx was wrong about everything: the real opium of the people in a modern, developed society is simply a belief that the good days will always continue, and that the future is automatically going to be a similar but better version of the present. The public’s support for the status quo ends very quickly if it starts to believe that life is about to get worse.Most of the time, a belief in progress makes sense: rational optimism, to use the great Matt Ridley’s phraseology, is a sensible philosophy based on a sound appreciation of the wonders of capitalism and technology. Contrary to the usual whining, the world has been getting richer and cleaner for years, people are living longer and poverty has collapsed. But the fact that the international capitalist order delivers the goods also needs to be tempered by realism: the system works well overall ordinarily, but it can easily be derailed by shocks such as wars, terrorism or pandemics. These need to be better understood and managed: the role of states isn’t to rule people’s lives, tell them what to eat, spend 45 per cent of GDP or own every hospital. It is simply to prevent the system from collapsing (and, of course, to refrain from collapsing it out of malice or incompetence à la Iran or Russia, or Venezuela-style economics). Yet they keep failing that basic task, and inevitably make matters worse.It is time, therefore, for the West to become a lot more “anti-fragile”, as the philosopher and statistician Nassim Taleb puts it. Governments must focus on the modern-day equivalent of nuclear fallout shelters: we need a whole series of highly developed, well-rehearsed plan Bs with mass public buy-in. A minister for resilience should be appointed. New institutions must be developed. Our foreign policy must become far more robust towards lawless states. We need to spend much more on cybersecurity, pandemic prevention, defence and space technology. I used to be an optimist: no longer. The next big crisis, also due at some point this decade, could easily destroy our precious, fragile and deluded West.

That depends on measures taken to limit its spread.French schools all opened on Monday and the country has a curfew in place but no blanket lockdown like in the UK.Fears of the new variant came as major logistical failings were on Wednesday blamed on France’s slow start to vaccinations. President Emmanuel Macron has come in for intense personal criticism after it transpired that France had only administered a paltry 516 jabs in the first week.Doctors injected 5,000 people on Monday and pledged to catch up with neighbours “within days”.Gérard Larcher, president of the French Senate from the Right-wing opposition party, The Republicans, slammed the government for a “lack of preparedness” and “totally defective logistics”.The government, he said, had “made a choice that is totally ill-suited to the types of vaccines available today” by not opting to vaccinate people en masse in single locations.“There is no response other than collective vaccination due to the conditions for conserving” the PfizerBioNTech vaccine, which must be kept at minus 70 degrees Celsius.The government initially ruled out large-scale vaccinations in single locations.Mr Larcher called for a “a logistician” to be put in charge of rolling out the vaccine and for red tape to be slashed.The criticism came as the French government confirmed reports that it had commissioned in December private consultancy McKinsey to help it with its “vaccine strategy”.It said the government had the last word but opposition politicians called the move “alarming”.France registered around 20,500 new cases on Tuesday compared to 61,000 in the UK and posted an R number of 0.91 compared to 1.1 to 1.3 in the UK.The country posted 7,583 new hospital admissions over the past week compared to 17,175 admissions in a week in the UK.The death toll in France on Tuesday since the pandemic struck was 66,282 compared to 76,305 in the UK.Only 40 per cent of French say they are currently willing to be vaccinated compared to almost 80 per cent in the UK, the latest polls suggest.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"georgia senate vote winner republican democrat joe biden","story":"Trump tells supporters: \u0027we love you, but go home\u0027Unclear if Houses return today to certify vote after Capitol stormedVP Mike Pence defies Trump in refusing to contest vote resultsDemocrats take control of Senate after Warnock and Ossoff winsAnalysis: Angry hordes storming the US Capitol reflect Trump\u0027s desire for power at all costs Subscribe to The  for a month-long free trial​Donald Trump has told his supporters: we love you, but go home, after hundreds of rioters stormed the US Capitol earlier and a woman was shot and killed.Mr Trump ordered the National Guard to the US Capitol to quell the protests, which spiralled into violence on Wednesday afternoon as Houses of Congress and Representatives met to certify Joe Biden\u0027s win.But moments later, the president doubled down on his false claims of election fraud, saying the vote has been unceremoniously \u0026amp viciously stripped away from great patriots.George Bush, the former Republican president, attacked Mr Trump\u0027s falsehoods and said the scenes in Washington were reminiscent of a banana republic.In pictures: Donald Trump supporters storm the U.S. Capitol BuildingFollow the latest updates below.In incredible scenes, Trump supporters attacked police and fought their way to the Capitol building.Mike Pompeo, the US Secretary of State, has tweeted, calling the actions of the protesters unacceptable.Former US president George Bush has condemned the sickening and heartbreaking sight at the US Capitol and said he is appalled by the reckless behavior of some political leaders since the election.In a statement, Mr Bush appeared to attacked Donald Trump and the Republicans for the the lack of respect shown today for our institutions, our traditions, and our law enforcement and accused them of spreading falsehoods.He added: This is how election results are disputed in a banana republic.Even as the Capitol is being assaulted , Donald Trump is continuing to tweet false claims that the election has been stolen.In his latest tweet, he claims that the vote has been unceremoniously \u0026amp viciously stripped away from great patriots:There are growing calls for Facebook and Twitter to remove the president\u0027s incendiary posts, or delete his accounts entirely.Read more: Calls for Twitter and Facebook to mute Donald Trump as violence breaks outNBC and Sky News quoting officials as saying the woman shot earlier inside the US Capitol building, who appeared in videos to be a Trump supporter, has died of her injuries.

He said simply telling he voters go jump in a lake would jeopardise the legitimacy of this and subsequent elections.Mr Cruz said: I am not arguing for setting aside the result of the election. Instead, he wanted Congress to appoint an impartial electoral commission to hold an emergency 10-day audit and resolve the claims.Mr Cruz said he was basing his request in what happened after the 1876 election.Several Members of Congress are tweeting that the violent protests on the Capitol have forced them to evacuate their offices or seek shelter.Police are reportedly now arrested a number of the protesters. Mitch McConnell, Senate Majority Leader, is speaking now, saying in his 36 years in the Senate, this is the important vote he has cast. The senior Republican chastises Trump for spreading dangerous conspiracy theories and says there is no proof of illegality. We\u0027re debating a step that has never been taken in Americana history - whether Congress should overrule the voters and overturn a presidential election, he says.President Trump claims the election was stolen. Nothing before us proves illegality anywhere near the massive scale that would have tipped the entire election.He said Congress had a limited role. We cannot simply declare ourselves a national board of election on steroids. Voters, courts, the states have all spoken. They\u0027ve all spoken. If we overrule them it would damage our republic forever.If this election were overturned by mere allegations from the losing side then our democracy would enter a death spiral.We\u0027d never see the whole nation accept an election again. Every election would be a scramble for power at any cost. The Electoral College would cease to exist.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, addresses sessionAs the joint session of Congress began hearing the formal count of Electoral College votes from each state the first objection has been made, Nick Allen reports. It came after the results for Arizona, one of the first states in the alphabet, were read. Mr Biden won Arizona.After the objection was made a group of Republican senators and members of Congress, including Senator Ted Cruz, stood and applauded. Mike Pence then adjourned the joint session and the Senate and House will each hold a debate on Arizona.The debates on Arizona could last up to two hours.Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) arrives for the Electoral College vote certification for President-elect Joe BidenIt appears Trump supporters have breached the Capitol building, tearing down four layers of security fencing.They are now attempting to occupy the building, fighting federal police who appear overrun. This comes minutes after the president called on those gathered at the rally in Washington DC to march to the Capitol to call on congress members to object to the electoral college vote certification.Here is a video from a journalist on the scene:Another one here:Mike Pence Vice President, has sent a letter to Members of Congress ahead of today’s Joint Session of Congress:, essentially refusing to do what President Trump is asking by contesting the certification.Pence, who has a largely formal and constitutionally prescribed role of presiding over the House and Senate, said he cannot claim unilateral authority to reject electoral votes that will make Joe Biden president. I do not believe that the Founders of our country intended to invest the Vice President with unilateral authority to decide which electoral voters should be counted, he writes. It is my considered judgment that my oath to support and defend the Constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not.Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Vice President Mike Pence talk before a joint session of the House and Senate conveneA group led by US Representative Louis Gohmert has just filed for administrative stay and interim relief with the Supreme Court over the certification of the election results.Trump just encouraged the sizable crowd gathered in DC to march on the Capitol during Electoral College certification later today.The president said it will be leading the march to the Capitol where the crowd will cheer on Members of Congress in real time who object to the certification of Joe Biden.Donald Trump is speaking at the Save America rally in Washington DC. He says: “These people are not going to take it any longer. They’re not going to take it any longer.We will never give up, we will never concede. It doesn\u0027t happen. You don’t concede when there’s theft involved, he says.Donald Trump speaks to supporters from The Ellipse near the White House “Does anybody believe that Joe got 80 million votes? Does anybody believe that?” Trump asks the crowd. NO! many shout back. “He got 80m computer votes. It’s a disgrace.He says of his supporters that there has never been a movement like this, ever, ever, to crowds shouting we love Trump!Videos have been emerging all morning of Republican senators facing the wrath of angry Trump supporters, who have descended on Washington DC for the Save America rally. This one shows Trumpers shouting at Senator Todd Young of Indiana, who has not publicly given his support to the bid to oppose the election\u0027s certification in the Senate today.It’s Republican v Republican on the steps of Congress this morning, writes Ben Riley-Smith, our US Editor. A foretaste of the almighty struggle coming between the GOP’s Trumpist and traditionalist wings.Thousands of supporters of President Donald Trump, including members of far-right groups, gathered in Washington in protest at a meeting of Congress on Wednesday to certify Joe Biden\u0027s victory in November\u0027s presidential election.Trump, who lost the election promised to address the protesters at the Ellipse, a park near the White House, where Biden is due to take over in two weeks.BIG CROWDS! Trump wrote on Twitter.Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u0027s personal lawyer, is warming up the huge crowd, saying he\u0027s willing to stake his reputation and Trump\u0027s reputation on there being fraud in the presidential election.Over the next 10 days, we get to see the machines that are crooked, the ballots that are fraudulent, said Giuliani. If we\u0027re wrong, we will be made fools of. But if we\u0027re right, and lot of them will go to jail. So -- let\u0027s have trial by combat. President-elect Joe Biden is heralding a Democratic victory in at least one of Georgia\u0027s two US Senate runoffs as part of a resounding message, as well as good news for his agenda.“I congratulate Reverend Warnock on his groundbreaking win last night and I am hopeful that when the count is complete, Jon Ossoff will also be victorious,” Biden said.“I congratulate the people of Georgia, who turned out in record numbers once again, just as they did in November, to elect two new Senators, demand action, and call on our elected leaders to end the gridlock and move us forward as a nation.”Biden also praised the work of two prominent Georgia women in clinching Warnock’s win.“I also congratulate the twin powers of Georgia, Stacey Abrams and Keisha Lance Bottoms, who have laid the difficult groundwork necessary to encourage turnout and protect the vote over these last years.”Biden reserved particular praise for Stacey AbramsGabriel Sterling, the voting systems implementation manager for the Georgia Secretary of State\u0027s office, is giving a press conference now. Asked by a reporter whether he has seen any sign of malfeasance, the Republican says: There is no evidence of any irregularities. The biggest thing we\u0027ve seen is from the president\u0027s fertile mind, a finding of fraud where none exists.While the Democrats were out there knocking out doors, Trump was out there discouraging people from voting, he said of why he thought the two Republican candidates were performing badly.Sterling has been outspoken in his criticism for Donald Trump, who he says is propagating disinformation about election fraud in Georgia.Sterling says he anticipates that all but a few votes will be counted by 1 pm local time (6pm UK) and that Ossoff will very likely defeat Perdue.He told  journalists that it is looking like Ossoff will win by more than half a percentage point, thus avoiding a recount. We\u0027ll bring you more when we have it.Perdue had a more comfortable lead over Ossoff in the November election, so the numbers will be disappointing for Republicans.David Wasserman, election forecaster at The Cook Political Report, projected an Ossoff win last night, but networks did not believe they have currently seen enough to call it.Mitt Romney, Senator of Utah, has hit back at President Trump after getting harassed by a flight full of Trump supporters and he did not mince his words, reports Josie Ensor.The only Republican Senator to vote to impeach Trump in 2020 said “it turns out telling voters the election is rigged is not a good way to turn out your voters...President Trump has disrespected the American voters, has dishonored the election system and has disgraced the office of the presidency”.“I’m confident we’ll proceed as the Constituion demands and tell our supporters the truth whether or not they want to hear it,” he added of today’s GOP election challenge.Election workers check-in, sort, and signature verify absentee ballots for the state\u0026#39s U.S. Senate runoff electionDemocratic U.S. Senate candidate Jon Ossoff declares victory over David Perdue in a video released on social mediaAn election official assists voters at a polling location during the Senate runoff elections in AtlantaThe Leader of the Senate Democrats Chuck Schumer has declared himself the new Senate Majority Leader, despite the fact that the race between Jon Ossoff and David Perdue has yet to be declared.“It feels like a brand new day. For the first time in six years, Democrats will operate a majority in the United States Senate — and that will be very good for the American people,” Sen Schumer said in a statement released Wednesday morning.“America is experiencing one of the greatest crises we have ever faced, and the Senate Democratic Majority is committed to delivering the bold change and help Americans need and demand. Senate Democrats know America is hurting,” he added, signalling that the Democrats will make a beefed coronavirus relief bill their top priority.Sen Schumer will replace Mitch McConnell as the Senate Majority Leader, a fact former Secretary of State and presidential candidate Hillary Clinton seemed to enjoy on Twitter.Donald Trump will be leaving office on January 20 when Joe Biden is inaugurated, but his plans to leave the USA to go golfing in Scotland on January 19 appear to have been scuppered by Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.Ms Sturgeon has warned the President that golf does not constitute an \u0027essential\u0027 reason for travel and as such, were he to come to Scotland to play, he would be in breach of Covid rules.As we continue looking ahead to a Biden presidency, Rozina Sabur explores how Jill Biden will take to the role of First Lady.Jill Biden spent eight years serving as the Second Lady during the Obama administration, but her highly personal nine-minute live address at the Democratic Convention in August, from an empty classroom at the high school where she used to teach, was her first formal introduction to most of the American public.A self-professed introvert, Dr Biden has always been reticent about entering the political spotlight, although she is often described as Joe Biden\u0027s biggest defender and one of his best assets. She is also said to be one of his most trusted political advisers, reportedly playing a pivotal role in helping Mr Biden narrow down his list of potential running mates.READ MORE: Who is First Lady Dr Jill Biden - and how will she take to the role?The President is awake and tweeting, and has reacted to Jon Ossoff\u0027s declaration of victory over David Perdue with typical good grace and decorum.As we enter the final two weeks of Donald Trump\u0027s presidency, Dominic Penna our video team take a look back at his tumultuos four years in office.Since his victory in 2016 and inauguration in 2017, Donald Trump has been at the helm of one of the most unconventional and eventful presidencies in recent memory.From the inauguration crowd size controversy, to meeting Kim Jong-un and swearing in three Supreme Court justices, Mr Trump ploughed ahead with his unique style of leadership which sometimes stumped even the most seasoned of Washington correspondents.To round off his term in office, Mr Trump faced both an impeachment, a devastating pandemic in the months leading up to the 2020 election, and most recently, a controversial phone call with Georgia\u0027s Secretary of State in an attempt to overturn Joe Biden\u0027s victory in the state.READ MORE:  Donald Trump\u0027s presidency: The best and worst moments from his four years as US President Stacey Abrams has tweeted her congratulations to Jon Ossoff, who just a few moments ago, declared victory in his Senate race against David Perdue.Jon Ossoff will stand for all of Georgia in the fight for healthcare, jobs + justice. And our nation will be all the better for having him, she tweeted. Congratulations!Donald Trump\u0027s son Eric has said this morning that the MAGA Movement started by his father is going nowhere.He also issued a stark warning to any Republican who votes to certify the results of the election in Congress today, saying any senator or any congressman on this side that does not fight tomorrow, I’m telling you will not, their political career is over because the MAGA movement is going nowhere.Democrat Jon Ossoff has declared victory over Republican David Perdue in the second run-off election in Georgia.In a video released on Twitter, the former documentary film maker thanked the people of Georgia and urged people to Let\u0027s unite now to beat this virus and rush economic relief to the people of our state and the American people.No networks or major news outlets have called the race for Mr Ossoff as yet and his opponent has not yet conceded.Hours after winning one of Georgia\u0027s high-stakes runoffs, Rev. Raphael Warnock says people in his state are feeling a sense of hope this morning.Speaking in a round of morning television interviews, he said his victory pushes against the grain of so many expectations, but this is America and I want some young person who\u0027s watching this to know anything\u0027s possible.Georgia is now in an incredible place when you think of the arc of our history, he said.This is the reversal of the old southern strategy that sought to ide people, Rev. Warnock said on ABC\u0027s \u0027Good Morning America\u0027. In this moment we\u0027ve got to bring people together to do the hard work and I look forward to doing that.He told NBC\u0027s \u0027Today\u0027 that we can ill-afford to be ided. And I hope to be the pastor among peers in the United States Senate to appeal to the better angels of our nature and to remind us that Dr. King was right, we\u0027re tied of a single garment of destiny.Joe Biden is expected to be sworn in as the 46th President of the United States on January 20, writes Verity Bowman.Despite ongoing tensions with Donald Trump over the 2020 Election, the traditional outdoor ceremony is set to go ahead - though the coronavirus pandemic could scale back the usual celebrations.READ MORE: ​Inauguration Day 2021: When is Joe Biden sworn in as US president, and what will it look like during Covid-19?Although the result has yet to be confirmed, it seems as though Democrats will take control of the Senate, meaning their arch-nemesis in Congress Mitch McConnell will have a new job title.Mr McConnell, a Senator from Kentucky, has spent much of the last six years blocking legislation championed by the Democrats. He has also managed to get three Supreme Court Justices confirmed during his tenure, after blocking Barack Obama\u0027s attempt to get Merrick Garland confirmed in 2016.Some prominent Democrats have taken to Twitter to gloat about his possible impending departure from the Majority Leader\u0027s Office, including California Governor Gavin Newsom.The sun has not yet risen in Washington DC but a small army of Trump supporters has already descended on the US capital, Rozina Sabur writes.As reporters line up outside the White House grounds to receive their credentials for Donald Trump’s address later today, protesters have been streaming passed. Many have been hurling abuse, in a sign of how toxic US politics has become. “Why don’t you tell the truth?” shouts one. “You’re going to burn in hell,” says another. Washington is braced for unrest today with thousands of protests and counter- protests expected to mark Congress’ certification of the electoral college results.For the president’s supporters today marks an opportunity to express their frustration with the outcome of the election, and protests against what many believe was a fraudulent race. For Democrats, the event marks the final chapter in the Trump presidency. With the final nail being hammered in to the Donald Trump presidency today, our reporter Nick Allen takes a look at what is next for some of his closest advisers - his children.The Trump presidency has been a family affair and, as Donald Trump\u0027s star falls, his children find their futures looking uncertain too.Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner have been White House employees, senior advisers to the president and, after he leaves office will be looking for new work.When Mr Trump assumed office, he left his adult sons, Donald Jr and Eric, running the Trump Organization. If he were to decide to resume control of his business they may be less busy too.It is not beyond the realms of possibility that Mr Trump\u0027s exit from the White House will lead to the start of a Trump political dynasty.READ MORE: What next for Donald Trump\u0027s children, after Joe Biden\u0027s inauguration?Reverend Raphael Warnock has become the first African-American to win a Senate seat in the history of Georgia after he defeated Republican incumbent Kelly Loeffler in a special run-off election on Tuesday night.The 51-year-old has never held political office before, but he has been an active member of Georgia’s political scene, spending much of the last decade campaigning for the expansion of Medicaid, criminal justice reform and increasing voter registration.Born the son of two Pentecostal pastors and raised in public housing in Savannah, Georgia, Rev Warnock has committed much of his life to his faith.READ MORE: Raphael Warnock: the African-American pastor who made history with Georgia Senate run-off winToday marks the day when Congress is expected to certify the Electoral College vote, officially recognising Joe Biden as the 46th President of the United States.The clock is ticking. With or without the co-operation of the outgoing Trump administration during the transition, Joe Biden wants to hit the ground running when he takes office on January 20.Irrespective of the blizzard of litigation, Mr Biden has already identified key members of the team he hopes will help ensure that his administration assumes the reins of government smoothly.Elsewhere in America, Trump supporters have been gathering in Washington DC for a day of protests and rallies today.Protesters are gathering in anticipation of the certification of the electoral college results in Congress this afternoon. Once ratified, Joe Biden\u0027s victory as President will be officially confirmed.Overnight, MAGA supporters clashed with police in the nation\u0027s capital, as seen in footage on social media.President Trump has spent much of the last few days attempting to pressure his VP Mike Pence to stop Congress from ratifying the results.It is hard to over-exaggerate just how much is riding on the remaining Senate seat race in Georgia which will decide the balance of power and thus the fate of many of Joe Biden\u0027s policies, writes our US editor Ben Riley-SmithOn the current maths the Democrats have 49 seats and the Republicans have 50. Win the last so-called ‘run-off’ races in Georgia and the Democrats are just about over the line. In tied votes in the US Senate, the deciding vote is cast by the vice president, soon to be Kamala Harris. Mr Biden can pass some laws in that case without Republican votes.But if they fall short the Republicans keep their majority. And that means Mitch McConnell remains as Senate leader.READ MORE: How defeat in Senate battle could leave a hamstrung Joe Biden struggling to accomplish real changeAs the Democrats inch closer to control of the Senate, and a clean sweep politically, our reporter Nick Allen looks at what this could mean for the first 100 days of Joe Biden\u0027s presidency.President-elect Joe Biden is due to be sworn into office on January 20. Mr Biden made a long list of promises for his first 100 days, but his overriding priority will be the coronavirus pandemic.In addition, he is expected to try to roll the clock back as much as possible to January 2017, when he and Barack Obama left office.That would involve using executive orders, as much as possible, to overturn orders introduced by Mr Trump, including those that loosened environmental regulations.READ MORE: What will Joe Biden\u0027s first 100 days as US president look like, and when is his first day in office?In scenes reminiscent of the second week of November, all eyes are on the vote tabulaters in Georgia, who have just released their latest batch of counted ballots.It\u0027s good news for the Democrats, as Jon Ossoff now holds a lead of 16,370 votes, according to CNN, which means he is not only inching closer to victory, but inching closer to a win without a recount.With 98 per cent of ballots counted, Mr Ossoff has a lead of 0.4 per cent over Mr Perdue, taking him within striking distance of exceeding the 0.5 per cent recount threshold.However, as Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said earlier today, it is unlikely we will have a final tally until this afternoon.President Trump has spent the morning calling fraud in the run-off elections in Georgia, where Democrats have already won one race and are closing in on winning a second.Looks like they are setting up a big “voter dump” against the Republican candidates, the President tweeted. Waiting to see how many votes they need?Just happened to have found another 4000 ballots from Fulton County. Here we go! he tweeted a little later.Democrat Jon Ossoff has extended his lead over Republican David Perdue to 16,370 votes with 98 per cent of ballots counted, according to Edison Research.That gives Mr Ossoff a 0.4 per cent lead over Mr Perdue, taking him close to clearing the 0.5 per cent threshold under which Mr Perdue could automatically request a recount.Stacey Abrams, a former Representative in the Georgia House, has congratulated Rev Warnock on his Senate victory.Ms Abrams, who is seen as a key figure in the Democratic party, was credited with significantly increasing Democratic turnout in Georgia in the 2020 Presidential election.Further to our post at 8.23am, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger has told CNN that some counties will now take a break from counting, and that we should have a better idea of the final results at noon on the East Coast, which is 5pm in London.“They’re probably going to take a break here, I think, in the next hour. Try and get as much work as they can done tonight ... At least, record exactly how many ballots are out there and then get as much scanning done tomorrow. Hopefully by noon we’ll have a better idea where we are,” he said.In the latest batch of counted votes, Democrat Jon Ossoff has extended his lead over Republican David Perdue to 12,806 votes. This gives him a lead of 0.2 per cent, which is still within the band where the loser in the race can request a recount. The winner must win by 0.5 per cent in order to avoid such a scenario.Donald Trump has taken to Twitter this morning to continue his attempts to pressure his VP Mike Pence to decertify results from some states, which would deny victory to Joe Biden.If Vice President  @Mike_Pence  comes through for us, we will win the Presidency, Trump tweeted. Many States want to decertify the mistake they made in certifying incorrect.Mike can send it back! READ MORE: Donald Trump urges Mike Pence to block Joe Biden\u0027s election victory in CongressIt may be a while before we know the final result if the Ossoff-Perdue race, as several key counties in Georgia have stopped counting votes for the night.Chatham County, Fulton County and Cobb County, which all contain significant urban and suburban populations, will resume their counts around 8am local time (1pm GMT).Attendees react as results come in during a Republican election night party in AtlantaRepublican U.S. Senator Kelly Loeffler speaks at the GA GOP election night event for the run-off election for Georgia\u0026#39s two Senate seats in AtlantaElection observers watch as a Fulton County election worker scans absentee ballots at the Georgia World Congress Center in AtlantaRev. Warnock, the senior pastor of the church where Martin Luther King preached through the height of the Civil Rights movement until his assassination, made history with a surge in African-American turnout.To be sure, a narrow win out of 4.4 million votes involves plenty of variables. But African-American voters were a force in the early vote and on Election Day. Notably, it wasn\u0027t just in metro Atlanta, but also in rural and small-town counties across South Georgia, where African-American turnout has historically lagged.That means it was an alliance ning from the most affluent African-American residents of Atlanta, including recent transplants to Georgia, to those African-American Georgia natives who hail from the most economically depressed pockets of the state.This election cycle a confluence of factors for African-American voters: 2020 offered the first general election after the disappointment of Stacey Abrams\u0027 narrowly missing out in 2018 on becoming the first African-American woman governor in U.S. history, and it was the first election after the death of Rep. John Lewis, Atlanta\u0027s civil rights icon who once marched alongside King and would publicly joust with Trump.Ms Loeffler and her Republican allies used the two-month runoff campaign to hammer Rev Warnock with ads calling him dangerous and radical. They used snippets of his sermons from Ebenezer Baptist Church to accuse him of hate speech and racial isiveness.But African-American voters can point to Tuesday\u0027s vote count and take credit for that strategy ending in defeat.The race for U.S. Senate in Georgia between incumbent GOP Sen. David Perdue and Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff is too early to call.As of 7:40 a.m. GMT Wednesday, Ossoff had a lead of 9,527 votes out of nearly 4.4 million counted, or a margin of less than 0.2 percentage points.There were still some mail ballots and in-person early votes left to be counted statewide, the majority of which are in Democratic-leaning counties.Under Georgia law, a trailing candidate may request a recount when the margin of an election is less than or equal to 0.5 percentage points.The Perdue-Ossoff race was one of two runoff elections that Georgia held Tuesday. In the other election, Democrat Raphael Warnock unseated Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler.The races will determine which party controls the U.S. Senate. Democrats must win both seats to take power, while Republicans only need one to keep Mitch McConnell as majority leader.The campaign for Republican David Perdue, who currently narrowly trails Democrat Jon Ossoff, has released a statement saying they believe Senator Perdue will be victorious.Using language that echoes that used by Donald Trump in the wake of his defeat to Joe Biden, the campaign said: We will mobilise every available resource and exhaust every legal recourse to ensure all legally cast ballots are properly counted.We believe in the end, Senator Perdue will be victorious.With 98 per cent of the vote counted, Sen. Perdue currently trails Mr Ossoff by 9,527 votes.Global stock prices slipped and bond yields rose on Wednesday as investors braced for the prospect that Democrats could win both seats at stake in a U.S. Senate run-off election in Georgia, handing them control of the chamber.Along with their narrow majority in the House of Representatives, a \u0027blue sweep\u0027 of Congress could usher in larger fiscal stimulus and pave the way for President-elect Joe Biden to push through greater corporate regulation and higher taxes.With Biden proposing to reverse President Donald Trump\u0027s tax cut, increase the minimum wage, and strengthen oversight on various industries, some might argue that his agenda is not particularly market-friendly, said Vasu Menon, investment strategy executive director at OCBC Bank in Singapore.Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff has taken a lead of about 3,500 votes in his close race against Republican US Senator David Perdue in Georgia, according to Edison Research.Both candidates have 50.0 per cent of the vote, but Ossoff has edged ahead of Perdue 2,195,441 to 2,191,881 with 98 per cent of the expected vote counted, according to Edison.The NBC television network on Wednesday projected Democrat Raphael Warnock the winner of his U.S. Senate runoff election against Republican Senator Kelly Loeffler.Warnock, a pastor at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta where slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King once preached, would become Georgia\u0027s first Black senator if final election results confirmed his victory.The close margins in the race means the winners might not be clear until at least Wednesday morning in the US.Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said election officials would take a break overnight but resume counting on Wednesday morning. Hopefully by noon we\u0027ll have a better idea where we are, he said on CNN.Most of the votes remaining to be counted were in counties Joe Biden won in November, with roughly 30,000 to go in DeKalb and Newton counties near Atlanta, according to Edison Research estimates.The critical races drew an estimated 4.5 million voters - a record for a run-off.Georgia Democrat Raphael Warnock claimed victory on Tuesday night in a key US Senate race against Republican Kelly Loeffler - who has not conceded defeat.US officials and major media had yet to declare a winner for either of the two Georgia seats at stake, both of which Joe Biden\u0027s Democrats need to flip to take control of the Senate.Georgia, I am honored by the faith that you have shown in me, Warnock, a 51-year-old Black pastor, said in a televised address shortly after midnight. And I promise you this tonight, I am going to the Senate to work for all of Georgia.Democratic Senate candidate Raphael Warnock speaks on his campaign\u0026#39s Youtube accountAs the hour slipped past midnight on the East Coast, the odds of Democrats Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff beating Republicans Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue were slowing inching up. It was a seesaw night. Warnock and Ossoff jumped to early leads, but as more votes came in, the Republicans swung in front.It made for some great television suspense, although people following online saw a different view. The New York Times website estimated the victory probabilities in each race and, as the evening progressed, moved steadily in the Democrats\u0027 direction. After midnight, the Times judged both Warnock and Ossoff had a better than 95 per cent chance of winning.Even before 10 pm, Dave Wasserman of the influential Cook Political Report tweeted that he had seen enough to predict Warnock would beat Loeffler. That led Twitter, however, to slap his prediction with a warning that other sources were saying it was too close to call.The Republican election night party in Atlanta is beginning to empty, with those remaining increasingly concerned that one or both GOP Georgia Senate candidates could lose.That would give Georgia a Democratic senator for the first time since 2005, when Zell Miller retired from his seat.John Burke, a spokesperson for Republican David Perdue, says, This is going to be close. He says, We\u0027ll see how the last few votes go.Republican supporters attend a run-off election night party at Grand Hyatt Hotel in Buckhead in AtlantaAs votes were tallied on Tuesday night, Democratic candidates Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff had the backing of Black voters, younger voters, people earning less than $50,000 and newcomers to the state, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of voters in Tuesday\u0027s high-stakes Senate contests.The Republican coalition backing Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue was the mirror opposite: white, older, wealthier and longtime Georgia residents.The findings from AP VoteCast reveal the extent of Georgia\u0027s recent political transformation - from GOP bastion to electoral battleground where turnout is decisive. The survey found roughly 30 per cent of Georgia voters were Black and almost all of them - 94 per cent - backed Democrats. Voters under 45, those earning less than $50,000 and those who recently moved to Georgia all broke for Democrats.But Republicans held firmly onto their supporters, bringing out white voters and those older than 45 - groups that still account for majorities of Georgia voters. Republicans Perdue and Loeffler also fared better than their rivals among voters earning more than $75,000 and those who have called Georgia home for more than 20 years.A person dressed in a Spider-Man costume holds campaign signs for Senate candidates near a polling location in Marietta, GeorgiaDonald Trump has suggested that Georgian officials are waiting to see how many votes Democrats need to beat the Republicans before announcing results.In his latest unfounded claim of election fraud, Mr Trump appears to be saying that the vote is rigged against his party. But votes are being published in batches as they are counted, with delays due to counting a large number of postal votes.We\u0027ve all done it, haven\u0027t we? When the new year begins, it takes a few days to get used to writing the correct date.But most of us aren\u0027t writing statements for the the president of the United States.A post issued by the Trump campaign has provoked ridicule on Twitter after it contained a number of falsehoods – and the wrong date.In the statement, the president\u0027s team denied a New York Times report that Mike Pence will certify Joe Biden\u0027s victory. The statement claims, wrongly, that the vice-president can decertify the results or send them back to the states for change and certification. He can also decertify the illegal and corrupt results and send them to the House of Representatives for the one vote for one state tabulation. This is not true and there is no precedent for a US vice-president doing this.The statement was also incorrectly dated 2020.Washington police banned the leader of a far-right group from the city and made two arrests on Tuesday as protesters supporting President Trump\u0027s attempts to overturn the election gathered in the city.Enrique Tarrio, the leader of the Proud Boys, who was arrested on Monday for destruction of property and possession of a firearm magazine, was released on Tuesday and ordered to stay away from the city, according to a court document.Protests against President-elect Joe Biden\u0027s November election win, which Congress will certify on Wednesday, started across the US capital on Tuesday and were expected to grow on Wednesday to thousands of people.Mr Trump, who lost the election by 7 million votes, was expected to speak to protesters on Wednesday morning at the Ellipse, a public park south of the White House, he said in a post on Twitter on Tuesday evening.Protesters are gathering in Washington DC before Wednesday\u0026#39s pro-Trump rallyA top Republican official in the Georgia secretary of state’s office has blamed Donald Trump for the Republican party\u0027s results so far, as early counts suggest they may be heading for defeat.Gabriel Sterling told CNN that if the Republican senators lose, the blame ought to fall squarely on the shoulders of President Trump and his actions since November 3.Mr Sterling has criticised Mr Trump’s untrue claims of fraud in the November election. He told CNN that the president\u0027s claims undermined Republican voters\u0027 trust in voting.Mr Sterling also claimed that the president has started a civil war among Georgia Republicans by denying the results of the November election.Gabriel Sterling said Donald Trump had led Republicans to believe that their vote did not matterThe elections director for Georgia\u0027s most populous county said a bomb threat targeting an Election Day polling place was investigated last week by the FBI.Rick Barron of Fulton County said during a media briefing that the person said that the Nashville bombing was a practice run for what we would see today at one of our polling places.A bomb detonated in downtown Nashville on Christmas morning, killing the bomber and injuring three other people and damaging dozens of buildings.The Fulton County threat, received on December 30, was reported to the FBI. Mr Barron said agents visited the Tennessee home of the man who made the threat and searched it but did not make any arrests.Mr Barron also revealed that several members of his staff have received death threats and innumerable racial slurs have been directed at his staff, by phone and on social media.Republican former US president George W Bush will attend the inauguration of Joe Biden on January 20, his chief of staff has said.President and Mrs Bush look forward to returning to the Capitol for the swearing in of President Biden and Vice President Harris, Freddy Ford tweeted.Witnessing the peaceful transfer of power is a hallmark of our democracy that never gets old, he added, in a seeming jab at President Trump who refuses to concede defeat and has not confirmed if he will attend Mr Biden\u0027s inauguration.It will be the eighth swearing-in ceremony the Bushs have attended, Mr Ford said.George Bush left office in 2009More people voted in Georgia\u0027s most populous county during Tuesday\u0027s run-off election than on Election Day in November.Fulton County elections director Rick Barron said there were more than 70,000 votes cast in person on Tuesday, with about 60,000 in-person votes on November 3. Fulton County includes most of Atlanta and is heavily Democratic.Mr Barron noted that there were fewer absentee ballots cast than during the general election and that the early in-person voting period was four days shorter, both of which he said may have contributed to the higher Election Day turnout.Spokesperson Summer Dunham says neighbouring DeKalb County, also a Democratic stronghold, also had more in-person votes on Tuesday than on November 3.Georgia voters in Tuesday\u0027s run-off races were evenly ided about which party should win, an exit poll showed.With about 10 per cent of the vote counted, Democrat Rev Raphael Warnock led Republican Senator Kelly Loeffler by 54.9pc to 45.1pc, while Jon Ossoff led Republican Senator David Perdue by 54.3pc to 45.7pc. However, those votes are from counties in Atlanta that are expected to vote Democrat.Edison Research\u0027s exit poll found roughly half of voters would prefer the Republican Party to retain control and half would like to see the Democrats take over, reflecting how close the two races were likely to be.The poll also found about half of voters in the two Senate run-off races voted for President Donald Trump in November\u0027s presidential election and half for Democrat Joe Biden.Meanwhile, about three quarters of voters who backed Republican candidates in Tuesday\u0027s votes said Joe Biden was not legitimately elected in November, according to AP VoteCast.Most polls have now closed in Georgia, though voters who were in line before 7pm (12am UK) will be allowed to vote.Results will begin to be posted in the next hour, though it may be some time before we have a definitive result.Officials have already started processing postal votes which should help to avoid a repeat of the scenes in November when Georgia\u0027s votes took days to count.Staff in Lawrenceville, Georgia, get cracking with the huge task of processing and counting all the votesGeorgia officials have started counting ballots as polls close across the state in two critical races.Here\u0027s what you need to know.What are these votes for?There are two Senate run-off elections being held. The votes are leftovers from the November general election, when none of the candidates hit the 50 per cent threshold.Why are they important?Democrats need to win both of the votes to seize the Senate majority – and, with it, control of the new Congress when Biden takes office in two weeks.Who are the candidates?In one contest, Republican Kelly Loeffler, a 50-year-old former businesswoman who was appointed to the Senate less than a year ago by the state\u0027s governor, faces Democrat Raphael Warnock, 51, who serves as the senior pastor of the Atlanta church where Martin Luther King Jr grew up and preached.The other election pits 71-year-old former business executive David Perdue, a Republican who held his Senate seat until his term expired on Sunday, against Democrat Jon Ossoff, a former congressional aide and journalist. At just 33 years old, Mr Ossoff would be the Senate\u0027s youngest member.When will we get the results?We could know the winners late on Tuesday evening in the US (early Wednesday in the UK).President Trump has confirmed he will address a rally of his supporters on Wednesday in Washington.Mr Trump tweeted on Tuesday evening that he will be speaking and is expecting a big crowd at the event, a protest against the certification by Congress of the 2020 election results.Republicans and Democrats have gone head to head in Georgia for a vital run-off election that will determine the balance of the SenatePolls have closed in the vote that is exceptionally closeDonald Trump has urged Mike Pence to block the certification of the election result in a last-minute attempt to overhaul Joe Biden\u0027s victoryThe president has confirmed he will speak at a rally in Washington DC on Wednesday in which protesters including the Proud Boys will demonstrate against the result of the November electionProsecutors have announced they will not charge a white police officer over the shooting of Jacob Blake, which set off violent protests in Wisconsin last summer.

It is disorder. It is chaos. It borders on sedition.And it must end. Now.I call on this mob to pull back and allow the work of democracy to go forward.You’ve heard me say this in different contexts: the words of a President matter, no matter how good or bad that president is.At their best, the words of a president can inspire.At their worst, they can incite.Therefore, I call on President Trump to go on national television, now, to fulfill his oath and defend the Constitution and demand an end to this siege. To storm the Capitol, to smash windows, to occupy offices, and to threaten the safety of duly elected officials is not protest. The world is watching — and like so many other Americans, I am shocked and saddened that our nation, so long a beacon of light, hope, and democracy has come to such a dark moment.Through war and strife, America has endured much. And we will endure here and prevail now. The work of the moment and the work of the next four years must be the restoration of democracy and the recovery of respect for the rule of law, and the renewal of a politics that’s about solving problems — not stoking the flames of hate and chaos. America is about honor, decency, respect, and tolerance.That’s who we are. That’s who we’ve always been.The certification of the Electoral College votes is supposed to be a sacred ritual in which we affirm the majesty of American democracy. Today is a reminder, a painful one, that democracy is fragile. To preserve it requires people of good will, leaders with the courage to stand up, who are devoted not to pursuit of power and personal interest at any cost, but to the common good.Think of what our children who are watching are thinking. Think of what the rest of the world is looking at.For nearly two and a half centuries, we the people, in search of a more perfect union, have kept our eyes on that common good. America is so much better than what we’re seeing today. Watching the scenes from the Capitol, I was reminded of Abraham Lincoln’s words in an annual message to the Congress whose work has today been interrupted by chaos. President Lincoln said: “We shall nobly save or meanly lose, the last best hope of earth….The way is plain, peaceful, generous, just — a way which, if followed, the world will forever applaud, and God must forever bless.”Our way is plain here, too. It is the way of democracy, of lawfulness, and of honor — respect for each other, and for our nation.Notwithstanding what we’ve seen today, I remain optimistic about the incredible opportunities. There has never been anything we can’t do when we do it together. And this God-awful display today is bringing home to every Republican, Democrat, and Independent in the nation that we must step up.This is the United States of America. May God protect our troops and everyone at the Capitol who is trying to protect the order.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"schools closed new lockdown when reopen uk areas covid","story":"Boris Johnson has announced that all primary and secondary schools will have to close from Jan 5, as England moves into a third national lockdown.The Prime Minister said schools will need to offer remote learning until at least mid-February and GCSE and A-level exams face cancellation for a second year.Mr Johnson said the new measures were necessary: because we have to do everything we possibly can to stop the spread of the disease.Only vulnerable children and the children of key workers will be allowed to attend schools for face-to-face learning, and early years settings such as nurseries will remain accessible.The Prime Minister has promised that schools will be the very first things to reopen when lockdown measures begin to be removed, saying that this could come following the February half term. However, Mr Johnson remains very cautious about the timetable, with restrictions being lifted as a gradual unravelling. Those entitled to free school meals will continue to receive them during closures, and more devices will be distributed to help remote learning, according to Mr Johnson.The Government had insisted schools would remain open only a day before the new measures were announced, reassuring parents it was safe to send their children back for the start of term on Jan 4.But the move prompted backlash from four national teaching unions, who called for the delay seen across London to apply to all schools in England amid concerns the new strain of Covid-19 poses a threat to teachers.Anne Longfield, the Children\u0027s Commissioner for England has called for teachers to be vaccinated as a priority.The new lockdown measures mean the entire country will be subject to the same tougher measures, including the closure of all schools, meaning the tier system is not currently in place.Every school had been instructed to draw up plans to ensure children continue to receive an education even if they have to stay at home.Mr Johnson said on the announcement of closing schools: I want to stress that the problem is not that schools are unsafe to children. The problem is that schools may nonetheless act as vectors for transmission, causing the virus to spread between households.Read more on the previous tier system: All schools will remain closed until mid-February, with the possibility that these measures could be extended further.This means most secondary school pupils will stay at home until at least February half term. Gavin Williamson, the Education Secretary, announced on January 6 that GCSE, A-Level and AS exams will not take place this summer. Exams will be replaced by teacher assessments, with Mr Williamson saying that the government will put our trust in teachers, rather than algorithms. The Education Secretary has also stated that the Department for Education and Ofqual had already worked up a range of options. Details are currently being fine tuned, but it will be a form of teacher-assessed grades, with training and support provided to ensure these are awarded fairly and consistently across the country.When schools reopened in September the Government published 25,000 words of guidance explaining how school children and staff should be kept safe.Older children will be encouraged to avoid close contact with one another, in part because risks increase with age. Teachers are not restricted to a single bubble, but are urged to stay at the front of any classroom to reduce contact. In class, pupils must sit spaced out side-by-side and facing forward.The use of the staff room by teachers is also meant to be “minimised”. Schools must contact local health protection teams immediately so those in close contact with the child can be traced. Currently, pupils in a bubble, year groups and very rarely, the entire school, could be asked to self-isolate. A mobile testing unit could also be sent to a campus. Schools will be offered serial testing of close contacts of staff and pupils who test positive to negate the need for entire year groups to self-isolate at home.Teachers who help a child with symptoms do not have to self-isolate unless they develop symptoms themselves. However, they should thoroughly wash their hands and wear PPE while with the child. The area where someone suspected of having Covid-19 has been must then be intensively cleaned.If a parent insists a child with symptoms should attend school, the headteacher can refuse to take the pupil if they believe there is a threat to others.Staff will also supply and promote the use of tissues as part of the “catch it, bin it, kill it” technique to control germs.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"washington stormed dark day american democracy unfolded","story":"Donald Trump’s supporters stormed the US Capitol on Wednesday to stop the confirmation of Joe Biden as the next US president as unprecedented scenes of violence and chaos played out in Washington DC. Dozens of protesters managed to break into the building and roam the corridors of the Congress as tens of thousands gathered outside in support of the president’s false claims of election victory.Congressmen who had gathered in the Senate and the House of Representatives to certify the election results were forced to flee under escort as law enforcement lost control of the situation.In the House chamber security officers pulled their guns to barricade the door. At least one pro-Trump protester made it into the Senate chamber, sitting with hand aloft in victory.One woman was shot as scuffles broke out in the corridors of the Capitol, according to multiple US media reports and video footage. It was unclear who fired the shot.A 6pm citywide curfew was announced as evening approached. The events were widely described as a dark day for American democracy.The entire District of Columbia National Guard, made up of 1,100 troops, was ordered into the city at the request of Washington mayor Muriel Bowser.Footage showed that one protester reached the office of Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic House Speaker, and left a note reading “we will not back down”.Both Ms Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate, released a statement calling on Mr Trump to demand that all protesters leave the US Capitol.Mr Trump had addressed the crowds hours before they marched on the Capitol, telling them to “stop the steal” and doubling down on his false claims of election victory.As the violence broke out Mr Trump later called for calm, tweeting: “I am asking for everyone at the US Capitol to remain peaceful. No violence!”Mr Trump later released a video calling his supporters to go home.  He said: “You have to go home now. We have to have peace. We have to have law and order. We have to respect our great people in law and order. We don’t want anybody hurt.”Boris Johnson tweeted, calling on the White House to restore the rule of law: Disgraceful scenes in U.S. Congress. The United States stands for democracy around the world and it is now vital that there should be a peaceful and orderly transfer of power.The remarkable developments in the nation’s capital were not inevitable when the sun rose on Tuesday morning, though there was a sense of foreboding around the city.Thousands of the president’s faithful had gathered the night before, arriving after Mr Trump demanded support for his on-going claim that he, not Mr Biden, was the real election victor.Wednesday was the day when Congress performs its largely ceremonial duty of signing off the results ahead of the inauguration on January 20, when Mr Biden becomes president.But the day had double significance. The final balance of the Senate, a chamber the Republicans have held the majority in for six years, was due to become apparent.Georgia, a deeply conservative and deeply religious state which has been a stronghold of the Republican Party for decades, voted on Tuesday for its two US senators.The races had gone to a so-called run-off after no candidate got more than 50 per cent in the November election. But it carried more significance than just that.The Democrats were on 48 Senate seats and the Republicans on 50 before the run-offs.If the Democrats won both, they would finally have control of the Senate because the vice president - soon to be Kamala Harris - casts the deciding vote in ties.On Wednesday morning it was clear the Democrats were headings for just that. Reverend Raphael Warnock was declared the winner in his race against Kelly Loeffler, the Republican.The result made Mr Warnock only the 11th black senator elected in US history and the first to represent the state of Georgia, which was once part of the Confederacy.The second race, between Jon Ossoff, a 33-year-old documentary film-maker, and David Perdue, the sitting republican senator, was closer.But by Wednesday afternoon the race had been called for Mr Ossoff. The Democrats had flipped both seats - a remarkable feat.Democrats were celebrating their expected victories and working out just how beneficial it would be for Mr Biden’s presidency.For one, he would no longer need to rely on Republican votes to confirm any of his proposed cabinet members - some of whom had been controversial - or judicial appointments, not least a Supreme Court pick should a seat become free in his term.For another, passing his legislative agenda will become easier. While bold progressive reforms like expanding government-funded healthcare and major climate change action may be hard to keep the Democrats united on, others such as getting more stimulus money to help those affected by the pandemic should pass.Plus it means the Democrats, not the Republicans, will hold the gavels on Senate committees, and with it the power over what and who to investigate. That could help Mr Biden in his first two years in office.The jubilation on the Democratic side was matched by the frustration on the Republican side. Georgia was now a blue state, won by Mr Biden at the election and with two Democratic senators.Much of the blame was heading towards Mr Trump, who had gone to political war with senior Republicans in Georgia over their refusal to overturn Mr Biden’s win and disheartened supporters with claims of election rigging.Josh Holmes, the former chief of staff to Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell, was among those to point the finger at the president.He tweeted: “Suburbs, my friends, the suburbs. I feel like a one trick pony but here we are again. We went from talking about jobs and the economy to Qanon election conspiracies in 4 short years and - as it turns out- they were listening!”The president, however, reached for a familiar explanation - vote rigging.Just like in the wake of his presidential election defeat, Mr Trump began to make unfounded and wild allegations of election fraud on Twitter to explain away the lost Senate seats.By mid-morning attention was focussing on downtown Washington DC. Tens of thousands of pro-Trump protesters had been gathering outside of the White House.Their presence in the capital was not just welcomed by Mr Trump but actively encouraged. For weeks, the president has been turning his attention to Congress’s role in approving the presidential election results.Since the election the courts and the states have consistently rejected the president’s claim that he won a “landslide” only to have it somehow “stolen”. Now Congress was Mr Trump’s last remaining hope.He had agreed to address the crowds and among those waiting in the cold wearing Trump merchandise there was widespread support for his position.Gary Dalbec had travelled seven hours from Charleston, South Carolina to attend the march. He said he hoped the presence of so many protesters would help to expose the fraudulent election and give Mr Trump another term in office.It was fraud. They\u0027ve got the evidence, they\u0027re hiding it. We just need the right people to expose it. The rest of the people are committing treason, he told The . That\u0027s the end of the road if they certify. Today is make or break.”Susan Cardin, from Colorado, said she had been protesting outside the White House since 5am. We\u0027re here to save America. We\u0027re here to stop the steal, she said.Ms Cardin remained adamant that the huge show of support for the president would help carry him into a second term.I believe that Trump\u0027s going to come out ahead, whether that\u0027s today or in 30 days, she said. They\u0027ll try and do all kinds of things but he\u0027ll still come through.”When the president eventually spoke he unleashed a furious verbal attack on Republican congressmen who had refused to endorse his baseless claims of victory.“They’re weak Republicans. They’re pathetic Republicans, he said at one point.You primary the hell out of the ones that don’t fight,” he added - referring to the move to challenge sitting congressmen for their party nominations when they seek re-election.His defiance of election defeat was total: We will never give up, we will never concede. It doesn\u0027t happen. You don’t concede when there’s theft involved.”Mr Trump also repeatedly demanded that Mike Pence, who as vice president oversees the Senate procedures, somehow intervene to reject the confirmation of the election results.“Mike Pence, I hope you’re going to stand up for the good of our Constitution and for the good of our country,” he said.“And if you’re not, I’m going to be very disappointed in you, I will tell you right now. I’m not hearing good stories.”The crowd cheered. And yet just as Mr Trump was uttering his demands, Mr Pence was doing the opposite - releasing a letter sent to congressmen explaining why he would not be following the president’s advice.It argued that he had no power to “unilaterally” throw out the decision of the people, insisting such a move would be unconstitutional.It was a three-page letter but could be summarised in one word: No. A sitting vice president had just told his president he would not break the US Constitution on his behalf.It was a remarkable moment in the Trump presidency, the point when Mr Pence publicly broke with Mr Trump. He will now be braced for Mr Trump’s vengeance.But he was not alone. Shortly afterwards, once Mr Pence stepped into the chair to oversee the Senate debate that would confirm the results, Mr McConnell rose.The wily leader of the Republican senators, Mr McConnell has been one of Mr Trump’s most reliable political allies, helping confirm three Supreme Court justices and pass major legislation such as a $1.5 trillion tax cut.But Mr McConnell too was about to break with the president. He said the vote was the most important he had taken in his 36 years in the US Senate.“We\u0027re debating a step that has never been taken in American history - whether Congress should overrule the voters and overturn a presidential election,” Mr McConnell said.President Trump claims the election was stolen. Nothing before us proves illegality anywhere near the massive scale that would have tipped the entire election.”He added: Voters, courts, the states have all spoken. They\u0027ve all spoken. If we overrule them it would damage our republic forever.If this election were overturned by mere allegations from the losing side then our democracy would enter a death spiral.”There were rebels, however. Thirteen Republican senators or senators-elect had made public their desire to object to the results before the gathering.In the event it was Ted Cruz, the Texas senator who came close to winning the 2016 Republican nomination and is expected to try again in 2024, who led the charge.He said large numbers of Americans believed the election was rigged and polls showed that included 17 per cent of Democrats.Mr Cruz said simply telling the voters go jump in a lake would jeopardise the legitimacy of this and subsequent elections.”Mr Cruz said: I am not arguing for setting aside the result of the election.”Instead, he wanted Congress to appoint an impartial electoral commission to hold an emergency 10-day audit and resolve the claims.The move was doomed to defeat. Even before the session had started it was clear the vast majority of US senators were willing and ready to confirm Mr Biden’s victory.But then the crowds descended. Sent on their way by Mr Trump to march up Capitol Hill from the White House, his vocal army of supporters had reached the Capitol Building.They clashed with officers. Then some stormed the building. Congressmen were scrambled out of the chambers as reports of armed stand-offs emerged.According to the US Capitol historical society it was the first time the Capitol had been breached since it was attacked by the British in 1814, during the War of 1812.The first protesters reached the inside of the building around 2pm, shortly after both the Senate and the House began proceedings to certify the election results. Photographs soon emerged of protesters having breached the Senate floor. One showed a man in a bobble hat sitting in Mr Pence’s chair, arm aloft in victory.A curfew was declared over Washington DC. The public had been forced to stay at home as sirens blared in the city, law enforcement scrambling to stay across the evolving chaos.By 3pm the congressional sessions to confirm Mr Biden as the next US president was yet to resume. The democratic system had ground to a halt.Mr Biden condemned the violence and called on protesters to fall back in a statement delivered to the cameras on Wednesday afternoon (see video below):“What we’re seeing are a small number of extremists dedicated to lawlessness. This is not dissent, it’s disorder. It’s chaos. It borders on sedition. And it must end now.“I call on this mob to pull back and allow the work of democracy to go forward.” Mr Pence issued a more forceful call for protesters to depart. This attack on our Capitol will not be tolerated and those involved will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, he wrote on Twitter.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"12 tory mps who voted","story":"NewsThe  Tory MPs who voted against Englands new lockdown - vote breakdownBoris Johnson faced a revolt from his own party over the third coronavirus shutdown, which came into effect on Wednesday amid surging Covid ratesmirrorShareCommentsByLizzy BuchanPolitical Correspondent:,  JAN NewsTory backbenchers rebelled against Englands new lockdown laws \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Angry backbenchers expressed alarm over new laws, after the small print revealed the lockdown could stay in place until March. MPs backed the plan in a Commons vote on Wednesday by  votes to , providing the Prime Minister with a majority of . But  Tory and  DUP MPs opposed the legislation. While the scale of the Tory revolt was smaller than the  MPs who opposed the tougher tier rules in December, it is a sign of trouble ahead for the Prime Minister. Mr Johnson insisted he had no choice but to impose a third national lockdown as the UKaposs death toll soared to levels seen during the peak of the pandemic in April. He told MPs earlier that the March deadline was not because we expect the full national lockdown to continue until then but to allow a steady, controlled and evidence-led move down through the tiers on a regional basis. The PM added: Our emergence from the lockdown cocoon will not be a big bang but a gradual unwrapping. On Wednesday, , people had died within  days of testing positive for Covid- - the highest daily reported total since April . Official figures are being affected by a lag of reporting over the festive period, with a round a third of the new deaths taking place before January  and around  in the week before Christmas Day. Record numbers of Covid- patients are in Englandaposs hospitals, with , people on the wards as of am on January . The figure is up % on a week ago. A string of Tory rebels expressed anger at new restrictions - despite the spiralling infection rates.  Former minister Sir Desmond Swayne branded lockdowns a complete failure while Sir Robert Syms said the measures, which are in place until March , were essentially a blank cheque for three months to Public Health England to do what they wish. Senior backbencher Sir Charles Walker blasted privileged people who were finding it easy to follow the rules. I canapost support criminalising a parent for seeing a child in the park over the coming months, itaposs not within my DNA to do that, he said. Sir Charles said it was easy for him and most people in this House to comply with the law, explaining: Weaposre comfortably off, we live in nice houses, we have gardens, we have outdoor spaces, we have access to family. The same applies to those journalists who fill our TV screens every night with their wisdom and wit about how people should comply with these regulations, and how they sneer at those who canapost.  How MPs voted on the lockdownThe new law, known as the Health Protection Coronavirus, RestrictionsandRegulations , passed by  votes to , with a majority of .

Quizzed about the potential impact of school closures on the estimated . million children without access to the internet,  Gavin Williamson confirmed that just like in Marchaposs lockdown those who cannot access classes from home can attend school. Schools remain open throughout the lockdown for vulnerable children and the children of key workers. Conservative chair of the Education Committee Robert Halfon raised concerns about the “digital ide”. He said: “I strongly welcome the Government’s laptop scheme but we know that there still will be, possibly, hundreds of thousands of people on the wrong side of the digital ide. “Can he confirm that those students who just don’t have internet connection or computers at home will be able to go to school alongside children of critical workers  Referring to last year’s lockdown, Mr Williamson replied: “Children who didn’t have access to digital devices were able to access education in that school and that is the same standard and same guidance that we are issuing today as well. “We’ll be doing everything that we can do to ensure that children are not left behind.” Technology firms have pledged to work with the Government to ensure schoolchildren are able to adequately study remotely after coming under pressure to improve access to data and devices during England’s latest lockdown. The Government has said that more than one million laptops and tablets will be provided to pupils by the end of the academic year to help with remote study, and previously launched a scheme to provide subsidised mobile data to those who need it. But as schools close to most pupils under the latest lockdown restrictions announced on Monday, fresh concerns have been raised about a digital ide among pupils, with many unable to access or afford mobile devices or an adequate broadband connection, and technology firms being urged to do more to make data and devices available to those unable to afford to take part in remote learning.

But since last March I have looked after wards where all the patients have Covid- for months on end. Iaposve never seen anything like it. Total UK Covid deaths hit , this week but many more infected people end up in hospital, get sick in care homes or have a rough few weeks at home. On call for emergency admissions, as I was this week, around half the patients I admit are sick due to Covid. Right now, a quarter of our beds are filled by Covid patients and our Intensive Care Units and High Dependency Units, have nearly doubled in size to cope with the surge in demand. The current peak is already as high as it was in April and the models suggest it will worsen through January. I have never seen so many patients needing so much oxygen for so long and while I’m very used to looking after seriously ill and dying patients, the sheer number has been relentless. One morning in April I saw five die within around  minutes. Hearing some people say it is “just a cold” or “just like a normal flu season” beggars belief for NHS staff dealing with this disease every day. Every second patient I saw yesterday on call, or on my ward this morning, had severe breathlessness from Covid-pneumonia that would take days to get over. Many of the others are confused or weak or dehydrated or have serious stomach upsets. Some deteriorate very rapidly and need additional help to breathe. For others, sadly, especially the older and frail or those with underlying lung and heart conditions or cancer it can be the last straw. With visiting and travel restrictions in place, doctors and nurses who’d prefer to speak with scared and upset patients’ relatives in person, and let them be with their loved one, spend a lot of time on distressing bad news phone calls. NHS friends and colleagues have died from Covid caught at work, or lost their own parents to it. While others have been advised to stay at home, we come into work surrounded by risk of infection. Many other NHS clinical staff have been hospitalised or are still suffering the effects of “long Covid”. Others are off sick or self-isolating – putting further pressure on the ones still at work. Some people arenapost happy about the lockdowns, the school closures, the behavioural restrictions and the mask wearing. I understand that. We’re all sick of it. We should take concerns about jobs, the economy and the impacts on health seriously. But some take this further by trying to tell us that the pressures on the NHS or the death rates are exaggerated. Walk a mile in the shoes of acute hospital staff, see what we see, look at the data and at least some of them would change their minds. One view doing the rounds from people who think we’ve gone too far in our Covid measures is that the virus only kills the old or the sick. So we just protect them better and “let the rest of us get on with our lives”.  You’ll see people arguing that less than  people under  with no existing medical conditions have been killed. Dig a bit deeper and you’ll see how daft this argument is. For starters, there are  million people over  in the UK, including . million over . That could be you, your parents, friends or family. Many are still very active and make a huge contribution as parents, grandparents, volunteers, employees and unpaid carers. Even the most frail are humans with human rights. Should we just write them off  Second, those people with “pre-existing conditions” - including those in their s, s and s - are not all people who would have died anyway. Covid takes years off their le expectancy. Those conditions arenapost just dementia or terminal cancer, but include diabetes, high blood pressure, asthma heart and kidney disease that people live and often work with for many years. Millions of people live with such conditions.

Parents have been going without food to pay for internet use, fearing their child is falling behind, a school boss has revealed. Charities, head teachers and councils are asking the Government to give more help. Internet providers are being urged to waive fees and data caps for disadvantaged families. Linda Heiden, boss of voluntary group Lambeth TechAid in South London, said the Government’s provision of laptops is “a joke”.  She called the problems a “national scandal” and described the demand for laptops and wi-fi access as “overwhelming”. Ms Heiden said: “I’m outraged the Government hasn’t done more. We’ve had a whole year, it’s been obvious this is coming. Their promises have amounted to nothing. “We are letting this whole generation down. Parents and children are despairing. They are stuck at home without access.” The Department for Education insists schools are “well prepared to deliver remote education”, with , laptops and tablets given to schools last year and a further , this week. Greenwood Academies Trust, with  schools in the Midlands and the east of England, received laptops from the Government, but chief executive Wayne Norrie said they need more help as a third of their , pupils are without laptops. He added: “Many parents don’t have broadband contracts. They are on zero-hours contracts and don’t have good enough credit. “A lot of our children are in small houses with multiple children and there isn’t the space to work. Our families are getting poorer and the stress and the pressure our families are under is increasing. Some of our parents have gone without food to help their children.  “One of the parents had to decideshe was going to eat or get some data to help her children. “We stepped in once we realised what was happening.” Imran Hussain, director of policy and campaigns at Action For Children, said the third national lockdown “risks causing irreparable damage to the le chances” of hundreds of thousands of children. He added: “The added costs of home learning, including laptops and internet access, were one of the main reasons families needed crisis grants from us last year.” Ofcom figures suggest between . million and . million children in the UKdo not have home access to a laptop, desktop or tablet. On Tuesday there was growing pressure on tech firms to provide more free data for disadvantaged kids.  Labour leader Keir Starmer said: “Data is a big problem. “Everybody needs to try and make this work, and that includes the companies that can take away the charging for data.” He later praised mobile network Three after it announced it will give free unlimited data to disadvantaged kids in England.BT works with the DfE on a scheme that provides poor children with extra mobile data each month. Mary Bousted, general secretary of the National Education Union, said the PM should push network operators to make data more affordable. The BBC has ann­ou­n­ced it will provide the “biggest education offer in its history”. From Monday, CBBC will provide three hours of primary school programming, while BBC will support GCSE pupils through at least two hours of programming each weekday.

But the proposals to sell Baden-Powell House – named after the movementaposs found Robert Baden-Powell – and the -acre campsite Downe Scout Adventures in Kent, have prompted calls for the Government to intervene. Labour MP Gareth Thomas, a former Business Minister, said other organisations helping youngsters received millions of pounds from taxpayers. He added: “The Scout Association is rightly a much-loved national institution and I hope ministers will meet as a matter of urgency with the Scout Association to help them stave off their Covid-related financial troubles. “Given the money ministers find to support similar organisations, like the National Citizen Service and the Army and Navy Cadets, it is only right that they should help the Scouts to avoid axing so many jobs and being forced to sell off their iconic former headquarters in central London, Baden-Powell House, and a much-loved, -acre campsite that has been dedicated to scouting for almost  years, into private hands.” In   the Ministry of Defence gave Britainaposs Cadet Forces “approximately £million”, according to parliamentary records.

It demanded extra help for people who cannot work from home but are ordered into quarantine to help curb the spread of coronavirus. Currently they can receive a one-off £ payment. A survey of , people found a fthof workers who have been forced to self-isolate, but unable to work at home, have received no sick payat all. It also found two in five workers feared they would have to go into debt or arrears on their billstheir income dropped to £ a week – the current level of statutory sick pay. TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: “The Government must do everything possible to slow down the spiralling rise in Covid- cases. “With the virus becoming more infectious, it’s more important than ever that people self-isolate when they develop symptoms. “But the lack of decent sick pay is undermining Britain’s public health effort and is forcing workers to choose between doing the right thing and being plunged into hardship. “Ministers must stop turning a blind eye to this problem and raise sick pay to at least the Real Living Wage of £ a week, and they must ensure that everyone has access to it.” By law, people must shut themselves awaythey are “pinged” by the NHS test and Trace app as having come into close contact with someone who tests positive or they test positive themselves.They should also self-isolatethey have any symptoms of the disease, are waiting for a coronavirus test result,someone they live with has symptoms or tests positive, orsomeone in their support bubble has symptoms or has tested positive. The TUC also called for an overhaul of outdated workplace safety rules to protect essential workers. Guidance for employers have not been fully updated since March  - despite advances in the scientic understanding of the virus.

A third national lockdown has once again left many people isolated and alone. While this is a dark time for the country we are not without hope. The path back to a normal le, where we no longer live under the bleak clouds of Covid, lies through the vaccination programme. Ensuring everyone gets the vaccine requires a huge national effort. That is why the Mirror has joined forces with the Labour Party and the TUC to urge people to volunteer to help the NHS. Together we can amass a grassroots army that will make sure the vaccine can be rolled out to every town, village and city of Britain. This is a race against time. We would like to have confidence in the Government’s ability to meet its target of dispensing  million jabs by mid February. But since the outbreak first struck we have become wearily familiar with Boris Johnson repeatedly over-promising and under-delivering. Ministers failed to place a protective ring around care homes, failed to provide protective kit to frontline staff and failed to test in sufficient numbers. We could stand by and watch them fail again. But it is all our interests that the vaccination programme succeeds.

Olivia Smith, , disappeared in the night leaving her mum to discover a letter on Tuesday morning claiming she had broken up with her boyfriend and was heading to Halax, West Yorkshire, to sort myself out for some time. But mum Samantha Smith, whose family lives in Harwich, Essex, suspects it is to cover her tracks and that Olivia has fled with the boy, who is also believed to be missing. She had been dating the -year-old for three months but Samantha, , said both she and Oliviaaposs dad had urged her to split up with the lad.

What a terrible example to set your child. Instead of teaching him that we must all act together, for other people, for society, for the future generation, he was dragged along in the freezing cold to watch his dad punished for doing what is clearly the wrong thing. The news that these dangerous, selfish fools – and other rule-breakers like them – are going to face consequences couldn’t have come at a better time. This isn’t just the right thing legally, it’s the right thing for the morale of the country.

Every single restriction flouter makes the sacrices everybody  is suffering pointless.It’s been infuriating for those who have stuck to the rules to see others doing as they please and getting away with it.

Mrs Lee, , and her husband, Alan, , a former electrical engineer, had received the call to head to Clitheroe Health Centre only on Tuesday afternoon. Less than  hours later they were celebrating after being given the Pfizer  BioNTech vaccine within a few minutes of each other. A -minute wait inside the building and then they were given the all-clear to go home and await the top-up jab – most likely in about  weeks’ time.How do you think the vaccine rollout effort is going  Share your views in the comments below... The World Health Organization has refused to give its blessing to Britain’s plan to space the two doses of Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine by more than a month. Officials in the UK have decided to use all available doses of the Pfizer BioNTech jab, which was the first to be approved, to get a single dose to as many people as possible. In the process they will leave people waiting up to  weeks for their second jab. The WHO said governments should be giving people their second dose within  to  days of having the first, to make sure the vaccine works long-term.  But it did not attack Britain’s decision not to do this, admitting the Government had been forced to make a dficult decision because of spiralling infections and deaths in recent weeks. Julia and Alan, who live in nearby Whalley, have spent most of the past year painstakingly trying to avoid coronavirus while all the time childminding their grandson, Daniel, now  months. “Overall, I think we feel a great sense of relief,” said Mr Lee. “They say thatyou’ve had the first vaccination and then get symptoms it won’t be so severe.  “That gives us hope for the future – and I imagine millions of other people will feel the same. It’s a fantastic step forward for all of us”. The Lees were among scores of pensioners and care home staff to be vaccinated in a slick, military-style operation overseen by medics and aided by volunteers from two local Rotary clubs. Bill Honeywell, , a local estate agent and past president of Clitheroe Rotary, was first to brave the sub-zero temperatures, arriving just before am to supervise a handful of other volunteers.  Thirty of these are fellow Rotarians, another  made up of local people who just want to chip in and help. Bill has organised them into shts so that a group of them are always on hand to marshal cars and help guide often frail pensioners in from the cold. “They’re just so grateful to be here,” said Bill. “A lot of them haven’t been out for maybe  months, so it’s a thrill just to be out in the open. “For them to be able to go away smiling after having the jab is a joy to behold. Their relatives are all incredibly relieved and thankful. We’ve had so many tins of biscuits dropped off as thank-yous that we’re going to pile on the pounds!” Despite requests from the health centre simply to arrive on time, a number have been turning up early – “just because they’re from a generation that likes to be punctual”.  They’ve also seen it as an occasion to dress up smartly for the doctor or nurse who administers the jab. “It feels such a privilege to be involved, and we’ll be here for as long as we’re needed. The quicker we can get the vaccine into people’s arms the better”. Wednesday’s operation was geared around the time of the vaccine’s arrival. No one at the health centre was quite sure when that would be, so appointments for the elderly had only been set from pm.  The two precious boxes containing the vials were dropped off by courier at .am. Their arrival triggered a chain reaction throughout the health centre. Dr Russell Robb, clinical director of the Ribblesdale Primary Care Network, was standing by to receive the vaccine. He signed for the packages before quickly carrying them to a fridge in the preparation room. Elsewhere in the health centre receptionists and admin staff began a flurry of calls to bring in more recipients. The first to be booked in were staff at local care homes who had already been put on standby.  And because the vaccine had arrived relatively early, staff were able to book in yet more pensioners for appointments starting at around am. In the preparation room, Dr Robb set about the delicate process of getting the vials ready for the vaccinations. Conventionally there are five vaccinations for each vial. But Clitheroe’s practitioners have picked up on the experience of others to raise that figure to six. Which means more people being vaccinated in a single day. The increase from five to six means that the health centre’s medics can administer , doses in a day rather than . And a busier sht for the staff on reception. They all know they have a total of three-and-a-half days to use this latest delivery.  Dr Robb’s sons, Fred, nine, and Arthur, five, have got used to his - hour weeks during the darkest days of the pandemic. But while they tell their friends that “Dad’s going out to solve Covid”, the reality is that he went on a specialist course on how to prepare and then to administer the vaccine. Those turning up to be vaccinated also come from satellite health centres in Whalley and Slaidburn.  Dr Robb, a one-time lieutenant in the Territorial Army, said: “I just feel very fortunate to be in a position where I can help this community. The faster we can get back to some kind of normality the faster we can tackle other issues we’ve not had time for”. He added: “There’s a real energy here to try to make sure we use the vaccine in a timely manner – a real go-get attitude. “I’m hoping that all our patients from  and older will have had a first vaccination by the end of May. It will be sooner than thatwe can get supplies.”  Dr Robb’s team have drawn up a reserve list of front-line staff to get the vaccine rather than see any of it going to waste. These include local teachers, firefighters, police, ambulance crews, dentists and clinical pharmacists. On Saturday he is planning to have every care home resident in the catchment area – just under  of them given a vaccination he hopes will prolong their lives. Anita Sorrell, , an activities coordinator at the local Abbeyfield House care home in Low Moor, Clitheroe, was among the first to be vaccinated on Wednesday. “I didn’t feel a thing,” she said as she waited the required  minutes to check for any adverse effect. “I feel very privileged to be able to have it. I’d only just got to work this morning when the health centre rang. It’s reassuring to me, but also to the residents. It gives them so much hope – especially now there’s another lockdown to get through”. Outside, Tony Perry, , had just helped a woman of  towards the temporary entrance at the back of the health centre.

Right at the beginning of  the Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced their plans to step back as senior royals. They said they would become financially independent and split their time between the UK and North America. In the following year, Harry, Meghan and baby Archie found themselves a home in Calornia and have remained in the US throughout the pandemic. At the end of December they debuted their podcast Archewell Audio, which they made as part of a reported £million deal with Spoty. While the royal coupleaposs plans to stand on their own two feet appear to be going well, an emotional as well as physical gap remains between them and the rest of the Firm. According to one royal insider, Harry and Meghan stick by their decision to branch out from the Royal Family.Despite everything that has been going on this year, they don’t regret their move to the US, the source told People.They love that they are able to focus on projects and causes that are important to them. Another source explained how big a move shedding the royal shackles had been for the couple.  Meghan and Harry took a huge leap of faith to embark on their new le, they said. While the Duke and Duchess may be in a better place, their position in the Royal Family is not nailed on. After the details were finally worked out last January, the couple were given a  month trial period to see how everything would go - which is due to expire soon. However, The Mirroraposs royal editor Russell Myers believes the couple may ask for an extension as their plans were delayed due to the Covid- pandemic.

This meant that it was allowed to stay open and residents could visit it in a safe, socially distanced manner.  “For many residents, the pub is associated with a lot of positive memories from their younger years, from their first-ever drink to countless hearty meals with family or friends, and everything in between.” He added. “The Chandler Arms’ opening was a huge success and residents left with a smile on their face. “Ironically, it turns out we’re the only pub in the UK to be unaffected by the tier restrictions, so we’re looking forward to our next pub night.” "},{"url":null,"title":"pimlico pusher shoulder barged pensioner","story":"News‘Pimlico Pusher shoulder barged pensioner toward oncoming bus after Tesco rowAmelia Doris, , fled the scene with two children as the victim, Linda Lancaster, only just avoided being hit by the bus in posh Pimlico, central LondonmirrorShareCommentsByTony Palmer:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video pimlico-pusher-shoves-woman-moving-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Ian Green, the Chief Executive of leading HIV and sexual health charity Terrence Higgins Trust, spoke to The Mirror last month about the continued impact of the late Princess Diana’s work in fighting HIV AIDS through her son Prince Harry.Green said: “I was privileged to meet the Princess a couple of times, not in relation to Terrence Higgins Trust, but other charities. And what I noticed about her was how genuine she was, how that she would pin people in authority to making commitments but in a really disarming way. And I certainly see that within Prince Harry as well.” The Terrence Higgins Chief Executive also spoke about the importance of Prince Harry’s own actions in tackling testing for HIV. He revealed: “I mean, heaposs indicated, when I first met him about three, three or four years ago now, that HIV was one of his real passions, and one of the main causes he was going to focus on, and he certainly kept his promise. And when he took an HIV test, publicly, there was a % increase in orders for HIV self-testing kits, on our websites. And he said very publicly, that everybody should know their status. “Becausesomebody is HIV positive and gets on treatment, their outcomes are good now. So I think heaposs done a huge amount to encourage people to get tested, but also continue to chip away at the stigma as his mother did. So I think thereaposs there are these huge similarities between the two of them.”Despite stepping down as a senior member of the Royal Family alongside his we Meghan, Duchess of Sussex earlier this year, Green says that the Duke of Sussex remains focused on issues surrounding HIV AIDS.“He remains passionate and committed to HIV as a cause,” noted Green. “Along with our colleagues at Elton John AIDS Foundation and the National AIDS Trust, we published the HIV commission report a couple of weeks ago, more day to day, setting out what needs to be done to end new HIV transmissions in the country by , and the Prince publicly endorsed it and made a public statement. “So heaposs still active.

Yet almost four years on, the country is filled with more hate, death and destruction that has left it unrecognisable to the one I arrived in almost eight years ago. Amid of backdrop of Trump’s Tsunami of untruths, I’ve born witness to some of the most shameful events ever to take place in a supposed civilised society. They say journalism is the first rough draft of history, but only time will tell what will be taught in US high schools in  years time. Whether it will be America’s biggest ever mass shooting in Las Vegas, travelling to see a US leader toady up to murderous dictators, immigrant children being held in cages while separated from their parents, withdrawing from the fight against climate change or emboldening the rise of the deadly far-right, the list is endless. The writing was on the White House walls no sooner had Trump, and First Lady Melania moved in. Ever since, amid made-up crowd sizes, an obsession with Barack Obama, and “alternative facts,” the Trump presidency has been a factory of hoods from the get-go. It has churned out distortions, deceptions, conspiracy theories and brazen lies at a production-line pace that has fuelled an industry of fact-checkers. The firing of former FBI director James Comey was more signicant than most could have thought. During a dinner with his new boss, he was asked by Trump whether he would pledge loyalty to him.  Comey avoided making such a promise explaining his role was to serve the American people. Months later, he was fired without being told. Above all, it illustrated Trump’s disregard for the rule of law that has since seen him turn the US Department of Justice into his own legal firm. To then see Trump in July  side with Vladimir Putin against the FBI contradicting his own US intelligence agencies who said there had been Russian interference in the  election, was jaw-dropping. If allies like the UK had not been put on notice before the Helsinki summit over where the US leader’s feelings lay at that point they did. He single handily shattered America’s global image. Only the month before I had travelled to Singapore to see Trump meet with North Korean despot Kim Jong Un on the hope of striking a deal to de-escalate the rogue nation’s proleration of nuclear weapons. What followed was an abject failure on the Trump administration’s part, yet the President still crowed about how he “fell in love” with the murderous dictator. If the problems were not bad enough on a world stage, domestically they were worse. Shortly his inauguration, the simmering rise of the white nationalism emboldened under his leadership boiled over.  During a ‘Unite the Right Rally’ in August  members of the alt-right, neo-Confederates, neo-fascists, white nationalists, neo-Nazis, the KKK and ious right-wing militias marched on Charlottesville, Virginia. The event quickly turned violent when Hitler-loving James Field ran over  counter-protestors killing Heather Heyer. As the country became a tinder box of racial ide, Trump initially refused to comment, but I watched in New York as he then said there were “very fine people on both sides”. It was the first of many instances of his apparent support for the far-right that, along with the radical left, has seen many of America’s cities more recently go up in flames. The fact that now no one blinks an eye when the leader of the free is called a “racist”, should be of enormous concern to us all.  It was never more apparent in the wake of George Floyd’s death in May this year - killed after white cop Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for almost nine minutes. As I stood watching the city of Minneapolis looted and torched, it was a time for the President to show leadership - to bring together a country that was clearly hurt and in turmoil. Instead, Trump added fuel to the already burning fire pitting Black Lives Matter protestors against police and more shamefully white nationalist groups. Yet despite high-profile incidents of police violence against Black Americans in recent months, including the killing of Floyd and the shooting of Jacob Blake sparking nationwide protests, renewed calls for the removal of Confederate symbols and public condemnations of systemic racism from lawmakers, corporations, sports leagues and others, recent research shows adult white America feels largely unmoved.  Americans are sceptical the current moment of racial reckoning will lead to major changes in the States, according to a new Pew Research Centre survey. They found: “The public is about evenly split on whether the increased focus on issues of race and racial inequality in the country in the past three months will lead to major policy changes to address racial inequality - % say it will and % say it will not. “A sizable sharesay this will not lead to changes that will improve the lives of Black people. And while a majority say the heightened attention to racial issues represents a change in the way most Americans think about these issues, just % say this represents a major change.” They found overall, % of U.S. adults now say the country hasn’t gone far enough when it comes to Black people having equal rights with White people but “White Americans are virtually unchanged”.  But it’s not just races that Trump, who became only the third president ever to be impeached, ides, its gender too. We should have all known. While campaigning for the White House, he was heard on tape saying of women it was perfectly acceptable to “Grab ‘em by the p****. You can do anything.” Yet still, America’s females voted for him in their millions. He has repeatedly, even during this campaign, belittled women none more so than the two dozen who have accused him of sexual impropriety and even rape. In response to writer E. Jean Carroll’s claim, he sexually assaulted her in a dressing room at a Manhattan department store in the mid-s he simply replied: “She’s not my type”.  Yet despite the accusations, the evangelicals of America still embrace him as he claims to be a good Christian - “a man of God” - using the Bible as a prop for any photo opportunity. Even after his alleged  marital affair with adult film star Stormy Daniels came to light paying her off to keep her silent, that was ok with the church because he was now a “changed person”. If it were left to Trump, the Bible would no doubt read: “Let he who has bedded a porn star just after the birth of his fth child with his third we cast the first stone.” He also pushed for transgender servicemen and women - who unlike his dodge of the Vietnam draft were prepared to put their lives on the line for American freedoms, to be banned from the military. It’s challenging to know which of Trump’s policies have been for the greater good. There is no doubt he had continued to build on the economy inherited from Barack Obama and almost wiped ISIS from the earth. Still, his recent handling of the pandemic will go down as one of the worst disasters in US history.

The picture tweeted by New York Post reporter Steven Nelson shows the man posing with a fur hat and a painted face after Republican protesters managed to swarm the historic building. QAnon is a baseless conspiracy theory that President Trump is secretly fighting a cabal of child-sex predators that includes prominent Democrats, Hollywood elites and “deep state” allies. It comes as the US Capitol was put on lockdown after protesters swarmed the historic building during a House of Congress vote confirming President-elect Joe Bidenaposs electoral win.  Violent scenes are unfolding in the heart of Washington DC in what has been described as close to a coup attempt this country has ever seen. Senators are being evacuated from the building, the meeting place of the United States Congress, after politicians were forced to shelter in their offices with police outside overwhelmed by hundreds of rioters.  Today the the US Congress and Senate were confirming the Electoral College votes from the  presidential election, won by Biden.The breach has forced a delay in the constitutional process to affirm Bidenaposs victory in the November election, after Trump urged his supporters to travel to Washington to protest over Congressapos formal approval of the win. Huff Post reporter Igor Bobic tweeted several dozen protesters are roaming through the halls, yelling, Where are they  Some were also in the visitorsapos galleries. He wrote: They’re in the chamber. One is up on the dais yelling aposTrump won that election!apos This is insane. CNN is reporting a woman is in a critical condition after being shot in the chest during skirmishes between police and Trump supporters. While US House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy has told reporters he heard on a police officeraposs radio that shots were fired about  or  minutes ago. Mr Biden condemned the violence as he took to Twitter to say it could amount to sedition. Let me be very clear: the scenes of chaos at the Capitol do not represent who we are. What we are seeing is a small number of extremists dedicated to lawlessness. This is not dissent, itaposs disorder. It borders on sedition, and it must end. Now.

The secretive state adopted the new measures in December, fearing that its teenage citizens were growing too comfortable with words popular in neighbouring South Korea. Now the authorities will reportedly inspect citizens’ phones, hunting for any use of banned expressions in private messages. Those caught will be suspected of flouting the ban on South Korean TV and could face the gulag. Talking to Rimjingang, a Japan-based magazine focused on the dictatorship, one North Korean parent revealed the sort of harmless slang that could land kids in hot water. The parent said: “The target of the crackdown is the text messages on cell phones. “It has been a while since South Korean dramas first came to North Korea, right “Since cell phones have become common recently, young people are using South Korean phrases in their text messages. “For example, almost all young people are using ‘saranghaeyeong’ , ‘chal-ka’ , ‘bye-bye,’ and ‘ty’in their texts. “If there are any expressions in the text messages that are not used in North Korea, the owner of the device will be suspected of watching South Korean dramas and interrogated. “Inspectors also check the text messages for any rumours or complaints about dficulties due to the Covid- pandemic. “However, students and young people are clever, so they are very careful to delete their text messages as soon as possible after sending them.” A three-page document marked apostop secretapos, obtained by Rimjingang, sheds more light on the ban. In the document, Kim Jong-un reportedly brands South Korea a apospuppetapos of the USA and names more banned words. He says: “We must strongly eradicate the [South Korean] ‘puppet words’ and ‘puppet style’ from our society. In the past, I have repeatedly warned against the phenomenon of young men and women who are not blood relatives using the ‘puppet’s language’ to refer to each other. “Such as ‘oppa’and ‘dong-saeng’ . “However, this phenomenon has not yet disappeared among some young people. “This is a typical example of the perverted ‘puppet language’ and ‘puppet style’ that is widespread in our society.” Greg Scarlatoiu, director of the Washington DC-based Committee for Human Rights in North Korea, said the Kim regime clearly felt threatened by South Korea’s growing apossoft power.apos "},{"url":null,"title":"woman tells boy 9 go","story":"NewsWoman tells boy, , go back to your country in vile racist rant on busVideo shows the woman telling the Ireland-born boy - whose mum is from Brazil - \"youre not Irish\" until the Dublin Bus driver driver kicks her off and forces her to continue her journey on footmirrorShareCommentsByDarragh BerryMark Corcoran:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video racist-woman-bus-shouts-go-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Video shows the unruly woman verbally abusing the boy and his mother, originally from Brazil, on board a bus in Dublin until she was kicked off by a hero driver. At one point, the woman tells the Ireland-born youngster, who was wearing a green jacket and hat, youaposre not Irish. The woman, who wasnapost wearing a face mask despite coronavirus rules, and another passenger were told to leave the bus and continue the rest of their journey on foot. The mum, who has been living in Ireland for  years and asked to remain anonymous, told DublinLive that her son asked her after the incident: They told me to take the green off me, am I not Irish  He was reading something aloud about coronavirus when the woman launched her tirade on Monday afternoon. She said it was a stressful and horrible start to their new year, and itaposs not the first time she has been verbally abused due to her background. She said: I was with my son. We got on the bus. He had a loud tone of voice, he was a reading an advert on the bus about coronavirus. There were not many people on the bus, so everybody could hear what he was reading.  The woman wearing a mask who was sitting on the second last seat on the row, started looking back and saying aposwhat are you saying about coronavirus apos. And when they are looking back, they are looking at my son, they are focusing all their attention on him and directing all the speech at my son who is only a child, he is only nine. The woman continued to ask the same question as the situation escalated. The boyaposs mum said: She was saying aposthis is a serious issue, people are dying around the world and youaposre making a joke about itapos - but he wasnapost making a joke, he was reading facts on the advert. Then the woman at the very end of the row, who wasnapost wearing a mask, started saying aposgo back to your home country, take the green off your clothesapos because my son was wearing a green jacket and hat. aposYouaposre not Irish, youaposre not Irishapos she kept saying, aposgo back to your home countryapos. But at the next bus stop, the bus driver stopped and opened the door and went over to the pair as you can see in the video and just said aposoff the bus, off the busapos and demanded that they leave. I remained quiet the whole time because I was scared thatI reacted things would have escalated. The mum feared her son would be traumatised. She has felt angry and sad following the incident. She added: But my son was born here, Ireland is our home. He kept saying, aposbut she asked me to take the green off saying that I wasnapost Irish, that was not niceapos.

She has travelled and trekked throughout the world but now lives in Argyll amongst the scenery she loves. www.heatheryheightsDuring wintry weather and shorter days it can be tricky fitting in longer walks and time for exploring the outdoors.What is fantastic about Knapdale and Kintyre is that we only have to go a short distance to gain truly spectacular views. The three walks in this edition y from relatively short, using tracks and paths to the lovely viewpoint of Castle Dounie, to challenging, where the terrain is tough underfoot and good route finding skills are required. All three start at Crinan harbour before climbing up through oak and birch woods to gain open vistas with views to Jura, Scarba and Mull. The convoluted ridge walks are rugged and wild, the steep sides sweeping down to the Sound of Jura where tides race and swirl. If you are lucky you may see pods of dolphins or even whales.. At the car park a signboard shows the Crinan Trail. This is the shorter of the routes but all three start and finish together. Leave the car park and turn left. Keeping to the road by the shore you will see a trail marker post ahead leading you briefly along the shore before the path heads into oak woods. After m the path bends sharply left. To the right a faint trail heads west towards the Sailor’s Grave but your route starts its steep muddy ascent to the forestry road above.. On reaching the road turn right, after m you will reach a bench and the first junction to your left. Here you have a choice either come back from the track ahead or to your left. All routes can be undertaken in either direction. I suggest for the longer routes you go straight on and for the Crinan Trail you go left.. For the Crinan Trail follow the waymark posts and arrows. After .km the route turns right onto a path and winds up and down with glimpses of views to come. Turn left at a sign for a viewpoint. This will take you up to the knoll atop which the remains of Castle Dounie, a prehistoric dun, command spectacular views over the sound towards the Gulf of Corryvreckan. There it is said the Cailleach Bheur, a giant witch, once washed her plaid in its whirlpools. Enjoy the vista before ing down to the junction and turn left. The path now meanders down to the forestry road. Turn right and head north round the coast above Adnoe Point and back to your path down to Crinan harbour.. For the longer walks, go straight ahead at the bench . Follow the track for nearly km, which leads you round a couple of hairpin bends and above Adnoe Point, before turning south. Keep your eyes open for the waymark posts and turn left onto a path. Head uphill for m. At the viewpoint sign turn right up to Castle Dounie and enjoy. To your south is the ridge that leads to Creag Mhor.. Immediately after dropping from Castle Dounie you will see a broken down wall on your right. Follow this for a short distance until you can start to work your way up onto the ridge to your right, by a couple of birch trees with coners on the skyline above. The ridge walk is convoluted, airy, rough and summits numerous lumps and bumps with fantastic views. Keep to the crest or east side as the drop-offs to the west are impressive but not to be dallied with. The highest rocky bump of Creag Mhor is parallel to the north end of the rocks offshore.. After  minutes of knobbly and exposed ridge walking #you do not fancy tackling navigation along walls in woods # this is now the time to keep an eye out for an obvious wide firebreakin the trees, below to your left. This leads you at a ° angle straight to a forestry track in the valley below. To check you have the right point look across from the firebreak and you should see a wall continue the line on the other side. Head down the firebreak to the track and turn left. This will take you back to the junction by the bench where you can turn right on the forest road then left todown the path to Crinan harbour.. If you wish to adventure on* and are confident with your route finding then continue south on the ridge # crossing over an old wall not on the map # to where it suddenly drops to a tiny col with forest directly ahead. Ahead is a steep little rise with walls on it. One drops to the right but it is the one going southwest into the forest you need to follow, for the next m. Keeping the wall directly on your right, circumnavigating the odd boulder and ducking the odd branch, you will see that the deer have created quite a path and that the way is often clear. Eventually it drops you very steeply down to a stream with another wall directly ahead. Turn left, southeast, up the stream with the wall on your right # it is boggy # until you reach a quaint waterfall on your left. A small break in the wall to your right allows you to escape the trees that have fallen across the wall higher up. Continue with it on your left across a tree harvested area and up the bump ahead. You will pop out onto a track end.. Follow this short track down to the forest road below. Turn right and almost immediately turn left onto a grassy track that crosses a stream and heads east up into the forest. After m you will come to a sharp left-hand bend. Directly in front of you a wall goes steeply up into the trees. This is your route up to Bealach na Moine. It leads up slippery, mossy rock for m, over a barbed wired fence , up a very rough and eroded track for nearly m, past a spring hidden with fallen trees, then over more pleasant grass and moss to the col. This last section makes you realise why it is worth the effort as views open up east and west. Turn right over a couple of steep little hillocks on the ridge. Suddenly ahead you will see your goal, the trig point and the summit of Cnoc Reamhar, also known as Gallachoille Hill and a Marilyn to boot. It really is a fantastic view.. Toeither descend the way you came or drop down from one of the breaks in the ridge to the north end of the small lochan on the west side of the summit, and follow the faint Landover track north to the spring. Re-join your ascent route, taking care on the way down. Turn rightat the forest road it is now an easy km back to the junction with the bench. Turn right then left after m, following the path back to Crinan harbour.*You can also drop down the firebreak and turn right on the track to join the route up to Cnoc Reamhar,continuing along the ridge does not appeal.The described routes and accompanying information are there to be used as a guide and do not replace the use of map and compass and the skills required to use them. Whilst every effort is made to ensure the route is accurate at the time of going to print please be aware that track and path closures can happen at any time.

The sector in Scotland accounts for around  per cent of UK production and is worth about £ million annually.One fth of these exports go to the EU, amounting to more than , tonnes a year.This is clearly a disastrous Brexit outcome for Scottish farmers and like all other aspects of Brexit, foisted on Scotland against its will.A terrible negotiating failure on the part of the Tory government, and a devastating blow to an extremely valuable part of Scotland’s farming industry, I am sure it will not be the first damaging impact to be highlighted once the deal is fully analysed.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,The report on the Piers and Harbours Asset Management Plan and Fees and Charges –  , submitted to the Argyll and Bute Council Harbour Board meeting of December ,  makes interesting reading.At a time when budgets are tight and councils have had to make hard decisions about where to cut services, it is dficult to understand why the council budget should be used to supplement the funding of dedicated ferry infrastructure for which CMAL should be responsible.The asset management plan allocates £,, for planned marine infrastructure works for the year  , of which only £, , is devoted to multi-use facilities. The remainder, £,,, is mostly allocated to single-use ferry facilities, and a huge proportion of that is to provide overnight parking for CalMac ferriesreaders will have to make up their own minds about the merits of spending £,, for an overnight berth at Fionnphort, and £, on a feasibility study for a breakwater at Lismore.CMAL pay back around half of the £,, to the council through harbour dues for the use of council-owned piers, however, that still leaves a whopping £ million gap in the required funding.If past experience of other CMAL projects is anything to go by, the planned eight per cent increase in council harbour fees and charges up to   is not going to cover it.Fergus Gillanders, KilmelfordSir,Last year, , was challenging and, although many people like to give generously to charity at Christmas time, it may have been dficult to make a donation this festive season.It#s not too late # you can still help support the Royal National Institute of Blind Peopleby collecting and donating used stamps from cards and parcels you may have received.Your stamps will be recycled and turned into vital funds that will help RNIB support children with vision impairment.

Food and drink is a staple in households across Scotland for Hogmanay, and it is certainly something that can remain the same, even with these uncertain times.A pot of soup to bring in the bells never goes amiss, and youd be forgiven for thinking that a slow-cooked stew is something of legend at this time of year.But while many families would plan to head out for a New Years Day meal, this will not be going ahead this year.Alternatives could include trying out some new recipes at home, and having a New Years meal at home. Bake some goodies to bring in the bells with, such as traditional Scots tablet or shortbread.Zoom have lted their -minute time limit across the New Year period, so set the camera at the bottom of your table and invite however many guests youd like!First footingA tradition throughout Scotland on Hogmanay, the normal act of first footing will certainly be missed this year, but there may be a way to salvage it.Traditionally, first footing involves the first person who enters the house after midnight bringing gts. It has been adapted through the years, and some now visit neighbours with a tipple and a song before moving on to the next house.While were not allowed in other peoples houses this year, we can certainly adapt the tradition.Ask one of your household to draw the short straw and brave the cold just after midnight and emulate a first footing with your immediate bubble. Or, have a virtual first footing, and make sure to call your loved ones and wish them a Happy New Year.TelevisionAs always, there will be a raft of content available to watch on TV on Hogmanay. Therersquoll likely be old favourites including the likes of Still Game.As ever, there will be several Hogmanay specials to help us bring in the bells from the comfort of our own home. Over on BBC One, Susan Calman will be getting ready for Hogmanay  with ldquoa studio of stars.Live eventsThe events that Scotlandrsquos festive season is famed for wonrsquot be going ahead in person this year.

Naturally, this would not be the last time an IndyRef would be brought up this year.On January , the UK confirmed its first two cases of Covid-.FebruaryBy February , the forthcoming coronavirus pandemic seemed a million miles away ndash with only three cases confirmed by this point.Attention instead was on Storm Ciara ndash a powerful and long-lived cyclone which battered parts of the country with gusts of up to mph.Flooding and heavy wind caused damage to buildings and train services, and on February , a -year-old man died after falling on icy surfaces and banging his head during the storm.Another major news story to unfold in the last year was surrounding former finance secretary Derek Mackay MSP.Once tipped to become the next First Minister, the Scottish Sun revealed the now shamed politician had been pestering a -year-old schoolboy on social media.The paper reported the -year-old MSP had contacted the boy out of the blue without knowing his age the previous August, then sent him  messages over six months.MarchThen came March ndash a month that can only be described as the month coronavirus pandemic really hit home in Scotland.On March , Scotland had its first confirmed case of the virus in the NHS Tayside, followed soon after by its first death on March .By March ,  cases had been confirmed in the country, with the virus clearly beginning to spread into other health boards.The inevitable news then came ndash with all pubs, cafes and restaurants being forced to close on March , before a nationwide lockdown on March .On the same day, Alex Salmond was cleared of sexually assaulting nine woman while he was the First Minister.As the BBC reports, a jury found the former SNP leader not guilty on  of the sexual assault charges facing him, while another was found not proven.A further charge of sexually assaulting a th woman had previously been dropped by prosecutors.

And it includes nursery schools, as well as primary and secondary schools.Ms Sturgeon said: \"I want to be clear that it remains our priority to get school buildings open again for all pupils as quickly as possible and then keep them open.\"However, right now, two factors mean that it is not consistent with a safety-first approach for all children to attend school in person.\"First, the overall level of community transmission is too high. We need to get transmission down before schools can safely reopen. A period of online learning will also, in turn, help us do that.\"The second reason is that there is still signicant uncertainty about the impact of the new iant on transmission amongst young people.\"We, therefore, have to adopt a cautious approach.\"So most pupils will be learning online for at least the rest of the month.\"This decision will be reviewed on January  whether they canto school on February .Meeting people outdoorsFrom tomorrow,the rule on outdoor gatherings will change.Previously, up to six people from two households are able to meet outdoors. Given the greater transmissibility of this new iant, the Scottish Government willconsider it necessary to restrict that further.From tomorrow, a maximum of two people from up to two households will be able to meet outdoors.Children aged  and under will not be counted in that limit, and they will also be able to play outdoors in larger groups, including in organized gatherings.However, for everyone  ndash including  to -year-olds - outdoor exercise should only take place in a way which is consistent with the twopeople from twohouseholds rule.Working from homeAnyone who is able to work from home must do so.It will only be a reasonable excuse to leave your home to go to workthat work cannot be done from home.The Scottish Government are asking people and businesses to take this \"really seriously\" because the situation is at least as serious now as it was then.The law already requires many businesses in certain sectors to close in Level .Every business is being asked to look again at their operations and to make sure that every singlethat can be done by people working at home, is being done in that way.Shielding advice changesIf you were shielding and you cannot work from home, our clear advice now is that you should not go into work at all.Hospitals near capacityNicola Sturgeon confirmed that thetotal number of Covid- patients in hospital is close to its April peak.In terms of hospital beds, NHS Ayrshire and Arran is currently at % of its Covid- capacity, and three other health boards - Borders, GreaterGlasgow  Clyde and Lanarkshire - are above % of their capacity.The total number of patients in intensive care in Scotland is already above normal winter levels.

Clearly, we will stay closely involved and be seeking the best possible outcome as we have done in the past.’TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGOSpy camera scheme takes a step forwardThe group planning to set up a town centre security system in Campbeltown is considering applying to the government for funding.The Scottish Office has just made £ million available to pay for , new closed circuit television cameras to help fight crime in Scottish towns.The driving force behind Campbeltown’s proposed system, Kintyre Crime Prevention Panel, recently received an estimate for the cost of installing a system from a leading security firm. Thorne Security says it could have a system in operation for £,, less than half the amount the  previously thought it would cost.The system would include four cameras to cover Main Street, Longrow, Burnside Square and the area around Hall Street and the cross.Four special television screens at Campbeltown Police Station would allow the police to watch the pictures from the cameras. The images would be recorded on an industrial-quality video recorder at the station. The pictures could alert the police to trouble or help them trace offenders.The team from Thorne Security will be visiting Campbeltown at the end of January to demonstrate the equipment.The secretary of the , Sergeant Douglas Reid of Campbeltown police, has already contacted the Scottish Office for more details about the funding package. Sergeant Reid said: ‘The  is fully committed, following the tremendous public response, to go in as far as possible along this road.’The  is already planning to apply to other local and national bodies for contributions towards the cost of the system.The Scottish Office’s challenge competition will make funds available for groups representing local communities to bid for money to fund CCTV systems.Applicants from dferent areas will bid in competition with each other for a share of the government cash.The first town centre security camera system in Scotland was set up in Airdrie three years ago. New research shows that in the first two years after the system was set up, the crime rate plunged by  per cent.The Scottish Office says there is no evidence that crime was simply being shted to areas outwith the reach of the cameras. Instead the total amount of recorded crime actually fell.FIFTY YEARS AGOMcCartney again!Mr Paul McCartney, ex-bass guitarist with the Beatles, has recently purchased from Mr A Revie, Loch Ranachan Farm, which comprises  acres and adjoins his other farm, High Park.Mr McCartney has been spending a few days on the farm with his we and family over the festive season.One happy Rangers fanMr Crawford Morans of  Albyn Avenue, who is employed with the Ministry of Social Security, has had a good ending to the old year.

In the Clyde, however, the Board of Trade did not insist on this in respect of vessels trading exclusively within what is known as the smooth water area.This area was within an imaginary line drawn from Skipness Point to Fairlie. On the date in question, the accused conveyed a cargo from Glasgow to Tobermory via the Crinan Canal.As soon as he had left Crinan, he was in contravention of the regulations, having entered the more hazardous waters off the west coast.On behalf of the accused, an agent stated that he had traded with the Bloodhound for nearly  years. During the war, the ship had been requisitioned by the Ministry of Shipping, and under the orders of that department had been sent outside the limits of the smooth water area.The accused had naturally thought that what he had been doing during the war, when he traded to ports on Islay and the Ayrshire coast, he was free to do now.Sherf Macmaster Campbell imposed a penalty of £."},{"url":null,"title":"leader january 1 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

In the Bible, more than  times He says: #Do not be afraid# or phrases that mean this. Let us take this truth into the New Year with us.Let us all pray that soon we can say we are not afraid and what a dferent year  is.#Away, then all fears.

Food and drink is a staple in households across Scotland for Hogmanay, and it is certainly something that can remain the same, even with these uncertain times.A pot of soup to bring in the bells never goes a miss, and youd be forgiven for thinking that a slow-cooked stew is something of legend at this time of year.But while many families would plan to head out for a New Years Day meal, this will not be going ahead this year.Alternatives could include trying out some new recipes at home, and having a New Years meal at home. Bake some goodies to bring in the bells with, such as traditional Scots tablet or shortbread.Zoom have lted their -minute time limit across the New Year period, so set the camera at the bottom of your table and invite however many guests youd like!A tradition throughout Scotland on Hogmanay, the normal act of first footing will certainly be missed this year, but there may be a way to salvage it.Traditionally, first footing involves the first person who enters the house after midnight bringing gts. It has been adapted through the years, and some now visit neighbours with a tipple and a song before moving on to the next house.While were not allowed in other peoples houses this year, we can certainly adapt the tradition.Ask one of your household to draw the short straw and brave the cold just after midnight and emulate a first footing with your immediate bubble. Or, have a virtual first footing, and make sure to call your loved ones and wish them a Happy New Year.As always, there will be a raft of content available to watch on TV on Hogmanay. The official TV guide has not yet been released, but therersquoll likely be old favourites including the likes of Still Game.As ever, there will be several Hogmanay specials to help us bring in the bells from the comfort of our own home.

There was heavy traffic and, needless to say, Irsquod never driven a bus before and hadnrsquot expected to at this moment either.ldquoYou mean drive the bus  I foolishly asked.ldquoThatrsquos why you are here, isnrsquot it  he replied.I was on the bus with two other learners, as well as the instructor. We had been given some rudimentary instructions by him as hersquod driven the bus into the busy city centre, but I hadnrsquot realised we would actually have to drive the bus through busy streets.That was the first time I had driven a bus. It was, of course, an assessment of my capabilities. I negotiated as best I could and quickly learned what a tail swing was, as I nearly shaved off the nose of a woman who was standing on the edge of a pavement waiting to cross the road!The gearstick felt like it had been cemented to the vehicle, making changing gears a Herculean effort, with the engine roaring as I struggled to crunch it into gear. I drove slowly and cars began honking their horns in frustration.There was a big L on the rear of the bus, but I think when people see a bus in the city centre they assume the person driving actually knows how to drive a bus!It was a stressful  minutes and, when I finally pulled over, the instructor looked at his notes shaking his head. I cannot repeat what he said, but it was a generally negative assessment with lots of adjectives.Yet I wasnrsquot written off and was told I needed six full days of lessons as a minimum before sitting my test. Against everyonersquos expectations, including mine, I passed first time.I had done it and realised one of my lersquos dreams.There was a specic reason I needed a bus driving licence: I wanted to be a driver guide and take people around Scotland on tour. My le had undergone some dramatic changes and my le ambitions had changed as a result.It wasnrsquot, of course, about money or climbing a career ladder, but about the hopeful expectation it would make me rich in experiences and give me a new angle on le.My head and heart were full of Scotlandrsquos stories, and this seemed a perfect way to use my love of history and folklore, and share my passion for the landscape that held so many personal memories for me. I felt my le was about to be transformed and indeed it was.So that day I passed my bus driving test was a day of utter joy. Although over  years ago now, I can still feel the elation.I worked for dferent tour companies at dferent times in my le over the following  years. It was something I couldto whenever I needed it. During the last period of my time as a driver guide, a transport manager called Ronnie worked miracles as he juggled my rota to fit round my very complicated childcare arrangements. I will be forever grateful to him for his understanding.Were my expectations of the job realised or did I have an over-romanticised image of it  Irsquod say a bit of both. I tried my best to showcase Scotland, but I quickly understood people travel for dferent reasons with dferent interests.But it opened a window on the world for me. I met so many people from dferent walks of le and dferent countries and cultures. It taught me so much about the way humans behave towards each other and how we handle and respond to experiences in dfering ways.We were all on mini le journeys together, usually three days, sometimes five. In this brief fleck of time, a small group of people would be together amidst the splendour, and sometimes challenging conditions, of Scotland. When connections were made, it was because of shared values, regardless of cultural dferences.I began to see the tours as a metaphor for the way we live our lives, not just in observing others but myself as well. I had never thought the job would be a lesson on the philosophy of le, but that is partly what it became for me.It revealed to me that happiness, enjoyment and appreciation is a default within us, not something to be found, bought or acquired, or even weather dependent!That now seems so obvious but it took years for me to truly understand how we can become so easily trapped in the hedonic treadmill. I know thatrsquos a fancy term, but its meaning is simple: that as we go through le, we quickly take things for granted and so seek new and higher levels of satisfaction which we believe will give us happiness. While we can get a rush of pleasure and satisfaction in new things or experiences, we soon then take those for granted as well. So the cycle continues. We become like dogs chasing our tails in pursuit of what we think will make us happy or give us a more fulfilled le.The tours taught me that appreciation is the key to this. You donrsquot have to be a tour guide to learn this lesson, of course, as we all have our lersquos experiences that teach us. But that treadmill is so easy to fall into, even when you know it offers a  dawn. It can take a conscious effort to climb out of it.That is when we need what is called a hedonic reset: another fancy term for stopping that chase of our tail and taking time to appreciate what we have. This can be done by temporarily depriving ourselves of things we take for granted and so regaining our appreciation of them.A simple example could be when we go camping. I love it, but when I get home I appreciate my bed, my shower and central heating in ways I didnrsquot before we left on our camping trip!The virus has forced a reset on all of us it has taken away many things we took for granted: travel, staying with friends, family meals, a coffee and blether with a friend, hugging loved ones, being with loved ones, browsing in a bookshop. We will all have our list.It has been heartbreaking, with devastating consequences for so many peoplersquos livelihoods and emotional wellbeing, as well as a tragic loss of le.Itrsquos an unwanted, brutal and forced reset, but the le lesson I learnt on the tours has helped me understand that appreciation is the key to resilience and getting through this as best as we can.When times relax, as they hopefully will soon, I know how much I will appreciate hugging my daughter I havenrsquot been able to hug for  months, being able to tell stories to a live audience and have a coffee with a friend in a real cafe. And travel to the places I love within my own country.Perhapsthere is any positive out of this, I hope it will be that I will never again fall into that treadmill of taking things I have for granted.So I say Happy New Year to you, and I mean it in a heartfelt way I never meant before."},{"url":null,"title":"vet-column-consider-welcoming-new-pet","story":"ONCE your new puppy or kitten has settled into your household, there are several things to consider, ensuring your new pet is kept fit and healthy.Register with your veterinary surgeon. This gives immediate reassurancea problem does arise with your pet.At Dunedin Vets, we offer free puppy and kitten checks and for all new pets as soon as you acquire them this may be carried out by telephone during these Covid- times. Lots of advice is given by vets, qualied veterinary nurses and reception staff.Everyone is thinking about vaccination against coronavirus for humans just now. Vaccination has been the major controller of lethal diseases since the process was developed by Edward Jenner centuries ago.We must vaccinate our pets to prevent several fatal conditions. Pups can be vaccinated from six weeks of age. However, vaccinating at  and  weeks of age is the new normal during this Covid- pandemic, when most vaccinations are given.Pups should be kept isolated until two weeks after the first vaccination, then limited contact with other dogs until after the second vaccine. Boosters are given annually against parvovirus, distemper, hepatitis leptospirosis and kennel cough.It is advisable to vaccinate your kitten against cat flu, feline enteritis and feline leukaemia. Two vaccines are usually given three weeks apart from nine weeks of age. Kittens should be kept isolated until one week after the second vaccine. Boosters are given annually against cat flu, feline enteritis and feline leukaemia.Rabbits can be vaccinated against myxomatosis and rabbit haemorrhagic disease , of which there are two strains. One vaccine against the two agents can be given from six weeks of age. Boosters are given annually.Everyone loves a new puppy or kitten, but please be aware of unscrupulous dealers who take advantage of the kind and loving nature of the majority of people.Recently, Kimberly Mackie visited Dunedin Vetsrsquo Tranent surgery with her new puppy Poppy. Poppy is a Jack Russell cross Chihuahua, so is a very small pup. However, Poppy arrived with diarrhoea and very dehydrated, weighing only a few hundred grams.Poppy was examined by vet Chris Monk, who immediately saw how ill little Poppy was.Mum had bought her in all good faith from a family home. It was soon discovered that Poppy had been microchipped and had a vaccination in Eire. Poppy was an import from Eire, a victim of the illegal puppy farming trade.It is so dficult for new owners to know the origin of their pup, especially when the sellers can seem so plausible. Ask to see the parents or at least the mother and other pups in the litter, although they find many ways to circumvent these questions. It is also so dficult toa puppy or kitten once you have cuddled them and instantly fallen in love.The good news is that Poppy, after fluid therapy and medications, and lots of loving care from Dunedin Vets staff and, of course, his forever mum, has made a full recovery and is developing her own special character.We must also consider other preventable conditions which our pets may be susceptible to.Most puppies and kittens are born with a roundworm infestation. Worms are passed to them before birth by their mothers and through motherrsquos milk. This is obviously not very pleasant and potentially these worms pose a risk for humans, especially children.Tapeworms are rarely a problem in puppies and kittens, although one type is actually transmitted by fleas.We recommend worming puppies and kittens at eight,  and  weeks of age with a quality wormer in tablet or liquid form, which will kill most worms.Remember, there may be no obvious signs of worm infestation.Worming should be carried out every three months for the rest of your petrsquos le.Many puppies and kittens arrive at their new home with a population of external parasites. These include fleas and mites.Fleas are passed from one animal to another. Although there are dferent types of dog and cat fleas, they donrsquot mind what they jump onto to feed!Fleas are two to three millimetres long and move quickly through the coat. Flea droppings are black and gritty, and turn reddamp cotton wool is applied to them.Fleas can transmit several diseases, cause allergies and general irritation. Fleas live on your pet, and in the house.You must use a suitable insecticide spray to destroy flea larvae, which can survive for months in the environment. Your veterinary staff can advise what is best for your pet and your home.The rabbit flea is unusual in that it doesnrsquot move very fast. They are often found along the edge of catsrsquo ears and are dficult to remove, so are called lsquostick tightrsquo fleas. Cats pick them up when hunting wild rabbits.Walking dandruff mitesare very common in puppies, kittens and bunnies. They are too small to see but occasionally skin scurf appears to move, which is actually the mites, hence the name.Mange mitesare minute parasites which bury into the skin. Some are passed from mother to young and some spread from pet to pet. Some cause intense scratching, some cause hair loss. Some can be very dficult to treat, requiring specialised anti-parasitic washes or spot on treatment.Ear mites live in the ear canals, causing irritation, lots of wax production and a smell.At Dunedin Vets, we strongly recommend taking out insurance for your pet at a young age. Many breeders will provide initial insurance cover, and many vets will offer free insurance with certain companies for a few weeks. This gives peace of mind whilst you are considering which insurance to purchase. We suggest you look for a lsquolelong coverrsquo policy so your pet will always be covered.Consider a pet health club for your new arrival.

I will set out our decisions shortly.However, I can confirm now, in summary, that we decided to introduce from midnight tonight for the duration of January, a legal requirement to stay at home except for essential purposes. This is similar to the lockdown of March last year.However, before I set out Cabinetrsquos decisions in more detail, I want to explain in some detail why they are so necessary.In the last few weeks, there have been two signicant game changers in our fight against this virus.One, the approval of vaccines, is hugely positive and offers us the way out of this pandemic.But the other - the new faster spreading iant of the virus - is a massive blow.Possibly the most simple way of explaining the challenge we face right now is to compare it to a race.In one lane we have vaccines - our job is to make sure they can run as fast as possible.Thatrsquos why the government will be doing everything we can to vaccinate people as quickly as possible. I will say more about that later.But in the other lane is the virus which - as a result of this new iant - has just learned to run much faster and has most definitely picked up pace in the last couple of weeks.To ensure that the vaccine wins the race, it is essential to speed up vaccination as far as possible.But to give it the time it needs to get ahead, we must also slow the virus down.And because it is now spreading faster, that means even tougher restrictions are necessary.The evidence is now compelling that the new iant is up to % more transmissible than previously circulating strains, and that it may add as much as . to the R number.And according to recent analysis of PCR test samples, it appears that the new iant already accounts for almost half of all new cases in Scotland.That increased and faster spread is undoubtedly driving the very serious situation we now face.Todayrsquos case numbers ndash , new cases, with % of tests being positive - illustrate the severity and urgency of the situation.No new deaths were reported today ndash because yesterday was a Sunday and registration offices were largely closed ndash but since I updated Parliament before Christmas,  deaths have been recorded in the daily figures. That again reminds us of the continuing grief this pandemic is causing.But this is not just about one dayrsquos numbers.We are now seeing a steeply rising trend of infections.Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that I am more concerned about the situation we face now than I have been at any time since March last year.In the week from  to  December, the seven day incidence of cases per , of the population increased by % - from  per , to  per ,.Test positivity has risen sharply too.The next update on the numbers of Covid patients in hospital and intensive care will be published tomorrow.I would expect these to show that, nationally, the total number of Covid patients in hospital is close to its April peak. And in some boards, the pressure is already very real.For example, in terms of hospital beds, NHS Ayrshire and Arran is currently at % of its Covid capacity, and three other health boards - Borders, Greater Glasgow  Clyde and Lanarkshire - are above % of their capacity.The number of people in intensive care is still signicantly lower than the April peak ndash which partly reflects the fact that treatment of Covid has improved signicantly since last spring.But even so, the total number of patients in intensive care in Scotland is already above normal winter levels. Indeed, all mainland health boards have now exceeded their normal intensive care unit capacity.And it is important to be clear that people who are in hospital and ICU now are likely to have been infected  days to  weeks ago.That means that these numbers reflect what the level of new cases was around  weeks ago.Given that the number of cases has increased signicantly since then, we can expect to see signicantly increased pressure on the NHS over the course of this month.Contingency plans remain in place to double and then treble ICU capacitynecessary.And the NHS Louisa Jordan continues to be available to help meet demand - as indeed it has been doing in recent months. , patients have attended there for scans and outpatient appointments nearly , NHS staff and students have been trained there and it is currently being used for Covid vaccinations.In short, NHS services are coping at present ndash although the pressure on frontline staff is considerable - but already in some areas the position is fragile, and getting more challenging.Andthe rate of increase in case numbers that we have seen in past two weeks was to continue unchecked, there would be a real risk of our NHS being overwhelmed - even with contingency plans in place.In fact, our modelling suggests that without further intervention, we could breach inpatient Covid capacity within  or  weeks.And, of course, a sharply increasing number of cases, in human terms, means many more people becoming ill and dying.All of that explains why we have to act quickly and decisively.The situation in some other parts of the UK - where case numbers are already much higher than here, and where the contribution of the new iant is already greater - shows what may lie aheadwe donrsquot.As things stand, we estimate that we are possibly about four weeks behind the position in London and the south east.The rapid acceleration in London began when it was at about  new cases a week, for every hundred thousand people. Thatrsquos the level Scotland was at a week ago.London is now seeing  new cases a week per ,. Test positivity is around %. And pressure on NHS services is acute.We have an opportunity in Scotland to avert the situation here deteriorating to that extent.But we must act quickly.The advice of our clinical advisers is clear that the increased transmissibility of the new iant means that the current level  measures may not be sufficient to bring the R number back below .It is essential that we further limit interaction between dferent households to stem the spread and bring the situation back under control, while we vaccinate more people.In short, we mustfor a period to a situation much closer to the lockdown of last March.Let me therefore set out in more detail the decisions Cabinet has reached.It is important to stress that these are not decisions taken lightly. I am acutely aware of the impact they will have and I know they will not be welcome.But they are in our judgment essential.As government, our clear and overriding duty right now is to act quickly to save lives and protect the NHS.We know that delay or preication in the face of this virus almost always makes things worse not better - evenit stems from an understandable desire that we all share to wait for more data or evidence.To turn to the decisions in detail. The decisions I will speak about a bit later on schools, let me be clear at this stage, they will apply to all parts of Scotland. However other decisions that I will outline will apply to those parts of Scotland currently at level , which of course is all of mainland Scotland, and they are effectively an enhancement to level .The island areas currently in level  will remain there for now, although we will continue to monitor them very carefully.These additional level  restrictions - essentially ing us to a position similar to the lockdown of last March - will be in place for the whole of January. We will keep them closely under review.However, I cannot at this stage rule out keeping them in place longer, nor making further changes. Nothing about this is easy.The first measure is that our fundamental advice, for everyone, is to stay at home.That is the single best way of staying safe.We consider that this stay at home message and advice is now so important that, from tomorrow, it will become law, just as it was in the lockdown last year.This means it will only be permissible to leave home for an essential purpose.This will include, for example, caring responsibilities, essential shopping, exercise and being part of an extended household.In addition, anyone who is able to work from home, must do so. It will only be a reasonable excuse to leave your home to go to work,that work cannot be done from home.We are asking people and businesses to take this really seriously ndash as we all did in March, during the first lockdown, - because the situation is at least as serious now as it was then.The law already requires many businesses in certain sectors to close in Level . We now need every business to look again at their operations, and to make sure that every singlethat can be done by people working at home, is being done in that way.Businesses have already shown a tremendous capacity to adapt during this pandemic and Irsquom very grateful to them for that - and we need them to consider their operations again, as we all work together to reduce transmissions.The Economy Secretary will be speaking to business organisations about this, including this afternoon. We will also engage with unions on these issues. And we will continue to considermore regulatory action is required.We are also providing new guidance for people who are in the shielding category.If you were shielding and you cannot work from home, our clear advice now is that you should not go into work at all.The Chief Medical Officer is writing to everyone who falls into this category, and his letter will count as a Fit Note for those who need it.Unlike the lockdown last year, the frequency of outdoor exercise is not being limited.It is important for physical and mental health that we can get outdoors for fresh air and exercise as much as possible.However, from tomorrow, the rule on outdoor gatherings will change.As of now, up to six people from two households are able to meet outdoors. Given the greater transmissibility of this new iant, we consider it necessary to restrict that further.From tomorrow, a maximum of two people from up to two households will be able to meet outdoors.Children aged  and under will not be counted in that limit, and they will also be able to play outdoors in larger groups, including in organized gatherings.However, for everyone  ndash including  to  year olds - outdoor exercise should only take place in a way which is consistent with the  people from  households rule.In addition, strict travel restrictions remain in place across Scotland. From tomorrow,you live in a level  area - as the majority of us do - you cannot leave your home except for an essential purpose. When you do go out, stay as close to home as possible and stay away from crowded places.And it remains the case ndash and let me stress this point - that no-one is allowed to travel into or out of Scotland unless it is for an essential purpose.Presiding OfficerA number of other measures will come into effect on Friday of this week.It is with real regret that we consider it necessary for places of worship to close during this period for all purposes except broadcasting a service, or conducting a funeral, wedding or civil partnership.I am well aware of how important communal worship is to people.But we believe that this restriction is necessary to reduce the risk of transmission.While up to  people will still be able to attend funeral services, wakes will not be possible during January. And a maximum of  people will be able to attend wedding and civil partnership services.Presiding OfficerI know how devastating restrictions like these are and I give an assurance that we will not keep them in place for longer than is absolutely necessary.There will also be additional measures in relation to businesses, in addition to the tightening of the essential retail definition that took effect from Boxing Day.The current  metre exemption for workplace canteens will end ndash so canteens will have to ensure that employees sit  metres or more apart, rather than  metre.The number of non-essential services which remain open will be further restricted.Premises which will need to close as a result of these changes will include, for example ski centres, showrooms of larger retailers, and clinics offering cosmetic and aesthetic procedures.I know that many businesses have already been hit by the restrictions which were put in place on Boxing Day.And of course I know that the vast majority of businesses have taken their responsibilities seriously, and have invested in Covid safety measures.In addition, the move to home working has brought challenges for workers and employers. I am hugely grateful for the way in which businesses and their staff have responded to those challenges.Grants are of course available for businesses required to close as a result of restrictions. That support is in addition to support through the UK wide furlough scheme.The Scottish Governmentrsquos financial support for businesses during the pandemic currently totals more than pound. billion.However, we will continue to assess what more the Scottish government can do ndash either in closure grants or other forms of support - to help businesses and those who work for them.We will also work with councils to ensure community and social support for those who need it, including for parents balancing work and online learning.We will confirm additional resources later this week.Presiding Officer,The final substantive issue I want to address - before giving an update on vaccination - relates to schools.We announced before Christmas that most school pupils would learn remotely ndash rather than in school ndash until Monday  January.I can confirm that we have now decided to extend that date and keep schools closed to the majority of pupils until  February. We will review this again in mid-January.The change will apply to all pupils - except vulnerable children, and children of key workers. And it includes nursery schools, as well as primary and secondary schools.There is no doubt that of all the dficult decisions we have had to take today, this was the most dficult of all and its impact is of course the most severe.The evidence to date makes clear that thanks to the hard work of school staff and pupils, schools in Scotland have been low-risk environments for Covid. We will work with our partners to ensure that remains the case.That will include ongoing work on testing in schools and discussions about when, in the context of the overall programme, it will be possible to vaccinate school staff.And I want to be clear that it remains our priority to get school buildings open again for all pupils as quickly as possible and then keep them open.However, right now, two factors mean that it is not consistent with a safety-first approach for all children to attend school in person.First, the overall level of community transmission is simply too high. We need to get transmission down before schools can safely reopen. A period of online learning will also, in turn, help us do that.The second reason is that there is still signicant uncertainty about the impact of the new iant on transmission amongst young people.We therefore have to adopt a cautious approach at this stage.So most pupils will be learning online for at least the rest of the month.We will review on  January whether they can - as we hope -to school on the  February.I know that remote learning presents signicant challenges for teachers, schools, parents and young people, and we will work to support children and parents throughout this.The Scottish Government, Education Scotland and local authorities are working together to further improve the remote learning options which are available for schools.And it is also worth highlighting that since schools ed after the summer, more than , devices ndash such as laptops ndash have been distributed to children and young people to help with remote learning. More devices are being distributed by councils on a weekly basis, and in total we expect our investment ndashwhich builds on existing local authority action - to benefit around , disadvantaged children and young people across Scotland.I also want to stress one final point.Just as the last places we ever want to close are schools and nurseries - so it is the case that schools and nurseries will be the first places we want to reopen as we re-emerge from this latest lockdown.They remain our priority.That is why we are considering whether and to what extent - consistent with our overall duty to vaccinate the most vulnerable first in line with JCVI recommendations - we can achieve vaccination of school and childcare staff as a priority. Many teachers will of course be vaccinated over coming weeks as part of the JCVI priority list.The fortnightly review will not simply be a choice between opening and closing schools - we will always seek to maximise the number of pupils we can safely get back to classrooms and nurseries.Sothe evidence tells us we can get some pupils back safely, we will do that.However ultimately, the best way of enabling more pupils tomore quickly is by reducing community transmission of the virus as much as possible.And all of us ndash by accepting and abiding by the wider restrictions I have set out today - have a part to play in achieving that.Before I leave the issue of education, let me remind the chamber that we already had plans in place for the staggeredof universities and colleges. We will be considering this week whether any further change is necessary.Presiding OfficerBefore I close today, I want to give a brief update on our current expectations around vaccine supply.The Health Secretary will give a more detailed update on vaccination in a statement the chamber next week.However, I can confirm today that well over , people have now received their first dose of the vaccine.The first doses of the Astra Zeneca vaccine are being administered today.In total, over the period to the end of January - including the more than , already administered - we expect to have access to just over , doses of vaccine. Obviously, we hope that increases.These will be split roughly equally between the Pfizer and Astra Zeneca vaccines.However, we anticipate that some of the Astra Zeneca portion will be available only in the last week of January.We do not yet have certainty on supply schedules beyond January but will keep Parliament updated as these become firmer.However, our current expectation, based on assumptions about supply and the new advice on doses being administered up to  weeks apart, rather than , is that by early May everyone over , and people under  with specic underlying conditions, will have received at least the first dose of vaccine.That is everyone who is on the JCVI priority list, and comprises more than . million people.Once everyone on the priority list has been vaccinated, we will start vaccinating the rest of the population, and will do this in parallel with completing second doses for those on the priority list.Those timetables are of course heavily dependent on vaccine supply. And for that reason, they are at this stage cautious.However, I have tasked our vaccination team with exploring and keeping under ongoing review all options to speed up the rate of vaccination and bring these timescales forward as far as possible.I am grateful for the many offers of assistance we have received and while many of them may not prove possible or practical to take up, they will be consideredThe Health Secretary will say more about all of this in her statement next week.Presiding OfficerTo conclude, this is most certainly not the new year statement I wanted to give.And I know it is a statement no one wanted to hear.But as I said at the beginning, we are now in a race between the vaccine and the virus.The Scottish government will do everything we can to speed up distribution of the vaccine.But all of us must do everything we can to slow down the spread of the virus.We can already see ndash by looking at infection rates where ndash some of what could happen here in Scotlandwe donrsquot act.To prevent that, we need to act immediately and firmly.For government, that means introducing tough measures ndash as we have done so today.And for all of us, it means sticking to the rulesIt means continuing to follow the FACTS guidanceAnd it means ndash above all ndash staying at home.That is again our central message.Stay Home. Save lives. Protect the NHS.If we do this, we give the vaccine the time it needs to get ahead and ultimately win the race.I know that the next few weeks will be incredibly dficult.Irsquom sorry to ask for further sacrices, after nine long months of them. But these sacrices are necessary.And the dference between now and last March is that with the help of vaccines, we now have confidence that these sacrices will pave the way to brighter days ahead.So ndash for everyonersquos sake and safety - please stick with it and stay at home."},{"url":null,"title":"new-lockdown-rules-scotland-covid-restrictions-explained","story":"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the new rules on Monday afternoon, asthe latest restrictions came into effect from midnight today in all Level  areas of the country andwill continue throughout the month.Speaking at Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon said: \"I can confirm now, in summary, that we decided to introduce from tomorrow, for the duration of January, a legal requirement to stay at home except for essential purposes.

Merton: the wayward truant son, whose surrealist flights of the imagination and razor-sharp wit often elevates the show into the realms of absurdist genius.Unsurprisingly, HIGNFY has come in for criticism. On the left, it has been accused of propping up the establishment, turning us into ldquogiggling couch potatoes unwilling to think too hard. Indeed, it is claimed the show unwittingly helped Boris Johnson become Prime Minister, with his several appearances allowing him to finesse his shambling posh-boy persona.In contrast, on the right, Hyslop, in particular, is often the target of much venom, whose occasional scathing diatribes have been described as humourless ldquostandard-issue BBC socialism.:Do they know the Christmas song is dead However, I find it reassuring that neither side of the fence can claim ownership of the show. Surely it means they are doing something right. It is just entertainment after all - its not obligated to change the system nor is there a risk of it doing so.But it isnrsquot without its faults ndash some episodes are better than others, and a lot depends on the right chemistry between the regular two, the host and guests. The lockdown episodes filmed via Zoom calls proved almost embarrassingly lacklustre.Sadly, the storm clouds are gathering and its future is by no means certain. Neither of the showrsquos standard bearers are getting any younger. Sometimes Paul seems jaded, while Ian can come across as grumpy. And worse still, director-general Tom Davie has vowed to tackle perceived ldquoleft-wing bias in the BBCs comedy output.But to say the show has let the Johnsons of this world off the hook is simply unfair.

It was also commended for including a system that brakes the car following a crash. The only real negative was that it could cause higher damage to other vehicles in a crash.Seat LeonThe Leon shares a  with the A and therefore scores similarly. However, it did marginally better in adult occupant protection, despite near-identical comments on injury protection. It also received a small penalty for the damage it could cause other vehicles, but otherwise received good marks for protecting passengers from injury.Volkswagen ID.Volkswagens new electric vehicle also underwent testing this year, getting full marks. It performed well in preventing injuries to its passengers, but was also noted for not causing excessive damage to the crash barrier, indicating its also quite friendly to other vehicles in a crash. The main negative was the fact that the dummy moved too far across the vehicle in the side impact test.Toyota YarisThe Yaris might be small but it scored well across the board, receiving maximum points for protecting critical body parts in the side impact test. It also gained praise for having clear information on the front airbag system, which can be disabled for rear-facing child restraints. However, an unclear manual meant it failed on the installation check for some child restraints.Honda JazzAnother small car that performed well is the Jazz, which demonstrated a stable passenger compartment in the offset frontal test. Protection of the passengers was generally good, but was rated as weak for the drivers chest. It was noted that the centre airbag protected passengers colliding with each other in a side impact.Mazda MX-Another electric car, Mazdas new MX received top marks, doing particularly well in adult occupant protection, where it scored %. The report notes that protection of passengers was strong, scoring top marks in both the side barrier test and more severe side pole impact. It was knocked for not having an advanced emergency call system or post-collision braking.Land Rover DefenderLand Rover will be pleased to learn that one of the most highly anticipated new cars of the year scored top marks in testing, despite not being outstanding in any department. Euro NCAP noted that the femur protection score was penalised, as was chest protection of the rear passenger in the full-width rigid wall test. It was also considered an aggressive partner to other vehicles in the event of a crash.Kia SorentoAnother large SUV and another five stars, the Sorento was another that didnt stand out in any particular area but did well overall. Its central airbag, whiplash protection and driver assistance were all rated highly. However, its protection of the drivers chest and right femur was rated weak, with occupant protection rated marginal in this test because structures in the dashboard could cause a risk to occupants of dferent sizes.Isuzu D-MaxThe surprise of the year was the Isuzu D-Max pick-up, which scored top marks despite competing in a segment that is not famous for highlighting safety. It received similar occupant safety comments as the Sorento in the offset frontal test, and was also penalised for how it interacts with other vehicles in a crash.

I was too caught up in my own small le to pay attention to her when I was young, which is a shame.At the same time is there a consolation in putting these events down on the page To be honest, I was sort of looking for redemption or healing to come out of writing this book. But I just never felt that! This book was dficult to make ndash it caused me a lot of sorrow. It was a trap for all my emotions. Sometimes, we make things without knowing what is motivating us exactly because we have to. I hope maybe Irsquoll feel the benefit of having done this in a few years.What comes across very strongly is your mumrsquos strength and stoicism in the face of everything.In this book I tried to create a fair, non-idealised, non-romanticised portrait of my mother.

Many will often view Scotland as nicely wrapped within a lovely box, tied with a charming tartan bow. Of course, such a positive view is not harmful, in fact, it can be beneficial.What is lacking in America is a depth of understanding about Scotland as an innovative, entrepreneurial, and progressive nation. The Biden Administration is listening and seems to understand the gt Scotland offers the world is so much more profound than to simply view it and the Scottish people as merely delightful.First Minister Sturgeon, numerous Scottish ministers and MPs representing Scotland have made important connections with U.S. leaders over the years and reinforced this message.One excellent connection the FM Sturgeon made was with then Deputy Secretary of State Blinken. It is valuable that Scotland and the United States have an existing relationship between the FM and the future Secretary of State on which to build.The U.S. Government would be wise to expand its presence in Scotland for strategic and economic reasons. Currently, the U.S. has one Foreign Service Officer based in Edinburgh who serves effectively in the U.S. Consulate as Principal Officer.A new U.S. Ambassador to the U.K. should make a tactical stroke to relocate a handful of commercial, political, and economic officer positions from London to cover regions across Scotland. Doing so will signicantly enrich the ambassadorrsquos knowledge as an advisor to President Biden and Secretary Blinken.The ambassador would better comprehend the political and economic dynamics in the U.K. and Europe, position the U.S. for the COP in Glasgow, improve the grasp of understanding of the U.S. Scottish trading relationship, and aid in forging more partnerships between U.S. and Scottish entities across sectors.Further, with a wider tactical presence, U.S. leaders will see how Scotland is leveraging sectors and offering a policy blueprint for other nations, businesses, and communities when it comes to hydrogen and net-zero policy, tech innovation, inclusion, wind-power, healthcare, human rights, le sciences, and caring for vulnerable populations.While these are dficult budget times in Scotland with an historic need to prioritize caring for those impacted by the pandemic, a fundamental international question is on the table. Should Scotland commit more resources to widen strategic relationships throughout the United States  The Scottish Office within the British Embassy in Washington, DC continues to do outstanding work. I am always amazed by how much they shoulder, lt, and achieve.Also, the broader teams in the British Embassy and British Consulates around the U.S. are an effective voice for all nations comprising the United Kingdom. Scottish interests in the U.S. are also aided by a wider community of Scottish groups, societies, organisations and advocates including Scottish Development International, Scottish Business Network, the GlobalScot network, ScotWeek, Entrepreneurial Scotland, among many other actors.Clearly this capacity is having a positive effect, but a greater potential impact is being left unrealized. Scotland must find a way to build on a strong existing foundation and invest more into scaling up in the U.S. Doing so will secure tangible benefits for Scottish enterprise, culture, trade, tourism, research, and academia at a key moment.A fresh foreign policy vision by President Biden, Vice President Harris, and the incoming team for Europe and beyond offers an opportunity for the United States and Scotland to forge modern links. Scotland can build on its own lsquospecial relationshiprsquo with the United States by launching a more assertive, strategic, and creative plan backed with more capacity building resources. And as the United States develops a renewed global approach, it can enlarge its footprint in Scotland while fully respecting and expanding its key connection with the U.K. A deeper partnership between Scotland and the U.S. is not only mutually beneficial, but valuable for the U.K., Europe, and the larger global community.Ian Houston has spent his career in Washington, DC as an international non-profit leader, a policy advocate for diplomatic engagement and global poverty alleviation, and intercultural dialogue.

Irsquove had a fondness for brussels sprouts since we had to boil a saucepan of them in my first domestic science class. It was the only lesson in this subject where I excelled. Back then, I seasoned with pepper.Today, a drizzle of olive oil turns them into the food of the gods. Thus, as I reach for a mid-morning biscuit, eyeing up the snow clouds outside and thinking of the energy required to get me through to lunch, I refuse to feel guilty. Others, however, seem hell-bent on pricking the nationrsquos conscience and turning an innocent cooked breakfast or buttered scone into a source of shame.There are many reasons to dread the start of the new year, not least the dark and cold. One unfailing, ill-timed and unnecessary scourge is the avalanche of advice doled out around January  by nutritionists and dieticians. Even worse than the tips of health professionals is the enthusiasm of former junk food addicts who, after a Damascene conversion that usually involves a near-death experience, are messianic about their new habits.My idea of weight control is whether or not I can tuck a T-shirt into my jeans after theyrsquove been in a -degree wash. The battery on my bathroom scales died years ago, since when theyrsquove been gathering dust under the bed. This is not something to boast about , but while I can face up to many things in le ndash a leaking roof, mice under the eaves, a looming taxdeadline ndash knowing how many kilos Irsquove gained is not one of them.There seems something sadistic about exhorting people to give up comfort food at precisely the time of year it was designed for. It might be fine to start January with a health kickyou live in Alice Springs or Calornia. In Achiltibuie or Crail, however, it feels cruel. When sleet is whistling around the windows, and the streets are coated in ice, the idea of following a meagre, challenging or carefully calibrated diet does not appeal.All of us know, by now, that Covid does not just love a crowd, it is also drawn to love handles. Being clinically obese is thought to raise the risk of coronavirus complications. The unfailing appearance of New Year diets, however, seems more a lestyle adjunct than a serious medical intervention. They fall into the same category as making resolutions to give up fags or booze, or to pound the pavement, clocking up steps like a hamster on a wheel. This year, however, therersquos not even the incentive of needing to be beach-ready by summer. I doubt many of us will be mentally prepared to launch ourselves into a warmer climate and inviting sea in July, evenwe are enviably lithe and toned.Obviously,I felt I was getting too heavy, Irsquod feel obliged to knuckle down and deal with it, whatever the date. It is true also that the majority of us could probably benefit from tweaking our menus around the margins. But the longest, blackest and dreariest month of the year is not the time to begin. It is counterintuitive, and possibly even self-defeating, to ask us to turn ourselves into a new and better version of ourselves, ldquothe best me I can be, when our internal clock is on perpetual snooze, coming alive only at the smell of roasted potatoes. When night descends by mid afternoon, and we have barely enough oomph to empty the dishwasher, let alone turn the kitchen into a MasterChef set, our willpower is posted missing.Perhaps I ought simply to bypass the magazine features that show vegetable slurries greener than a David Hockney landscape, or chargrilled chicken served with an acre of al dente field. Yet it is not the promise of slimness that lures me in but the ever-changing science of food. That, and the thought of the guinea pigs who allow themselves to become living laboratories. One such group is the cohort of older women cited in the German science writer Bas Kastrsquos new book, called The Diet Compass.These grandmothers were each given a muffin a day for seven weeks. One lot was baked with sunflower oil, the other with palm oil. Unsurprisingly, everyone gained weight, but those in the second category grew fattest.

If each of those does -a-day, that is .m-a-week extra vaccines that can be provided, very often to those who are hardest to reach.

It had been rolled out on all Clyde and Hebrides routes by October , with fares on routes to Shetland reduced by the Scottish Government in .With the Brexit transition period now at an end, Councillor Stockan has written to Paul Wheelhouse, minister for energy, connectivity and the islands, asking for urgent talks on introducing RET equivalent fares as soon as possible on Pentland Firth routes and for Orkney’s inter-island ferry links.“We want to engage positively with the government on this,” Councillor Stockan added. “RET equivalent fares will have a hugely beneficial impact for Orkney – reducing fares that are far higher than those on equivalent routes where in Scotland.“Ending this inequality will remove a major barrier standing in the way of Orkney’s recovery from the enormous impact the pandemic has had on our community and local economy.“I’m asking the Minister to work with us in finally rolling out RET equivalent fares for Orkney – a move critical to our economic recovery, which will have an immediate impact on the daily lives of folk in some of our most fragile communities and provide a welcome boost for our tourism businesses as we look forward with hope to a brighter .”When asked by The Orcadian for a response to the letter, a Scottish Government spokesperson said on Tuesday: “Following the st December publication by the UK Government of its guidance on implementation and operation of subsidy rules, we are working through this to understand what it means for Scottish Government subsidies, including ferries, and will discuss this with our local authority partners, including Orkney Islands Council, when we are able to discuss the implications of the new guidance.“This consideration of the new guidance will however be a complex undertaking and will take some time. For that reason we do not intend to make any immediate changes to ferries policy while the work on understanding compliance matters progresses.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This is a total of  miles that we will attempt to cover over the  days of January.#Helen explained that herself and Deborah Sutherland from the guild are taking part, and joining them are friends Tracy Hourston, Julie Garriock, Joanna Sutherland, Sarah Jessen and Sammy Wilson.Their fundraising and walking efforts got off to a great start this week already, with well over £ pounds raised and over  miles covered, with those walking enjoying fine weather.Helen explained that they are following all social distancing and Covid regulations, with folk keeping count of all the miles they are walking, so a total can be added together as they head towards their target.Donations can be made online at www.justgiving crowdfunding helen-davidson- Funds are being raised for the leboat stations in Kirkwall, Stromness and Longhope.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The building was locked down and police with guns drawn moved in as Vice President Mike Pence and lawmakers were evacuated to secure locations.National Guard troops were deployed and a citywide curfew called for shortly after dusk, as rioters continued to occupy the capital for hours.ldquoAt this hour our democracy is under unprecedented assault unlike anything wersquove seen in modern times, Mr Biden said, adding that what unfolded was, ldquoan assault on the rule of law like few times we have ever seen it.I call on President Trump to go on national television now to fulfill his oath and defend the Constitution by demanding an end to this siege.mdash Joe BidenJanuary , He said the uprising bordered on sedition, adding: ldquoThe scenes of chaos at the capitol do not reflect a true America, do not represent who we are.ldquoI call on this mob to pull back and allow democracy to go forward, Mr Biden said. ldquoAt their best the words of a president can inspire, at their worst they can incite.Mr Biden also called on President Trump to ldquogo on national television now to ldquodemand an end to this siege.Let me be very clear: the scenes of chaos at the Capitol do not represent who we are. What we are seeing is a small number of extremists dedicated to lawlessness. This is not dissent, its disorder. It borders on sedition, and it must end.

They phoned me back an hour later and said they had seen something.”Joanne, who is a keen sportswoman and coaches netball, continued: “I didnt feel that sick at the time so I continued to play sports and netball. I played a match the following week but I still had the cough and when I came home from the match I began to cough up blood.“Although I contacted Dalriada on call I still didnt feel that sick so I went to bed but when I got up the next day it was worse so I went to AE.“I was admitted to hospital because my lung collapsed and I couldnt breath. I was told I had a carcinoid tumour which is very rare on my left lung and attached to my windpipe.”Throughout lockdown Joanne regularly attended the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast for treatment.She said: “I started my chemo and laser surgery and I seemed to spend the whole of lockdown between the Royal and my bed.“In November the consultant told me they had lasered enough of the windpipe to do me over Christmas as they had to free up the hospital due to Covid.“I need an operation to remove a quarter of my windpipe and my left lung with everything being bypassed and directed into my right lung. Once I get the operation the tumour should hopefully be taken all away.”Unfortunately Joanne received news that her operation has been delayed.She said: “I was built up for the operation both physically and mentally. After I was told I went into a depression because they said it would be four months.“I have two or three good days but then the rest are bad and at times I am so ill I have to stay in bed. One minute you are doing  miles an hour and then everything just stops.“But I am very lucky to have the support of my daughters and husband as I know the situation is very hard on them too.”Joanne decided to focus on trying to give something back Action Cancer NI and with the help of her father in law, Raymond Lennox, has been creating bespoke wooden planters, bird feeders, Christmas tress and Christmas plaques.The items are being sold at Blossom and Birch, Broughshane Street in Ballymena, which has hosted a number of events in aid of charity, one of which included a gallery night featuring art work by David McAneaney who also works at the florists.Joanne commented: “Between Raymond and myself we have been making a range of items and there has been a big demand for them. It has been good for us both as it has kept us busy and focused. “It is something to keep your mind off things and it keeps us going.”Despite the impending lockdown Joanne and Raymond hope to continue their fundraising efforts and anyone who is interested in purchasing an item can contact Joanne via her facebook page.

I would believe that employers wishing to do the right thing should accept previous shielding letters as indication that somebody needs to shield until such time as any further communication is resolved.His comments prompted a flurry of anxious responses on social media from members of the public and charities that support vulnerable members of society.However, a spokesman from the Department of Health subsequently issued a statement to clary that the latest advice dfers from the advice that was originally issued to clinically extremely vulnerable people in March last year.It recommended that anyone advised to shield adhere to strict measures, including staying indoors at all times and limiting contact with members of their household.A statement released on Wednesday night said: Prof Young was referring to the updated advice to clinically extremely vulnerable people issued just before Christmas - with a commitment that letters from the chief medical officer would follow. Some of these letters have already been received.While not ato the shielding advice in place in the early part of the pandemic, the updated Northern Ireland advice does mirror the latest advice in England.Sinn Fein MLA Colm Gildernew, chair of the health committee, on Wednesday night described the confusion over the issue as regrettable.It is slightly dferent revised advice and it is regrettable that people who are vulnerable have felt confused and unclear about the advice, he said.According to the latest guidance, clinical extremely vulnerable people should avoid going to shops, pharmacies and hospitality settings. They should also work from home where possible.The measures were put in place on December  but updated information has not yet been sent out to all the , people who were told to shield last June.Meanwhile, Northern Ireland looks set to remain in lockdown until March at the earliest as Prof Young revealed his fears that Covid- will still be out of control at the end of February.Professor Young has given the clearest indication yet that the draconian restrictions put in place to stem the surge in Covid- cases will not come to an end on February .The Executive Office announced on Tuesday that the additional restrictions would be reviewed on January  and will remain in place until February .However, speaking at the health committee on Wednesday, Prof Young said he expects virus levels to remain signicant at the end of February.Prof Young also revealed that a failure to implement the latest lockdown would have resulted in Northern Ireland#s health service being overrun by patients for three months. And he warned that hospitals will experience a surge in patients at the end of the month.It comes as a further , cases and  deaths were announced by the Department of Health on Wednesday.During Wednesday#s committee meeting, Prof Young came under fire from Sinn Fein MLA Pat Sheehan, who said the strategy put in place by Prof Young, Health Minister Robin Swann and chief medical officer Dr Michael McBride to respond to the pandemic had failed miserably.The CSA said: Do I wish we could have done better  Absolutely. Would there be decisions which I could have been taken dferently looking backwards  Without a doubt.When asked to expand further by Mr Sheehan, Prof Young continued: So, I think that right towards the beginning of the epidemic, on a UK-wide and Ireland-wide basis, there might have been some merit in taking action around travel at that stage, before the virus had become very well established in the country, that#s one thing.I think certainly that we would look back and think might have been done dferently although those are policy decisions, they would have been informed by advice.I wish that we had got the testing developed more rapidly and rolled out more rapidly given all the limitations of it because I think more testing earlier in the epidemic would have been very helpful in terms of trying to keep it under control.Belfast Related ContentCoronavirus PremiumFlouting coronavirus rules like #slapping a nurse in the face#: SwannHealth Minister Robin Swann has fired a warning at those who continue to flout health regulations, saying that they might as well be slapping a nurse in the face.Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Stay at home message legally enforceable on Friday New lockdown for Northern Ireland... it’s back to square one as police get powers to curb travel Coronavirus Northern Ireland: Further  deaths and , new cases reported as GCSE and A-Levels cancelledMartin McGuinness# dad told him to get out of house after he joined IRABrexit delivery issues: How Amazon, John Lewis, Dunelm and other companies have been affected by Irish Sea borderLatest CoronavirusRestrictions reviewed: NI family of seven at odds with NI guidance on gatheringsFlouting coronavirus rules like #slapping a nurse in the face#: SwannKeith WysnerOpinionExam company AQE#s self-serving move has let our children down badlyPandemic has had #devastating impact# on cancer servicesLatest from Belfast Pep Guardiola dedicates Manchester City’s semi-final win to Colin BellParis St Germain held by St Etienne in first game under Mauricio PochettinoRestrictions reviewed: NI family of seven at odds with NI guidance on gatheringsTwitter restricts Trump video ‘due to a risk of violence’Snow showers and freezing fog set to hit UK in coming days,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Liam McBurney PA WireAndrew Madden and Eimear McGovernJanuary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailAn order for people in Northern Ireland to stay at home will become legally enforceable on Friday, it has been confirmed. The advice is to be put into legislation from midnight on Thursday, with additional powers being given to the PSNI to enforce the measures.The move was agreed by the Executive after it met on Tuesday, along with the tightening of other measures.Amongst the additional restrictions agreed are:Private garden gatherings - maximum of six people from one household or support bubble only, with children under  counting towards the permitted total.Gatherings reduced to maximum of six people from two households. Children under  are now counted towards the permitted total.Outdoor exercise permitted with one person from another household - to allow, for example, those living alone to go for a walk with a friend.People will only be allowed to leave home for medical needs, to buy food or to exercise. Those who cannot work from home will also be allowed leave. It was agreed the measures will last until February  with a review expected on January .Schools in Northern Ireland are also set to undertake remote learning until the mid-term break, it was also confirmed.First Minister Arlene Foster said discussions on exams are ongoing with Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, with a decision to be made by Thursday.Mrs Foster said the rising coronavirus cases and hospital admissions were causing grave concern.She added: We confirm that all educational establishments will move to remote learning until the half-term break in the middle of February.It will be reviewed up the end of January. But we want to give those educational establishments the vision ahead into February. So, that is what is happening.That applies to primary schools, post primary schools and indeed to nursery schools as well.Childcare, however, will continue, eventhat is in an educational setting. Childminders will be able to operate as well.Mrs Foster denied the Executive had failed to agree on a way forward for exams.She said: Our educational grading and our GCSEs and A-levels are very integrated into the wider UK system.There#s ongoing discussions with Gavin Williamson, secretary state for education in Westminster, actually the Executive have mandated our education minister to get clarity for these issues.By the end of the executive on Thursday, we will have complete clarity in relation to GCSEs and A-levels.Deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill said the decision to close schools was a reflection on how serious the situation is with the pandemic.She said an Executive meeting could be held on Wednesday to discuss the issue in relation to exams and called on the Education Minister to bring forward proposals.Childcare and special education schools are to remain open, the Deputy First Minister said.Speaking after the Executive meeting, Ms O#Neill said: The message will be stay at home.This will provide additional powers to the PSNI, for example to be able topeople to their homes when they actually come out for reasons that are not allowed under the reasons that you can actually leave your home.There are also additional restrictions to household mixing. So, in private homes and gardens, both indoor and outdoor gatherings will be restricted to members of one household, or a member of your support bubble.There are obviously some exemptions that are for people who live in homes so those things will carry on.Outdoor and indoor gatherings will be restricted. The current position is that  people can meet outside that will be reduced to six people. Again, that#s a necessary intervention at this time.There is still little clarity on transfer tests for entry into grammar schools, which were initially cancelled only for the Association for Quality Education to announce they will hold a single exam in February.On Tuesday, it was confirmed a further  people in Northern Ireland had died after testing positive for Covid-. , new cases of the virus have been reported.

Stormont needs to get these things right. It#s undermining efforts of people trying to abide by what the lockdown restrictions actually are.On Wednesday in the Assembly First Minister Arlene Foster gave an overview of the new restrictions and when referencing the number of people who can gather in a garden Mrs Foster said that the Department of Health was working through the details and there would be clarity to come on the matter.On Wednesday night the NI Direct website was updated with the latest restrictions which remain in place until February  and will be reviewed on January .It also said that everyone must now stay at home unless they had a reasonable excuse.Earlier the head of the police federation Mark Lindsay questioned the practicality of the PSNI being able to enforce the new regulations and whether officers had the power to cross the threshold of a residence.He told the BBC#s Stephen Nolan show: We have been quite disappointed over the past year in some of the legislation that we think has been rushed, hasn#t been properly thought through, and police are left to pick up the pieces.Mr Lindsay said it would be easiertravel restrictions were in place in that officers could tell from someone#s driving licensethey were in breach of regulations.He questioned how is it practical to enforce gatherings in gardens of hundreds of thousands of homes - many of which are inaccessible. However Justice Minister Naomi Long told MLAs yesterday that officers did have the power of entry.The health protection regulations as laid by the department of health gave those tasked with enforcement the power to take any actions necessary to enforce any legal restrictions and it is the view of the Executive that that includes the right of power of entry, she told MLAs.Belfast Related ContentCoronavirus PremiumFlouting coronavirus rules like #slapping a nurse in the face#: SwannHealth Minister Robin Swann has fired a warning at those who continue to flout health regulations, saying that they might as well be slapping a nurse in the face.Most ReadNew lockdown for Northern Ireland... it’s back to square one as police get powers to curb travel Coronavirus Northern Ireland: Further  deaths and , new cases reported as GCSE and A-Levels cancelledMartin McGuinness# dad told him to get out of house after he joined IRACoronavirus Northern Ireland: Stay at home message legally enforceable on Friday Brexit delivery issues: How Amazon, John Lewis, Dunelm and other companies have been affected by Irish Sea borderLatest CoronavirusConfusion after Department of Health claries advice on shielding after statement from chief scientic adviserFlouting coronavirus rules like #slapping a nurse in the face#: SwannKeith WysnerOpinionExam company AQE#s self-serving move has let our children down badlyPandemic has had #devastating impact# on cancer servicesLatest from Belfast Pep Guardiola dedicates Manchester City’s semi-final win to Colin BellParis St Germain held by St Etienne in first game under Mauricio PochettinoConfusion after Department of Health claries advice on shielding after statement from chief scientic adviserTwitter restricts Trump video ‘due to a risk of violence’Snow showers and freezing fog set to hit UK in coming days,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

My dependency on it was getting worse,that was possible.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClosePatricia Quinn and Jonny Dobson confirm their marriage FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":truePatricia Quinn and Jonny Dobson confirm their marriage Things finally began to turn around when, as Jonny puts it, he grew a conscience.I was stealing from people and I really didn#t want to be that sort of person so I stopped doing it, he said.I also wanted to quit drugs because of how they were making me feel. Gradually, I managed to wean myself off them.Alcohol, however, was a tougher nut to crack.I#d been trying to quit since I turned , he said.I was bingeing, getting sober for two weeks, then bingeing again... the vicious cycle just went on and on.To complicate matters, Jonny started self-harming.He began by scraping himself, but that soon morphed into something more sinister.I#d been using broken bottles and ended up cutting a vein open in my leg, said Jonny who, by March  - just before he met Tricia - had pretty much given up on le.I#d cut my wrist, severing my median nerve. I was really on a downward spiral and couldn#t see a way out of it, he said.By then, he had been sleeping rough outside an off licence on the Ormeau Road.Someone who works with homeless people finally intervened, taking him to the Stella Maris hostel, where his le would, not immediately but ultimately, turn around.Having met and fell in love with Tricia there, the pair left Stella Maris together in June, moved to a property in Co Down.But although there was emotional salvation, neither party could defeat the demon drink and within a year both of them were back living in the hostel.We had really tried to make an effort but it fell apart, said Jonny.We were also on the streets for a while. Tricia broke her ankle and I had to stay sober because she was in a wheelchair.The onset of the Covid- pandemic coincided with Tricia going into rehab - for a third, and what she is adamant will be the last, time in her troubled le.After Tricia took that big step, Housing First [a service provided by DePaul Charity] found us temporary accommodation in north Belfast because we were both sober at that stage, he said.They spent a year there until their landlord sold the property and they ended up sleeping in a tent in dferent campsites, before then finding another bricks-and-mortar home but it was on the third floor which was a concern for Tricia, who has epilepsy.Through sheer, collective determination, however, they were able to save some money and acquire a one-bedroom apartment last August - their marital, dry home.I haven#t had a drink in eight months and Tricia hasn#t touched it for nine and half, said Jonny.That might not sound like much but that#s massive for us. Previously, I#d never stopped for more than six weeks in my entire le.Jonny is now halfway through an Open University course in planetary science and astronomy and, while he spends the day studying, his new we devotes her time to attending AA meetings and helping others who want to quit.I#m from an alcoholic family, said Tricia, who spent six years on the streets.I was in a children#s home from the age of . I left at , had four kids by the time I was .I didn#t actually drink back then I only started when I was .Unlike her husband, Tricia has never taken drugs but didn#t have any friends.I had some traumatic experiences when I was in my twenties, she admitted.I#d been having problems sleeping until I tried red wine. I didn#t actually like the taste of it but it helped me get over.Tricia told of how she tried to get sober back then but, after a spell in rehab got wine to celebrate coming out.She said she lost virtually everything. Friendless and aged , she ended up on the streets.Drink cost me so much, she said.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClosePatricia Quinn and Jonny Dobson FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":truePatricia Quinn and Jonny Dobson She is still in touch with some, but not all, of her children.Tricia was in and out of Stella Maris for years, trying, and failing, to turn her le around.I was institutionalised, I didn#t know how to be on my own or live on my own, she said.I was drinking straight vodka, and most of my le was a blackout.Some memories she does retain, however, still haunt her every waking moment.I remember sleeping outside McDonald#s with a girl called Catherine Kenny, but she#s dead now. She died on the streets. Catherine called an ambulance for me once, after I#d had a serious epileptic fit.I ended up on a le support machine. When I woke up in the Ulster Hospital I didn#t know where I was or how I#d got there... but all I could think about was drink. I signed myself out of hospital and went straight to the off licence. Then I went back to Stella Maris...Another more pleasant memory: meeting Jonny - although she spent that first night in jail.I thought he was gorgeous, she recalled.I was sitting beside him while he was watching a film, and I got arrested! I#d been arguing with a girl - a friend, actually - and ended up in the cells overnight.When I got out of the police station the next day, I went looking for Jonny.He told me he slept rough on the Ormeau Road so I went up there and found him. That#s where it started.Tricia puts her sobriety purely down to rehab - specically a spell in Cuan Mhuire, Newry, that began at the start of the first Covid- lockdown.I desperately wanted to get sober, she said.Jonny had a small relapse when I was in there. He phoned me drunk. I told him he had to get sober for both our sakes, and he did.After signing up to AA and finding a sponsor, Tricia now attends two virtual meetings a day.She is also helping other alcoholics by giving talks about my journey.She added: If you told me this time last year I#d be sober nine and a half months and married - there#s no way I would#ve believed it.The couple tied the knot at City Hall on December .It was just me and him. My brother was the only guest. It was perfect, said Tricia.The boss of Housing First got us a car, made me a posy and baked me a cake.Tricia - who has one granddaughter aged seven, and two grandsons, aged eight months and five months - said  has easily been the best year of her le.They hope to honeymoon in Poland, when the lockdown restrictions permit.Getting married is the third best thing I#ve ever done, she said.The first was getting sober. The second was getting myself a sponsor in AA and doing the steps, and the third was getting married. I couldn#t have done the third one without the first two.She added: It was so hard to get sober but I think the hardest part is staying there.Christmas was very dferent for Tricia who said last year she was in blackout.Jonny was sober but I was wandering the streets before we went to my dad#s for Christmas dinner, she recalled.This year, Mr and Mrs Dobson had Christmas dinner at Tricia#s dad - only this time they both remember it.The worst part of living on the streets was not knowing who might end up dead beside you the next morning, said Tricia.Jonny added: For me, it was not having access to any facilities. You#re just constantly dirty and broke and you have no options.He added: It#s the first time we can say we#re happy. We#ve got money in the bank, we#ve got options, a bit of security it#s a whole dferent le.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Stay at home message legally enforceable on Friday New lockdown for Northern Ireland... it’s back to square one as police get powers to curb travel Coronavirus Northern Ireland: Further  deaths and , new cases reported as GCSE and A-Levels cancelledMartin McGuinness# dad told him to get out of house after he joined IRABrexit delivery issues: How Amazon, John Lewis, Dunelm and other companies have been affected by Irish Sea borderLatest Northern IrelandConfusion after Department of Health claries advice on shielding after statement from chief scientic adviserRestrictions reviewed: NI family of seven at odds with NI guidance on gatheringsSnow showers and freezing fog set to hit UK in coming daysFlouting coronavirus rules like #slapping a nurse in the face#: SwannMore than , birds to be culled in NI after avian flu outbreakLatest from Belfast Pep Guardiola dedicates Manchester City’s semi-final win to Colin BellParis St Germain held by St Etienne in first game under Mauricio PochettinoRestrictions reviewed: NI family of seven at odds with NI guidance on gatheringsConfusion after Department of Health claries advice on shielding after statement from chief scientic adviserTwitter restricts Trump video ‘due to a risk of violence’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

That#s the draw.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseMore images taken by Abandoned NI FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueMore images taken by Abandoned NI With a lot of these places I go I find that when I put up the images there#s a lot of people from an older generation who relate to some of the items they see. They bring back memories of their own lives. It can be very nostalgic.Rebecca said there is a wealth of history all around us waiting to be discovered.Many crumbling buildings have stories that have yet to be told, and through her work she is determined to bring that past to the present day.I couldn#t even put a number on how many locations I#ve visited, she added. There would be hundreds. You never run out of them. The main problem is getting the time to visit them all and document what#s in there.I guess you could say it is lonely, although I think this is maybe why I like it. The older I#ve got, I much prefer my own company.Belfast Most ReadNew lockdown for Northern Ireland... it’s back to square one as police get powers to curb travel Coronavirus Northern Ireland: Stay at home message legally enforceable on Friday Coronavirus Northern Ireland: Further  deaths and , new cases reported as GCSE and A-Levels cancelledMartin McGuinness# dad told him to get out of house after he joined IRABrexit delivery issues: How Amazon, John Lewis, Dunelm and other companies have been affected by Irish Sea borderLatest Northern IrelandRestrictions reviewed: NI family of seven at odds with NI guidance on gatheringsConfusion after Department of Health claries advice on shielding after statement from chief scientic adviserSnow showers and freezing fog set to hit UK in coming daysFlouting coronavirus rules like #slapping a nurse in the face#: SwannMore than , birds to be culled in NI after avian flu outbreakLatest from Belfast Pep Guardiola dedicates Manchester City’s semi-final win to Colin BellParis St Germain held by St Etienne in first game under Mauricio PochettinoRestrictions reviewed: NI family of seven at odds with NI guidance on gatheringsConfusion after Department of Health claries advice on shielding after statement from chief scientic adviserTwitter restricts Trump video ‘due to a risk of violence’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Just turned, went upstairs.I could hear the noise in the front room, a bag being filled... and he came downstairs and said #look, I have to go#, asthe conversation with my father had terminated.He said to my mother: #Don#t worry, I#ll be back to see you frequently#. And that was the only dissent he ever showed throughout his le until that day. He was on the run, then, basically living in one house or another.Mr McGuinness said he thought it absurd when his brother was appointed as Education Minister, having only attended UCB - University College Bogside.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseMartin McGuinness FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueMartin McGuinness Here#s a guy who had no academic background whatsoever in the formal sense... failed the -plus along with his older brother.How#s he going to handle the situation  But he took charge of a £.bn budget.Mr Paisley, the North Antrim MP, spoke of accepting McGuinness in later years, given that he had considered members of the IRA who killed police officers and bombed cities and towns as people to be absolutely detested.It never left me, the fact who Martin McGuinness was, he said. I wasn#t a fool to this, but someone  once said to me: #What made you do the arrangements with the former terrorist Martin McGuinness #And I said: #The word former#.Julie Hambleton#s sister Maxine was one of  people killed in the IRA Birmingham pub bombings in . She said McGuinness# IRA past could never be justied.When you kill one person you destroy a whole nucleus of a family. The impact of losing Maxine, and for all the families… it#s immeasurable, she said.There is no excuse for Martin McGuinness, or anybody, to pick up a gun or a kne or make a bomb and plant it on innocents.Brid Rodgers, a founding member of the SDLP, said she struggled to forget McGuinness# IRA past when they later became colleagues.She recalled the story of Patsy Gillespie, a Catholic who worked in an Army base. In , considered a collaborator by the IRA, he was forced to drive a van containing ,lbs of explosives to a border checkpoint while his family was held hostage.The bomb killed Mr Gillespie and five soldiers.The documentary is now available to stream online at tg.ie.Belfast Most ReadNew lockdown for Northern Ireland... it’s back to square one as police get powers to curb travel Coronavirus Northern Ireland: Further  deaths and , new cases reported as GCSE and A-Levels cancelledMartin McGuinness# dad told him to get out of house after he joined IRACoronavirus Northern Ireland: Stay at home message legally enforceable on Friday Brexit delivery issues: How Amazon, John Lewis, Dunelm and other companies have been affected by Irish Sea borderLatest Northern IrelandConfusion after Department of Health claries advice on shielding after statement from chief scientic adviserRestrictions reviewed: NI family of seven at odds with NI guidance on gatheringsSnow showers and freezing fog set to hit UK in coming daysFlouting coronavirus rules like #slapping a nurse in the face#: SwannMore than , birds to be culled in NI after avian flu outbreakLatest from Belfast Pep Guardiola dedicates Manchester City’s semi-final win to Colin BellParis St Germain held by St Etienne in first game under Mauricio PochettinoRestrictions reviewed: NI family of seven at odds with NI guidance on gatheringsConfusion after Department of Health claries advice on shielding after statement from chief scientic adviserTwitter restricts Trump video ‘due to a risk of violence’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

You have to keep up with the trends.When I first started doing it, it was more with pedigree breeds, and at the minute now cross breeds are very popular. That#s where the trends have moved.He said the key to success has been building longstanding relationships with clients.There#s a couple that have been coming to me since I started grooming, he said.They were saying to me before Christmas that the relationship between their dog and a groomer is vital.Becauseyou#re taking your dog to dferent groomers all the time, you haven#t got that bond.He said pitting his skills against other top professionals had been nerve-racking.He added: I really did enjoy it. It was a great experience and something that I#ll never forget.Asked how he manages to maintain such a busy household, he said: Behind every man is a good woman - she#s the rock that holds everything together.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseThomas with we Michaela and children Charlie, Callen, Kerry, Mathew and Daniel FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueThomas with we Michaela and children Charlie, Callen, Kerry, Mathew and Daniel Thomas said that his ambitions are to keep growing his business and progress his teaching.I teach level three dog grooming at the minute, which is commercial grooming, he said.I#m moving on now to teach level four, which is more trying to get things more to a breed standard.The eight-part series will feature  pairs of professional dog groomers taking part in a series of themed challenges to create epic transformations for the chance to be named the UK#s top dog stylist.Each week the teams will reveal their creations on #The Dogwalk#, where judges and owners will see their pooches transformed from scruffy to fluffy for the first time.It is hosted by award-winning actress Smith, who has six dogs of her own. She said sharing a set full of four-legged friends was a dream job.She added: To combine my love of dogs with a brand new job presenting for the BBC was a match made in heaven. Everyone who knows me will understand that animals, and especially dogs, are very special to me.Belfast Most ReadNew lockdown for Northern Ireland... it’s back to square one as police get powers to curb travel Coronavirus Northern Ireland: Further  deaths and , new cases reported as GCSE and A-Levels cancelledMartin McGuinness# dad told him to get out of house after he joined IRACoronavirus Northern Ireland: Stay at home message legally enforceable on Friday Brexit delivery issues: How Amazon, John Lewis, Dunelm and other companies have been affected by Irish Sea borderLatest Northern IrelandConfusion after Department of Health claries advice on shielding after statement from chief scientic adviserRestrictions reviewed: NI family of seven at odds with NI guidance on gatheringsSnow showers and freezing fog set to hit UK in coming daysFlouting coronavirus rules like #slapping a nurse in the face#: SwannMore than , birds to be culled in NI after avian flu outbreakLatest from Belfast Pep Guardiola dedicates Manchester City’s semi-final win to Colin BellParis St Germain held by St Etienne in first game under Mauricio PochettinoConfusion after Department of Health claries advice on shielding after statement from chief scientic adviserRestrictions reviewed: NI family of seven at odds with NI guidance on gatheringsTwitter restricts Trump video ‘due to a risk of violence’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Barman Andy Nutt is preparing to pour the last measure at the well-known local pub.Reporter: Liam Tunney::  Dec   addthis, Knobbsrsquo Tavern closed in March, just before the pandemic arrived. In the week leading up to its final hurrah, we caught up with barman Andy Nutt and a few regulars.A well-known County Derry pub that has been in operation since  will close its door for the final time on Thursday.Knobbs’ Tavern in Kildoag, between Claudy and Donemana, was originally a grocery store that serviced the local area, but the community it sustained has been shrinking.On Saturday, they held a packed farewell concert, and when the County Derry Post caught up with a few of the regulars on the Friday afternoon, they were in reflective mood.“We’ll miss the yarns and the company,” said previous owner, Jack Knobbs, who was perched at the corner of the bar with his dog, Honey.“It was originally what they call a licensed shop and the first time it was opened as a bar was in . Until , the shop was still here and the bar could only hold maybe seven or eight people.“It would have been mostly locals in the bar and then in  they built on the upstairs and it would have hosted a lot of music – mostly country and western music.” googletag.cmd.push Jack is quietly spoken but points me in the direction of black and white photographs on the wall, where he featured in the Kildoag Wanderers FC side and the local cricket team in a previous era.Both teams used the bar as their base, and the social aspect the rural pub brought to the area is something Jack feels will be greatly missed.“The place would have been packed out on a Saturday night – people would have come from Donemana, Waterside and Claudy for the music.“We just enjoyed the craic. You had the odd tall story told. It’s hard to beat a good story, evenit’s not true!”Mervyn McComb lays claim to being the bar’s oldest customer. “I’ve been coming here about  years,” boasts the -year-old. googletag.cmd.push  “I was in it when the old bar was in the other room. Then, when they opened up the lounge, the place was packed to the rafters. “A lot of old bars seem to be closing up, there’s not the customers there used to be. It’s going to be badly missed. “It’s local people that come here.”Right on cue, a loud cheer erupts from the men as another regular walks into the bar, while Ian informs me the bar has its own taxi driver in residence.Barman Andy Nutt prepares to explain further. He mutes the small television mounted above the bar. This is serious stuff now.“There were six women arrived from Cumbria in England on a Tuesday night. They were on a biking tour and on their way to Park.“They came in and asked to use the toilet and I said that was no bother at all. One of them askedthis was a bar and I said it’s been called many things, but you could definitely call it a bar.“She askedthere was any chance they could have a drink and to cut a long story short, they ended up leaving the bikes here!“They stayed all night so I said I would get them a taxi man to get them back to Park. I rung up Eddie Curry and askedhe could do a run.“Eddie said ‘I’m definitely not going to Park’. Then I told him it was six women and he asked what time I wanted him down!     “I got a text from them that evening then – I think they were in Portrush.“It said: Andy, no Guinness at pound., no gin and tonic at pound. – we shouldn’t have left you!”The tale is typical of the kind of comical, slightly embellished yarns that used to be commonplace in bars across the country, but rural decline is threatening to silence them.Mervyn McComb’s son, Ian, believes that people make the bar what it is.“It’s a good wee bar, with great people in it,” he says. “There were memorable nights here every weekend. It was always good craic.“There used to be bands in upstairs and the place would have been jammed. It always did a good trade, was well run and there was never any trouble. “I’m  now so I’ve been coming here maybe  years. It will be sorely missed and it’ll hurt the community.”The range of presentation cheques that adorn the bar’s walls give an indication of how the community will suffer without its hub. Each year, the bar ran a charity drive and the evidence of their impact is clear in the many comments left on social media following news of Knobbs’ closure. Nicola Doherty fondly recalled a vintage tractor rally held at Knobbs’ after her father had beaten cancer.She commented: “We held our first tractor run in there when my dad beat cancer and bought a vintage tractor. “We hoped for a few tractors to show up and to raise a couple of hundred, but the place was packed, and we raised pound, for the Sperrin Room. “Great memories, I’m sad to see it close the doors.”The doors will indeed close, but Saturday night’s punters were treated to the nostalgic sight of the rafters reverberating to the sound of the Father and Son Remo band in the lounge above. There is a black cat that Jack Knobbs says follows him to and from his house to the bar on every visit.It sits almost sentry-like on the windowsill outside Knobbs.On a bright summer’s afternoon, Jack’s feline companion would be treated to a breathtaking view of the Faughan valley, but on Knobbs’ farewell night, Storm Jorge’s wind and rain battered its weary walls.The storm will have calmed by Thursday, as Andy Nutt prepares to close the doors. There is no doubt that Jack Knobbs will be there to oversee what will be an emotional moment.Knobbs concedes to the march of time.“I’m just a customer now,” says the former owner.“Sometimes I sit too long.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Until now. Liam Tunney talks to an ex-member of the infamous Gorilla Gang, who were responsible for many a headache at Slaughtneil discoThe Slaughtneil GAC committee used to meet every Monday evening. The meeting was supposed to be a general meeting about club business, but usually got bogged down with the disco. Discussions often revolved around two groups of boisterous young men in particular – the Gorilla Gang from Draperstown and the Banana Gang of Bellaghy. The latter were set up in reaction to the former, whose name was notorious around south Derry throughout the s. “The name was actually originally meant to be ‘Guerrilla Gang’,” an ex-member told the County Derry Post. “About  or , things were getting hot and heavy and the likes of Ballinascreen was getting saturated by the British Army. googletag.cmd.push “There would have been fighting with the UDR or the Brits, andthey came into Draperstown, the Gorilla Gang would have gathered up a posse and put them out. “There were two or three gangs in Draperstown at that time. One of them was the Wombles and the other one was the Sixtown Clowns. “They all used to fight amongst each other at small discos that used to be on round Draperstown before Slaughtneil started. “The police knew about the Gorilla Gang. I had a few older brothers that went to Spain, and on their way home they were pulled in at London airport and quizzed about the gang!” googletag.cmd.push As the disco’s popularity began to grow, the three gangs soon set their grievances aside as the possibility of taking their local scuffles to a wider field presented itself. “The disco took in the whole of south Derry, so there was more boys to fight with outside your own town,” he recalled. “It was just like that at those times around dance halls. In the early s, before Slaughtneil, the older Gorilla Gang would all have been over in Dungiven fighting at the Castle. “There were a wile lot of boys in the Gorilla Gang that were mad for fighting, and then everyone started making up their own gangs to fight us.     “I think that’s where the Banana Gang came out of, that they were going to get the Gorilla Gang at Slaughtneil. “I think the Banana Gang gave the Wombles and the Sixtown Clowns a bad beating one night and then they didn’t want to go anymore. “Well, they were mad to go, but they couldn’t because they were scared of the Banana Gang. They came to the Gorilla Gang and askedthey could join up.” The merger prompted a rivalry that lasted throughout the late s and caused the Slaughtneil bouncers no end of trouble. Our ex-member feels that the gangs’ propensity for bravado and fisticuffs helped boost the crowds that flocked to the hall on a Friday night. “Four carloads of us would leave the town to go down to Slaughtneil. We didn’t chance taking the bus, becauseyou were fighting, the bus driver wouldn’t let you on,” he said. “I remember going down to Slaughtneil and being told these Banana Gang boys were gonna be there, and two nights in a row, we went down, and they weren’t there. “The third night we went down, we thought they weren’t turning up, so maybe only five or ten of us went and we got some beating from the Banana Gang that night – they all turned up! “God help them bouncers. I don’t think Slaughtneil would have been Slaughtneil without it. Everybody was going, girls and all, to see what was going to happen next week. “If there was a small scuffle in the car park, threats were made about who was going to be there next week that wasn’t there tonight.  The characters’ nicknames roll off the ex-member’s tongue. Bungle. Flan. Rocky. Numan. Turk. Goggles. Nelly. Bruce. Shiny, who ‘couldn’t beat eggs’ but drove the getaway car. The King, who would run out onto the pitch and shout, ‘I’m the King of the Gorillas and I eat bananas for breakfast’ before a dust-up. Johnny the Donkey, who played the role of negotiator when the gangs were thrown out of the car park and arranged to meet halfway between Draperstown and Bellaghy to finish it off. An eclectic mix, but one name resonated more than others. “Flathead was the feared name. He was a real tight boy, he would have fought anybody man to man,” he said. “We would have said, ‘you boys will be in trouble next week, we’re taking big Flathead with us’, and everybody would have been at Slaughtneil the next week for the big punch up outside! “Even the bouncers were a wee bit scared of big Flathead because he was big for his age. There were some characters about.” While the rivalry between the two gangs was intense, it never created any lasting grudges and the member recalled how, by chance, he encountered one of his nemeses years later. “I hadn’t seen this boy for years, until I was going along one day in the car through Rocktown and heading for Bellaghy,” he said. “I saw a man walking along the road in the pouring rain and I stopped to seehe wanted a lt. “He hopped in anyway and was talking away to me and when he was getting out of the car, whatever way he turned sideways I recognised him. He caught on then to who I was too. “We were good friends at school, but then he was in the Banana Gang and I didn’t really want to let him know that I wanted to kill him, and he didn’t want to let me know either!” Time and people move on. The exploits of the Gorilla Gang may seem shocking when viewed through a st century lens, but our ex-member says it was a dferent era. “When I look back, I never knew of a man being hurt badly. When I hear the gang mentioned, it makes me laugh,” he said. “There were no mobile phones, no fancy cars. Anybody that had a car, it had cost them maybe pound. That whole thing is just lost. “I know it wasn’t good going to all them dance halls and fighting, but at the same time, no one was doing drugs or anything, it was just a punch-up. “Just a locka lads with a few beers in them, that fell out with another group of lads and there were a load of myths and legends that never even happened. “There were a few nights when I was younger that I maybe woke up in the morning with a black eye and a cut forehead and I said to myself, ‘oh my God, what am I at ’, but apart from that, I’ve no regrets. “We were all young cubs. Apart from the odd bleeding mouth and a bust lip, there wasn’t much harm done.” “God help them bouncers, those men got some torturing! Them boys did some organising to keep that all going. “For a club on top of a mountain, they did well to actually get people to get up there. There’s not even a pub.” It’s unlikely south Derry will ever see the likes of the Gorilla Gang again, but their mention invokes howls of recognition and intrigue. With a chuckle no doubt brought on by the memory of discos past, the ex-member had one idea that might have some under lockdown pining for its end. “I couldn’t say that I’ve any enemies out of it, put it like that. If we could get a Banana Gang-Gorilla Gang reunion night gathered up, I’d say we could have a good laugh!” See also: If you build it, they will come: Slaughtneils field of dreamers Spinning the soundtrack to a timeless era South Derrys ballroom of romance The goose that laid the golden egg Bringing Muhammad to the south Derry mountains The night a TV star came to Slaughtneil  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Joe Cassidy and captain Ciaran McNally took Michael McMullan on an wander into the past... Twelve years before helping Cathal Scullion to strike gold in an Ulster Club final, Joe Cassidy was setting up goals. This time, in the colours of Ballynease PS. A week after losing the  Castle Cup final, by virtue of a last minute goal, to a Johnny McBride and Bosco ONeill inspired Moneymore, the sides met again. googletag.cmd.push The shoe was on the other foot this time. Only a goal would save Bellaghy, thought Cassidy as he stood over the late free. With the benefit of hindsight, only Ronaldo would have found the net from the environs of right wing. Ciaran McNally began his run from full-back. He took a complete gamble. “I just swung at er with an auld scuffed box, and she fell into the net,” laughs McNally, who was the teams goalkeeper  months earlier.  Joe Cassidy and Ciaran McNally celebrate success with Ballynease PS This was the start of McNally and Cassidys winning run. They were on Bellaghys Ulster minor winning team six years later. Under McBrides captaincy, the Bellaghy duo played for Derry in the  All-Ireland minor final defeat to Westmeath. googletag.cmd.push By that time, Cassidy had secured the first of six senior medals as a list for the  win, which ended Bellaghys eight year absence from the pinnacle of Derry football. McNally had to wait until his debut year of  for senior glory and he would pick up four more championships and captain them to Ulster glory. “The best team, more often than not, always wins the championship,” Cassidy begins. “We had two dferent Ulster minor winning teams– two complete new sets of players.” Sam Maguire winners Karl Diamond, Danny Quinn and Joes older brother Damian were also to the fore.     “There was the likes of Gerry McPeake, Seamus Birt, Damian Brown and Benny Lee, boys that had a bit of experience.” The pieces of the puzzle were slotting into place to rule the Derry club scene. ---- Kilmacud Crokes goalkeeper Mick Penders late penalty save, from Damian Cassidy, denied the Tones a second All-Ireland on St Patricks Day , but after going on to dominate the race for the John McLaughlin Cup, Crossmaglen became their nemesis in Ulster. “They beat us in and . Both times, there wasnt the kick of a ball between the two teams,” McNally outlines. The  All-Ireland final, between Dublin and Galway, was the video of choice on the Bellaghy bus as they headed to their  Ulster semi-final date with Enniskillen. The irony wasnt lost on Joe Cassidy. Dublin had three men sent off, including then Derry senior boss Brian Mullins. Later that afternoon, Bellaghy also finished with  men as they bowed out of Ulster. “In those first four of five years, we got to Ulster finals and semi-finals regularly,” McNally adds. Without an Ulster title, Bellaghy were going to underachieve, he remembers thinking at the time. Joe Cassidys thoughts also flash back to the  final and having it won until John McEntees late equaliser. In the replay, Bellaghy were also a point up going into injury time. Cassidy remembers Damians free dropping in around the Crossmaglen square. If they even had kicked the ball dead the title was theirs, he laments. “The ball got played out to the wing to Oisin McConville and he ran about  yards,” Joe adds. “With hindsight, the best thing wouldve been to do a Sean Cavanagh and pull him down....wed have been Ulster champions.” Three passes later, Cathal Short – who played on the same UUJ Freshers team as Cassidy and Gareth Doherty months earlier– slid the ball past Kevin ONeill and Cross were on their way to their first All-Ireland. Lavey knocked Bellaghy out of the  championship, before Seamus Birt and Colm McElwee took charge at the start of a three year stint that brought three league and championship doubles. For, Joe Cassidy,  was their best chance of winning an All-Ireland. By , Paul Diamond – who Cassidy rates as one of the best he played with – was out of favour. Gone was the experience of Danny Quinn and Damian Cassidy. “For us, hewas a leader. He was one of those boys I loved playing with, he could hit you with a pass from about  yards away and not all midfielders had the ability to do that. Damian was the same. You just needed to make a half a step and Damian had the ball popped in your hand.” After a comfortable win over Lavey in the  county final, Bellaghy were back knocking on Crossmaglens door in the Ulster final, but super-sub Michael Moley scored the winner. Ballinderry qualied for the final the following year, after beating Lavey out the gate at Bellaghy. Joe Cassidy, who was stewarding at the game, remembers Conleith Gilligans fist pump towards a vocerous Shamrocks support after being replaced late in the game – as a bring on Bellaghy type salute. “That county final was one of my favourite ones. It was at Ballinascreen and it was on a Sunday night. There was an unreal atmosphere and a young group ofboys brought flares. “I remember walking behind the band...McNally and dferent boys were giving Gilligan a few welcome messages, so they were. Louis McPeake scored Bellaghys goal but they needed points from man of the match Damian Cassidy and Gavin Diamond to seal victory. That season ended with that defeat by Enniskillen. Without the elusive Ulster title, Bellaghys dinner dance in Arbys the following February was like a ghost town, Cassidy remembers. “Even though we had won the league and championship double...because you had done so bad in Ulster, it nearly looked like a bad year. There was a real dead atmosphere. “Youre expectations were to win an Ulster and, after seeing what Crossmaglen had done, the ultimate was to win an All-Ireland.” Despite a winning start to the  season, Bellaghy werent firing on all cylinders. Danny Quinn was player coach and was taking  percent of the training.  Ulster Club Champions  “Mammawas manager. You would land at training and everything was organsied, so he had those traits,” stated Cassidy. “Before that era , training was pretty pre-historic. My first innovator with training was Henry Downey at school. In around the club scene, Dannybegan to innovate things, he was coming off the back of county level. Mickey Moran came on board as Bellaghys trainer later in the summer, following Sligos exit out west. “That sortve gave us the kick up the backside that we needed, with someone of Mickeys level coming in. His training was top drawer.” One of Ciaran McNallys recollections of their Ulster winning campaign was how damn lucky they were to even get to Clones. The wheels almost coming off the wagon against Lavey in Greenlough. “It was a one or two point game, with a few minutes to go,” McNally remembers, when a loose ball pinged around in the Bellaghy penalty area. “I think it even hit the post and was heading across the line. All anybody had to do was get a toe to it and we were gone, then we ended up winning Ulster.”Joe Cassidy goes past Martin Calf in the  Ulster Club final. A six point win over Loup didnt satisfy the Bellaghy fans who now had lofty expectations. “People around the town were taking it for granted that wed beat the Loup and we, as players, could feel that, McNally continues, knowing it was going to be a battle. “I remember getting slated after it and people were saying youse were terrible and I remember saying....we won.” There was a draw with Slaughtneil in semi-final before Fergal Doherty, in his second senior season, hammered over a point in the early stages of the replay. “He would have been nervous in around the changing room, he was young at the time,” his captain outlines. “I remember the roar and relief from himand it was great from our respective.” The final was another showdown with their rivals Ballinderry again. It was a damp squib. Both McNally and Cassidy acknowledge almost falling over the line in a - to - victory. “Somebody needs to just stop that man,” McNally remembers thinking as the Shamrocks defensive rock Niall McCusker ferried the ball from corner back, up the wing before his diagonal ball went out for a . “The ball then came in, dropped short and we cleared it. Then came the relief with the final whistle.” ---- With three-in-a-row now secure, Bellaghy needed a win over Castledawson to keep their league hopes intact but an ankle ligament injury sustained in that game put Joe Cassidys Ulster club hopes in doubt. Bellaghy received a bye in the first round of Ulster, following Cargins suspension dished out after their final with arch-rivals St Pauls. Cassidy came on as a sub late in their semi-final victory over Cavan champions Gowna, who Bellaghy also met on their way to the  title. On the other side of the draw, Castleblayney disposed of Crossmaglen in the quarter-final before falling to Errigal Ciaran. “I had an idea ...you dont break up a winning team and we had played well in the semi-final,” Cassidy admits. Bellaghy won the toss and elected to play against the breeze. Bellaghy owned the ball in the first half but a litany of wides saw them trail - to - at the break. Peter Canavan had fired over the bar for the games first score, but never got a kick off David ONeill who dominated the Tyrone legend in the air. Cassidys worst nightmare was being paired off against Neilly in training games. “Between him and Sean Marty , I dont know how many roastings I got over the years.” Birt gave Cassidy the nod to warm up at the interval and six minutes into the second half, he entered the fray. “I was coming in fresh and the first ball I got, I turned and fired this thing over the bar from  yards. You looked like a super player but the breeze was carrying it.” Bellaghys defence, which included man of the match Peter Diamond, held Errigal scoreless for a full  minutes until Mark Hartes consolation goal in stoppage time. Six minutes before that, Cathal Scullions goal put the game to bed and Bellaghy could savour the march to glory. “Karl Diamond put the ball into the corner,” Cassidy recalls, with the help of watching the game again in his father Dan Joes Ballynease museum of GAA. “Gavin Diamond came off the shoulder, I flicked it to Gavin and it became a two versus one. He put it into Chubberwho put it into the back of the net.” Cassidy and McNally, interviewed separately, both speak with a laugh of Scullion swinging his jersey over his head in celebration. “I will never forget Peter Docon the terrace, jumping up and down. At that stage, you knew you had it. There is no better feeling when you have trained your whole le to try and win something,” Cassidy enthused. For McNally, it was always about learning from defeats and the steeliness it helps to generate. “I always tell people its not all badit makes you come back the following year that bit more determined.” It took Scullions goal to cement the result. Some years later, Ciaran lost his fatherand mothersuddenly but he clearly remembers his father telling of the sheer joy on the Clones steps, as Bellaghy eventually ended their Ulster losing streak. “The supporters were so disappointed in previous years. To have that picture in your head, of us being home and hosed, it was special.” At the final whistle, McNally embraced goalkeeper Ciaran Donnelly before being whisked off to the presentation area by an Ulster Council official. After years in the Ulster wilderness, the Tones skipper stood alone, before bellowing into the microphone to urge the throngs of joyous royal blue clad players and fans to join him. McNally didnt tempt fate. No speech was prepared, but two things came flooding back. He firstly made sure to commiserate with Errigal Ciaran. He knew the drill, having had one hand and four fingers of the other on the Seamus McFerran Cup before McEntee, Moley and Short – on three separate occasions - pulled it out of Bellaghys grasp. He also had a sincere word of thanks for Seamus Birt and Colm McElwee who took an awful lot of abuse following defeats to Cross and Enniskillen. “I hope you are as quick to come forward and thank them,” McNally told the Bellaghy faithful. “They done a lot of work, won us three-in-a-row and an Ulster.” Following the customary post game meal in Paudge Quinns restaurant, the team bus – rocking from the sing-song inside – rolled into the middle of Bellaghy. The players marched up to Muldoons shop and back to the Diamond, before heading to the club to celebrate long into the night. “Those are the nights you will never forget,” Cassidy insists. “There is no tomorrow, just endless partying, craic and everybody is in good form. There is something special about waking up the morning after a club final. There is no hangover, you just cant wait to get to speaking to people and meeting your family.”  Ciaran McNally rasies the Seamus McFerran aloft in the Clones tunnel. His younger brother Ryanlooks on. In the All-Ireland semi-final, they were defeated by eventual winners Crossmolina. It was an emotion Bellaghy knew only too well. Crossmaglen , Ballinderry and St Galls also beat the Tones on their way to lting the Andy Merrigan Cup. Patrick McAndrews goal gave the Mayo men a - to - interval lead. With eight minutes to go, two Gavin Diamond points had the margin down to two points before Ciaran McDonald was sprung from the bench. “He was carrying an ankle injury, but the next thing he came on and fired over a couple of absolute reevers and they beat us by four,” states Joe Cassidy, who one of Bellaghys only two scorers that day. Later that night, in the wee small hours, Ciaran McNally sat out on the swing in the family garden. Staring into oblivion, until the birds began to chirp. It was time to reflect. “I just couldnt go into the house,” he said. Despite people trying to soften the blow earlier in the night, McNally knew it was going to be a long way back. For Cassidy, he feels he speaks for everyone of that era - highlighting the regret of not winning an All-Ireland. “After that, managers came in and tried things and what youll find is...managers will generally get the blame, iniably from players – and I include myself in that,” Cassidy said. “It is only with experience and hindsight, you realise it had f**k all to do with management. It was to do with hunger and lots of us were making excuses.” Ballinderry beat them in , a final Bellaghy played better than their grind a year previous. First round defeats at the hands of the Shamocks and Glenullin prevented them from getting back to a decider until Slaughtneil beat them in the  final. Under the tutelage of Damian Cassidy, they realised that John McLaughlin wasnt a million miles away again. “One of his main attributes as a manager is his ability to get best that he can out of squads. Every night at training, he challenged you, states Joe, who was top scorer in the  championhship. Their - to - win over Loup in  took Bellaghy to  on the roll of honour. It was followed up by an Ulster win in Crossmaglen but that was the last hurrah in the winners enclosure. St Galls, with future Bellaghy boss John Rafferty at the helm beat them in an Ulster final. “Money couldnt buy what I got out of it,” McNally sums up of his career. “The only travesty about it is that you get too far down the line before you realise it. It was taken for granted.” “You see things now, with families all gathered aroundtaking photos...we didnt do that because we thought thats the way it was.” Its a regret. McNally got his hands on championship silver in four of the first five years of his senior career. “If I had a few lean years before it, you maybe wouldve knew to appreciate it,” he concludes. When Joe Cassidys lofted ball landed in the Moneymore goalmouth all those years ago and McNallys fisted goal brought silverware back to Ballynease, it was only the beginning of a journey to the steps of the Gerry Arthurs stand...a day when Bellaghy were kings of Ulster.

Michael OKane took on the role at St Colmcilles Primary School in Claudy after Easter this year, with schools already closed by the first Covid- lockdown. He was nominated for the award by parent Fiona Garrett, who told presenter Stephen Nolan that Mr OKane had helped her children with two particularly tricky transitions. “My son Matthew was transitioning from P to big school and my daughter Oacuterlagh-Janetransitioning from nursery to P,” she said. “My daughter has a statement of special educational needs. During lockdown, she became very distressed at the sudden change of routine and Mr OKane really helped with this. googletag.cmd.push “He did this by doing videos to show her where her new classroom was going to be, what it would look like, who her new classroom assistant was going to be and how to sanitise your hands properly. “He also helped my son with the P leaving transition. My son started becoming distressed at not seeing his friends and the fact they wouldnt get a last opportunity to all be together. “Mr OKane arranged a wonderful Year  leaving mass, where he shot a beautul photo and video of the group together with his drone. “Matthews short, but positive experience of Mr OKane actually inspired him to want to become a teacher now.” googletag.cmd.push Miss Garrett said Mr OKane had gone beyond the call of duty to make sure parents were looked after too, and said he was a special person. “He is so good with children who have special educational needs. He goes above and beyond, going that extra little step just to make everything run smoothly. That takes a special person,” she said. “He goes out of his way to be so approachable and friendly. “Hes in the thick of it with the children, showing them how to use their talents and getting the best out of everyone, including his staff. “He really cares for his school family. Absolutely anything is possible with the right support and Im so grateful.”     Michael admitted it was a shock to receive a call from Stephen Nolan, initially askinganything was wrong, but he regained his composure to pay tribute to the schools staff. “I only started here at Easter and I inherited a fantastic school with fantastic staff and I dont think Ive done too much myself – everybody in the school has really pulled together,” he said. “Im just looking out the window here on a dreary Monday morning and thats the sort of thing we need to hear. Im in shock here, but Id just like to thank the staff, and in particular Fionas childrens teachers. “Theres a fantastic team in Year  who made children feel comfortable in coming back to school. “Its been tough, but everybody has gone above and beyond from teachers, classroom assistants, our building supervisors and cleaners. “Im going to relay this to all the staff because it will lt everybodys spirits,” he added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Facilities at Watty Graham GAC, Glen, were damaged on Saturday night after a vehicle was driven onto the main pitch. The club, who experienced a similar incident just two years ago, posted images of the damage on their social media accounts on Sunday morning, branding those responsible as morons. “Yet again our facilities have been damaged by alcohol fuelled morons. Very dficult to understand their mentality. Experience suggests that the culprits didnt travel very far,” the post stated. Some of the damage caused at Watty Grahams GAC, Glen. googletag.cmd.push Mid Ulster District Councillor for the area, Brian McGuigan, said the vandalism was an attack on the entire community. “Watty Graham Park is a community facility paid for, maintained and run by the community,” he told the County Derry Post. “I am appalled that the playing surface, maintained all year round by the dedicated volunteers at Watty Graham GAC has been extensively damaged by culprits who not only attacked the GAA facilities but have attacked the entire community. “The club volunteers of Watty Grahams have been working tirelessly alongside community groups within Maghera, helping the elderly and vulnerable during the pandemic. googletag.cmd.push “This is a community working together and a community that is angry at the latest act of anti-social activity to blight the area. “It is unbelievable that a person or persons would carry out such a mindless act of vandalism on the community and the facilities. These people need to wise up and get off the communitys back.” Fellow councillor Martin Kearney also condemned the vandalism. “I deplore the recent vandalism to the Watty Grahams Pitch,” he said. “This is not the first time they have been attacked in this way. It is very disappointing when they have served the wider community so faithfully during the ongoing pandemic.     Police appeal A police spokesperson said they were aware of the incident and appealed to anyone with information to come forward. “Police in Magherafelt are appealing for information about criminal damage caused to a football pitch on Falgortrevy Road, Maghera sometime over the weekend,” they said. “It is believed that between pm on Saturdayand pm on Sunday , entry was gained to the grounds of a sports club. “A vehicle is believed to have been driven onto the pitch, performing manoeuvres that caused damage to the grass. “Enquiries are continuing, and we are appealing to anyone with information about this incident to call us on .” Information about the incident can also be passed on to investigating officers through the reporting section on the PNSIs website.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Students save a considerable amount of time by using the laneway to get to and from school.The former Down Council attempted to secure funds to upgrade the laneway and carry out a much-needed resurfacing and lighting scheme but liaising with representatives from a number of statutory agencies including the Housing Executive and Roads Service, the ownership issue could not be firmly established.Describing the laneway as a ldquovital link for residents who live at the Langley Road area in particular, Cllr Walker hopes that, with the publicrsquos help, he can find out who owns the land.ldquoThere are several street lights along part of the laneway but the Department for Infrastructure insists that it is not responsible for the land, he said.Cllr Walker says it is necessary to find out who owns the laneway as work is starting to upgrade Ballynahinchrsquos masterplan which includes a number of new walking trails in and around the town.ldquoWhy not include Beedhamrsquos Lane in the planned trails andwe could find out who this piece of ground it could pave the way for its upgrade, he continued.ldquoPeople could be forgiven for thinking that it leads to a farm. Given that we are in the midst of winter, the laneway is an awful state and children who are walking to school are literally getting covered in mud.Cllr Walker has suggested that it would not cost a signicant sum of money to upgrade the laneway which he suggests has the potential to become a key component of the townrsquos planned new walking trails.ldquoIf anyone can help me identy who is responsible for this piece of land could they contact either myself, the Langley Road Residentsrsquo Association or Newry, Mourne and Down Council, he said.Cllr Walker added: ldquoThe upgrade of this particular laneway has been raised on numerous occasions in the past, but nothing has ever been done.ldquoGiven the high volume of pedestrian traffic which uses it, itrsquos important work gets underway to upgrade it.ldquoIn seeking to find out who owns the laneway I hope that it can be determined of this particular piece of ground is a registered right of way..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd December 2020 Caldwell.jpg","title":"Caldwell’s goal seals cup win  ","story":"DOWNrsquoS U- hurlers will have cause to celebrate Christmas with a little more cheer after they clinched the Peadar Oacute Laithaacutein Cup with a two-point win over Meath in Navan on Sunday.Two minutes into injury time, and with the sides deadlocked at - apiece, it looked aswe were heading to extra time when Ryan Byas struck over a wonderful m sideline.Meath looked to have sealed victory from a doggedly tough Down side with virtually the last play of the contest.However, straight from the resulting puck-out Michael Dorrian raced clear of midfield and floated the sliotar towards the edge of the box.Francis Caldwell reached highest and as he slipped past both Cottrell and Ennis in defence.A deftly-placed one handed flick out-foxed Jack Fagan as he lunged out to intercept the sliotar. He could only watch on but as it bypassed his attempts and nestled in the back of the Meath net.Finn Turpin opened the day with the first score of the game inside a minute. Downrsquos captain, Tom McGrattan, knocked over a free a minute later, but by the end of the first quarter Meath were in front as midfielder Joey Cole got the next three scores.McGrattan levelled matters from play shortly afterwards, as both defences were kept busy.On several occasions in the first half, Down threatened the Meath rearguard as goal chances went begging with James Clarke, Michael Dorrian and Caldwell all having attempts saved, blocked or bundled away from danger.Down struggled in the middle of the park and found it hard to win any puck-outs against a physically strong Meath team.They did though throw themselves into every tackle. Jarlath McCollum, Deaglan Mallon and James Higgins played out of their skins, harrying, hustling and shutting down any potential danger as Meath tried in vain to breach the Down defence.A McGrattan free and a Caldwell point saw Down edge into a two-point lead in a very scrappy final ten minutes of the half.With less than three minutes to the whistle, Meath hit a purple patch with four unanswered scores, two courtesy of the dangerous Ryan Byas and the others from corner men Rory Fagan and Josh Harris.Playing with a slight breeze in the first half, Meath knew thatthey were to ensure a victory on home soil, they would surely need some daylight between themselves and their northern opponents before the change of ends.Thankfully for Down, Turpin, Dorrian and Clarke kept Meath on their toes as they eventually managed to engineer the last score of the half.Oisiacuten Coulter popped the sliotar over from out near the side-line to leave just two points between the sides at the end of the half.Within the opening two minutes of the restart, Oisiacuten Coulter continued a good vain of form and had the sides level for the fth time, as both sides refused to yield.Joey Cole pointed four minutes later as the Royals introduced Matthew Cully to full forward, his introduction would breathe new le into their attack.Down initially struggled to handle the burly full forward, who ended the day with three superbly-taken points whilst under severe pressure from their Ulster counterparts.The lead changed hands again as two McGrattan frees and a Michael Dorrian point gave them a slight edge with the game fast approaching the second water break.A Jack Meagher score, followed swtly by Matthew Cullyrsquos first of the day, when he picked Downrsquos pocket after a quick puck-out had failed to reach its intended target, shook Down. Instead of leading going down the home straight, it was level at - each.With  minutes played Denis Darby won a sideline for the home side and when Byas hit the sweetest of strikes straight over Pearse Smythrsquos crossbar there were scenes of jubilation and euphoria from the Meath bench as surely it looked asJustin Coyne would be presented with the cup.Sean Young had this young Down side well drilled and it was a credit to the teamrsquos spirit that within the next  seconds Downrsquos goal machine, Francis Caldwell ensured that it would be a victory for Down in the strangest of seasons five days before Christmas.After seeing Tom McGrattan lt the cup, a delighted Young was magnanimous in victory and praised Meath for the high standard of Hurling that made this contest such a thriller.ldquoWe knew coming into the game today this would be a very dferent challenge than last week, he said.ldquoMeath are always a big strong physical side with a spread of talented Hurlers in their ranks. We knew it wasnrsquot going to be easy to play them in their back yard, it was going to be a monumental task to get over the line.ldquoI thought the game was nip and tuck in the first quarter as our main objective was not to concede any early goals playing against a stf breeze in the first half.

He had lived in London most of his le, leaving Saul at the age of .Engaged to be married, but struggling to find the right ring, he found himself back in Northern Ireland on business he decided to call on his uncle Will, his only surviving Irish relative.It was the eve of the longest night of the year, a few days before Christmas, and a bitterly cold late afternoon. On the side of a rural road, devoid of street lights, all but hidden by trees, was an old fashioned car, with smoke escaping from its engine.Standing beside the car, kicking it was a young woman in a bridal dress. She appeared to be beating up the motor. Jim applied the brakes of his vehicle and rolled down the window.lsquoCan I help rsquo The young woman looked at him with burning blue eyes, turned away and thumped the boot. lsquoUseless piece of junk,rsquo she shrieked. The young woman attempted to give the car one last kick, missed and ped with a thud on to her rear. Jim got out of his car. Trying not to laugh he rushed over to the young woman and attempted to help her to her feet.She pulled her arm away and with an effort dragged herself up using the carrsquos half open door. She ripped of her shoe and attacked the window screen. She turned to Jim. lsquoWhat do you know about fixing cars rsquo Jim shrugged.The bride pierced him with fiery blue eyes.lsquoAre you going to a fancy dress party rsquo he asked. lsquoI am going to be married,rsquo she replied. She banged the roof of the car with her shoe a number of times, hopping about attempting to put the shoe back on to her foot. lsquoLet me give you a lt,rsquo suggested Jim.In order to steady herself the bride hung on to Jimrsquos shoulder and finally won the battle of the shoe. lsquoThought yoursquod never ask.rsquo She lashed out at the motor with her fist, missed, spun around and fell into Jimrsquos arms.Saul Church was only a mile away. The lady could not walk to her own wedding, besides it was growing dark. She grabbed his coat in near panic. lsquoMy ring,rsquo she cried. lsquoIrsquove lost my engagement ring!rsquo She dropped on to her knees. lsquoThis is a nightmare and you are not helping.rsquoJim walked at speed to his car and grabbed a torch as the bride crawled around the ground, feeling the earth in a vain attempt to retrieve the ring. Jim ed and shone the torch about the trees and grass. She grabbed his leg and pointed towards her car.lsquoItrsquos cursed, the car is cursed, and so are you.rsquo She bit him on the knee. lsquoGet off me,rsquo he shouted. She sat back on a muddy mound. lsquoI may have overreacted,rsquo she said. lsquoIs my lipstick smudged rsquo She wiped her hand across her lips. rsquoI think it might be smudged.rsquoJim did not answer, choosing to rub his knee, shine the torch, find the ring and hightail it to his unclersquos house as fast as possible. lsquoItrsquos all go,rsquo she said, trying to make conversation. lsquoIf my father could see me now, he would be so proud.rsquo The young woman adjusted her veil. It slowly drooped on to the side of her head and from there drted towards her lap. She picked it up and tossed it away.Jim located the ring beside the front wheel. lsquoIrsquove got it, Irsquove got the ring.rsquo He retrieved it and gave it a amateur polish. It was silver with an small amber stone as its centre piece. He read the inion lsquoTo M.K, Saul rsquo. It must have been handed down through her intendedrsquos family.lsquoYou great big sexy man. The bride jumped to her feet. Well done.rsquo She kissed him on the nose. lsquoItrsquos a lovely ring,rsquo said an embarrassed Jim. lsquoI am engaged, havenrsquot got the ring yet.rsquoThe bride grabbed the ring and placed it on to her finger lsquoThen you had best get a move on, you donrsquot want to lose her.rsquo She took out a hanky and blew her nose with considerable force.Jim noticed in the torch light that she was muddy and dishevelled, her face and red hair littered with spots of mud.lsquoYou donrsquot have a driver rsquo he asked. lsquoSmelly little man, didnrsquot trust him, kicked him out a mile or so back,rsquo she replied. Jim had spotted a somewhat sad looking gentleman on the road a few minutes before. lsquoShall we go rsquo asked the bride, as she gathered up her dress and walked towards his car, tripping over her loose shoe, all the while muttering under her breath.They didnrsquot speak much during the short trip to the church lsquoYes, I am looking for a ring. Where did you get yours rsquo Jim inquired.                                                                    lsquoYou like it rsquo asked his odd passenger as she struggled in vain to apply lipstick. Jim smiled and nodded his head. The bride inspected her ring lsquoItrsquos very nice, expensive,rsquo she boasted. lsquoWas it handed down through your fianceacutersquos family rsquo The bride didnrsquot reply. lsquoI live in London, I am visiting my uncle Will, do you know him, Will OrsquoBrien rsquoJim noticed that the young lady was gazing out of the window, looking slightly lost, she was not in the mood for conversation. The car came to a halt outside the little church. Warm lights beamed from inside. Jim thought it was an odd time of day to get married and a strange time of year. A few indistinct people stood around the grounds of the church.The bride opened the door, lsquoIrsquom here,rsquo she said and fell out of the car, lsquoIrsquom alright,rsquo she said painfully, stood up and slipped. Steadying herself, she kicked his car and her shoe dropped off. She picked it up and without so much as a thank you, disappeared, muddy and wet, into the church, resembling a worn-out scarecrow more than a bride. Jim waited a moment before driving off.Uncle Will and Jim talked and joked as they caught up with all the news over tea and cake. lsquoDid you ever meet Maureen Walsh rsquo asked Uncle Will. Jim shook his head as he helped himself to an extra slice of cake.Your grandfather was meant to give her lt to her wedding. She and he didnrsquot hit it off.rsquoUncle Will poked the dying embers of the fire. lsquoHe wasnrsquot one for bathing,rsquo he mumbled under his breath.lsquoShe died a few hours ago. Her husband called around almost at once to see me, gave me this for you. How he knew yoursquod be here is beyond a mystery.rsquoUncle Will handed Jim a small box. He opened it. To his surprise it was a engagement ring, silver with a small amber jewel at its centre. Jim focused his eyes and read the inscription lsquoTo M.K, Saul .rsquo Uncle Will popped a bun into his mouth. lsquoYour young ladyrsquos called Mary Kane rsquo lsquoMaureenrsquos maiden name was Keenan, She married her husband back in, let me think...rsquo Jim closed the little box. lsquoAt Saul Church, Christmas ,rsquo he replied. His uncle was amazed. Jim had his ring.

It was slightly bizarre, as one was a track and field meet, and the other a cross country race.As most of us donrsquot know what day it is, let alone which month, this blending of two dferent seasons seemed acceptable to many.The ANI Winter Track Series, spread over two nights, included a range of distances with East Down ACrsquos Neil Curran opting to give the km a blast. He has mostly been training solo since March and was glad of the opportunity to mix with some speedy competitors.He raced well and was pleased with third place in his heat. He recorded a time of .. which is only five seconds off his PB for the distance and proves that he remains in good form, despite the lack of racing to keep him sharp.In  his attempts at this distance exceeded the  minute barrier so this represents commendable progress overall. Keep at it Neil.The first cross country event of the  autumn season was also the last of the year. The Bobby Rea Memorial had been scheduled and rescheduled as restrictions rose and fell, but finally got away on Sunday at the Billy Neill playing fields in Comber.There was a limit on the entries and waves were allocated to permit social distancing. Sadly there were no spectators allowed. East Down AC had only three runners taking part as the change of date had affected overall attendance.The first to test the underfoot conditions were the senior men with Aaron McGrady representing East Down.The race got underway after a short period of silence in honour of John McKeag, the Ballydrain Harriers stalwart who sadly passed away the previous Monday in his th year.Aaron had hoped to fit in this particular race as a marker for his form ahead of the Intermediate Championships scheduled for mid-January but now likely to face abandonment due to the lockdown proposed to be implemented for six weeks after Christmas.The race consisted of two laps of .km each, the shorter distance designed, like the ision of the runners, into waves of up to a maximum of  runners each, to prevent mass overtaking to comply with social distancing requirements.As only half of the over  entries turned up, it was necessary to use only two waves.Aaron was drawn in the first wave alongside the faster runners and though he prefers to start relatively slowly and then set out to catch those in front, he doubtedit would be possible on this occasion so he was well to the fore from the off and came through at the end of the first lap in fourth place.However he stuck with his pre-race plan and when the runners re-appeared at the end of lap two, he was in third place behind Mark McKinstryand Craig McMeechan , and comfortably maintained his position until the finish line.He said afterwards that he was happy with how the race had gone and had no regrets about his tactics. The first three recorded times were ., . and . respectively, which is pretty hot running on a cross country course that was holding a fair amount of overnight rain. Well done Aaron.The second race was for senior and masters women and East Down AC again had only one representative mdash the ever-enthusiastic Sharon Madine.Sharon started conservatively in the second of the two waves, but proceeded to make steady progress and at the end of her two laps she had a time of . against her name. When the results of both waves were combined she placed overall th but first in the over- category. Well worth the efforts Sharon.The third and final event of the day was for Male Masters and again a sole East Down AC runner mdash the evergreen Dee Murray. Another who seems to have lost none of his competitive edge during the pandemic, Dee simply turns up and runs as hard as he can.On Sunday this meant that his time of . gave him th place overall and second in the over- category. Well done Dee.In spite of the absence of spectators, all who turned up said that it was well organised and they were glad to have taken part. As one of the few interested official observers, I have to agree with that.Sandwiched between these two events was the East Down AC annual Xmas predicted K at the Downshire Estate on Thursday evening.This is a fun event where runners try to guess how long they will take to cover the distance and then without a watch or other timing device do their best to match it. With the emphasis on accuracy and pacing rather than speed the way is wide open for all to snatch the prize.The top five were impressively close to their predicted times with fth place going to Johnny Holmes, who was seven seconds out. Deirdre Weatherall and Colin Shields tied for third equal - each with a five-second deficit.Seamus Savage was four seconds off his guess, which was good going, but it would have been hard to beat the winner Maureen Kelly who was a mere one second to the better of her guess. She was delighted to top the table and over the moon to find that her prize was a hamper of goodies as well as a pound voucher for Bells Supervalu Crossgar. Congratulations Maureen.Even though the runners had to be split into waves and social distancing was enforced, it was the best that was on offer due to current circumstances and it was a good boost to club morale. Instead of charging the normal entry fee, members were asked to donate food items which have been duly delivered to the Fountain Foodbank in the town.All in all it was a successful night for all concerned and an uplting end to a less than inspiring .

The enthralling cup tie ended - after  minutes with the sides locked at - after extra-time at Hampden Park.Hazard, who was recently handed the number one jersey by Hoops boss Neil Lennon, made both his European and Scottish Premiership debuts and retained the starting jersey for Sundayrsquos final.The stopper mdash who has also forced his way into the Northern Ireland international squad mdash was delighted to play a major part in his sidersquos cup final victory.And while his current contract expires in the summer which allows him to negotiate with other clubs in January, should he favour a move away from Celtic Park, leaving the club he has supported since he was a boy is the last thing on his mind.Conor described Sundayrsquos cup final as ldquocrazy day for him and his family who watched the match at home.ldquoThree weeks ago, I would never have been able to picture what happened there on that pitch, he said moments after his penalty shoot-out heroics.ldquoI am just absolutely over the moon. Irsquove been a Celtic fan my whole le and to get this opportunity, well I am just delighted, he said.ldquoTo play for such a worldwide club, we know what the fans expect and how much they drive us towards winning. It is an honour to play for them. I want to fully focus on each match, playing week in, week out here at Celtic, and hopefully it will come together.Conor said the final was a ldquomomentous day for him and his family, explaining that his lsquophone hasnrsquot stopped ringing.Conor grew up in Downpatrick and developed his skills in the Celtic academy, travelling across to Scotland for games from a young age.ldquoThe club means everything to me, he said. ldquoWe used to get up at am to get on the boat to go to matches and we wouldnrsquot be home until three the next morning. Itrsquos something I always dreamed of growing up.Conor has spent several spells out on loan in recent years in order to build-up his first team experience, readying him for a career between the sticks for Celtic.He got his chance to impress against Lille and Kilmarnock r as Celticrsquos form hit a rocky patch, but being selected by Lennon for the win over Hearts at Hampden Park was a huge confidence boost.ldquoI have to thank all of the staff and the manager for putting trust in me, said Conor.ldquoIt was a huge honour in such a big game. Thankfully, I was able to repay that trust with the two penalty saves. I have put a lot of work in and gone on loan spells waiting for my chance. The coaches have helped me a lot throughout the club.Sundayrsquos cup win clinched the domestic treble for Celtic for the fourth successive campaign, something that has never before been achieved. It is also the th time Celtic have been crowned Scottish Cup winners, with the Downpatrick man admitting the team has a lot of work to do to try and achieve its aims and targets this year.ldquoThe final was only my third game for the club, so Irsquom taking each day as it comes. As a team and as a group, this win could be a major factor in turning things round, he added.Conorrsquos family watched his cup final heroics at home in Downpatrick as fans were not allowed to attend the match due to coronavirus restrictions. However, they were over the moon with his achievements.ldquoI donrsquot think I have any fingernails left after that, laughed his beaming dad Gary. ldquoWe didnrsquot know up until the last minutehe would get the nod to play or not. We knew he did well in the European game and certainly made a case for himself. He only found out on Thursday from Lennon that he would be playing.Whilst there was undoubted pride from his dad, Gary said Conor has deserved his break due to how hard he has worked.ldquoHe has put so much time into Celtic over the years and done all the right things. All the close family are so proud of him, his mum Pauline, his younger brother Jack. He was superb.ldquoConor very much wants to be able to go on and make himself number one for Celtic. He is only  and this was just his third appearance, so hersquos been doing well. He had a loan spell at Dundee and did very well there and that has put him in good stead.Gary said Conor has also been drawing high praise from his Northern Ireland manager Ian Barraclough after breaking through for the senior team too.ldquoBarraclough has spoken really highly of Conor. He did very well for him when he was the manager at under-age level and the boss knows what he can do in training, he said.Conorrsquos family are no strangers to sporting success either.

They will be hoping that he [the abuser] will be OK, she explained.ldquoI have seen over the years that women and children develop this radar with antennas scanning all the time to judge his mood, howrsquos he walking, howrsquos he eating, scanning constantly all the time, thinking is it safe, is he OK, are we annoying him  It will not matter as he is only one who can control his behaviour.While Eileen is keen to highlight that Womenrsquos Aid will provide   help to women, she also wants to dispel some myths about domestic abuse and violence and to talk about coercive control mdash any act or a pattern of acts of assault, threats, humiliation and intimidation or other abuse that is used to harm, punish, or frighten victims.ldquoOne of the main things we do for women when they come into the service is to help her understand that there was not anything she did as therersquos nothing she could have done which would have stopped him, she said.ldquoWe have women who have had to beg to have a shower and we have women who phone us who are literally hiding in a hedge as hersquos walking up and down the street trying to find her.ldquoA lot of us think its black eyes and broken bones but the real damage is the psychological torture that is going on where women and children are terrorised in their own home. They are led to believe that everything is all their fault, they are at the root cause of whatever incident. When you are living with that  , you are only surviving.Womenrsquos Aid recently launched an awareness campaign called lsquoUnlock Your Lockdownrsquo to highlight their services to women who are living in fear or under threat.Eileen said: ldquoI would say that any woman who is worried at how she is going to get through Christmas andit is to do with her partner, then I would say to ring us and have a chat. We donrsquot force anybody into the service and we donrsquot make women leave home, thatrsquos always their choice.ldquoWhat we do is to work with her and help her to determine where she is and whatrsquos the best option for her. It can be either just one phone call to her engaging in full services for anything up to two years.She stressed that the first thing Womenrsquos Aid do when a women calls them is to assess the risk she and her children are in.ldquoThe first we do is assess the risk, to find out how safe she is, where she is, where her children are, what is the immediate priority  she stressed.ldquoDepending on the level of risk, we may had to do several dferent things. It could be that a woman is hiding out at a family member or friendrsquos house, so it might involve the police or social services.Then we try to manage the risk and reduce it as much as possible and then we try and work with out how best to help her move forward and to keep her safe. For the top % of women who come to us, we would hold a Multi-Agency Risk Assessmentconference and then we would work with them on a continuous basis.ldquoHowever, I would like to stress there is no such thing as low level risk of domestic abuse for women because the only person who is in control of whether that risk is high, low or medium is the perpetrator.She is dismissive of abusers where an incident of abuse involves either drink or drugs.ldquoIf you keep terrorising the people that you love and continually use the excuse of alcohol or drugs I donrsquot buy that, said Eileen.ldquoWhat drink and drugs to is give him an excuse for violence. When itrsquos over he will say it was the drink or whatever.

People who do not qualy on grounds such as having a sibling will lose out on a place, which is profoundly unfair.The grammar schools themselves, and their supporters, share some blame for the current situation. Aside from a handful of people, such as the academic Dr William Kitchen on these pages , there has been a serious failure to challenge the emotional rhetoric around testing.Northern Ireland needs grammar schools, albeit perhaps a smaller number of them. It also needs outstanding non grammar schools. There should not be a winner-takes-all system.Meanwhile, it is good to hear teachers such as the retired principal Hugh McCarthy, opposite , to the head of St Ronan’s Primary School in Newry, Kevin Donaghy, speak up about what the latter describes as the “disaster” of school closures.We need always to be mindful of that disaster. Instead of thinking in terms of long closures and cancelled summer exams, we need to think in terms of getting pupils back to class as soon as is practicable.• Dr William Kitchen: Grammar schools in Northern Ireland are right to stand by academic selection• Hugh McCarthy: Education is le-changing and it is shameful to deny it to children• Closing NI schools a disaster for children – principal• Dr William Kitchen: Scrapping the transfer test this year could be the end of grammar schools in NI• Ben Lowry: Covid will be used to undermine grammar schools——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Is it beyond us to deliver a project which would have the potential of bringing our people together as well as positively selling Northern Ireland to the wider world I propose that work be commissioned to examine the potential for a regional sports museum to be builtwhere there exists the necessary infrastructure to build such a facility and connect it to local visitors but also for those arriving internationally.\"Another Northern Ireland sporting great Joey DunlopOver the years Northern Ireland and our people have punched well above our weight in terms of sporting success. Whether that be road racing, horse racing and show jumping, golf, athletics, boxing, snooker, rugby, inidual footballers we’ve produced, the talent within Gaelic football and hurling etc.We are also home to other rich sports such as handball, road bowls, rounders and we have a proud history of success and development opportunities for those competing in disability based sports and events.In Joey Dunlop, George Best and Alex Higgins we have arguably the most naturally gted in their respective sports.But there are so many other iconic iniduals and teams who have excelled over the last century, bringing joy and positivity to this place, our people and also helping position Northern Ireland’s place in the world, securing the respect and admiration of others along the way.Such a museum could play host to preserving magical moments like the Dennis Taylor  snooker final black ball finish, Mary Peters heroics on the track, Joey Dunlop and Jonathan Rea on the back of motorcycles, our Golfers winning majors, Ulster Rugby heroics, AP McCoy Champion Jockey, our warriors in the ring and the many special Ulster County and Club performances which saw successes at Ulster Provincial and all-Ireland level etc.So my question is: do our leaders genuinely want to celebrate success and the achievements of the incredible people who make up this place  If so then a golden opportunity to do something about it exists.

It said it was working “to get these back on the shelves as quickly as possible and direct customers to alternatives where we can”.In Sainsbury’s large Forestside store in south east Belfast an entire aisle of vegetables was virtually empty and – as revealed by this newspaper yesterday – hundreds of items are disappearing as they sell out and being replaced on an emergency basis by products sourced locally, including own-brand produce from rival supermarket Spar.Read More Read MoreDays after Brexit, many products vanish from Sainsbury’s in Northern Ireland and...To a lesser extent, there were signicant gaps in Marks  Spencer’s Forestsidefood store and in Lidl’s Castlereagh Road store.A spokesman for MS said that they had been well-prepared for Brexit and their stores were “receiving regular deliveries”.\u2028Two months ago MS set up a single “export centre”in Motherwell to handle all of its deliveries to Northern Ireland and the Republic.Asda said that it had“not experienced any issues in getting Asda lorries across the [Irish Sea] border following the end of Brexit transition period” and so “this isn’t the reason for any availability issues”.At the other end of the grocery spectrum, small business Causeway Organic supplied about  households on the north coast with vegetable boxes– until receiving an unexpected message on Monday.Owner Jonathan Owens, who said he had spent months nurturing the business, was forced to email his customers on Monday night to say that his importer had told him “there is an extra layer of red tape they were previously unaware of on top of what I’d already gone through involved in bringing the pallet across into NI”.Last night Mr Owens told the News Letter that he had been forced to suspend his business and would be refunding his customers.He said: “The impression I got from the people helping me in Belfast to manage orders was the [customs] commodity codes was all that was required to get vegetables through ports.”Now as I understand it you need aphytosanitary certicate for each and every item on the pallet, which would potentially double the cost of every item.”Mr Owens said that he was still hopefulthat he could find another supplier, but added: “If it just becomes insurmountable, then bluntlythat’s the end of the business.”He expressed derision for the Secretary of State’s public insistence that “there is no border in the Irish Sea”.He added: “It’s incredibly hard not to be angry. Idon’t think people who ushered this in thought it through beyond a bit of flag-waving.”:Irish Government did secret deal with Gerry Adams to free IRA prisoners days after  ceasefire, declassied file revealsIrish Government deliberately did not condemn ceasefire murders by IRA in  to keep Sinn Féin on board, declassied file revealsUlster Farmers’ Union lobbied for ‘unequivocal’ government statement on beef safety – months before BSE link to humans, declassied file showsCivil servants paid equivalent of £, a day for advice from ex-civil servant, declassied file revealsGerry Adams was ignorant of basic Protestant views and didn’t think he had to persuade unionists to back a united Ireland: Declassied fileGovernment pondered renaming or giving away Stormont as it meticulously planned for the Good Friday Agreement, declassied files reveal——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityMike Kingston, who this week collected his long service medal to recognise the achievement, has shared his pride and some of his memories over the years.Mr Kingston, who is married and has two children and two grandchildren, joined Penarth RNLI on November  , as a volunteer crew member ndash and quickly progressed to become leboat helm.Along with his fellow volunteer crew members, he attended hundreds of incidents, launching day and night in all kinds of weather conditions, to go to the aid of people in trouble at sea.Since his retirement from being a sea-going member of the team, he has spent the last  years as shore crew and one of Penarthrsquos Deputy Launching Authorities, liaising with the coastguards when they request assistance, and managing the leboatrsquos launch.Mr Kingstonrsquos leboat career has extended beyond the UK. In , he was a member of a crew of just eight leboat volunteers from across the UK who flew out to aid the relief effort in flood-stricken Mozambique.Together, the team faced the dangers of crocodiles, hippos, poisonous snakes and anti-personnel mines, navigating rivers that had burst their banks, in a rescue mission to bring desperately needed medical relief to , people in villages marooned by flood waters.ldquoWe had five small D class inflatable leboats, and had to ferry doctors and medical supplies to areas that had been written off as impossible, as helicopters couldnrsquot land there and they were inaccessible by road, he said.ldquoIt was so hot that the soles of my boots melted. We had to spend the night on sandbars where we took turns to keep watch, as the crocodiles were very keen to join us.Since he joined the crew, Mike has combined his volunteering with his paid job in the South Wales Fire and Rescue service. He joined the service back in , at just , and progressed from his position as a firefighter, to the lead instructor for recruit training, finally finishing his career in  as Chair of the Water Rescue group, and a member of the servicersquos all Wales flood response team.Over the past four decades, -year-old Mr Kingston has seen huge changes in the way the RNLI operates.He has seen Penarth leboat station move from its original home in the deck chair store underneath the current Coffi Co building on the Esplanade, to its current location just up the road in a purpose built, modern leboat station.ldquoIrsquom sure the people of Penarth will remember the hand held maroons that were fired off by a leboat crew member to call the rest of us to the station for a launch, he said.ldquoBut even before that, I remember when the Pier Master would get us down to the station by firing the maroons out of a small cannon.ldquoNowadays, technology has moved on and we use pagers, mobiles phones and computer systems to respond to a shout.ldquoThese systems are a lot more sophisticated, but itrsquos still the same feeling when yoursquore called out of bed in the early hours of a freezing cold January morning.ldquoNo matter how times have moved on, one thing that remains constant is the unbelievable commitment of the whole RNLI team.ldquoThere have been so many highs and lows over the past  years. As all the team will know, itrsquos good to feel that yoursquore part of a team, giving something to your community.ldquoBut there have also been some sad times when people have lost their lives. Irsquom proud to have been a part of Penarth RNLI family.Thanking him for his  years of service, Jason Dunlop, Penarth Leboat Operations Manager said: ldquoOn behalf of all at Penarth leboat station, I would like to congratulate Mike on this fantastic achievement and thank him for his commitment and support to saving lives at sea over the last  years. We are all volunteers at Penarth RNLI, we give our time freely to support our local community.ldquoMikersquos contribution to the charity over the years has not only been volunteering his time, hersquos also been happy to share his wealth of experience with the crew as we train and work together when someone needs our help. Hersquos been a fantastic mentor to many and for that we thank him. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

You donrsquot come into palliative care to keep patients at armrsquos .She said the use of PPE had been dficult ndash especially during the heatwaves.She then had a further risk assessment which classed her as vulnerable, meaning she couldnrsquot be face to face with patients and her role changed again.She was drafted back to the clinical specialist team, but instead of seeing patients herself in their homes, she would see them virtually or speak to them over the phone.ldquoHaving been right up there with the patients, the role changed, and I couldnt see a face to face patient at all for about two and a half months, and we had to adapt to a whole new way of working.ldquoThe patients have adapted really well to it, and in some cases, I think some patients have found it better.ldquoOur patients are wonderful and even though they are palliative patients theyve got to make you a cup of tea, get the cakes ready, make sure the house is tidy and theyre not doing that now before the nurses come, because they can sit in a corner of the room and thats the only little corner I see.She will be working through the Christmas period, and last year worked on Christmas Day.ldquoPalliative care never stops, and Christmas is no dferent.ldquoWe are a service that needs to be here for our patients and we accept that, we come into nursing knowing youre going to be working some of these important days.She says her own family are flexible ndash as she encourages the families she cares for to be flexible ndash around moving Christmas celebrations.ldquoI think this year is going to be dficult more than other years, becauseyou know this is going to be your last Christmas and its restricted, perhaps cant go out for that big Christmas last lunch you wanted to have or you cant have as many relatives around your house as you would have liked to have had.Talking about her work on the charityrsquos information and support line, she added that there had been numerous calls, both related to Covid and about terminal illness in general, which she provides information to people about from a clinical perspective.The support line, which also includes trained officers and bereavement volunteers as well as Marie Curie Nurses, is open to patients, families and professionals who need to talk to someone about any aspect of dying, death and bereavement.Sharing her final thoughts at the end of , she said: ldquoWe had a lot of personal challenges in  in our family, we had a bereavement ourselves and I couldnt wait to see the back of  and said I cant wait for .ldquoI will never ever wish a year away again.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local community\"The increasing numbers of Covid- case numbers across Cardf and the Vale of Glamorgan Health Board area could not be any more serious or alarming.Therefore, this message needs to be acted upon urgently and be seen as a warning to each and every one of us about the seriousness of the health situation we are all now facing.If current projections continue, then by Christmas week we will be seeing more than four times the number of new infections each day, than we were seeing at the start of December. These projected figures are the highest we have ever seen in this County and are likely to reach almost , cases per , in the seven-day period up until Christmas Day.If you compare that with the figure of  cases per , when we entered the local lockdown, you can see how serious the current situation is. We can no longer be complacent.We know from the first and second waves that as case numbers increase, more people get seriously unwell, and we will inevitably see more deaths from Coronavirus - many of which can be avoided,we act now.We are deeply concerned that hospitals and primary care services across Cardf and the Vale of Glamorgan are now under unsustainable pressure due to COVID-, and sadly, but inevitably, the number of people who are becoming very sick is increasing daily.Each and every one of us has a responsibility to act now. We must all follow Welsh Government coronavirus regulations, butyou can also take further actions to protect those you love, then we urge you to do so.We should not meet with anyone outside our household bubble and keep contact with people outside our household to an absolute minimum until the current threat has passed, but especially in the run-up to Christmas.We know that staying away from loved ones will be painful for many, especially at this time of year, butwe do this now, we will be doing everything we can to protect our family and friends for the months to come.We know many people think that the vaccine is going to become more widely available, so everything is going to be okay. Regrettably, that is simply not the case. If we donrsquot change our behaviour now,many people will die before the vaccine is rolled out, people who donrsquot need to die, possibly people who you know.The full roll out of the vaccine will take many months, so now is not the time to be complacent. Very few of us are immune and the virus is still prevalent in our communities and our hospitals. By practising social distancing, washing our hands regularly and wearing face coverings we will all be doing our bit to help.So, our message is simple.Wash your hands regularly oryou canrsquot do that use sanitiser hand gel.Please try and stay at home and only go out for essential reasons andit is essential to go out, please do so in quieter periods.If you do go out, wear a mask when required and keep socially distanced by at least  metres, wherever possible.Please do not mix with other households or your friends.Work from home,you can do so.If you develop symptoms such as a new and continuous cough, a temperature, or a loss of taste or smell please self-isolate with your household and arrange a test.These small steps can really help us all to keep our communities safe.As a Health Board and Council, we are fully mobilised in the fight against COVID-. Doing so continues to be a huge challenge and is one that we will best achieve,we do it together, just as we did in the Spring.We are asking every one of you to achieve this challenge together.Letrsquos stop the spread, and letrsquos keep the Vale of Glamorgan, the NHS and our loved ones safe.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Hospitality businesses would have joined them on pm Christmas Day, with a level four lockdown coming into place on Monday, December . The five day lsquorelaxationrsquo period would have still been in place according to these rules, but a change from three households mixing to two.But on Saturday, December , all this changed as prime minister Boris Johnson held a press conference to update the UK on the rapid spread of the new strain of coronavirus and announcing that the South East of England, including London would be moved into tier four.Tier four means residents must stay at home with some limited exemptions ndash which includes workunable to do so from home, however, working from home is strongly advisedit is possible. Non-essential services must also close. People also must not enter or leave a tier four area.This also saw a change to Englandrsquos Christmas restrictions, with households banned from mixing, apart from single households, which would be allowed to form a bubble to avoid isolation.Areas in the lower tiers were still allowed to continue to mix with up to three households ndash however, only on Christmas Day.So, what did this announcement mean for Wales The announcement by the prime minister was focused specically on England, but it was followed by Walesrsquo first minister making an announcement of his own the same evening. He announced that the tier four lockdown would come into place from midnight on Saturday, December , meaning businesses had a matter of hours to come to terms with the news and people rushed out to do some last-minute Christmas shopping before all the non-essential retail closed.Some of the supermarkets across Wales have now taken their lsquonon-essentialrsquo items off sale.The festive period bubble rule has also changed, with a maximum of two households allowed to mix on Christmas Day.MORE NEWS:Mr Drakeford said in a statement on Saturday evening that the pattern of transmission in London and the South East of England, which is linked to the new iant of coronavirus, is ldquoremarkably consistent with the rapid acceleration of transmission in Wales in recent weeks.Also in the statement, the first minister said that latest evidence had suggested the new strain is present throughout Wales and that it needed an ldquoimmediate response.After meeting with the Welsh Governmentrsquos Cabinet on Saturday and taking into consideration advice from senior medical and scientic advisors, he said: ldquoThe situation is incredibly serious. I cannot overstate this.ldquoWe have therefore reached the dficult decision to bring forward the alert level four restrictions for Wales, in line with the action being taken in London and the South East of England.Dr Chris Williams, incident director for the Novel Coronavirusoutbreak at Public Health Wales said in a statement: ldquoAs indicated by the Welsh Government, the immediate introduction of new restrictions is related to the identication of a new more transmissible iant of Coronavirus. Public Health Wales has been working with UK partners to investigate and respond to this iant.ldquoIt is normal for viruses to undergo mutations, and we expect this to happen. Although the iant is easier to transmit, there is currently no evidence that it is more severe.ldquoWe are reminding people that all current guidance relating to Coronavirus continues to apply to the new iant, including advice relating to symptoms, social distancing, self-isolation, and vaccination.ldquoThe new iant shows up as positive in Public Health Walesrsquo existing Coronavirus tests, and people must continue to seek a test in the usual waythey develop Coronavirus symptoms.ldquoIf you or a member of your household develop a cough, fever or change in sense of taste or smell, you must self-isolate immediately and book a free Coronavirus test by calling .ldquoPublic Health Wales urges everyone to follow the rules, to avoid transmission of Coronavirus and to protect everyone in our communities, including the most vulnerable. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Not just from the virus but the isolation our response to it creates.So the Penarth Times will publish, online and in print, a list of support services - public organisations, charities, community groups and local volunteers - who are there to help in whatever way through this dficult time.And we are asking you to play your part by doing three things.First,you know an organisation or group that should be on our list, let us know and well add them so more people can benefit.If you know of a group doing good in your community, tell us so we can share their story and provide hope and inspiration.And, most importantly, think about who the people are in your community who you might be able to help, be it a card through the door or dropping off some shopping.
