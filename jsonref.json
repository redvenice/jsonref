[{"url":null,"title":"PIERS MORGAN Harry Meghan brought negative press yourselves","story":"Share this article I suspect this staggeringly privileged multi-millionaire prince\u0027s main worry each morning is instructing his servants in his palatial home as to how he wants his breakfast eggs cooked.But when you marry a Hollywood actress, then unfortunately, this kind of pathetic woe-is-me-me-me attitude often comes with the territory.In the next part of his statement, Harry really upped the pity ante, invoking the memory of his late mother Princess Diana.\u0027My deepest fear is history repeating itself,\u0027 he fumed, \u0027I\u0027ve seen what happens when someone I love is commoditised to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person. I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.\u0027Wow.I understand why Harry dislikes the press after what happened to his mother, truly I do.Her death must have been incredibly hard for him to take as a 12-year-old boy.But let\u0027s be very clear - the press didn\u0027t kill Diana, a speeding drunk-driver killed Diana.And if she hadn\u0027t recklessly abandoned her usual royal protection officers and drivers, she\u0027d probably still be alive today.         Prince Harry, and Meghan pose with their newborn son Archie on May 8 this year. The Duke of Sussex accused the press of \u0027bullying\u0027 and \u0027relentless propaganda\u0027Yes, she was the subject of huge press attention, but speaking from personal experience as a newspaper editor at the time, I can assure you she played the media game just as ruthlessly as we played it with her.She was the biggest star in the world, and would happily and regularly collude with the papers when it suited her – just as Meghan happily and regularly colludes with magazines like People and Vogue when it suits her.But with all due respect to Ms Markle, she\u0027s not in the same league as Diana in terms of fame.So for Harry to compare them in this way is both wrong and slightly distasteful. (And before the inevitable howls of \u0027you\u0027ve no idea what it\u0027s like to lose a parent young\u0027 pour in, let me just point out that my father died when I was very young.)         Meghan was guest editor of September\u0027s Vogue, dedicating it to 15 \u0027fearless women,\u0027 including Jane Fonda, Jacinda Ardern and Greta ThunbergHe added that he has been \u0027witness to her private suffering for too long\u0027 and \u0027to stand back and do nothing would be contrary to everything we believe in.\u0027Hmmm.It was only a few weeks ago that Meghan was telling people at a function that she never reads any press about herself. So how would she know what the press is saying, let alone suffer from it?As I\u0027ve often said, I have little time for Meghan after she ghosted me as a friend the moment she first met Harry. It signified a worrying social-climbing character trait that has seen her ditch many friends and almost all her family if she feels they may threaten her ferociously ambitious rise up the celebrity ladder.But what I think of her personally is irrelevant to the situation that actually sparked this battle with the media, and that is the breakdown of her relationship with her father.There\u0027s no doubt that Thomas Markle made a big mistake in stunting photos with the paparazzi before his daughter\u0027s wedding, as he has admitted himself.But did that really warrant him being banished forever in such a heartless manner?It\u0027s utterly extraordinary that Harry has never met his father-in-law, and that Meghan has now cut him out of her life.         Harry referenced his mother Princess Diana in his statement: \u0027My deepest fear is history repeating itself,\u0027 he fumed, \u0027I\u0027ve seen what happens when someone I love is commoditised to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person. I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.\u0027 He is seen above with her and Prince William I\u0027ve interviewed Thomas several times and found him to be a very normal and nice, if naïve, guy who just had no idea how to handle the massive vicarious fame that instantly came his way after Meghan announced she was engaged to a British Prince.Rather then help him, they savagely punished him for a silly mistake, and his erratic behaviour ever since suggests a father deeply hurt and bemused by losing any contact with the daughter he brought up with such love and care.Thomas Markle gave Meghan\u0027s letter to the Mail on Sunday because he wanted to correct what he believed was misleading criticism of him in People magazine from Meghan\u0027s friends.Judge him all you like for it, but imagine how tough the past few years have been for him too? He has never even met his own grandchild.Thomas has been no angel in this family wrangle, but nor is he the devil.And he should be allowed the freedom of speech to defend himself.Rather than going to war with the press in this absurd manner, Harry should clamber down off his hysterical hothead high horse and repair the real running sore causing Meghan\u0027s distress – by making peace with her father. "},{"url":null,"title":"Horrific footage shows man car dragging woman hair","story":"Share this article The woman screams \u0027get off me, please, get off me!\u0027 as the driver revs the engine and drives along the road, with the woman hanging by the side of the vehicle.The victim finally manages to escape his grasp and runs to the petrol station for help.

It far outstripped the pre-auction estimate of £1.5m-£2m.The auction was held in the same auction room where Banksy stunned the art world a year ago by activating a shredder moments after his Girl With Balloon sold for a little over £1m.The sale price for Devolved Parliament comfortably beats the previous auction record for a Banksy, which is thought to be the US$1.8m (£1.4m) for Keep It Spotless, which was sold at Sotheby’s in New York in 2008.Shortly after Devolved Parliament was sold, Banksy reacted on Instagram.“Record price for a Banksy painting set at auction tonight,” he wrote. “Shame I didn’t still own it.”It was lent earlier this year, by its anonymous owner, to a display at Bristol Museum marking both the exhibition’s 10th anniversary and Britain’s original planned exit from the EU on 29 March.At the time, Banksy wrote on Instagram: “I made this 10 years ago.

From curators with aggressively short fringes and witty spectacles to patronising artists on rural residencies, he sees them all.Williams is no ingénue – he represented Wales at the Venice Biennale – but the satirical drawings he drip-fed through Instagram over the last year have a fanbase all their own. The Welshman has made it impossible to see art-world gatherings as much other than an assemblage of his painfully accurate caricatures. But now the serpent has eaten its own tail: Williams’s drawings are at Frieze, the art fair at Regent’s Park in London, shown by Southard Reid. Make a beeline for its booth and you’ll see the fair through different eyes.While Frieze is short on actual laughs (year on year, there is less bad plastic surgery, fewer wild costumes and a scarcity of ill-advised stilettos) the art itself tells an upbeat story. As though in riposte to dark times, colour dominates. Gagosian Gallery’s huge booth sets the tone with a suite of paintings titled Helios by Sterling Ruby, a California-based artist popular with the fashion crowd. This season, it seems, is all about yellow and orange: Ruby’s paintings are so bright that standing mid-booth feels less like greeting the California dawn than being stuck inside a spacecraft hurtling toward the sun. A migraine hazard it may be, but Helios certainly gets the fair off to a colourful start.Donna Huanca at Simon Lee makes a more calming offer. The artist usually works with performers whose naked bodies become part of what she paints. Here, she creates a mesmerising environment in which the visitors are the performers. Highly textured blue paintings, some freestanding and hung with braids, sit in a low-ceilinged white space above mounds of white sand amid a pervasive scent derived from palo santo, the fragrant wood burned during ayahuasca ceremonies.An elegant engagement with yet more dazzling colour comes at Lisson, which has one of this year’s most striking booths: a memorial to its artist Joyce Pensato, who died in June. Pensato’s large, expressionistic portraits of pop-cultural characters, all painted in black on plain backgrounds, are shown between intensely coloured blocky abstract paintings by her friend Stanley Whitney. The works are beautifully balanced: apparently the display had been planned before Pensato’s death but she became too unwell to complete work for it. The gallery instead borrowed paintings from private collections (none are for sale) and the result is one of the most powerful booths at Frieze.There are bursts of colour everywhere, in fact. Strong, graphic paintings with beaded embellishment by the US artist Jeffrey Gibson pop up at both Sikkema Jenkins and Kavi Gupta. Recalling geometric textiles or printing patterns, Gibson’s works carry thoughtful mottos: “You Better Let Somebody Love You” or “Make Your Own Kind of Music”.Lehmann Maupin painted every panel of its booth a different jewel-bright shade to show suites of photographs by Robin Rhode. The South African artist’s shtick is a combination of street art and staged performance – a play of illusions in which the human body interacts with painted material blossoming across a surface. Here, he’s worked with dancers whose changing positions apparently generate transforming geometric patterns panel by panel.It is, it seems, a year for painting, and for figurative painting in particular. Among the young discoveries are 25-year-old Joy Labinjo, showing at Tiwani Contemporary. Inspired by a photo album showing her British Nigerian family in moments of celebration, Labinjo has teased out particularities and common threads, from the style of pose to combinations of patterns and groupings. Her compositions are evocative if deliberately awkward, a tone reflected in her titles: Everything Will Be Alright and A Celebration of Sorts.There are gorgeous new paintings from established British favourites. Lubaina Himid, who won the Turner prize in 2017 and recently had a triumphant exhibition in New York, has Traditional Three Tier Wedding Cake at Hollybush Gardens: two black men share the canvas, each in his own universe, set apart by the reflected light picked up on their skin – one all indigo blues and lavenders, the other yellows and lime greens.Sadie Coles HQ’s booth is fronted by a complex sculptural screen by Helen Marten that feels endlessly fascinating and enigmatic. (Screens seem rather a phenomenon this year – just the thing for the collector who loves paintings but has run out of wall space?) The curated section, titled Woven, seems less coherent than in previous years. There is very little linking these solo displays by non Euro-American artists working with textiles and fibre, beyond that initial premise, either technically or thematically.The late Pacita Abad’s bright paintings pay homage to erse immigrant communities in the US, capturing the energy of billboards, painted signs and busy streets. Her optimism is broadcast in the radiating LA Liberty (1992) a Latinx Lady Liberty in a patchworked and embellished robe, her torch beaming a multitude of colours. What thread connects this to Angela Su’s disquieting anatomical pictures embroidered in human hair (beyond the fact that both artists wielded a needle) is hard to discern.Once unfashionable, textile art has a big presence at the fair. As with the bright colours and tendency toward figurative painting, there is a suggestion here that we currently need comfort and reassurance. Certainly very little hi-tech new media art is being shown. Jack Shainman Gallery has ravelling wall hangings by rising Texan star Diedrick Brackens, recipient of recent awards from the Studio Museum in Harlem and at Frieze New York. PPOW have a great tapestry by Erin M Riley, whose painstaking handwoven works engage with the instant gratification of camera phone imagery: selfies, sexts, handbag spills, all the apparently ad hoc documentation of contemporary life. Reflections shows the artist’s lavishly tattooed body reflected in the mirror, like a butt-centric update of Velázquez’s 17th-century masterpiece Rokeby Venus.Continuing the #MeToo mood of last year, there are fewer arty photos of beautiful naked young women, and far more works in which female artists depict sex and the body on their own terms. Star prize for erotic idiosyncrasy goes to Urara Tsuchiya, whose cute ceramic dioramas of interspecies orgies (pandas are among the favoured participants) are a London art world favourite. Given free rein at Union Pacific’s booth, Tsuchiya has created a hotel room mid-dirty weekend, with ceramic bra-and-thong sets strewn all about, a minibar hanging open, complete with bottles of ceramic booze, and lampstands and bowls full of naughty couplings.Cute ceramic panda sex?

The bar was designed by Josef Hoffmann for the Wiener Werkstätte, a cooperative artistic workshop, and the recreation features about 7,000 ceramic tiles of different colours and motifs.“When we started the discussion everyone thought we were crazy,” said Ostende. “You want to recreate one of the most iconic pieces of the Wiener Werkstätte? Nobody has done that before, it’s impossible. You don’t have enough archive, enough evidence. It was a real challenge.”The Cabaret Fledermaus, with its Gesamtkunstwerk (total work of art) design, opened in 1907 but it endlessly struggled to make money and was forced to close in 1913.Ostende said the show was about celebrating the importance of places such as Cabaret Fledermaus that had often ended up being footnotes in art history.Spanning from the 1880s to the 1960s, 12 venues around the world are featured, offering an alternative history of modern art, according to the curators. They range from Le Chat Noir in Paris, with its theatrical shadow plays, to Rasht 29, a meeting place of avant-garde painters and poets in Tehran, which opened in 1966.Other interior recreations in the show include a room from Theo van Doesburg’s L’Aubette in Strasbourg, a huge entertainment complex labelled the “Sistine Chapel of abstract art”, which opened in 1928.Every Thursday evening during the exhibition’s run, the Aubette space will become a music venue co-curated by the jazz trumpet player Mark Kavuma."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67397832bfbff5a7912b9e357dbbcfd9c54cd670/0_89_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73debd412649434720d52037bdd93277","title":"prize winning photos of peace in pictures","story":"From climate activists to orangutan babies, these images capture peace efforts around the worldThese international awards for the best images of peace celebrate professional photographers who visualise what inspires hope.

The EU said it would retaliate.Gary Smith, the Scotland secretary of the GMB union, said the move represented a “troubling glimpse into the post-Brexit future” for the UK. “Scotland and the rest of the UK are sitting ducks after October 31st. The collective strength we have in the EU trading bloc will be gone and there is simply no such thing as a ‘special relationship’ with the United States – Trump will squeeze the UK economy for everything he can get,” he said.Scotch whisky exports to the US were worth £1bn last year, , supporting a wider industry employing 11,000 people across Scotland. Karen Betts, the chief executive of the Scotch Whisky Association, said the tariffs would put jobs and investment at risk. “Despite the fact that this dispute is about aircraft subsidies, our sector has been hit hard.”Airbus shares rose most on France’s CAC 40 index of leading companies, in a sign that investors had feared a stiffer sanction was possible.

Carnet discovered that it was in fact the last remaining 19th-century vespasienne urinal in the city. He decided he needed to save it.“It no longer conforms to the comfort standards of today,” he says of the urinal (an understatement). “But it’s a piece of heritage and it’s in a terrible state in the middle of the boulevard – it’s not possible to just leave it like that.”The urinal is “part of the great Parisian history of public sanitation,” he says, though he admits he’s never used it himself. “The participatory budget is an opportunity to give it a second youth.”Carnet’s project was one of 430 that went to public vote between 6 September and 22 September this year. Sadly for him, the vespasienne was not one of the 11 major projects and 183 smaller propositions that earned enough votes to become reality. Instead, Parisians chose projects that ranged from better recycling facilities to upgraded cycling infrastructure to programmes to help women who are experiencing homelessness.More than 140,000 people voted in the scheme, the sixth (and possibly last) time residents have been able to choose how the administration of mayor Anne Hidalgo spends a significant portion of its money.As usual, while the quixotic propositions tend to garner attention during the voting stage, it is the serious improvements to the city that tend to get funded, such as the €1.5m plan to upgrade cleaning facilities that won more than 37,000 votes last year, or the decision to send funds to a temporary migrant camp built on the outskirts of the city at the height of refugee arrivals to Europe.Paris’s deputy mayor for local democracy, Pauline Véron, says the vast majority of projects “aren’t bizarre or complicated – they’re serious. They can be original, a bit new or innovative, but they’re not harebrained.”The scheme was launched when Hidalgo came to power in 2014. At €45 per inhabitant, Véron says Paris runs the largest per capita participatory budget in the world. Overall, more than 1,800 inidual city improvements have been realised thanks to the public vote, Véron says.Thousands of proposals are submitted each year and must pass a feasibility study before qualifying for the vote. A plan to bulldoze Sacré-Coeur on the basis that it was an insult to the legacy of the 1871 Paris Commune was famously disqualified at this stage in 2017. (The city demurred not because the project would involve the permanent destruction of one of the most famous buildings in the world, but because the church belonged to the Archdiocese of Paris, and was hence outside its jurisdiction.)The programme was inspired by the city of Porto Alegre in southern Brazil, which successfully introduced a participatory budget in 1989 to tackle its rampant inequality. It is with the redistributive spirit of Porto Alegre in mind that Paris specifically allocates €30m of its participatory budget to working-class areas, Véron says.Despite this, the Paris incarnation lacks the radical spirit of the Brazilian scheme, says Gilles Pradeau, who is writing his PhD on participatory budgets at the University of Westminster. He notes that while a large part of the Porto Alegre budget was decided by residents, “what is critical in Paris about the making of the city is not done through participatory budgeting”.Still, the Paris scheme and one launched in Lisbon in 2008 have helped kick off a wave of imitators across Europe – similar projects are under way in Milan, Glasgow and Madrid. In France, the number of participatory budgets has doubled each year since 2014.With city elections set for March next year, it is not certain that Paris’s participatory budget will survive if Hidalgo, who has not yet announced her candidacy but who is widely expected to run, does not win re-election.Whatever happens in 2020, Véron says the budget will be an important part of Hidalgo’s legacy.And if the legacy of the last vespasienne in Paris still hangs in the balance, public urination did get a boost this year: a €240,000 proposal to install designer urinals along the Canal Saint Martin will now go ahead, thanks to the votes of more than 2,000 impatient Parisians.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5a7100613ee132932ba9cfff24776c9b789e5a1/0_223_4252_2552/master/4252.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35f27db8fb814383c3b82ea22905cc44","title":"10 timeless fashion trends that never date","story":"Iconic staples rule the catwalk this season.

Women and men’s entitlement to a state pension was equalised by law back in 1995, so women retire at 65 now, at 66 next year – just the same as men. Sounds fair? Not to women born in the 1950s whose lives were hard work and slim savings, with no chance to build up pensions: they expected to retire at 60 and draw their state pension.Women Against State Pension Inequality (Waspi) took their case to court for compensation and today they lost. These implacable campaigners for the pension rights of nearly 4 million women born in the 1950s turn up at every political event and tail each Department for Work and Pensions secretary relentlessly to protest about pension changes that left many in penury. Politicians groan inwardly when they see them coming, but these women never give up.Two of them, with the help of crowdfunding, sought a judicial review but today were turned down. They don’t oppose an equal pension age: their complaint is the speed with which women’s pension age has been raised, to 65 last year, to 66 next year, giving many no chance to build up a pension. The law was changed in 1995 and was intended to be phased in between 2010 and 2020 – but in 2011, the coalition government speeded up the change, implementing it in 2018. Many women were only warned by letter 16 years after the initial legislation was passed.This group are losing four to six years’ worth of state pension – life-changing inidual sums of some £47,000, while the treasury saved £30bn.The government’s case was bluntly put by Sir James Eadie QC: “Parliament has no substantive, freestanding obligation of fairness,” he told the court. There you have it, no duty to fairness and the court agreed, though claimed to be “saddened by the stories”. As we know, courts regard parliament as sovereign and parliament had passed it into law. Nor did it matter that the government had failed to warn the women: “There is precisely no obligation on parliament to notify those affected by its judgments,” Eadie said, and the court agreed.Here’s what stands out: governments have been slow to pass laws and slower still to enforce equality for women in every other field. When the equal pay and sex discrimination acts were passed by Barbara Castle in the 1970s, we who had campaigned thought it was all done and dusted, job done. Yet the pay gap yawns wide, while women’s promotion to higher jobs lags behind and fair treatment in essential services that give women an equal chance are a matter of political whim – from childcare, which is the most expensive in Europe, to refuges for victims of domestic violence. The one and only equality for women imposed with a rod of iron was the equalisation of pension ages, because it saved the Treasury a fortune.Waspi’s case was never against equalising the pension age – indeed, more women are in work and for longer. Since the abolition of the compulsory retirement age, the number of people continuing to work past the age of 65 has risen to 1.2 million. But introducing this “equality” at draconian speed was in effect a retrospective act. These older, poorer women’s lives were very different from younger women now. Many left school at 14 and 15 to work in hard manual jobs that took a toll on their health. Few had further education opportunities, and more of them are unskilled. They were paid less than men, and still are. In researching a book on work, I found trade union agreements in the car industry that demanded women be paid less, for fear they would take men’s jobs, hence the famous Dagenham women machinists’ strike. Part-timers, almost all women, were excluded from company pension schemes until 1989. Women back then had total responsibility as carers: there was no subsidised childcare nor nurseries until the BlairBrown government.Had they been clearly told, some could have planned working lives to last longer, though many couldn’t. Discrimination against older women applying for work is even worse than it is for older men. Michael Mansfield, representing Waspi, gave the court government documents proving ministers knew there was “widespread ignorance” among many women that they were about to lose their pensions. Informing people about pensions is notoriously difficult, hence the success of the recent automatic enrolment scheme requiring people to opt out – it relies on most people staying clueless.Those on high who make sweeping decisions about the lives of others screen out these brutal facts, as if they are beyond their comprehension. A large slice of the population they govern has nothing – no safeguards, no protection from even the smallest buffets in their lives. Poverty and living on the verge of poverty is widespread, and means a life of constant anxiety. Waspi describes how many of their number – unable to work until 66, and unable to draw a pension – are reduced to food banks to survive.With his usual empty bravado, when asked on the leadership hustings if he would help the stranded Waspi women, Boris Johnson promised to “commit to doing everything I possibly can to sorting out” the issue if he became prime minister. Now Johnson is in No 10, how many of those hasty promises of everything to everyone will he fulfil?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4753e369dba0e9fc7220ee912c6e6ef6885d7765/0_125_1870_1122/master/1870.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=368a59b12336bd585e03a18d424e103a","title":"the guardian view on the backstop proposals britains broken promise","story":"Boris Johnson calls it a compromise. But, once again, the Conservatives are talking only to themselves, not to Ireland and the EUBoris Johnson has reached for the word compromise many times in the last two days as he has promoted his new Brexit proposals. There were three mentions of compromise in his party conference speech in Manchester on Wednesday, a further four in his letter to the European commission, two in the statement he delivered to MPs at Westminster on Thursday and several others in the exchanges that followed.These usages, although tendentious, are not wholly specious. Mr Johnson’s proposals are an attempt to bridge the gap between the EU-UK withdrawal agreement signed by Theresa May last year and the root-and-branch rejection of that agreement by the Conservative party’s most dogmatic pro-Brexit faction. Setting aside the fact that Mr Johnson himself voted for that agreement in March, the prime minister has moved the dial a few notches from his previous determination to get rid of the Northern Ireland backstop in its entirety.However, the new proposals are not a compromise with the European Union, which is the body with which he ought to be seeking a deal. They are a compromise with the Democratic Unionist party. Mr Johnson has courted the DUP more assiduously than even Mrs May did. He has spoken at their conferences, invited them into Downing Street and generally gone the extra mile to find ways of appeasing their demands that Northern Ireland should not be treated differently from the rest of the UK. The compromise Mr Johnson has now made with the DUP allows him to say that there can be some all-Ireland regulations for a limited period – which would mean Britain and Northern Ireland leaving on different terms – while the DUP has secured an effective veto over their further continuation, thus ensuring that Northern Ireland will be fully part of the UK customs territory in the longer term. But they are talking to themselves, not to the wider polities of Ireland, Britain or Europe.Mr Johnson ignores three huge issues. The first is that the DUP does not speak for Northern Ireland, whose people voted to remain in the EU in 2016 and where opinion polls regularly show support for the backstop and for separate treatment for Northern Ireland to preserve the all-Ireland economy. By allowing the DUP to act as if it is the government of Northern Ireland, Mr Johnson ignores the majority that oppose the DUP’s pro-Brexit stance and mounting evidence that the DUP is now losing the hegemony that it used to enjoy. Giving a decisive role to Northern Ireland institutions that are suspended for intractable reasons solves nothing (and triggers the demand from Scotland that their devolved institutions should get a veto too). It suggests Mr Johnson might not be able to make his deal stick, even if the EU agreed to it.The second problem is that Mr Johnson’s plans renege on the principles, and legally rooted treaty guarantees, of north-south cooperation that have been the bedrock of the increasingly precarious Northern Ireland peace process. Preserving the BelfastGood Friday agreement was at the core of Mrs May’s approach. It is part of the EU (Withdrawal) Act itself that the UK will not create any form of “physical infrastructure” for border arrangements after Brexit. The reason why there is a backstop at all is because the May government took these promises seriously. Like so many English Tories in the past and today, Mr Johnson simply does not share that sense of responsibility. His plans betray Britain’s solemn promise and ignore the consequences for Ireland.The final problem is that the vagueness of Mr Johnson’s plans leaves a hole in the EU single market without proposing a workable solution. Controls of any kind are inconsistent with the principle of frictionless trade, while loose controls threaten rules and protections for consumers. It is typical of Mr Johnson and the hardliners that they have failed to engage with these realities at all.Yet the realities are immutable. Britain has profound legal and political obligations to the people of Ireland. Britain has deep moral obligations too. None of these are upheld in the government’s new proposals or by the untrustworthy way Britain behaves on the Irish and European stage. Mr Johnson calls it compromise.

Rivalling New York City and LA, Toronto’s become a new premier destination for millennials curious to discover its thriving arts, culture, fashion and dining scenes.After taking in some of the top-tier downtown attractions, such as the CN Tower, head over to nearby Kensington Market. Spanning only a few blocks, the streets lined with outdoor fruit markets, musicians and local craft boutiques are emblematic of Toronto’s erse spirit.From Mexican to Japanese food, the market is a culinary beast. It’s home to Toronto’s best-rated taco shop, Seven Lives, where you can snatch a spot in line and grab a combo of three fish, octopus or shrimp tacos for less than £10. Wash it down at El Rey, a mezcal bar with an Americana western vibe, where a shot and brew go for less than £8. Finally, for a spot of fine dining, look no further than acclaimed chef Jen Agg’s Grey Gardens, where you can enjoy wine and oysters in an exquisite French-bistro setting.Kensington Market is also a treasure trove of vintage finds. So whether you’re looking for a bossy fur coat or a 90s Nike tracksuit, get thrifting! Mixed into the vintage crawl are local designer clothing and jewellery stores that offer a personalised touch at a reasonable price. One of these most notable mainstays is Sole Survivor – an all-female shoe and leather repairs shop, owned by Lorena Agolli. The caring neighbourhood spirit of the city comes alive in the shop, with the craft perfected in patience and care.‘I would say to come and visit with an open mind and to avoid just visiting the standard tourist attractions. Instead, try and get lost in the more erse and culturally immersive areas in the city, like Kensington Market.’ Lorena Agolli, Sole Survivor ownerMore or less everyone in Toronto can agree that Riverdale and the adjacent neighbourhood of Leslieville are having a moment. While most of this guide features hotspots in the west end, the sweeping views of the skyline and flourishing culinary scene puts this east end spot on the map.Toronto’s appetite for brunch is huge – and its menus reflect the city’s status as one of the most erse in the world, fusing cultures, ingredients and techniques from across the globe. Leslieville knows its way around a brunch better than pretty much anywhere else in Toronto. Lady Marmalade, a long-time local gem for all-day breakfast, has featured in the top 10 eggs benedict in the city since it opened in 2005. Mixing traditional and Mexican-inspired dishes, the bright, airy space combines local hospitality with a touch of elegance.For lunch, the Real Jerk, which was the filming location for Drake and Rihanna’s music video for Work, is a family-run, unassuming spot for some of the city’s best West Indian cuisine. Finally, Ascari Enoteca, named after 1950s Italian racing legend Alberto Ascari, is a Leslieville favourite. Serving up plates of handmade pasta paired with perfect wine matches, it’s known as the date-night spot by neighbourhood denizens.If you’re heading back to the area for some fun after dark, the hottest spot at the moment is the Rooftop Bar at the Broadview Hotel. Housed in a historic building dating back to 1891, this newly renovated space, featuring industrial chic decorative touches, offers unmatched views of the city skyline. Another hotspot is the Vatican Gift Shop, where patrons step through a secret door, in what from the outside appears to be an unassuming storefront, into a neon-lit basement speakeasy to enjoy live music and a cocktail (or two).Get artsy on Queen Street West. From its independent galleries and hip bars to high-end boutiques, this street, which stretches from Roncesvalles to central Toronto, is an urban trekker’s dream. Get those cameras out – you won’t want to miss a photo-op next to the many murals that  Queen Street West. Don’t be surprised if you wander into one of the many galleries and get handed a complementary glass of wine at an exhibition opening if you’re around in the early evening.Local creatives flock to Queen Street West to share their crafts – so store-hopping is a must. Find your new favourite vintage rock T-shirt from F as in Frank. Or what about bespoke lipstick, fused together right before your eyes at Bite Beauty Lab? If simplicity with a conscience is your thing, check out KOTN, a homegrown clothing label committed to quality essentials, ethically made, and honestly priced. Owner Ben Sehl’s store, bordering popular Trinity Bellwoods Park, is a reflection of the city’s bubbling creativity.‘The balance makes Toronto such a great city, and the ersity keeps it interesting – there’s always something new to discover.’ Ben Sehl, owner of KOTNNeed to fuel up from all that wandering? A quick grab-and-go prosciutto sandwich from Forno Cultura is a great option for those on the run. Or take a break at Terroni, a hometown casual eatery with simple and delicious Italian fare, paired with an exclusive list of wines from Italy. For a snack, feed your pastry and caffeine cravings at award-winning Sam James Coffee Bar across from Trinity Bellwoods Park. For an exquisite, once-in-a-lifetime experience, Alo, which has topped Canada’s 100 best restaurants list three years in a row, combines French cuisine with local seasonal ingredients for an eye-opening culinary experience.Finally, when dusk falls, romantic cocktail bars and hideaways come to life on Queen West. For the crowd, head to the Drake Hotel, where parties are held across three levels (basement to rooftop bar) each weekend. For something less flashy, a 10-minute walk north to Dundas Street West brings you to Cocktail Bar, where delicious cocktails meet refined snacks. Finally, bring your A-game to Apartment 200 — perhaps the city’s trendiest bar, where Toronto’s top DJs go for a spin.Toronto has one of the world’s biggest Chinatowns, so it’s no surprise that it’s a fixture of the city. Chinatown is a fine option for planning a day excursion filled with activities. Start off with selfies at the Art Gallery of Ontario, especially with the world-acclaimed Yayoi Kusama Infinity Mirrors installation. Then, prepare yourself for a food adventure.For an authentic dim sum experience, order your har gow and siu mai off the menu at Rol San Restaurant. Need a quick fix? Swatow offers cheap and plentiful food – order the signature wonton noodle soup or Yeung Chow fried rice (note: These portions are huge.) For a snack, Juicy Dumpling is the easy option – where six soup dumplings start at less than £1.In recent times, the area has also become a hub for street style with world-class stores sprawled along Spadina Avenue. Check out Nomad Toronto, carrying everything from Issey Miyake and Comme des Garcons to the self-styled “internet street apparel” available at local hang Creeps, which is run by an all-female cast. Around the corner is Better Gift Shop. Owned by Avi Gold, who has collaborated with big-time retailers such as Dover Street Market, it offers a collection of unique international brands and local wears, catering for all your unique souvenir needs.‘An impressively wide range of ersity in cuisine and quality at a fair price defines Toronto’s food scene. There are many high-end, world-class establishments, as well as accessible spots that a visitor could enjoy and find affordable.’ Sam James, owner of Sam James Coffee BarDespite being known as a foodie’s paradise, Chinatown is the ultimate spontaneous night out. Enjoy a lychee cocktail underneath the glowing lanterns at Big Trouble in Little China, named after the 1986 fantasy martial arts film.

When plants, insects and fungi are added, one in seven of the 8,400 UK species assessed are at risk of being completely lost, with 133 already gone since 1500.The causes of the losses are the intensification of farming, pollution from fertiliser, manure and plastic, the destruction of habitats for houses, the climate crisis and invasive alien species. The State of Nature report shows no significant improvement since the last one in 2016, which said the UK was “among the most nature-depleted countries in the world”.The losses mirror the global annihilation of wildlife, which scientists suggest is the start of the sixth mass extinction on Earth and is undermining the natural life-support systems that humanity relies on for air, water and food.“We know more about the UK’s wildlife than any other country on the planet, and what it is telling us should make us sit up and listen,” said Daniel Hayhow of the RSPB, the lead author of the report. “We need to respond more urgently across the board.”Sophie Pavelle, a young conservationist who contributed to the report’s foreword, said: “I have felt the loss of nature more acutely this year than any other. A dawn chorus less deafening hedgerows less frantic bizarre, worrying weather. It seems that in a more complex world, nature is tired, muted and confused.”Paul de Zylva of Friends of the Earth said: “As we lose nature, we lose a huge part of what makes us happy and healthy. UK ministers and businesses persist in planning and funding disastrous projects and practices, often with public money.” Repeated declarations by the government to halt and reverse the decline of nature have not been followed by matching action, he said.The report uses assessments from the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s red list to assess the number of UK species at risk of extinction. As well as mammals and birds, it found 440 plants, 405 invertebrates and 232 fungi and lichen in dangerThe mammals most at risk are the Scottish wildcat and the once-widespread black rat, but hedgehogs, rabbits and water voles are also falling in numbers. “I have never seen a hedgehog, although my parents used to see them all the time in this area,” said James Miller, another young conservationist featured in the report.“But it is not all gloom and doom,” said Gary Powney, of the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, a contributor to the report. “There are inspirational conservation success stories, where people have come together to protect and restore wildlife.”The fen raft spider was threatened with extinction in the UK, he said, but the Wildlife Trusts worked with the EU to fund habitat restoration and the species was increasing. Other successes include the saving of corncrakes and bitterns, the large blue butterfly and the return of otters to less polluted waters.The report uses many millions of data records from tens of thousands of expert volunteers. “We need even more people to get involved and record the bioersity around them, so we can monitor the health of our countryside,” said Powney.Rosie Hails of the National Trust said: “It’s not just government that needs to act we can also all do our own bit, including nature-friendly planting in our backyards.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d582b15731fab0fcb3b42f9f6f5266e47b641c8f/0_59_1772_1063/master/1772.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eed363605ae1789e934146554eec9eaa","title":"monster fatberg autopsy reveals wet wipes bones and false teeth","story":"Fatberg found in Sidmouth, Devon, contained no toxic chemicals or microplastic beads The dirty secrets of a huge fatberg discovered lurking under the seafront of a Devon town have been laid bare after scientists carried out an “autopsy” of the monster.As expected, household cooking fats, wet wipes and other hygiene products were key components of the 64m-long beast (bigger than the Leaning Tower of Pisa) but it also contained bits of bone, twigs, string – and false teeth.Happily, it did not contain any detectable levels of toxic chemicals, and the scientists who examined lumps of it could not apportion blame for it to any particular businesses, neighbourhoods or groups. It appears to have been very much a community effort.Campaigns to educate people about how not to feed fatbergs take pains to remind us that toilets and sinks are not “magic portals”. There is a simple set of rules for the bathroom: stick to flushing the three Ps: pee, poo and (toilet) paper. Everything else – sanitary towels, nappies, cotton buds, condoms, dental floss, used plasters and whatever else you might think to chuck down the toilet – should go into the bin.Just because a product says it is flushable doesn’t mean that it is biodegradable. Baby wipes might be a godsend to parents, but not to Victorian-era sewerage systems. Wipes marketed as flushable will probably be able to make their way down your toilet, but will eventually clog up the pipes further along their journey.The kitchen is another area of concern. Water companies are keen to bust the myth that running hot water and pouring washing-up liquid down the sink ahead of fats, oils or grease will stop it building up and blocking the pipes. Their recommendation is to keep a small container, such as an old margarine tub, to hand in your kitchen, into which you can pour oil and fat before safely disposing of it in the bin.The fatberg was discovered under The Esplanade in Sidmouth, a few metres from the sea, by South West Water just before Christmas last year and made headlines around the world.In February a hardy bunch of workers donned breathing apparatus to begin the painstaking process of hacking the fatberg into small pieces and removing it from the sewer. It took eight weeks and the monster was carted away in 36 tankers.A team of scientists from the University of Exeter were given the scarcely less enviable job of carrying out the autopsy to establish how it came into being and whether it posed environmental risks.The scientists were given four 10kg samples from the fatberg, which smelled like a heady combination of rotting meat and an unclean toilet. They melted the chunks and then combed through them by hand before subjecting samples to forensic analysis.The team found that the samples they received were mostly made of animal fats consistent with domestic food preparation combined with household hygiene products such as wet wipes and sanitary products, as well as natural and artificial fibres from toilet tissues and laundry.Crucially, the team found the fatberg contained no detectable levels of toxic chemicals, meaning its presence in the sewer did not pose a chemical or biological risk to the environment or human health.Prof John Love, a synthetic biology expert at the University of Exeter, said: “We worried that the fatberg might concentrate fat-soluble chemicals such as those found in contraceptives, contain now-banned microplastic beads from cosmetics and be rich in potentially pathogenic microbes, but we found no trace of these possible dangers.“We were all rather surprised to find that this Sidmouth fatberg was simply a lump of fat aggregated with wet wipes, sanitary towels and other household products that really should be put in the bin and not down the toilet. The microfibres we did find probably came from toilet tissue and laundry, and the bacteria were those we would normally associate with a sewer.”Scientists from the Greenpeace laboratory, based at the university’s Streatham Campus, also looked at the chemical composition of the fatberg. The results suggested that the fats found were more in keeping with domestic food preparation than commercial food outlets, while the chemicals were those found in personal care products rather than pharmaceuticals or pesticides.Nicky Cunningham, the manager for the Centre for Resilience in Environment, Water and Waste, said: “The results indicate that there isn’t a single contributing factor or demographic responsible for this fatberg coming to being.”South West Water’s director of wastewater, Andrew Roantree, said: “Although we deal with around 8,500 blocked sewers every year, the Sidmouth fatberg was by far the largest discovered in our service history. We wanted to learn as much as we could about it, how it was created and what it was made of to help us avoid further fatbergs in future.“We will be using these results to help us educate, inform and change the behaviours of people in terms of what they are putting down the toilet and sink. That’s not just applicable to Sidmouth but across our region.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52dc08762e38ed327c927a97d4ae471d7efc8b01/557_114_2687_1613/master/2687.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5ca1a74449633e222e99382fe0e1b3f","title":"gold liner liquid lipstick and eyelash glue precision drag queen tips for everyday makeup","story":"As RuPaul’s Drag Race comes to British TV, former contestants share their makeup dos and don’t’s, from time-saving tricks to lipsticks that stay putAfter 10 years of RuPaul’s Drag Race bringing drag culture to mainstream TV audiences, the UK is getting its own version of the show, filled with British “charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent” – and, of course, makeup. Drag queens are known for their exaggerated makeup: false eyelashes, bold brows and extreme contouring are all commonplace. So, too, is a lot of glitter (and to do Drag Race shimmer sustainably see options here and here). Importantly, whether comical, cartoonish or comparatively subtle, drag makeup is always on point. Here are the tips and tricks that translate from the werk room into everyday makeup looks, according to former Drag Race contestants.It sounds like a cliche, but good makeup starts with good skin. The best makeup tip is to drink water – not just while you put your makeup on, but generally. It plumps up your skin and makes it glow.Your foundation shade should always resemble your skin tone. Skin comes in different tones – this applies to all skin colours – so some people have warm tones, some have cool tones. One thing I often see is orange foundation with pink necks.People always ask me how to apply glitter and sparkles. You can stick crystals on your face with eyelash glue, the same for glitter. The trick is taking your time, using a fine angled brush and being quite precise. Then there’s how to take glitter off – because if you just wash your face, then you will end up with glitter everywhere for days. Instead, get some Sellotape and press it on to the glitter to remove. That will leave you properly glitter-free.If you are in a rush, then pick up your black eyeshadow and don’t put it down until you are done. You can use it for eyeliner, eyebrows, your eyeshadow crease – so just do them all at once, using one angled brush.I tend to do my brows using a gold liquid liner, which really adds a pop. I have even done it as a boy, when I have been going out to a club. It baffles me that people use tape or card to draw on their eyeliner wings – it’s not that hard to draw a straight line at a 45-degree angle! It looks manufactured and just makes me think that you failed art class.Drag makeup is designed to pop. The minute you walk in a room you’re going to catch everyone’s eye because your features are so exaggerated. I love the transformation that I create using makeup and I love knowing that people in the back row can see every detail.I call my face a Frankenstein face because there’s no one brand that I use on every single area. I use Kryolan and Mac foundation, all different kinds of eyeshadow, and liquid lipsticks from Anastasia. It’s a good idea to play and experiment.I use liquid lipsticks because they stay put. I’m not one of these dainty queens who has to have a straw – honey, I’m using my mouth. I’m eating, I’m drinking, I’m talking and I need lipsticks that stay where they are supposed to. You can also use liquid lipsticks for eye colour.Your eyebrows should be at least close relatives – if possible, twin sisters. When it comes to eye makeup, you don’t have to paint with all the colours of the rainbow. I’ve seen a lot of people who have obviously bought an eyeshadow palette that has five colours, and then put all five colours on their eyelids without blending them. The main technique is to go from light to dark, from the brow bone down to your eyelid. Then just blend everything.My go-to lipstick right now is anything nude – for me that means a muted, matt grey-toned pink colour. Currently I use Sugarpill Cosmetics Liquid Lip Colour in Trifle. It’s easy and it complements any makeup look. If you wear red and it bleeds out, you can look as if you’ve bitten into a red berry, but that doesn’t happen with nudes.I take as much time on my makeup as I do in creating a look or preparing for a performance and I think that is why drag queens tend to look so good. Beyond makeup techniques, it’s really down to time and preparation.RuPaul’s Drag Race UK starts on BBC Three on 3 October at 8pm and will be exclusively available on BBC iPlayer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8d69965c5c08ce2fa8ce90938dc10d97b0fe149/0_0_3500_2332/master/3500.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=0d5b46debb4474e4b9a06af7d3e20346 1320w","title":"always cooking the same thing try a weekly food box","story":"In the days when Abel \u0026amp Cole was the only game in town, I blew very hot and cold on vegetable boxes. It was a lot like wearing a Fitbit: you’re filled with this round-the-clock reminder of your own virtue. You’re roasting beetroot while you wash up in the morning, your fridge is brimming with fennel à la grecque, you’re taking baked potatoes to work, the best bit of which is how many people you can tell about your thrift and wholesome living. Then wham, you have one week of compromised domestic engagement – which is US militaryspeak for being out on the razzle every night – and your vegetables are piling up like an accusation. Your heart turns against them. Is it in any way reasonable to send you a carrot in May, when you have been eating them all winter? (The Fitbit equivalent, by the way, is when it runs out of battery and you remember how livable life still is even when you have no idea how many steps you’ve done and may not have done any.)I went through this love-hate cycle a few times in the 00s, and in the meantime the world moved on. Complete meal subscription services took off, though in the beginning they were mainly for weight loss. This is a disaster, even if you’re doing it for research purposes and you have no intention of losing weight. You have a quinoa mountain in no time. You end up eating lentils for breakfast, but that’s so unholy that you have another breakfast on top of that. I tried the Balance Box for a month, once, for an article, and I think I ate it all as well as my regular food.The services have moved on again to include full-meal solutions for the time-poor, and fruit-and-vegetable solutions for those who hate the idea of food waste. I have just tried Hello Fresh for the first and Oddbox for the second and, broadly, everything that was wrong with either was really something wrong with me.Hello Fresh always seems to have an offer running, which brought the cost down by half to £2.50 per person per meal. A three-meal-a-week box for £15, for a couple, is completely reasonable. Yet the thrifty wartime homemaker in me was constantly complaining – maybe if I’d got the chicken from a market, at five in the morning, off the floor, it would have been cheaper. If anything, not having anything to complain about made it worse.But I just don’t think other people’s portions are big enough. There was plenty of nutrition in them more than plenty – over 1,400 calories a person in the cumin roast-pork recipe. But if I’d been making it myself, there would have been more on the plate. This put me in a scarcity mindset, which is a disaster for family harmony. I was being ridiculous.The recipes are simple but quite bold in flavour, the ingredients are good, the instructions are very clear, especially if you don’t mind being addressed like someone who has never handled meat before (I am way too old to be told to wash my hands), and the repertoire is good. There’s always a cute touch, an aubergine you weren’t expecting, some blue cheese sauce. Unless you specify “quick”, they don’t try to keep everything down to half an hour. I really admire this service, in almost every particular I just don’t like being told what to do, and always like to have too much on the table.With Oddbox, I could overcater like wild. It was £13.50 for a vegetable-only box for a large family, which isn’t us, because the children eat only peas. With a tiny adjustment to regular life – eating kale by choice – this makes it cheaper than buying veg in a shop. It’s explicitly thrifty in a broader, social sense, on food miles and – sorry, the main point – it’s food that would otherwise have been thrown away because the producers couldn’t sell it. There was either too much of it for the supermarkets or it supposedly looked funny, though, in fact, none of it did.This is a radical leap forward from the old days. I have never had baby courgettes by subscription before, and only very rarely seen chicory. Sure, there were onions, potatoes and carrots, lettuce, broccoli, fennel, spinach – these are not endangered species – but I have nothing against staples as long as there is fancy stuff. I made algarve carrots, the ones they give you in bars to make you drink more, and creamed spinach, like ordering a stroke in a classic French bistro. I shaved fennel and put chilli on broccoli and made hasselback potatoes for the hell of it. The only thing I had left was the lettuce, and I gave that to a rabbit. My fridge looked like a delicatessen, I smelled constantly of garlic, I finished a load of kippers I had in the freezer because I’m not, when it really comes down to it, a vegetarian, and, once again, I felt high all week on my own virtue.I would recommend either service for a person who is hungry, and doesn’t want to surrender to the unchanging menus of their own conformity. But for the self-righteous, there is nothing like a box of invisibly deformed vegetables."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff31959e291862c38093a995cb58b814b0024c3a/0_72_4141_2484/master/4141.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=900fe0229251d492ad6d27d431f32a93","title":"arsenal standard liege europa league match report","story":"For Unai Emery this was an occasion to savour his work and question himself. The Arsenal manager quite rightly took delight in seeing his team maintain a perfect start to their Europa League campaign with a performance full of control and goals but it hardly did his reputation as a judge of talent much good that a player who struck twice and shone throughout as the spearhead of Arsenal’s attack is someone he does not feel has what it takes to be a central striker.That was Emery’s assessment of Gabriel Martinelli before this game, with the Spaniard insisting the 18-year‑old, who joined Arsenal from Brazilian side Ituano in the summer, is better deployed in wide areas. That appeared far from the case when Martinelli tore Standard Liège to bits in that very role.His goals, which arrived inside three first-half minutes, were expertly taken and he continued to show impressive movement, poise and purpose, as he did when also scoring twice against Nottingham Forest last month as the main man up front.Arsenal’s recent history is littered with South Americans who have faded fast but Martinelli looks a genuine prospect, and a goalscoring one at that.Somewhat remarkably, Emery insisted again that central striker is not Martinelli’s best position but, having deployed him there, he went on to praise the teenager’s contribution, which alongside two goals included the assist for Arsenal’s fourth goal, a lofted cross that was turned into an empty net by Dani Ceballos on 57 minutes. “His performance and attitude was amazing,” said Emery. He was not wrong.Martinelli was just one of many players in red and white who caught the eye. Emery made 10 changes to the team that drew 1-1 with Manchester United on Monday and such was the hosts’ collective swagger and authority that you could forgive the man in charge if he decided to go with the same lineup for Bournemouth’s visit here on Sunday.It is certainly possible that Héctor Bellerín, who captained Arsenal in his first start since January, will keep his place, as could Kieran Tierney, who was a dynamic presence at left-back in his second appearance for the club. Then there were the contributions of Reiss Nelson and Joe Willock, two more youngsters who yet again showed they have bright futures at the club.The same can not be said for Mesut Özil who, as was the case at Old Trafford, failed to make even Arsenal’s bench. That is an ongoing saga that mattered little as Arsenal’s alternatives made their presence felt on the European stage for a second successive game. Last month’s 3-0 victory at Eintracht Frankfurt was followed by this thumping win and with two games gone, Arsenal already look primed to qualify with ease from Group F.Arsenal were indeed quick, not only in the tempo of their play but also in how they built their lead. Three goals were scored inside the opening 22 minutes, with Martinelli getting his first on 13 minutes via a perfectly timed glancing header from Tierney’s near-post cross. The Brazilian’s second came from practically the same spot, this time via a composed right-foot finish, and entered him into Arsenal’s record books at 18 years and 107 days he is the youngest player to have scored two goals in a major European game for the club.Martinelli should have completed his hat-trick on 53 minutes but directed a low shot from in front of a practically open net wide of the far post.In the grand scheme of things it did not matter – by that stage the hosts were rampant having gone 3-0 ahead thanks to Willock’s cool finish. Then came Ceballos’s goal, his first for Arsenal since arriving from Real Madrid on loan."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1fb0707bb3c8bfa14409e04c494bdf187961cfd/0_52_4241_2544/master/4241.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43e1e9a6117be6b348e0cbb1b62f798c","title":"az alkmaar manchester united europa league match report","story":"Ole Gunnar Solskjær is still looking for his first away win as Manchester United’s permanent manager. Newcastle on Sunday would seem an inviting opportunity but Solskjær is going to have to alter his team and his tactics from this limp showing to have any hope of beating even such demoralised opponents as Steve Bruce’s side.This was just as presentable a chance to turn a corner, yet a United side sorely lacking in ambition and creativity were unable to take it, merely adapting to Alkmaar’s level and in the end being quite fortunate to escape with a draw.Solskjær’s worries were compounded by Jesse Lingard limping off late on with a hamstring injury to leave United to see out the match with 10 men.They were not exactly outplayed, in a borrowed stadium in front of a crowd slightly less than the stated capacity of 15,000, though the home side created the better chances and the captain for the day, David de Gea, was certainly the busier of the two goalkeepers towards the end of the match. Marco Bizot in the Alkmaar goal was a virtual spectator throughout. While United had a late penalty claim waved away when Marcus Rashford came on, more damning was their failure to register a single attempt on target.“It should have been a win, I’m fed up complaining about penalties we should have had,” Solskjær said, brazenly ignoring the fact that Alkmaar also had a couple of reasonable appeals turned down, in addition to managing the odd shot on target. “The linesman had a good view of the tackle on Marcus and he wasn’t interested. A better decision and we would all be sitting here smiling now, but it’s no good me going on about it. We just have to hope that one day the decisions will start going in our favour. We didn’t get to grips with the pitch until the second half, so I regard today as a good away point. If we win our home games and stay unbeaten away we should be all right in the group.”Solskjaer’s concerns before the game had focused on the artificial surface, though it was clear from an early stage that Alkmaar could pose problems with the ball in the air. Myron Boadu had the ball in the net after 11 minutes from Fredrik Midtsjø’s cross. He was correctly ruled offside, yet De Gea would not have been impressed by his defenders allowing a free header. De Gea was called upon to make the first save of the game shortly afterwards, reacting well to Oussama Idrissi’s well-struck shot, and from the resulting corner Dani de Wit put another free header over the bar.United had started well enough, with Daniel James not only playing but initially being deployed through the middle. After the first quarter passed without a visiting shot on target Solskjær had a rethink and put James out on the right, again not his best position, with Mason Greenwood taking up his expected central role. This almost brought immediate results, with Diogo Dalot sending James skipping down the right and Greenwood meeting his cross in the middle, only for the former Aston Villa defender Ron Vlaar to block a goalbound effort.If that was encouraging it was also untypical of United’s first-half efforts. Alkmaar played the more effective counterattacking game, at least proving capable of moving the ball swiftly upfield and on several occasions entered the United area with purpose. United by comparison were ponderous and uninspired, retaining possession easily enough but failing to find any real penetration. At 34 Vlaar might have been viewed as a weak link in the Alkmaar defence, but the plodding, sideways game United played made it easy for the home side to stand their ground without being asked to run about too much.Making his first start for United, the left-back Brandon Williams was lucky to get away with handball in the area early in the second half. Giving away a penalty would have spoiled an otherwise confident display, though the ball struck his arm and referees are now being told to ignore considerations of intent. Rashford was sent on after an hour in an attempt to give United a little more bite up front. In the end it was another substitute, Lingard, who shot wide with a late chance to win the match, before limping off. Rashford’s main contribution, a free-kick blasted wastefully high over the bar, was more in keeping with United’s overall performance. While Solskjær will always have Paris, in his present situation he will not be allowed to live on the memory indefinitely."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c3587d885f03342d84d97a185bdd74d423a2a94/0_62_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=afc717f3c452955c1381ea95edeb8569","title":"jordan nobbs england return familiar territory","story":"Arsenal midfielder who missed the World Cup through injury is back on international duty at the club where her career beganThe Arsenal midfielder Jordan Nobbs is buzzing to be back in England kit after a lengthy spell out of action with an anterior cruciate ligament injury. “It was weird because I forgot the excitement of what it’s like being called up again,” Nobbs says before training at St George’s Park this week. “I can’t believe it’s been so long but it was exciting.”The thrill of ending an 11-month absence from international duty is enhanced by Saturday’s friendly against Brazil taking place at Middlesbrough, where Nobbs’s England journey began when she was attached to the club. “I first got picked for England at 12 years old at Middlesbrough so it was kind of fate that it is my first camp back for England,” says Nobbs, who was born in Stockton-on-Tees. “Hopefully I can have a lot of family and friends there to see me back playing for England.”Having ruptured an ACL against Everton in November 2018, Nobbs had a tough choice: whether to attempt to recover for the World Cup. “It was a hard decision as obviously nobody wants to say they don’t want to go to a World Cup. But I’m 26 and I have heard some disaster stories as well as good stories so it was about weighing that up.” That she ruled herself out, putting her long-term health above the short-term gain, has meant that she has been in no hurry to rush things now she is fit.When Nobbs fell to the ground in agony playing for Arsenal against Everton last November, her screams echoed around Southport’s ground and the crowd held their breath. The possibility of England’s midfield engine being ruled out would, for some, rule England out of contention in France.“In a selfish way it was good for me. Some people thought it was crazy that I was going out to the World Cup when I wasn’t playing but my mindset was in a much better place it allowed me to focus on different job roles. It could have gone drastically wrong but I’m very grateful I played a part in that.”Having almost scored instantly on her return for Arsenal, a goal has taken six games to come, but it came in style – a tight, angled volley from a Vivianne Miedema cross. The problem was she took it with the wrong foot, her right foot, ending an amusing run of 15 Arsenal goals being scored with alternating feet. “None of the girls knew where that stat came from but I’m the dumb one of the team so when it was me it was like: ‘Typical Jordan.’ I got a bit of stick for that ...”The focus is on staying fit, for Arsenal, who are the closest they have been to a fully fit squad in a year, and for England, not least because she is eyeing an Olympic spot. “The last Olympics I was in the long list squad. It’s the biggest tournament you could be a part of. Being part of Team GB is my goal.”Avoiding injury is key, too, because of her impact in the dressing room. Montemurro recently spoke of her influence on morale. “No pressure,” she says with a grin. “I hope so. I think about Steven Gerrard: he was a player I looked up to a lot, his work rate and things like that. I hope that puts you already at a certain standard. I like to think the girls would listen but they’re in an incredible place anyway where we all respect each other and we all want to win.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a597d64b74f80bdee6d2c31993b677d8576f80d4/1_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b2ae74052c04d24c04ff43aff092835","title":"premier league 10 things to look out for this weekend","story":"Brendan Rodgers returns to Anfield, Spurs offer opponents too much space and Bournemouth have Arsenal in their sightsBrendan Rodgers returns to Anfield on Saturday, sensing an opportunity to end his former club’s perfect Premier League start. Last season, a much less adventurous Leicester side got a point at Liverpool, triggering a costly spell of self-doubt for Jürgen Klopp’s title chasers. There has been virtually no sign of weakness from the Reds in the league this term, but Salzburg’s dramatic Champions League fightback may have shown Rodgers the way forward. Andrew Robertson and Trent Alexander-Arnold made surging infield runs against Salzburg, a tactic that helped Liverpool race into a three-goal lead as Robertson scored. As the game changed, the hosts were left exposed in wide areas as their opponents poured forward. Leicester will be a threat on the counter and have plenty of pace and craft on the flanks, not least through their own full-back pairing of Ben Chilwell and Ricardo Pereira. Rodgers’ side are dangerous opponents, and Klopp will hope the reliable Joël Matip is available to slot back into central defence. NMManchester United travel to St James’ Park on Sunday, a year to the day since a 3-2 defeat at Old Trafford where Alexis Sánchez’s late winner saved José Mourinho from the sack. A year is a long time in football. While much has changed since, both teams are still dealing with the same fundamental issues. Manchester United cannot conjure any kind of consistency or fluidity, and Newcastle are short of goals and fearing relegation. Last year, Rafael Benítez’s safety-first approach got them out of trouble. Under Steve Bruce, they have lost their solidity at the back without getting any better going forward they are the league’s joint-lowest scorers. Since beating Chelsea 4-0 in their league opener, Manchester United have scored seven goals in nine games, with turgid draws against Arsenal and AZ Alkmaar this week. In short, don’t expect another five-goal thriller in this Super Sunday showpiece. NMWolves’ shaky start appears to be behind them now, with two victories and two clean sheets inside a week. Before the trip to Besiktas, captain Conor Coady had targeted defensive improvement and they delivered in Istanbul, with centre-back Willy Boly grabbing a last-gasp winner. Boly was a key figure in both fixtures against Manchester City last season, scoring a handball opener at Molineux and getting sent off early at the Etihad in a 3-0 defeat. That was Wolves’ only league red card last term this year, they have already doubled that tally, with Boly dismissed at Everton and Romain Saiss sent off at Crystal Palace. Defensive discipline is not all about keeping clean sheets, and while Wolves may travel in hope rather than expectation after such a long midweek trip, concentration will be key. In midweek, Dinamo Zagreb showed the benefits of taking on City with a clear defensive strategy two weeks ago, Watford showed the pitfalls of not doing so. NMIt remains early days but West Ham appear to have bridged a gap they been trying to bridge for a while. A spluttering of mid-table finishes failed to stimulate much excitement around a club that harbours explicit hopes of qualifying for Europe, but there are signs they could make a reasonable play for those places under Manuel Pellegrini. Sébastien Haller came at a cost, but the £45m striker looks more than just a 6ft 3in handful and, behind him, Pellegrini has a plethora of options to pick from, including the fit-again Manuel Lanzini. How they will fare without the injured Lukasz Fabianski remains to be seen, but with Everton and Wolves yet to convince, it would be wrong to overlook Pellegrini’s credentials to deliver a top-seven finish. The Chilean has form for parachuting unfancied teams into the upper echelons, having propelled Villarreal and Málaga into Europe, and early evidence suggests West Ham, who finished 10th last season, have the tools to go close. BFThese teams last met when the Canaries secured the victory that brought them last season’s Championship title. The extent of Aston Villa’s post-promotion recruitment drive is no secret but here is a telling illustration: of the 14 players who played either from the start or from the bench for Norwich that day all are still at the club, every one has played in the Premier League and most are doing so regularly, having between them played 5,378 league minutes. Of the 13 players who appeared for Aston Villa six have left the club, two remain but have not been used and just two have started a top-flight match since promotion. Between them those 13 players have played 828 minutes, of which Neil Taylor is single-handedly responsible for 568. Take away Taylor and the remaining 12 have, on average, played a mere 21 minutes and 40 seconds of league football for Villa this season, or a still unimpressive 43 minutes 20 seconds if you discount the departed players. Take away the one member of that Norwich side who has been most used this season, Ben Godfrey, and the remainder have averaged 360 minutes and 23 seconds. For all that the sides are currently separated by only one point, but this is a chance for one of them to prove that their methodology is superior.

Last season they earned notable victories over Chelsea and Tottenham on home soil but failed to take points off any of the top six away from Dean Court, mustering three goals along the way. They were thumped 5-1 by Unai Emery’s side in February and in their last eight meetings, the aggregate score reads 20-8 against Eddie Howe’s side. There is no doubt Bournemouth can hurt teams and Philip Billing has formed a promising midfield partnership with Jefferson Lerma, but a defence that is susceptible to leaking cheap goals – one without a clean sheet in the Premier League this campaign – will likely be tested again in north London. If Howe can find a defensive remedy, Arsenal could be in for another difficult afternoon. BFIt was made abundantly clear to Ralph Hasenhüttl that beating Portsmouth was non-negotiable, and that Southampton supporters would happily shrug off defeats in the league games that bookended that Carabao Cup tie at Fratton Park safe in the knowledge they had recorded victory over their despised rivals. But they can ill-afford league form to suffer too much. If they fall to defeat at home to an in-form Chelsea, they will have lost three Premier League games on the bounce. After the international break they travel to Wolves and host Leicester before November presents trips to Manchester City and Arsenal. Victory over Pompey was priceless but they need to pick up points and fast – particularly at home, where they are yet to taste victory this season – if they are to avoid getting dragged into another all-too familiar relegation scrap. BFEverton’s last visit to Burnley will provoke unusually conflicting memories for the home side. It was, on one level, a complete humiliation: they were a goal down inside two minutes, three behind by the time the opening period was halfway through, and went on to lose 5-1. After that game, however, Sean Dyche made a few changes – Dwight McNeil had started once all season but has only failed to start one league game since Joe Hart had played every league game but has not got off the bench since – Burnley won five and lost none of their next eight and proceeded to finish comfortably clear of relegation. “I thought we bottomed out that day,” Sean Dyche said as the season neared its conclusion. “It is a hard thing to put your finger on but it is a collective thing of, ‘That’s enough.’” Now they will want to show the extent of their improvement against the side that pushed them to the bottom. “It’s one we want to put right,” Ben Mee said. “We’ll definitely be up for it and it will be a good buzz if we get a good result.” SBOf Watford’s last 19 league games, amounting to exactly half of a top-flight season, they have won only four, and taken a total of 15 points. That is point accumulation at a rate that would guarantee relegation if continued over an entire campaign, and partly explains the haste with which they disposed of Javi Gracia last month, after he led his team to one point from four winnable matches. More worrying still, all but one of those four victories came against teams now playing in the Championship. Not since Andre Gray’s last-minute goal brought a 2-1 win over Leicester more than seven months ago have Watford beaten a current Premier League side. They took 16 of a possible 18 points against the teams that eventually went down last season, and this first meeting of the season with a recently-promoted side is a chance for them to see if they feel equally at home against sides that eventually came up. Watford’s defence is seen, not unreasonably, as the side’s great weakness but it is surely time for their attack to contribute a little more: they have taken 105 shots – more than every side except Manchester City (150), Chelsea (120) and Liverpool (105), but of those only 30 have been on target and just four have gone in.

Photographs and video by Achilleas ZavallisThe last day of 14-year-old Raja Hamid Yahya al-Oud’s life began like any other.She got up early along with the rest of the family because there was always a lot of work to do on the farm in the spring planting season. White drones had intermittently circled above their cornfields for the last few weeks, but there was no sign of them that morning.Raja and her mother, Amira, liked to take breaks under the acacia trees about 200 metres from the house. At 4pm, this was to become her final resting place.The plane was flying too high for them to hear it coming but Amira said the sound the CBU-52 BB cluster bomb made as it rained 220 deadly submunitions on their heads will stay with her forever. Some exploded on impact while others, still armed, fell into the fields.Screaming for her daughter, Amira saw Raja’s twisted body under a small tree. Her jaw and entire right side had been ripped apart and blood had already dyed the sand around her black. A neighbour, Hamoud Mohammed al-Ghar, dodged the remaining submunitions to pick Raja up and then ran with her to the nearest road to find a car to take her to hospital. “I knew the girl was already dead,” he said. “But I had to try.” The drones circled ahead the entire time.Raja died on 23 March 2018. But the story of the bomb that is believed to have killed her stretches back decades earlier. Using the serial number and other technical information on the CBU-52 BB’s outer shell, the  traced the munition from its manufacture in Milan, Tennessee, to Sahar farms, in north Yemen, where it ended a child’s life.Cluster munitions were invented by the Nazis and had become a standard weapon of war across the world by the 1970s, designed to kill as many people as possible.They usually consist of a hollow shell filled with hundreds of submunitions that disperse over an area as big as several football pitches as it falls through the air. They either explode on impact or are triggered when moved or stepped on, firing hundreds of fragments of metal that travel at the speed of bullets.The submunitions remain a threat for decades once deployed and those from older designs often resemble shiny silver orbs around the size of a tennis ball, making unexploded ordnance especially attractive to curious children. Hundreds of people worldwide die each year after coming into contact with unexploded cluster bombs, with about 300 casualties a year in Vietnam alone.In 2008 an international treaty called the convention on cluster munitions severely limiting the use, transfer and stockpiling of cluster bombs was adopted by 30 countries. By 2018 it had been signed by 120 states. The US, which sells arms to Saudi-led forces fighting in Yemen, was not one of them.“Cluster munitions went through a proportionality test to measure military advantages gained versus civilian harm of their use,” said Rawan Shaif, the lead Yemen researcher at the open source investigative organisation Bellingcat, of the Geneva conventions relating to the protection of victims of armed conflict. “There’s no military advantage in using a cluster munition in a farm, unless your aim is to make that area uninhabitable for generations of civilians and military alike.”The cluster bomb that killed Raja was manufactured at the Milan Army Ammunition Plant in 1977. The large site, just north of Jackson in west Tennessee, encompasses 231 miles (372km) of roads and 88 miles (142km) of railways and is nicknamed Bullet Town by residents.Milan’s fortunes have risen and fallen with that of the plant: work there has ebbed and flowed with America’s wars. Most of its ordnance and mortar production lines have been moved to Iowa by American Ordnance, the private contractor operating the plant. In 2013 it employed just 113 people, down from a peak of 10,000 during the second world war. By 1977 thousands of cluster bombs like the one that killed Raja were rolling off the production line. The US no longer manufactures CBU-52s: it has long since upgraded to “smart” computer-guided cluster bombs with supposedly more accurate arming and targeting systems. One possible reason a 1977 bomb found its way to Sahar farms, in Yemen, in 2018 is because the US has such a large stockpile of the weapons.In the interim, a good way of reducing the stockpile of outdated weapons – and making some money – was to sell them. Data from 2017 showed the US still had some 2.2m cluster bombs in its arsenal.“Many nations, including the US, Germany, and Switzerland, have taken steps in recent years to bolster both their pre-export due diligence, and their post-delivery verification methods,” said Nic Jenzen-Jones, the director of Armament Research Services, a specialist technical intelligence consultancy. “Nonetheless, there are a lot of arms that have been exported prior to these changes that muddy the waters in terms of how researchers can track and trace items of interest.”The US has been selling weapons, planes, tanks and ordnance to Saudi Arabia for decades and permitting its arms manufacturers to export: it has licensed $138bn (£112bn) to the kingdom in the last 10 years alone, according to research by the US thinktank the Center for International Policy. Officials under Barack Obama worried that sales, after Riyadh launched its air campaign against Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels in March 2015, could amount to complicity in war crimes under international laws that could name the US as a co-belligerent, but in 2016 went ahead with a $1.3bn sale anyway.Bomb sales continue: Donald Trump, who has made Saudi Arabia the cornerstone of his Middle East policy, overrode objections from Congress in March to complete the sale of more than $8bn worth of weapons to Riyadh, its coalition partner the United Arab Emirates coalition partner, and Jordan.The total extent of export licences to the kingdom is not known, and neither is it known when the bomb that killed Raja was sold. The SIPRI Arms Transfers Database, the world’s most extensive record, yielded no results: it contains just a fraction of true sales, as pre-digital record-keeping was poor and states cite national security concerns to avoid disclosing records.It is possible the CBU could have been sold by the US years ago to a third party state and then sold on again to Saudi Arabia: cluster bomb sales to Riyadh were officially stopped in 2016. The US Department of Defense and the state department did not respond to requests for information. Such inquiries are usually met with no comment.Washington says US supplies of “smart weapons” are helping the coalition reduce civilian casualties – but as Raja’s death shows, old US-made dumb bombs are still being used.What we do know is Sahar farms was bombed on 23 March last year after the area had been surveyed by drones for weeks. “We are just farmers,” Hamid Yahya al-Oud, Raja’s father, said over tea in his living room, surrounded by his six remaining children. “Look outside. There’s our well, there’s our goats. Why would there be Houthis here?”At the time of publication, the coalition had not responded to the ’s requests for comment.Sahar farms lies in the countryside of Saada in north Yemen, the Houthi heartland on Saudi Arabia’s border. The whole province is littered with bombed-out buildings, bridges, roads and unexploded ordnance. The green cigar-like shell of the CBU-52 BB cluster bomb is one of the most common of those dropped on the area, according to Abdullah Umayyad, the manager of the UN-funded Yemen Executive Mine Action Centre (Yemac) field office in Saada.The coalition rarely acknowledges civilian casualties from airstrikes, making justice or even simple answers for affected families about why they were targeted almost impossible.“It took two days to clear out Sahar farms after that strike,” said Umayyad. “The work is very dangerous. Three men have been killed in clearance operations here in Saada. My old boss lost his hands, eyes and nose after trying to disarm a cluster bomb submunition last year.”Despite condemnation from human rights groups over airstrikes in Yemen, Yemac’s records suggest more cluster bombs are being dropped on Saada than ever: at least 147 cluster munitions were recovered in the province in the first six months of 2019, up on 122 in the same period of 2018.Its record-keeping, however, is spotty and inidual items are not catalogued. Questions of who, what and why when it comes to bombings fall outside its remit: the political fallout could impact the team’s ability to work across the war-torn country.US-made bombs rain down on north Yemen with almost total impunity.At Sahar farms, the drones have been back in the last two months. “They already killed my daughter,” said Hamid. “Now they’re back for more.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76a0e758379b04a4fa612f19631921d6a87ef4f7/0_1_2281_1369/master/2281.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40b8723519305c0afa200526177ed3e6","title":"with the greatest disrespect how her majestys press offers its candid friendship","story":"The Duchess of Sussex may think she has a good case in her legal battle with the media. But just look at how these other royals fared …Has there ever been a more cruelly miscast “candid friend” to the royal family than Her Majesty’s Press, who are neither truly candid, nor remotely the sort of people one knows socially? And, yes, I obviously include myself in that.In any case, the ONLY acceptable way to look at the royal family is that practised by Princess Michael of Kent, of whom the Queen is once said to have remarked: “She’s rather grand for us.” (Remember: children of former Nazis always marry down.) Unfortunately, this simple shtick has not been grasped by so many of our great newspapers. They embody Sybil Fawlty’s lament over Basil’s relationship with the guests: “You never get it right, do you? You’re either crawling all over them, licking their boots, or spitting poison at them like some Benzedrined puff adder.”And so with the royal press. Either they’re wanking on fawningly for 15 pages about some wedding we probably ought not to have paid for, where every guest without exception hates and pities them. Or they’re making the word BIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIITCH stretch over those same 15 pages, and imagining it counts as fair comment for some minor violation of a quid-pro-quo policy that only they understand, and whose impenetrable rules they change every three minutes anyway.For some decades, my favourite reaction has been the mad leader columns in which the paper in question rants about what they are OWED by whichever prince or princess has denied them #content of some form or other. These are the journalistic equivalent of screaming in the street that a woman should have sex with you because you bought her a drink. Or, in this case, bought a titchy percentage of her drink as a UK taxpayer. In any other arena it would be regarded as certifiably embarrassing behaviour.And with that, we must narrow our frame of reference to the “select media outlets” – print and TV – that have spent the past year or so affectlessly tormenting Prince Harry and his wife Meghan for clicks, yet are now calling for the smelling salts because the couple have decided to launch a legal action.There is, as we know, no snowflake like a freedom-of-speech snowflake. Freedom of speech being the sole human right these particular papers and TV pundits recognise, there is now a great outpouring of “candid friendship” warning the couple that they have gone too far by speaking freely. Freedom of speech is a one-way street, and the last thing people who are a distant sixth in line to the throne, and receding from it fast, should be behaving like is slightly crap celebrities.And yet, and yet … is it? I hate to point out the obvious, but the series of events that would lead to Harry and Meghan becoming operational and actually taking the throne would be so immense, sensational and horrifyingly multi-corpsed, that – were it to happen – editors probably wouldn’t mind any more which mode of transport they had taken back from a trip to New York two years before. So what does any of it matter? A Google summit in Italy, charity editorship of Vogue, a private jet to Elton’s house, something-or-other in the royal box at Wimbledon, refusing to show what one paper called “all of Archie” to the photographers – these wouldn’t be quite the major deal they are laughably imagined at the moment.Having said all that, we papers have got to stick together. So in the spirit of colleaguery, I am very pleased to offer the lawyers of the newspapers in question a series of historical precedents I have unearthed from the global archives – all of which relate to other royal women who were no better than they should be. I believe they show why your current approach is the right one, and offer them humbly for presentation to the courts in due course.We are saddened to learn you claim “distress” at our meticulous coverage of public-interest questions regarding your fingers. The public are very interested in them. As you know, our article Does Anne Boleyn Have Six Fingers? was one of the very first newspaper questions to which the answer is “no”. We pride ourselves on our pack-leading journalism. Our coverage of this issue amounted to valuable – estimable – public service journalism, and no one will ever say that you have six fingers again. Certainly not for centuries, still, even when it is definitely untrue. However, you need to understand that this generous service on our behalf is a two-way street, and it is time for you to honour your side of the bargain. Why will you not repeatedly sit for our portraitist, displaying all your fingers, in a manner that would quell residual gossip? What is it you have to hide? Is it a rudimentary finger? People are beginning to ask again, and it is only right that we report their allegations. Furthermore, I am afraid your failure to understand our mutually beneficial relationship means we have had to run a portrait using Photoshoppe, which is captioned: “How Anne Boleyn might look if she had six fingers.” We are saddened to have been driven to this. Please consider our feelings.We must caution Your Majesty against your frankly hysterical complaint regarding our hugely popular, long-running front-page series Is Queen Bess a Maid Or No? Like many newspapers, we breathed a sigh of relief when an investigation found your mother, Anne Boleyn, was killed not by a relentless campaign of conspiracist shittery, but by an executioner’s blade. A reminder that gossip doesn’t kill people – swords do. Alas, it is a great and most portentous sadness to us to find you repeating some of her mistakes. While during her life we shat on her every week for everything, to the point where she presumably didn’t know whether she was coming or going, we now speak of her as someone who got it absolutely, tragically right always as far as dealing with us is concerned. She was a saint. She worked with us. You should, too. What’s the worst that could happen?We were disappointed to receive your extraordinary complaint over our coverage of your attendance of the Galileo summit in Italy. This newspaper has made no secret of its concerns over Mr Galileo’s fashionable theories that the Earth goes round the sun, or of our concerns that he is being manipulated in a way we cannot quite put our finger on, but which will allow us to maintain our policy of thinking his insistent warnings probably aren’t really that big of a deal. Without wishing to lapse into technical jargon, we are confident that he will “get his” in due course. Above all, your complaint reeked of hypocrisy from top to bottom: you also like to tell us that the world is round, but you were pictured walking on flat earth on your arrival.

Most artists operate on tiny margins and the prospect of extra cost and bureaucracy would kill their ability to tour, develop their talent and build their fanbase.”Dugher said British artists were already cancelling European tours and promoters were withdrawing planned investment. In September the British musician Imogen Heap announced she was cancelling her upcoming European tour, which was due to start in early November, citing “the extreme uncertainties of travelling throughout the EU so soon after Brexit has happened”.Mark Davyd, the head of the UK Music Venue Trust, said: “If this is the best that can be achieved then we would strongly urge the government to bring forward fully funded proposals that create centralised, accessible and free-to-use support that can enable grassroots musicians to comply with these demands.”The issues are also expected to affect sport. The president of Uefa, Aleksander Čeferin, said recently that Brexit would affect the organisation of tournaments such as Euro 2020. “I don’t think that we should organise such a big event,” he said at the Uefa committee meeting in Slovenia last month. “It’s symbolically very nice, it’s pan-European, it’s east-west, north-south, it’s 60 years, but doing it every time, I would say it’s too challenging.”In the event of a no-deal Brexit, touring parties would have to check inidual EU states’ immigration rules for requirements regarding documentation, work permits and visas. HMRC would stop issuing forms to allow self-employed people to work temporarily in the European economic area.Tourers would have to contact relevant EU countries’ social security institutions to check whether they need to pay contributions locally in addition to national insurance. Additionally, the guide states that European health insurance cards may not be valid after a no-deal Brexit, necessitating the purchase of health and travel insurance.Anyone driving their own vehicle in the EU would require a “green card” that takes up to a month to acquire from an insurance company, plus a GB sticker and in some countries an international driving permit.Parties planning to run “unscheduled bus or coach services” in EU countries would require a standard international operator licence and a copy of the Interbus waybill. Every roundtrip passing through EU nations requires a completed waybill from the Confederation of Passenger Transport that details the entirety of a planned trip from start to finish.CPT’s operations officer, Mark Purchase, said this would limit the ability of DIY organisations – for example, a band, small theatre company or charity hiring a minibus – to tour the EU, as international operator licences were available only to licensed bus and coach operators, not iniduals.Purchase said anyone attempting to tour EU states without an international operator’s licence may face fines. They recalled a spate of instances this year in which British operators attempted to tour Belgium with incomplete waybills, incurring fines of €900 (£799).Ian McCoid, the general manager of leading Hull-based tour bus company MM Band Services, said these measures would add to travel times “quite considerably”, at least in the short term. “I think these first few months will be chaotic for UK-based tours and travel companies.”Touring artists would require carnets – essentially a detailed passport for merchandise – to avoid paying duty on goods brought into EU nations for business reasons, such as publicity and education materials and equipment used for work. A carnet costs £325.96 and is valid for one year: it requires the holder to list every item they take into a country.Tom Dowse, a guitarist in the emerging UK punk band Dry Cleaning, said: “Being from a working-class background, touring Europe often represents the only exposure to different cultures and audiences you can experience as a musician. Clearly this is a move to make another sector of the arts the exclusive preserve of those who have access to significant financial support. As usual, that conforms to type. The Conservatives have always wanted to make the opportunity to contribute to the culture of this country something only rich people do.”Paul Reed, the chief executive of the Association of Independent Festivals, said the DCMS guidance, while useful, “does not translate into readiness”. He said he did not feel the live music industry was ready for a no-deal Brexit, citing issues including VAT, data protection and the movement of people and equipment. “Despite repeated calls for an EU-wide ‘touring passport’ in the event of no deal, all we have are short-term assurances regarding freedom of movement up to December 2020 – and then ‘leave to remain’ for a further 36 months.”Reed said that while economic uncertainty related to Brexit did not appear to affect independent UK festivals this year, it had influenced UK-based festival promoters operating in other parts of Europe, citing “significant amounts” spent on contingency planning around the original planned 29 March departure date.“It is also alarming that UK artists travelling to Europe will have to pre-pay import duty and VAT on all merchandise they bring on tour with them in the event of a no-deal,” Reed said. “For the government, there seems to be an overemphasis on large-scale events for no-deal planning, but this will all have an impact at grassroots level.”Davyd said the proposed administrative and financial demands were “plainly outside the capabilities and economics of the average musician playing an under-500-capacity show on the continent. If this is the final position then a significant decrease in the number of UK artists able to tour at the grassroots level in the EU27 countries would be the inevitable result.” Rob Challice, an agent at the music touring agency Paradigm, said he doubted the British touring industry was “anywhere near” ready for a no-deal Brexit. “The relevant information is generally unclear because it is dependent on information from other countries that is subject to change on 1 November.”Challice expressed further concern about the need for ATA carnets to transport equipment. “It’s a complicated piece of paperwork and it does cost money to process. Furthermore, there’s no guarantee that the UKEU ‘border’ will be set up to stamp them accordingly.”In April, Sammy Andrews of the industry group Music4EU told the  that a visa requirement would lead to “heavy losses” for work for British road crew and technical engineers. “Having to get extra visas for them means for certain that many bands will use local crews and not employ people from the UK for those roles, and this could have a devastating impact on that community. We know this for sure because it happens already for exactly those reasons outside of the EU.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9b5ac300f9fadec2a33f9c1e87be04648976813/0_72_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e377d522f87b730b9a5c0906e6da93ed","title":"tell us if you have applied for welfare and benefit payments online","story":"We would like to hear about any difficulties you have experienced negotiating computer and IT systems while making a welfare or benefit claimPublic authorities are using robots, algorithms and machine learning to assess welfare and benefit claims, but the systems are often hidden inside a ‘black box’, away from public scrutiny.

Manchester is a “hotspot” for this “highly volatile” work, it adds.But it is not just takeaway delivery people who are in insecure work: fixed-term contracts are common practice in universities, of which Manchester has many, the author notes.In Manchester, average house prices are 6.6 times average incomes, higher than in the wider north-west. This is less than the English average of eight times, which is skewed by London, where, at the most extreme, house prices are more than 20 times average incomes.The situation in Manchester is compounded by a larger private rented sector than the national average and a waiting list of 13,000 for social housing. In Greater Manchester alone, 92,000 social homes have been lost through right to buy since 1980, according to the combined authority.An average house in Manchester now costs £175,000 compared with £36,500 in 1995, meaning costs have more than quadrupled in 24 years.The report also encourages Greater Manchester to implement minimum standards for access to private or neighbourhood outside space such as gardens, balconies and roof gardens. The Greater London Authority has already adopted a minimum standard of 5 sq metres of private space for each one- to two-person household, which increases with the number of people in residence.Hannah Webster, report author and senior researcher at the RSA, said: “Young people are being failed by our current housing system – and this is particularly true in Manchester.”She added: “A new Greater Manchester housing devolution deal should give mayors and councils Scottish-style powers to cap runaway rents in areas like central Manchester. These ‘rent pressure zones’ would help those facing steep rents in certain neighbourhoods, without taking the step of introducing rent controls across the board.”Suzanne Richards, Manchester city council’s executive member for housing and regeneration, said: “Our challenge is to improve standards and increase supply at the affordable end of the market to ensure all our residents have a safe and decent home to live in.“To meet this challenge, we are working closely with the city’s registered providers and housing associations to unlock as much investment as possible from government. We are also prioritising our own land and resources for investment in affordable and social housing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06b7b8ee8a729b55bf6d33b4c8daf112054af88e/0_323_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7462274ed0b965421d51c5e2a6dd048","title":"dina asher smith ice cream gold medal world championships","story":"Moments after shrugging off all that suffocating pressure by obliterating her rivals to win her first 200m world championships gold medal on Wednesday, an exhausted Dina Asher-Smith took a deep breath and her mind wandered back to where everything began. “It was something I dreamed about as a pipe dream when I was younger, when I started running, when I was eight years old,” she said.All those years ago, the 23‑year‑old never imagined her dreams would come true in Doha. Even her arrival into the world of athletics seems a fluke – only a bribe in the form of an ice-cream convinced the Perry Hall Primary School pupil to attend a running club where they ran cross country, a discipline she detested. It was her future coach John Blackie who saw her and put her on the right path, recruiting her to the Bees Academy in Bromley at the age of eight.By the time Asher-Smith left primary school and arrived at Newstead Wood School in Orpington, she was beginning to break records. However, for Vikki Eason, her PE teacher and athletics coach, it was Asher-Smith’s overall athleticism that was striking.“She was always a really able sportswoman in many different sports, not just athletics good at school games, she swam … I taught her as a PE teacher but also as athletics coach and she still used to come and compete for the athletics team.”The records continued. At 13, Asher-Smith recorded the 300m age‑best in a time of 39.16sec. Even as her athletics career took off and she began her long journey of juggling sport and academics, she continued to be an integral part of her school.For all her lofty dreams, Asher‑Smith kept them to herself. Eason did not know that her pupil harboured Olympic goals until she watched Asher-Smith appear at the 2012 Olympic games as a kit carrier.Asher-Smith returned to school emboldened and inspired, finally ready to embrace her potential.“That’s when she told me that she wanted to be an Olympian,” says Eason. “She was so keen and so enthusiastic to be so close to the athletics stars. She was keen to take part in all aspects of athletics she wasn’t just one of the ones to perform and not do anything else.”“Bubbly” is the word constantly used to describe Asher-Smith, and that is also how Eason remembered her. But that does not quite explain how Asher-Smith has been so ruthless in the face of pressure in a sport that relies so heavily on mental fortitude. Early last year, Asher‑Smith gave a Tedx talk where she spoke only of her career, her mindset and goals. Her opening line revealed plenty:“I’m Dina Asher-Smith and I am motivated by a fear of failure,” she said. “OK, ‘motivated’ isn’t a strong enough word to express how I feel. It’s more like an allergy to me – an itching, nagging feeling deep inside of me that gives me the inability to be complacent about anything.”Most sporting champions are forged in the smothering heat of adversity and no season prepared Asher-Smith for this week more than the nightmare of 2017, when she fractured her foot in training five months before the 2017 world championships in London.Ever since her Olympic experience, Asher-Smith had dreamed of London, so when doctors told her it was over, she refused to hear it. She worked tirelessly on her comeback and won a 4x100m relay silver after a fourth-place finish in the 200m. As well‑meaning people congratulated her simply on returning to the track, she realised that her attitude could not have erged more.“The focus from then on was not just being healthy, not just running painlessly but it was being world class,” she said. “It was being as close to my best as possible. So many people have told me: ‘Oh my god, it’s so good that you’re running. You’ve been so positive. It’s great.’ But I wasn’t in the business of just being positive. I don’t just go into the championships being positive. If I’m there, I want to be the best I can be and London was no different.”In 2013, as a 17-year-old, she received a surprise call from British Athletics to run in the 4x100m team. She was shocked at that and even more so when the British quartet secured a bronze medal. Those days are no more. Now, she calls herself a “championship performer”, and after she won the 100m and 200m double at the European Championships last year, she returned home to pandemonium. She is learning how to be famous.“Lots of people have been referring to me as a role model, which I still find very odd,” she said. “But at the same time I am rolling with it, because I do have a social responsibility to make sure young people have a positive person to look up to.”With a world title forever wed to her name and the Olympics on the horizon, there will only be more attention, more fame and more people looking up to her success as an example to emulate. But for all the fans she gains, it is telling that those who knew her first still back her all the way.“It’s absolutely amazing,” Eason said. “It’s just a real privilege to have taught her at school. For her to have worked with me and to now see her come through in the way she has? She’s just worked so hard and she’s so enthusiastic. It’s really lovely.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2648efd48fbdc131e44bcdba4b76ab47a70c38f5/0_95_5115_3070/master/5115.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cade7d4c52615a9466fc9d69dfd460bb","title":"england rugby world cup argentina jones","story":"Eddie Jones is eager for his team to stick to their plan and arrive at the knockout stages with gathering momentumCompared to their last three Rugby World Cup campaigns things are going almost unnervingly smoothly for England at present. They have no major injury concerns, the squad are relishing each other’s company in Japan and their lineup to face Argentina has an increasingly settled, confident look to it.Big tournament life is not supposed to be so serene, as England know from weary experience. By this point in 2007 they had been beaten 36-0 by South Africa in 2011 the wheels were already beginning to wobble in New Zealand. Four years ago they were in the process of losing to Wales and Australia on consecutive Saturdays, a grim old period for all concerned.Contrast that with the strong poker hand at Eddie Jones’s disposal this time around. When his side thrashed Ireland at Twickenham in their penultimate warm-up Test in August, it did not take a genius to foresee the management wanting to name the nucleus of that XV for the Pumas fixture. Fourteen of the 15 starters from that Irish fixture are back again, the only exception being the fit-again Anthony Watson on the wing for Joe Cokanasiga.With Mako Vunipola, Jack Nowell and Henry Slade, furthermore, all back on the bench, England’s small army of physios, conditioners and medics also deserve a pat on the back. Fate could yet intervene, clearly, but Jones could not have asked for much more before a fixture that has been circled in his diary for over two years. Beat the Pumas and, to some degree, England can relax, safe in the knowledge their knockout qualification is assured for the first time in eight years. There will inevitably be some idle teahouse chatter about whether they would be better finishing second in Pool C and potentially avoiding Australia and New Zealand in the quarters and semis but, equally, arriving in the last eight with gathering momentum and an unbeaten pool record would hardly be the worst outcome.While Jones is making dutiful noises about fully respecting Argentina, he also knows this would be a good moment to make a real statement against opponents who have not looked as threatening as usual at this World Cup. It would also nip in the bud the “boring” England narrative with which Jones is entirely familiar, having previously seen another former Wallaby coach Bob Dwyer employ it successfully prior to the 1991 World Cup final.England’s pack were more than a match for anyone but that day, instead, the team chose to adopt a more open style which ultimately backfired. “It is the old two-card trick,” Jones said, grinning. “Bob Dwyer threw that one out there in 1991 and there was a response. Maybe if England hadn’t played like that they would have two World Cups on their sleeves.”There is more than one way, in other words, to skin a Puma and Jones has long been working on ways to maximise this current England side’s strengths. Above all else he wants his players to be crystal clear about the gameplan, dynamic with and without the ball, supremely fit and flexible enough to keep up with international rugby’s latest trends. In this tournament, given the frequently slippery ball and the reluctance of referees to ping every single ruck offence, it pays to have a range of different kicking options and, in particular, a mobile threat at the breakdown.Hence the return to the George Ford-Owen Farrell axis at 10 and 12, with Elliot Daly’s left boot in reserve and both Tom Curry and Sam Underhill in the starting back row. “I feel the game has moved into another cycle of contestability,” Jones said. “The referees want low penalty counts and when you have low penalty counts, that means you have a highly contested breakdown and more kicking. We just thought: how can we be best equipped in that area? Argentina have gone for big, tall, carrying back-rowers. We have got one big carrying No 8 between two industrious players at six and seven. Is that the right way? We think it is.”•\u0026nbspFixtures, tables and results• Top try and points scorers•\u0026nbspSign up to The Breakdown, our free rugby union email newsletterPablo Matera and Marcos Kremer will be keen to challenge Jones’s hunch but, with temperatures of 30C forecast for matchday, conditions might not necessarily suit the heavier members of the Pumas pack. England will aim to back their fitness – save for Mako Vunipola and Nowell who Jones concedes are still working their way back to a full gallop – and to stick to their pre-arranged script. “I think we know what we are good at,” said Jones. “Like any good batsman you can get seduced by a loose ball outside the off stump every now and then. We are as guilty as anyone but, by and large, I think we are pretty disciplined.”Omitting Mark Wilson for the all-action Lewis Ludlam, however, was a tough call and Jones still rates such conversations as the hardest part of his job. After 25 years, I still find that difficult. We’ve got some disappointed ones.”He has also been saddened by news of the passing of his good friend Jeff Sayle, a popular stalwart of the Randwick club in Sydney. “He was just a great fella and is a real loss to the game. We’ve got to make sure we keep those characters in rugby.” A rip-roaring win for the Poms this weekend, perversely, would be a timely tribute."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1db71f88beddc559fce310b4855cb354bdaa23bb/0_197_3774_2264/master/3774.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2616e70b66ca846dca1d2914059748c6","title":"ioc investigation alberto salazar athletes","story":"Thomas Bach, the International Olympic Committee president, says he has contacted the World Anti-Doping Agency asking it to investigate all athletes who trained with the banned coach Alberto Salazar.Salazar, who coached Britain’s Mo Farah for six years, was this week found guilty of “orchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct” while at the Nike Oregon Project.Speaking on Thursday at a news conference, Bach said the case was “very worrying and raises serious concerns”, and that he would be asking Wada to take a closer look.Sebastian Coe, president of the International Association of Athletics Federation, warned that any athlete who tries to stay secretly with Salazar would face a two-year ban themselves.On what he will be asking Wada, Bach said: “To see how many athletes have been investigated. Have all the athletes been investigated who have been training in this centre? Does the report address the whole period of the existence of this project or only part of it? Could any Olympic results directly or indirectly be affected?“We learned from the report that the athletes would not have known what happened to them – this is an important factor when looking at sanctions but disqualification is mandatory whether the athlete knows or not.”In a statement, Wada said it could not comment publicly until it had reviewed the case in full. Salazar has said he will appeal against the judgment. This week Farah, who has never failed a drugs test, said he had “no tolerance for anyone who breaks the rules or crosses a line”.Meanwhile Coe has vowed to clamp down on athletes using prescription medicines for performance enhancement in the wake of Usada’s investigation into Salazar – including the use of asthma and thyroid medication. The use of such medication is not illegal under the World Anti-Doping Code, but many in the sport believe using drugs such as thyroxin is unethical because it could damage an athlete’s health.On Wednesday one leading coach asked UK Athletics to set up an inquiry into whether Salazar’s methods were ever used by British coaches and athletes. Coe admitted the issue was also a concern for him.“We are looking into this,” he said. “We’ve got to make sure that medical conditions are genuine – and that prescription-only drugs are not aiding human performance. However when it comes to therapeutic use exemptions, they have already been tightened up dramatically since when I first came on to the IAAF’s council. I think we were in the thousands for TUEs. Now it is literally a handful in real terms. So we’re much tougher about that sort of stuff.”Coe was also asked about comments made by the US 1500m legend Jenny Simpson, who said on Wednesday that a “black cloud” had hung over Salazar’s training group.“Jenny’s a very thoughtful athlete,” said Coe. The only point I would make is that if athletes feel that they’ve got something to tell us, they really must. Because they are the prime source of intelligence.”Coe also denied taking a swipe at the BBC and its presenter Gabby Logan, who was seen laughing when the pundit Michael Johnson told her off camera that the IAAF president was “full of shit”.“The BBC is a great broadcaster,” Coe said. “It’s got a fabulous history with our sport. I just made an observation about the comparison between what is easily concluded in a studio over a few days, and the bigger picture that I have to be thinking about.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/322412589580b8b0407ec1e3a46fcf19013d1688/0_234_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95340e3229c4a2227ae01233241ae14a","title":"enable drawn in stall nine of small field as she chases history in the arc","story":"Sunday will be the smallest Arc field since 2007 with 12 runners as Frankie Dettori’s mount seeks a third win at LongchampEnable remains odds-on at 4-5 for the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp on Sunday after being drawn in stall nine for Europe’s showpiece event. Charlie Appleby’s Ghaiyyath, however, has drifted in the betting after being handed the widest draw in stall 12, a difficult starting position for a horse that seems best when he can get to the lead.Last year’s Arc showed the potential importance of the draw at Longchamp, as Sea Of Class, from stall 15, narrowly failed to overhaul Enable, from five, after being forced to drop in at the rear of the field. The smallest Arc field since 2007 should mean it is less significant on Sunday, giving Enable every chance to make history as the first horse to win the race three times.Three of the four horses at the head of the ante-post betting were drawn towards the outside, with Japan and Ryan Moore immediately to Enable’s left in 10. Sottsass, the French Derby winner, is the only leading contender with a low stall, against the rail in one.Magical, a stable companion of Japan at the Aidan O’Brien yard, is alongside him in stall eight, while Waldgeist, who will be André Fabre’s only runner as the trainer seeks a record eighth Arc victory, is drawn in three.Ghaiyyath, who took the Group One Grosser Preis von Baden by 14 lengths last time out, eased from 10-1 to 12-1 with several layers after the draw on Thursday, having made most or all of the running to win both in Germany and in the Prix d’Harcourt at Longchamp in April.His only defeat this year came in the Prix Ganay, again at Longchamp, when he was unable to dominate and while William Buick, his big-race jockey, has suggested this week that his mount is “not one-dimensional”, a soft lead on Sunday now looks highly unlikely.The going at Longchamp was described as soft on Thursday morning, with no more than 2mm of rain forecast for the track on Friday and Saturday. Earlier fears of more significant rain ahead of Sunday’s big race have also receded, with no more than 4mm expected at the track on Sunday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa8ce649acfbca3f81f5bdea813d3539e96964d6/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e19f7274850548f7e0e82fba10d6f59","title":"google data harvesting facial recognition people of color","story":"Subcontracted workers were instructed to persuade subjects to agree to face scans, mischaracterizing them as a ‘selfie game’ or ‘survey’Facial recognition technology’s failures when it comes to accurately identifying people of color have been well documented and much criticized. But an attempt by Google to improve its facial recognition algorithms by collecting data from people with dark skin is raising further concerns about the ethics of the data harvesting.Google has been using subcontracted workers to collect face scans from members of the public in exchange for $5 gift cards, according to a report from the New York Daily News. The face scan collection project had been previously reported, but anonymous sources described unethical and deceptive practices to the Daily News.The subcontracted workers were employed by staffing firm Randstad but directed by Google managers, according to the report. They were instructed to target people with “darker skin tones” and those who would be more likely to be enticed by the $5 gift card, including homeless people and college students.“They said to target homeless people because they’re the least likely to say anything to the media,” a former contractor told the Daily News. “The homeless people didn’t know what was going on at all.”“I feel like they wanted us to prey on the weak,” another contractor told the Daily News.Randstad did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Google defended the project but said it was investigating allegations of wrongdoing.The contractors also described using deceptive tactics to persuade subjects to agree to the face scans, including mischaracterizing the face scan as a “selfie game” or “survey”, pressuring people to sign a consent form without reading it, and concealing the fact that the phone the research subjects were handed to “play with” was taking video of their faces.“We’re taking these claims seriously and investigating them,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement. “The allegations regarding truthfulness and consent are in violation of our requirements for volunteer research studies and the training that we provided.”The spokesperson added that the “collection of face samples for machine learning training” were intended to “build fairness” into the “face unlock feature” for the company’s new phone, Pixel 4.“It’s critical we have a erse sample, which is an important part of building an inclusive product,” the spokesperson said, adding that the face unlock feature will provide users with “a powerful new security measure”.But the project has drawn harsh condemnation from digital civil rights and racial justice advocates.The controversy touches on tricky questions about algorithmic bias and data privacy. Is it better to improve facial recognition for people of all skin colors – or ban the technology entirely, as a handful of US cities have done this year? And how much should users be compensated for providing companies such as Google with their personal data?“This is totally unacceptable conduct from a Google contractor. It’s why the way AI is built today needs to change,” said Jake Snow, an attorney with the ACLU of Northern California. “The answer to algorithmic bias is not to target the most vulnerable.”“Whether it’s racist because it’s accurate or because it’s inaccurate, facial recognition and biometric tools in general fuel racial bias,” said Cyril. “No amount of money or informed consent is enough to produce a weakly regulated technology already being used to violate the human rights of millions.”Rashad Robinson, executive director of Color of Change, said: “Google’s tactic of targeting economically vulnerable populations is morally reprehensible. There’s no way to put a sticker price on biometric data – nor should there be.”“Facial recognition software has bias baked into its coding, and has primarily been used to control our movements and decide who belongs and who doesn’t, in public and private spaces,” he added. “This technology is dangerous – especially for black people – and that’s why Color Of Change is mobilizing for complete legislative bans on facial recognition across the country. We don’t need more tech experiments. We need government regulation to stop the unfettered growth of this technology.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d67f364f92827e5c4d1559471e09da24fe5897a1/1_0_1689_1014/master/1689.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6da66cad5f76da32e743dcd1eef3b689","title":"can a mini pc and a tv set replace a old laptop","story":"Anthony wants to replace his mother’s old Windows 7 laptop. Would a mini-PC hooked up to her 32in TV work well enough? My retired mother happily uses her iPhone and iPad for the majority of her digital needs, but she uses an old, low-spec Windows 7 laptop for Microsoft Office documents for various committees she sits on, for her music library and digital photos, some web browsing and other tasks that cannot be easily done on a small device.I have a Mac Mini running through a 42in TV set, and we are interested in the feasibility of using a mini PC hooked up to her 32in TV. Target budget is £300 for PC, keyboard and any adaptors.For the OS evangelists among your readers, I use a Mac and I may well repurpose her laptop with Linux, but Mum wants Windows. AntMini or micro PCs are terrific at what they do, as long as you don’t expect them to do too much. They are also potential space-savers because they can be attached to the back of any monitor or TV set that has a standard VESA mount. Anyone unfamiliar with the form factor can read an answer from November 2018, What is the point of mini PCs?However, mini PCs come in at least three overlapping categories. First, there are entry-level models that cost about £100 to £350, and are essentially television set-top boxes. Second, there are desktop replacement minis that are widely used in large businesses for their convenience and space-saving properties. Prices range from £300 to about £1,500.The third category consists of so-called barebones machines that appeal to computer enthusiasts and other people who want to build their own small-format systems. These could be set-top boxes or desktop replacements depending on the parts used. However, they don’t appeal to home users who want an off-the-shelf set-top box for media streaming, and they don’t appeal to businesses, which buy standardised mini PCs in volume from HP, Lenovo and Dell.Your question is about the feasibility of using a (roughly) £250 mini PC hooked up to a 32in TV for Microsoft Office and some other uses, such as managing music and photo libraries. There are a couple of reasons why I don’t think it’s a good idea.The main problem is that it’s not practical to use programs such as Word and Excel at typical TV viewing distances, especially not with such a small TV set. In the old days, interface designers distinguished between “the 3ft experience” of using a computer monitor and “the 10ft experience” of using a TV set. They needed radically different approaches, and different-sized icons and text.Even if we assume the TV set can display small text sharply enough, your mum will need to be around 3ft1 metre from the screen to make it usable. Based on my long experience of watching TV in normal-sized living rooms, I’ll be surprised if this is practical. However, you can easily check this by plugging mum’s current Windows laptop into her TV set.The other problem is your budget. There are plenty of very cheap mini PCs, but their specifications generally include an old and slow Intel Atom processor, 2GB or 4GB of memory, and 32GB of eMMC chip storage, which is pretty much on a par with an SD card. Amazingly enough, machines like this will run Microsoft Office with home-sized documents, but they are underpowered for what your mother needs.Worse, any PC with limited storage – 32GB or 64GB – may run into problems updating Windows 10 twice a year, even though it should be able to handle upgrades by using, say, an external hard drive as temporary storage space. (Presumably your mum already has one for backup purposes. If not, install some kind of backup solution as soon as possible.)Suppliers rarely sell their higher-spec PCs for less than their lower-spec versions, so either I’m missing something or the apparent anomalies won’t last very long.If you buy a mini PC for closer to £200 then you could still come in around your budget price with either of these monitors, as long as your mother can find space for the extra screen.Under the circumstances, you may want to take the easy way out and replace mum’s old laptop with a new laptop. It’s some time since I looked at cheap laptops, and my most recent answer covered laptops costing up to £500. You can still buy “real” laptops for less, but below £300, the experience gets progressively worse.Yes, you can live with a laptop that has limited screen resolution (1366 x 768 pixels), a slow Intel Pentium or Celeron processor, only 4GB of memory and a traditional hard drive, but you can do dramatically better for not a lot more money.Low specs are a false economy. Today, 8GB of RAM costs about £30, so fitting 4GB instead of 8GB only saves $20 at retail prices. It must save even less at the wholesale prices that HP and Lenovo pay when they are buying more than 1m memory modules a week. At current prices, it’s crazy to buy PCs with only 4GB, unless you plan to add more memory instantly.Have you got a question?

Little common knowledge can be assumed and an awful lot of time and effort has to be spent explaining quite where we are and who has done what to whom to get us there. An opening caption sets the scene, which you can choose to read in your A-Team or Star Wars voice: “Catherine’s turbulent reign began in 1762 with a military coup. She seized power from her husband Emperor Peter III who died soon after – in mysterious circumstances. Surrounded by enemies and fighting off rival challenges to her throne, Catherine’s rule is far from secure.” If you have a problem, if no one else can help you, maybe you can hire … Count Orlov and Grigor Potemkin. No, wait, I’m getting ahead of myself.Catherine the Great is played, magnificently, by Helen Mirren. If she were not, questions would surely be asked in the House. Her formidable talent and long career has made her into acting royalty herself and in recent years she has become a specialist in monarchs proper, leaning into her innate regality to produce award-winning turns as Elizabeths I and II. Even more pertinently for her latest venture, she was also born Helen Mironoff, daughter of Vasily Petrovich and granddaughter of Pyotr Vasilievich Mironov, a colonel in the Imperial Russian army. It feels as much a labour of love as the glad seizing of a part that would be catnip to any actor.So this series has the perfect actor and comes, in many ways, at the perfect time – ripe for the story of a woman resented on all sides for refusing to shape herself or her desires to the traditional feminine mould and becoming instead the embodiment of the writer Florence King’s note: “When a woman steps out of her place, she always steps up.” Not all of them arrange a coup d’etat removing their husbands from power and having them assassinated (she maintained plausible deniability over the latter), of course.Her now-lover Orlov and his brother are angling for a slice of power. The army reckons it put the Empress on the throne and can knock her off it any time. There are those who consider her regent only until her son Paul reaches his majority and can take over. There are others who have met Paul and would rather a large fur hat governed Russia than that 18-year-old milksop. And then there’s Prisoner Number One, poor Ivan IV, a claimant to the throne confined in Shlisselburg prison for all of his 24 years and sent mad in the process, but who still acts as a rallying point for Catherine’s opponents.Before long we are all in a welter of intrigue, treachery and general skulduggery – and once Potemkin heaves into view, you can add sexual rivalry too. It really is, one hopes, so unlike the home life of our own dear queen.In the opening episode, the liberal-minded empress must lose some of her ideals and find her cojones instead. Ivanites move against the empress, so her orders to have him killed are carried out. The army’s Lieutenant Merovitch tries to stir up trouble and finds himself decapitated, despite her insinuation of a pardon on the scaffold. Only Potemkin offers her a safe space, and he is soon defenestrated by the Orlovs for his pains. He survives, though only to have to attend a fancy dress palace ball (which hardly seems fair on the man).The parts are all good – the scenery, the performances, the script – but they add up to slightly less than their sum. Perhaps it is the extra exposition that makes it feel too ponderous and prevents it from taking flight. Or perhaps it is the fact that when it comes to creating anything, you can do all you can to maximise your chances of success but the final ingredient is always elusive. Call it magic, call it luck, but you need it to alchemise your efforts. If it’s not there what you have is a sturdy workhorse, full of fine actors, good moments and impeccable intentions, but not the elegant thoroughbred or racing steed of your dreams."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e328249a99441499958dc15380a50a0531866742/0_219_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc5efcaeaf8e93eb4667ae2a16cc50bc","title":"hong kong leader to ban face masks as she activates colonial era powers","story":"Carrie Lam warned against ‘slip towards authoritarianism’ as leak reveals police relaxed guidelines on lethal force Hong Kong’s leader plans to use harsh colonial-era emergency powers for the first time, banning face masks in a bid to curb the city’s protests.Opposition politicians warned it represented a slide towards authoritarianism and risked further inflaming tensions.Adding to concerns about a hardline government approach, a leaked memo showed police had relaxed their guidelines on using lethal force the day before a teenage student was shot in the chest, the first live-ammunition injury since protests began in June.Police have insisted the officer acted lawfully, and the 18-year-old student, who is still being treated in hospital, was charged with rioting and assaulting a police officer.Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, was expected to announce details of the face mask ban on Friday, local media reported, in response to chaotic violence across the city on China’s national day, 1 October.Lam was at a gala in Beijing celebrating 70 years of communist rule while pitched battles were fought in the streets of her city between police and protesters, but since her return she has been under heavy pressure from pro-China groups to use the sweeping powers bequeathed by the British.The emergency regulations ordinance was introduced in 1922 so colonial authorities could break up strikes paralysing the ports. It allows the government to make any regulations it considers in the public interest, if it decides the city faces “an occasion of emergency or public danger”.Measures imposed could include censorship, control or suppression of the media, arrests, detentions, deportations, and seizure of property. The legislature can only amend or repeal any law passed under the emergency regulations once it has already been implemented.The regulations are considered so extreme that they have not been used for over half a century, and never deployed since the 1997 handover to Chinese sovereignty.“The emergency regulations are the start of a slip towards an authoritarian state,” a lawmaker, Dennis Kwok, said at a news conference, adding that he did not expect any form of government crackdown to end the protest movement.“The yearning for freedom, democracy and liberty are not going to go away just because you bring in more draconian regulations,” he said.A ban on masks would appear to be a limited use of emergency powers, but government critics say they believe it could serve as a way to test public and legal reaction, and pave the way for more extensive controls.A new Hong Kong extradition law is proposed, which would allow people to be transferred to mainland China for a variety of crimes. Residents fear it could lead to politically-motivated extraditions into China\u0027s much harsher judicial system.Large public demonstrations start as thousands march in the streets to protest the extradition bill.Hong Kong lawmakers scuffle in parliament during a row over the law.Hong Kong\u0027s leader Carrie Lam introduces concessions to the extradition bill, including limiting the scope of extraditable offences, but critics say they are not enough.The scale of protests continues to increase as more than half a million take to the streets. Police use rubber bullets and tear gas against the biggest protests Hong Kong has seen for decades.Lam says that the proposed extradition law has been postponed indefinitely.The protests continue as demonstrators storm the Legislative Council, destroying pictures, daubing graffiti on the walls and flying the old flag of Hong Kong emblazoned with the British Union flag. The protests coincide with the 22nd anniversary of the handover of Hong Kong from the UK back to China.Armed men in white t-shirts thought to be supporting the Chinese government attack passengers and passers-by in Yuen Long metro station, while nearby police take no action.44 protestors are charged with rioting, which further antagonises the anti-extradition bill movement.By now the protest movement has coalesced around five key demands: complete withdrawal of the proposed extradition bill, withdrawal of the use of the word \u0027riot\u0027 in relation to the protests, unconditional release of arrested protesters and charges against them dropped, an independent inquiry into police behaviour and the implementation of genuine universal suffrage.The mass protests enter their fifteenth week, with police resorting to tear gas and water cannon against the demonstrators, and a wave of \u0027doxxing\u0027 using digital techniques to unmask police and protestors as a new front in the battle.Police are reported to have shot a protestor with live ammunition for the first time, as demonstrations continue on the day marking the 70th anniversary of the declaration of the People\u0027s Republic of China.The government’s legal position has changed enormously, however, since the powers were last used in 1967, to quell riots linked to the Cultural Revolution.Hong Kong today has its own mini-constitution, the Basic Law, which protects human rights and which some experts believe trumps even the emergency regulations.“In my view it is incorrect to view the ordinance as a blanket power for the government,” said Stuart Hargreaves, an associate professor in the law faculty at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. “There is nothing in it that overrides the requirement that all other laws comply with the Basic Law.”Because an anti-mask law would affect freedom of assembly guaranteed under the Basic Law, if someone challenged it a court could ask the government for a legal defence of its position, he said.“This does not mean the government cannot introduce an anti-mask law it means that the emergency regulations ordinance is not a trump card over constitutional rights.” Hong Kong courts had been receptive to limits on freedom of expression in the past but any ban would need to be tested, he added.The ban aims to strike at morale and protester numbers by persuading people to stay away from gatherings for fear they will be identified. Face coverings have become a common uniform for those scared of arrest now or longer-term retaliation from Hong Kong or Chinese authorities.But it is unclear how it would work in practice. Crowds have turned out in their thousands for demonstrations denied police permits – even though they are technically illegal.It is also unclear whether the ban would only apply at protests or be applied more widely. Wearing face masks for health reasons is common in Hong Kong.Activists said they expected mass displays of civil disobedience, and if large numbers still marched with face masks police would not have the capacity to arrest them all or space to hold them. However, officers might try to make an example of some iniduals as a deterrent.The fact that most police are masked – and would likely be exempt from any ban – is likely to add to frustrations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1c2204dd6df26a106b43ab91b19a523aba91f3a/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6b000852294a3a46ba57b2e4b628ed0","title":"ok sign gesture emoji rightwing alt right","story":"The media has been manipulated by extremists but focusing on the victims offers journalists a way to redress the balanceAnother day, another seemingly harmless symbol you can’t use without appearing to be a purveyor of hate.The alt-right’s latest trophy is the OK hand sign, which was officially recognised as a hate symbol by the Anti-Defamation League over the weekend. And on Tuesday, it was reported that a Universal Orlando Resort employee was fired after concerned parents found a photo of him making the hand sign on their six-year-old’s shoulder (their child is biracial and has autism).The OK sign joins a number of surprising symbols co-opted by the alt-right, such as the milk emoji, Pepe the frog and even, at one point, Taylor Swift.She explains how these media manipulators see an opportunity – for example, when something goes viral or becomes popular – and choose it as a moment to insert themselves into the conversation. In the case of the Facebook “Trash Doves” sticker, for example, 4chan users noticed the cartoon go viral and sent out the rallying cry: “Let’s make this normie meme a Nazi symbol!”With this process, they flex their muscles, showing that what the Lord giveth, the alt-right can take away. And it’s done through elaborate means, too: with Trash Doves, 4chan-users began to photoshop swastikas on to the viral Facebook cartoon. Sometimes they’re even more sophisticated, creating fake content cards like that of the ADL’s. They circulate the content online through social media, leaving it out as bait for undiscerning journalists who perpetuate the hoax by writing about it as if it is an authentic hate-threat.“This is their trick: they are hoping journalists will uncritically look at the OK symbol, find these infographics that claim it stands for white power and then write about it. The trolls have a laugh when the journalists are fooled,” says Donovan.“These become symbols of hate pretty much exclusively because of journalistic coverage,” says Wendy Phillips, who wrote This is Why We Can’t Have Nice things: Mapping the Relationship between Online Trolling and Mainstream Culture.Ultimately, this a game about power: if rightwing trolls can make the so-called liberal media look gullible, then it has a delegitimising effect, supporting the idea that journalists are oversensitive, easily triggered snowflakes. Soon enough, the news begins to feels like it belongs to a parody website rather than real life.“What memes do is they create in-groups and out-groups. The in-groups know it’s satirical, the out-groups think it’s something to fear,” says Donovan. ﻿Part of the effect is to make you think that white supremacists could be everywhere, hiding in plain sight. If someone as important as the president could be one of them – Trump likes to flash the gesture when he speaks – who else is? Heck, maybe you’re a white supremacist, because the last time you sent an OK emoji you were unwittingly signalling your belief in the superiority of the white race.At some point, life begins to imitate their art, and what began as a media hoax takes on dangerously radical connotations. This point came when the Australian man charged with killing 51 people at mosques in New Zealand, made the OK gesture during a courtroom appearance after being arrested.Phillips says even if stories written about these memes are incredulous or mocking, they might help the cause, since media attention is what those groups are after.“Many of us tend to be very fascinated in the bad guys themselves which is understandable but they are the smallest part of the story,” she says.So what does this mean for journalists? Phillips argues that media organisations can’t ever truly separate themselves from the amplification of white nationalists if they have to report on them.Instead, she advocates for the media to shift the camera away from the white supremacists and focus on its real victims. That means looking at its impact on minority communities in places like Texas, and on the people who live in the small towns that neo-Nazis turn up in. It means highlighting the toxic resentment of women that the patriarchal ideology of white nationalism results in, and what it feels like for a mother to have white supremacists take her daughter away.Ultimately, it means reporting the news but in a different way, says Phillips: “I don’t think the media shouldn’t tell the truth, you should just tell a bigger truth: about the impact of these behaviours, instead of just reporting on the genesis of them.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Budget initiative will target \u0026lsquovulnerable but viable\u0026rsquo firms to support in no-deal scenarioRedevelopment to be \u0026lsquoabandoned\u0026rsquo unless councillors sanction \u0026euro7m deal with BartraConcerns have also been raised about the number of health and safety incidents on the siteColin Farrell and Glenda Gilson among plaintiffs in action on Celtic Tiger-era defectsNo role for officers \u0026lsquochecking documents, goods, the back of white vans and so on\u0026rsquoBrace of \u0026euro1 stamps features the Black Rose album cover and a portrait of Phil LynottFamilies of people killed in 1974 IRA attacks say they have \u0026lsquomore questions than answers\u0026rsquoFormer taoiseach says Ireland \u0026lsquohas a lot on its side\u0026rsquo in rare public commentsOnline regulator \u0026lsquowith teeth\u0026rsquo needed, committee discussing online harassment toldTourism bodies suspended promotion after report found 6,000 dogs culled annuallyWomen told judge that all they wanted was to to be housed somewhere suitableWilde wrote Ballad of Reading Gaol after being imprisoned for gross indecencyAnti-abortion groups lament \u0026lsquosad day\u0026rsquo and urge politicians restore Stormont bodiesSocial welfare rise and increase in stamp duty for overseas property also advocatedBacteria found in newborn babies\u0026rsquo gut can alleviate aspirin-induced ulcers \u0026ndash Cork studyTeenagers need parents to steer them in the right direction, says health expertJohnson\u0026rsquos proposals create \u0026lsquomajor obstacles\u0026rsquo to deal, says TaoiseachA third of men who have sex with men reported being stared at or intimidated in past year"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4039507.1570132320!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"celebrities drawn into legal action over dublin luxury apartments","story":"A number of celebrities, including actors and nightclub owners, have been drawn into a legal case against firms involved in the construction of a boom-time Dublin apartment block.The case, which was lodged against firms involved in the construction and design of the Spencer Dock Apartments in Dublin’s docklands, has been taken in the name of the owners of many of the apartments.Spencer Dock has been affected by building defects, including water ingress around window frames, while issues regarding balconies, leaks and fire alarms at the development have also been reported.The owners, who purchased the apartments for peak prices at the top of the boom, include actor Colin Farrell, who is understood to own six apartments in the development, and television presenter Glenda Gilson.Robbie Fox, the former owner of Renards Night Club, a Celtic Tiger fixture, is also listed as a plaintiff, as is his wife, Martina.Prominent figures in the Celtic Tiger property scene, many of whom were involved with developer Treasury Holdings, are also named as plaintiffs, including John Bruder and Mark Pollard. Also listed are members of developer Johnny Ronan’s family, including his brother Conor and Conor’s wife, Claire. Mr Ronan was a director of Treasury Holdings.Spencer Dock was constructed as a landmark development, with some apartments boasting their own pools. When the apartment scheme was launched in 2002, people queued in the rain on the first day viewings were available.Up to €150 million was spent acquiring units in the development in the days after they came to market, it was reported at the time. Even in recent years, duplex apartments at the scheme sold for €900,000-€1.45 million.Pyrite actionsWell-placed sources said the action, while taken in the name of the property owners, had been initiated by the firm that provided insurance warranties to those purchasing units. The company, Premier Guarantee, has previously taken out similar actions in Ireland on behalf of homeowners who have experienced difficulties with pyrite.The defendants include a subsidiary company of construction giant Sisk, which was responsible for the overall project, as well as a dozen other engineering and design firms.Among the firms listed as defendants is architect firm Scott Tallon Walker, which designed the scheme. The firm’s managing director is also listed as a plaintiff, but sources suggested this was probably due to him being an apartment owner at the scheme.A property fund linked to Davy stockbrokers is also listed as a plaintiff.Three directors of the owner’s management company, a corporate entity composed of apartment owners in a block and responsible for maintenance and upkeep, are also listed.When contacted on Thursday, several parties listed as plaintiffs said they had no knowledge of the legal action. Sources with knowledge of the matter said this was because the insurer was taking the action in their names rather than the owners taking the action themselves.No commentA spokesman for Sisk had no comment when contacted. The management agent for the apartment development did not return a request for comment, while efforts to contact Scott Tallon Walker were unsuccessful.While apartments in the scheme are still in demand, and can rent for upwards of €4,500 a month, it has been affected by a series of alleged building defects. Most recently, an agent acting on behalf of receivers now responsible for some apartments in the development wrote to tenants in relation to “potential defects in the window frames of the apartments”.It is understood that water ingress has been detected around the frames of the windows.Sources said the action was probably being taken to aid Premier Guarantee in recouping any charges it had already been hit with, or may be hit with in the future.

Photograph:  Armend NimaniAFPKosovo is preparing to vote in an unpredictable parliamentary election that could see a former rebel commander replaced as the head of government by the country’s first female prime minister.Ramush Haradinaj resigned as premier in July to answer questions about his record during Kosovo’s 1998-1999 war, triggering early elections on Sunday that may put US-educated law professor Vjosa Osmani in pole position to take power.Coalition talks are likely to follow a hard-fought election in which debate over reform and corruption has raged amid speculation over the possible terms of an elusive deal to normalise relations between Kosovo and its former ruler, Serbia.“Going in front of investigators in another jurisdiction would have damaged our sovereignty and created a wrong precedent for our young nation, so I had to resign,” says Haradinaj, who was interviewed at the so-called Kosovo Specialist Chambers in The Hague despite twice before being acquitted of war crimes charges.“These are difficult elections and it won’t be easy to win,” he told The  in government headquarters in Pristina.“I am still in the battle, but I don’t know what will happen.”Anger over corruption, poverty, unemployment and ailing public services has tarnished his government, and its fractious relations with president Hashim Thaci – another former guerrilla commander – has strengthened a sense that it may be time to look beyond war veterans for the reform that Kosovo needs.“We will remove from power those who have strangled Kosovo,” Osmani declared on the campaign trail.“My political opponents are afraid of the big change we will bring,” the AFP news agency quoted her as saying.Peaceful resistanceOsmani (37) has helped re-energise the Democratic League for Kosovo (LDK), which was founded by “father of the nation” Ibrahim Rugova and advocated peaceful resistance to Belgrade through the 1990s collapse of Yugoslavia, before the outbreak of fighting in Kosovo that killed about 13,000 people and displaced more than one million.After studying in Pristina and Pittsburgh, Osmani served as chief of staff to Kosovo’s president Fatmir Sejdiu a decade ago, worked on the country’s successful bid to have the UN’s top court recognise the legality of its 2008 independence declaration, and chaired the foreign affairs committee in the last parliament.“The LDK seems to have got new momentum from making her its lead candidate and it seems to have created new momentum in the electorate too,” he adds.“This is the first time a big political party in Kosovo has nominated a woman to be prime minister and I think this is a huge change in our political and even social mentality . . . Patriarchalism is fading in Kosovo.”The LDK is affiliated with the European People’s Party, to which Fine Gael belongs, and Cork TD Dara Murphy spoke alongside Osmani at her first campaign rally in Pristina.“She would be a formidable prime minister,” he told The .“She’s very focused on better relations with the EU and in the neighbourhood and that’s exactly what Kosovo needs . . . to represent itself on the European and global stage in a different way. She will present that as someone new, young and fresh, who doesn’t have the baggage that some other politicians have.”Osmani pledges to slash corruption and bureaucracy and shrink government, freeing up funds to plough into healthcare and education, while launching a stringent vetting procedure to “decriminalise” Kosovo’s judicial system.Nationalist streakPolls show the LDK vying for victory with the Vetevendosje party, which has similar reform priorities and plans to reduce the number of ministries, but also aims to strengthen the welfare state, cut utility bills and create a sovereign wealth fund to revive state enterprises.Founded in 2005, Vetevendosje (“Self-determination”) is a leftist movement with a nationalist streak that has been a fierce critic of successive governments and what it sees as foreign interference in Kosovo, leading big street protests and repeatedly setting off tear gas in parliament to block major Bills that it opposed.Vetevendosje took 27.5 per cent of votes in the 2017 parliamentary election, but despite being the biggest single party it failed to form a government, as Haradinaj’s broad coalition secured a slim majority with the support of deputies from Kosovo’s ethnic minorities, including the Belgrade-backed Serb List party.After Vetevendosje split last year, there are now signs that its leader, Albin Kurti, may be softening his firebrand image and showing newfound flexibility in a bid to take power at long last and beat Osmani to the post of premier.“I think Albin has learned the lessons of recent years – especially since Vetevendosje won the mayoral elections in Pristina (in 2013 and 2017) – that he cannot govern without partners and compromise is part of political life in Kosovo,” says Peci. “I think he has changed . . . and is very much a possible prime minister.”Compromise dealKosovo’s next leader will be under considerable pressure from its western allies to reach a compromise deal with Serbia to normalise their relations and open up the prospect of eventual EU membership for both states.All the top candidates for prime minister reject any suggestion of handing over territory to Belgrade in return for its recognition of Kosovo’s independence, however.Haradinaj says full recognition from Belgrade would allow Pristina to lift a 100 per cent tariff that it imposed on Serbian imports last November, in response to Vucic’s efforts to block Kosovo from international organisations.“But that’s probably all we could give,” he adds.“Why not go for good neighbourly relations, privileges in the economy and peace and reconciliation? I’m in favour of this and I think that in the end, these will be the main arguments.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4038253.1570055301!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"us to target key irish food and drink brands with 25 tariff","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe tariffs on butter will likely hit Kerrygold, which is the second-most popular butter brand in the United States. More than 34,000 tonnes of the Irish product was exported there in 2018.  File photograph: Getty Irish food and beverage products including Kerrygold and Baileys are to be hit by a new 25 per cent tariff by the United States.The Trump administration unveiled plans to tax EU imports following a WTO ruling on Wednesday.In a blow to Irish and European food exporters, the Office of the US Trade Representative announced it would impose tariffs of 25 per cent on a range of food products including butter, cheese, pork and several drink products, including liqueurs such as Baileys.However, while whiskey from Scotland and Northern Ireland – including Bushmills – will be hit, it appears that Irish whiskey has been exempted from the tariffs.The decision was announced hours after the United States was given the green light to impose $7.5 billion (€6.84 billion) worth of tariffs on European exports.The Geneva-based WTO issued its judgment in the long-running trade dispute, ruling that the United States could impose trade measures worth up to $7.5 billion over what it has said are unfair subsidies given to Airbus.It marks the largest ever ruling by the international trade body.Ireland’s butter and liqueur exporters will be among the businesses affected by the ruling, with the new tariffs due to come into effect on October 18th.Apparent exemptionHowever, the apparent exemption for whiskey from the Republic of Ireland will be welcomed, given that the US is Ireland’s primary export market for whiskey.The tariffs on butter will likely hit Kerrygold, which is the second-most popular butter brand in the United States. More than 34,000 tonnes of the Irish product was exported there in 2018.An analysis by Ibec earlier this year found that Irish goods would be the most exposed, on a per capita basis, to the proposed US tariffs on EU goods, noting that €818 million worth of products would be hit. “Given that the food and drink sector makes up two-thirds of the exports of indigenous firms, there is potential here for significant knock-on impacts on the domestic economy,” the association writes in its most recent economic outlook.‘Big win’Speaking at a press conference in the White House on Wednesday, President Donald Trump said that the WTO ruling was a “big win for the United States”.“The WTO has been much better to us since I’ve been president because they understand they can’t get away with what they’ve been getting away with for so many years, which is ripping off the United States,” he said of the decades-long dispute.The WTO is due to rule on a parallel case brought by the EU against US support for Boeing early next year. The EU has warned that it will be forced to retaliate over the new tariffs.Incoming EU trade commissioner Phil Hogan said during his confirmation hearing in Brussels this week that Europe “has to stand up for itself” and should identify American products that could be hit in retaliatory action if the US imposed the sanctions.Read more about the Donald Trump administration"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons october 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Facebook\u0026#39s Zuckerberg defends decision on encryptionBillions at risk as Britain moves away from fuel-burning carsMetal detectorists accused of stealing £3m haul of Anglo Saxon coins and jewellery after finding it in fieldBreast cancer deaths fall by almost half since the 1980s, report shows Killers of hospital worker Melanie Hall may have left DNA on rope used to conceal her body, police revealHome Secretary tells Mark Zuckerberg he is creating a \u0026#39digital blindspot\u0026#39 for paedophiles and terroristsScrap fuel duty and introduce \u0026#39road pricing\u0026#39 to herald rise of electric cars, say fiscal expertsExoskeleton driven by AI helps paralysed man to walk againScotch whisky targeted by Donald Trump\u0026#39s punitive tariffsObsession to please Tom Watson led police to \u0026#39overlook liar\u0026#39 Carl BeechComment: If the EU rejects Boris’s offer, it’s full steam ahead for a no-deal Brexit Lawyer to child sex abuse inquiry says he warned Scotland Yard not to believe Nick but they ignored himAn extra half glass of fruit juice a day could sharply increase diabetes riskDonald Trump pressures UK to \u0026#39investigate the investigators\u0026#39 over origins of Mueller inquiryLeo Varadkar accused of attempting to derail Brexit deal by claiming Britain wants to stay in the EUComment: The government should hold its ground on state pension equalityJeremy Corbyn urged to intervene after Labour members table confidence vote in Jewish MP on eve of Yom KippurComment: \u0026#39Johnsonism\u0026#39 amounts to shrewd politics – terrible economics\tRussian man sues Apple for \u0026#39making him gay\u0026#39Lily-Rose Depp suffers wardrobe malfunction at London film premiereWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/02/12/bitcoin-mining-russia.jpg","title":"bitcoin mining russia nuclear scientists cryptocurrency","story":"Subscribe nowSubscribe NowSubscribe NowSubscribe NowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Try Independent Premium free for 1 monthSee the optionsSarov facility is home to one of Russia\u0027s most powerful computersA nuclear scientist\u0026nbsphas been fined 450,000 rubles (£6,000)\u0026nbspfor illegally mining bitcoin at a top secret facility in Russia, according to local reports.Denis Baykov was one of three scientists at a nuclear laboratory in Sarov – a closed Russian town 400 kilometres from Moscow – who were arrested after they allegedly used an ultra-powerful supercomputer to mine the cryptocurrency.The two other employees are currently awaiting sentencing,\u0026nbspThe Moscow Times\u0026nbspreported, citing the state-run RIA Novosti news agency.Bitcoin mining requires vast amounts of computer processing power in order to solve the complex mathematical problems that are needed to generate new units of the cryptocurrency.The supercomputer used by the scientists has one petaflop of processing power, meaning it is\u0026nbspcapable of conducting up to 1,000 trillion operations per second.Created with Sketch.Bitcoin\u0027s volatile history in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Satoshi Nakamoto creates the first bitcoin block in 2009On 3 January, 2009, the genesis block of bitcoin appeared.

This is the first below-50 reading since March when Britain was last facing a no-deal crash-out from the EU.Analysts said this\u0026nbspheadline measure may be too downbeat, partly because the services PMI does not include the retail and public sectors\u0026nbspwhere activity has held up well recently.\u0026nbspNonetheless, the latest survey, together with polls on UK manufacturing and construction released earlier, is “probably giving us a reasonable steer on the underlying strength of economic activity”, said Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics.\u0026nbspAlthough she still thinks GDP grew slightly in the July-September quarter, the risks to that forecast “appear to be firmly to the downside”, Ms Gregory added.Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson and Brexit merchandise for sale at the Tory conference Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A Boris Johnson doll for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberMugs with Boris Johnson\u0027s portrait for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA Boris Johnson themed T-shirt for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson and other Conservative themed cards for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson posters for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberCopies of The Conservative newspaper are ready to be distributed during the Conservative Party conference on 30 SeptemberGET BREXIT DONE mugs alongside other Conservative merchandise at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberAssorted Conservative merchandise for sale at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBooks about Jacob Rees-Mogg and Jeremy Corbyn for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA variety of books for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA Boris Johnson doll for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberMugs with Boris Johnson\u0027s portrait for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA Boris Johnson themed T-shirt for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson and other Conservative themed cards for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson posters for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberCopies of The Conservative newspaper are ready to be distributed during the Conservative Party conference on 30 SeptemberGET BREXIT DONE mugs alongside other Conservative merchandise at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberAssorted Conservative merchandise for sale at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBooks about Jacob Rees-Mogg and Jeremy Corbyn for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA variety of books for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberThe September PMIs for the much smaller manufacturing and construction sectors came in at 48.3 and 43.3 respectively, signalling a\u0026nbspdeeper contraction than in services.\u0026nbspSumming up the results of the three PMIs, Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS​ Markit, which compiles the surveys, said:\u0026nbsp“Brexit-related concerns dominated the September survey responses, linked by companies to falling sales, cancelled and postponed projects, a lack of investment and job losses.”Employment in manufacturing and construction also fell over the month. The reduction in construction was the steepest since December 2010.The labour market has been resilient this year, with the employment rate hovering around a record high. However, a\u0026nbspnumber of economists, including at the Bank of England,\u0026nbsphave suggested that companies have preferred to hire rather than to invest because of the persistent uncertainty over Brexit. The argument goes that firms can let workers go if their sales drop, whereas investment in machinery is a more permanent expense.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There’s a lot of mordant chat about the weather, illustrated with shots of dark grey clouds above even darker grey lochs.” 337 The Paras: Men of War (ITV)“From the outset the production is elevated by its sensitive handling of the men – and the Paratroopers remain exclusively male – involved. These kinds of programmes have a tendency to fetishise toughness, lingering on assault courses and weaponry.”“Despite what some feared, the casting of Cumberbatch doesn’t simply flatter Cummings – the A-lister is too good a chameleon for that. But, inevitably, as he scrawls out his campaigning brainwaves on a whiteboard, there is a touch of that deductive maverick Sherlock in his portrayal of this scruffy, balding political saboteur.” 537 A Year of British Murder (Channel 4)“The programme-makers must have done much to win the confidence of so many friends and families, as they went through unspeakable personal pain but they repay that confidence with an understated and powerful film.” 637 The Secret Life of the Zoo (Channel 4)“This documentary goes behind the shrubbery to show off these animals and their s. The humans are a pretty exotic bunch too, judging by some of the lines they come out with.”“You see, saint or sinner, prince or pauper, we are all part of one race, the brotherhood of man. And the saintly and regal Danny Dyer stands as its finest ambassador.” “West believes Valjean to be “the greatest hero in all literature”, and he plays the part with all the care and intricacy such a character deserves.” 937 Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil (BBC2)“For anyone who’s not altogether sure how British politics turned so suddenly into a rolling dumpster fire from which all exits are blocked then Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil is a necessary public service to explain exactly, and exactly how needlessly, we all came to be here.”“There’s really been nothing quite like Catastrophe on our screens before, and it deserves its cult status for the quality of everything the production team do, not least the stunning cinematography in this finale. Thanks, all. I’m glad Catastrophe died happy. “Yet again the Williams have woven a brilliantly tangled web, helped in no small part by Karyo’s quietly arresting central turn” “It is both a revisionist – and frequently batty – take on the caped milieu and a winningly knotty mystery. And it surely is the first big-budget superhero tale more indebted to Wes Anderson than to Stan Lee.” “Like all the best detective dramas, Shetland engages the audience in the very process of detection. That way we grow intrigued, and we care. And so we find ourselves sitting next to Henshall in his (prominently featured) Volvo V70 estate, sharing his thoughts, intercepting suspects and being driven off the road by unidentified enemies.” 1437 This Time with Alan Partridge* (BBC1)This Time with Alan Partridge is such a consistently strong creative achievement that fears for the future of Alan Gordon Partridge, may, once again, be allayed. Or Alayned, perhaps.” Michael Jackson has long looked like a burning tire yard. There were the allegations, the out-of-court settlements, the arrest, the trial and not-guilty verdict. But there has been nothing like Leaving Neverland” Home is a rather gentle, unobtrusive variation on the sitcom theme – but one that is built on a quite a bizarre premise. The twist is that a family who returns to Surrey from a holiday touring around France discover a Syrian refugee stuffed in the back of their SUV. Not only that, but, after a few moments of blind terrified panic about a suicide bombing, they eventually adopt him like he’s stray cat that’s just wandered in.1737 The Murder of Jill Dando (BBC)A tremendously sad, strange story then, and just as unfathomable today. Dando’s friends, family and the producer and director of the film have made a fitting and balanced tribute to her, something she deserves. I can’t really add anything to that.It is sometimes remarked that the Troubles in Northern Ireland make for an unpromising backdrop for a sitcom about adolescent kids. Well, yer man’s wrong, as they might say. Derry Girls, returning for a triumphant and exuberant second run, proves that humour, dark or otherwise, can be quarried from even the most unlikely of locations.While there are plenty of well-turned one-liners, the deeper attraction of Fleabag is schadenfreude. The character is as old as Daisy Buchanan or Lydia Bennett or Scarlett O’Hara. The best compliment to Waller-Bridge and her cast is that they find fresh clothes in which to dress these ancient monsters.2037 Road to Brexit (BBC)The Road to Brexit is easily the best thing to emerge from the whole brexit imbroglio. OK, not much competition, but still... Despite the po-faced title, you realise very quickly that it’s not yet another drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch or yet another attempt by Laura Kuenssberg to explain the inexplicable, or yet another show with the public arguing about stuff they don’t understand. Rather, it’s a very clever, very funny, very \u0027different\u0027 parcel of bollocks to Brexit.The footage is glorious, especially the side-on tracking shots of the birds and the hunting, where it is as if the cameramen were able to set up a rail along the ocean. Most spectacular of all is the sequence of a glacier collapsing into the ocean, where 75m tons of ice being sloughed off in less than 20-minutes. But at times Our Planet feels a little unfocused. Attenborough’s last big BBC series, Dynasties, won almost unbearable amount of emotional resonance through its focus on animal families. Our Planet is more of a greatest-hits parade, with overblown orchestral soundtrack and ponderous intonation. You can’t buy love, even if you pay for David Attenborough.2237 Line of Duty (BBC)Plausibility is a spectrum Bodyguard became ridiculous but Line of Duty stays just the right side, and as usual there is more plot in an hour than in whole series of other programmes. As well as being gripping entertainment, Line of Duty has become an effective examination of the relationship between the state and the inidual. The shadowy government forces are elected the organised crime gangs are fuelled by the drug trade. The police are there to save us from ourselves but can only do it if they are subjected to constant scrutiny. It’s exhausting work, policing the police.Joseph is almost never out of shot, whether seen from afar, contemplating a bottle of strong cider in a playground, or in visceral close-up, clutching his doner to his face. There are few actors you could trust with so much screen time, especially with such a pared back and naturalistic script. The fact any of it is remotely watchable is testament to Stephen Graham’s abilities. No man working in Britain today can drink a pint with more pathos.\u0027Good Omens is a hugely enjoyable, imaginative premiere, as close to Pratchett’s vision as anyone could have dared dream. And while the melancholy tone may not be for everyone, fans of the book will surely be sated.\u00272537 Years and YearsYears and Years, then, is favoured by some wit, a cornucopia of fab talent and promising characters. The dominant one as we continue our quest into the 2030s and beyond, will be Vivienne, or Viv, Rook, played brilliantly by Emma Thompson. As a bit of a long-term Emma-sceptic I was actually startled by how good she is in the role of the epitome of everything she has spent her life hating and campaigning against, for Viv is a horrifically nasty businessperson turned populist politician with the most terrifying of views. Viv Rook makes Ann Widdecombe look like, well, Emma Thompson at an Extinction Rebellion sit-in.As the series develops, it’s clearer than ever that Eve and Villanelle are more similar than they are different. Villanelle’s new vulnerability invites us to question what it is exactly she wants from Polastri. First time around she was toying with a more worthy adversary, but why now? Polastri, by contrast, is frayed around the edges, a terrible wife to her husband Nico (Owen McDonnell) and an even worse intelligence agent to her boss Carolyn Martens (Fiona Shaw). The script is still tight and the jokes are still there, as are Villanelle’s accents, outfits and abrupt killings, but without the will-theywon’t-they energy of the initial plot, it is harder to care.Timely, bleak, intelligent and compelling, Chernobyl is a triumph of a disaster.Season three\u0027s knuckle-whitening finale is far less disappointing than the last.The writing is sharp and well observed, probing the fault lines between small talk and real problems.A touching tribute to a flawed reality TV star.Despite the strength of its ensemble cast, Succession is a feat of writing above all. Although it is ostensibly a business show, you won’t learn much about the minutiae of media deals by watching it. Its key dynamic, between father and children, means that it is limited in the amount that can actually happen without risking the magic. The writers, led by the creator Jesse Armstrong, who also gave us Peep Show, weave just-about-plausible and sympathetic characters from a web of insults and backstabbing, and tight editing and camerawork ratchets up tension from a slow-moving plot.In Kathy Burke’s All Women on Channel 4, the unapologetic, effing-and-blinding, salt-of-the-earth actor meets lots of different women – from nuns to reality stars – to understand what it means to be a member of the fairer sex, so to speak, in 2019.So here we have an intriguing, but rather flawed sort of Big Brother thriller set in our contemporary world of digital snooping, near constant surveillance and (a topical touch) widespread use of facial recognition technology.Top Boy can be bleak and violent, with dialogue so naturalistic that it verges on the impenetrable, but in telling stories that rarely get heard, it asks us to think differently about the city we live in.Criminal uses its small canvas to ask big questions. The focus on these intricate dances means that after a while we begin to question the idea of objective truth, as well as the facts at hand. I have no idea if it is a realistic depiction of detective work, but it makes for gripping drama.3637 Tories at WarAfter an hour of Tories at War (Channel 4), I felt I had to get out into the fresh air and go for a walk. The foul language the visceral hatred the unbearable tensions the violence being inflicted on ancient institutions and this poor old knackered country by the Tories, as if with chainsaws and zombie knives – it was like watching my first Saw movie.3737 World on FireIn a TV world where too often we are encouraged to see the Nazis as warm and cuddly real people with emotions, it’s refreshing that they are here relegated back to pure baddies, strafing cafes, shooting surrendering fathers and generally being Nazi-ish about things.“As a slightly cheesy reminder of what we love about Doctor Who – i.e. the fact it gives us an intergalactic eccentric in a big flappy overcoat shouting at Daleks  – this is a New Year treat that more than delivers” 237 Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland (BBC2)“Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland is a meandering look back over his life, career, and national identity – a “Proustian wander through Scotland”.

There were other factors, political factors.”Eccleston said the way his departure from the show was portrayed in the media caused him to temporarily lose confidence as an actor and to get blacklisted from shows.His confidence, he said, came back when he played John Lennon in\u0026nbspLennon Naked, the 2010 BBC Four biopic dedicated to the musician.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It appears to have been doing so as far as back as 10 billion years ago, when it was just forming, and those faint traces of smaller galaxies can still be seen to this day.Astronomers hope that the research can shed light on how our own galaxy will eventually be swallowed, and how it will come to its end. But it also opens up new mysteries about why and how Andromeda is destroying the galaxies that surround it.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberThe eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberThe Milky Way is on a collision course with Andromeda in about four billion years. So knowing what kind of a monster our galaxy is up against is useful in finding out the Milky Way\u0027s ultimate fate, said Dr\u0026nbspMackey\u0026nbspfrom the\u0026nbspAustralian National University\u0027s\u0026nbspResearch School of Astronomy and Astrophysics.Andromeda has a much bigger and more complex stellar halo than the Milky Way, which indicates that it has cannibalised many more galaxies, possibly larger ones.Huge ‘structures’ found floating in spaceTo piece together that ancient story, which is published in the journal\u0026nbspNature, researchers looked at dense clumps of stars that are known as\u0026nbspglobular clusters. Those show the signs of the ancient feasts, during which Andromeda would swallow its closer neighbours.That allowed them to see the fossils of long-dead galaxies, using them to understand the galaxies as they were when they lived, in the same way that fossils on Earth could shed light on ancient lives and deaths.By tracing the faint remains of these smaller galaxies with embedded star clusters, we\u0027ve been able to recreate the way Andromeda drew them in and ultimately enveloped them at the different times, Dr\u0026nbspMackey\u0026nbspsaid.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhile the study helps answer important questions about the fate of our galaxy, it also opens up new questions and mysteries. Scientists say that Andromeda\u0027s two rounds of feeding came from entirely different directions.This is very weird and suggests that the extragalactic meals are fed from what\u0027s known as the \u0027cosmic web\u0027 of matter that threads the universe, said Professor Lewis from the Sydney Institute for Astronomy and University of Sydney School of Physics, who co-led the study with Dr Mackey.More surprising is the discovery that the direction of the ancient feeding is the same as the bizarre \u0027plane of satellites\u0027, an unexpected alignment of dwarf galaxies orbiting Andromeda.Those planes can be torn up by Andromeda\u0027s own gravity within the space of a few billion years, according to previous research by the same scientists.This deepens the mystery as the plane must be young, but it appears to be aligned with ancient feeding of dwarf galaxies. Maybe this is because of the cosmic web, but really, this is only speculation, Professor Lewis said.We\u0027re going to have to think quite hard to unravel what this is telling us.Astronomers also hope that the discovery could help us to learn more about our own galaxy, and how it will continue to evolve.One of our main motivations in studying astronomy is to understand our place in the Universe. A way of learning about our galaxy is to study others that are similar to it, and try to understand how these systems formed and evolved.\u0026nbspSometimes this can actually be easier than looking at the Milky Way, because we live inside it and that can make certain types of observations quite difficult.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The black ink sac and light organ in the centre of the squid’s mantle cavity can be clearly seen.Where they cross, galaxies form and are fed by streams of cooling gas.Lead author Dr Hideki Umehata, of the RIKEN Cluster for Pioneering Research and the University of Tokyo, said: “The presence of such intense radiation suggests very strongly that gas falling along the filaments under the force of gravity triggers the formation of many starbursting galaxies and supermassive black holes, ultimately giving the universe the structure that we see today.“Previous observations have shown similar emission from blobs of gas extending beyond galaxies, but now we have been able to clearly show that these filaments stretch to much larger distances, going even beyond the edge of the field that we viewed.Galaxy next to us is ‘violent’ and coming to eat the Milky Way“This adds credence to the idea that these filaments are actually powering the intense activity that we see in galaxies within large structures assembling in the early universe.”Using the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer on the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope, Dr Umehata and colleagues detected and mapped the light emitted by hydrogen irradiated by the galaxies within a distant proto-cluster.The results show the gas is arranged into long filaments, providing fuel for intense formation of stars and for the growth of supermassive black holes.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But by late afternoon, they were down as much as 38.9 per cent.Sales also fell 0.7 per cent and bosses warned that the company will continue to struggle in the second half of the year if market conditions do not improve, pointing out that the warm weather in September is already having a negative impact.The fashion brand also suffered from the troubles of Debenhams and House of Fraser in the UK and Nordstrom and Bloomingdale’s in the US – department stores where Ted Baker had a significant presence.It took a hit of £600,000 from the collapse of House of Fraser alone.Created with Sketch.Best high street fashion buys in October 2019 Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Chairman David Bernstein said: “Trading conditions have been characterised by unprecedented and sustained levels of promotional activity across the sector with, in several cases, distressed discounting from brands and retailers and heightened competition.“The group’s performance has been impacted by very difficult trading conditions throughout the period, amplified by heightened levels of consumer uncertainty across many of Ted Baker’s global markets.“The financial results we delivered in the first half were behind our expectations. Trading in the second half has started slowly, not helped by the unseasonably warm weather in September, and this will have an impact on the full-year outcome.

The international evidence tells us that it can have serious impacts on children, and that it is not effective.”Mr Finnie earlier addressed critics of the Bill, who suggested it could criminalise parents.France passes law banning parents from smacking childrenBans on smacking children ‘linked to lower violence among teens’Smacking children should be banned, psychologists saySmacking children makes them ‘more aggressive and antisocial’He said: “There is no evidence that a change to the law results in increased prosecutions in any of the more than 50 countries where some of the reforms have taken place.“In fact, this change in the law in Ireland prompted more parents to contact services to ask for help and support with alternative disciplining techniques.”Children’s campaigners hailed the passage of the bill as “a momentous day for children’s rights”.Joanna Barrett, of NSPCC Scotland, said: “It’s a common sense move that closes an archaic loophole and ensures that, finally, children in Scotland will have the same protection from assault as adults.”Mary Glasgow, chief executive of the charity Children 1st, said: “Again and again people have told us about the life-long impact of being hit as a child, as they’ve joined the campaign to change the law.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is the first below-50 reading since March when Britain was last facing a no-deal crash-out from the EU.Analysts said this\u0026nbspheadline measure may be too downbeat, partly because the services PMI does not include the retail and public sectors\u0026nbspwhere activity has held up well recently.\u0026nbspNonetheless, the latest survey, together with polls on UK manufacturing and construction released earlier, is “probably giving us a reasonable steer on the underlying strength of economic activity”, said Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics.\u0026nbspAlthough she still thinks GDP grew slightly in the July-September quarter, the risks to that forecast “appear to be firmly to the downside”, Ms Gregory added.Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson and Brexit merchandise for sale at the Tory conference Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A Boris Johnson doll for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberMugs with Boris Johnson\u0027s portrait for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA Boris Johnson themed T-shirt for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson and other Conservative themed cards for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson posters for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberCopies of The Conservative newspaper are ready to be distributed during the Conservative Party conference on 30 SeptemberGET BREXIT DONE mugs alongside other Conservative merchandise at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberAssorted Conservative merchandise for sale at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBooks about Jacob Rees-Mogg and Jeremy Corbyn for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA variety of books for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA Boris Johnson doll for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberMugs with Boris Johnson\u0027s portrait for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA Boris Johnson themed T-shirt for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson and other Conservative themed cards for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson posters for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberCopies of The Conservative newspaper are ready to be distributed during the Conservative Party conference on 30 SeptemberGET BREXIT DONE mugs alongside other Conservative merchandise at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberAssorted Conservative merchandise for sale at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBooks about Jacob Rees-Mogg and Jeremy Corbyn for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA variety of books for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberThe September PMIs for the much smaller manufacturing and construction sectors came in at 48.3 and 43.3 respectively, signalling a\u0026nbspdeeper contraction than in services.\u0026nbspSumming up the results of the three PMIs, Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS​ Markit, which compiles the surveys, said:\u0026nbsp“Brexit-related concerns dominated the September survey responses, linked by companies to falling sales, cancelled and postponed projects, a lack of investment and job losses.”Employment in manufacturing and construction also fell over the month. The reduction in construction was the steepest since December 2010.The labour market has been resilient this year, with the employment rate hovering around a record high. However, a\u0026nbspnumber of economists, including at the Bank of England,\u0026nbsphave suggested that companies have preferred to hire rather than to invest because of the persistent uncertainty over Brexit. The argument goes that firms can let workers go if their sales drop, whereas investment in machinery is a more permanent expense.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They saw it as an issue that should be fixable.”Iran has a plan B thanks to China and Russia – and it might beat TrumpScholars also say the rising clout of Afghans inside Iran may have also prodded the Council of s to go against its ultra-conservative track record and approve the law.\u0026nbspThat thousands of Afghan migrants took up arms in the Iranian effort to bolster Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria may have boosted the image of Afghans in conservative circles that dominate the judiciary.“The state has to increasingly pay attention to them over time,” said Kevan Harris, a sociologist specialising in Iran at the University of California in Los Angeles. “And not all of these families are poor. There is a rising Afghan-headed middle class.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They are among\u0026nbsphundreds of thousands of Afghans who\u0027ve lived in Iran since the beginning of their countries wars in the 1980s without paths to naturalisation.\u0026nbspMany of them have lived in the country for up to four decades, have contributed enormously to the economy in back-breaking jobs, and have gone about quietly improving their situations through education and hard work, she said. They have also integrated well into Iranian urban neighbourhoods, share Iranian culture, speak Persian with an Iranian accent, and a large proportion are also committed\u0026nbspShi\u0027a\u0026nbspMuslims. This probably accounts for their growing voice in the country\u0027s political life.Demographic factors including an ageing workforce and declining birth rates have made Iran friendlier towards immigration.\u0026nbspMr Harris also suggested that there was rising pressure from international organisations such as the UN\u0026nbspHigh Commission on Refugees, which continues to bankroll projects in Iran for those escaping conflicts in neighbouring Iraq and Afghanistan.\u0026nbspTo pass the law, parliament had to give way on security screening for anyone obtaining citizenship, which allowed\u0026nbspthe intelligence branch of the Revolutionary Guard to vet any applicant.\u0026nbspThe new rules don’t completely equalise access to citizenship. Iranian women must still apply for nationality for their children, while it is automatic for men’s children.“The children of all citizens, whether men or women, should instead be granted citizenship on an equal basis,” the advocacy group Human Rights Watch said earlier this year.\u0026nbspDespite the caveats, those inside Iran celebrated the change as a step forward. Any law that improves the lives of\u0026nbspIranian people is a step forward, said one Tehran social scientist, who spoke on condition her name not be published. There are so many limitations in Iran that each step forward is a good one.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Around  years ago, as co-presenter of BBC’s live TV show Crimewatch Daily, I interviewed a man called Mick North.Mr North was a lecturer in biochemistry at Stirling University in Scotland and, shortly after giving birth to their daughter Sophie, his we Barbara was diagnosed with breast cancer and died just two and a half years later – leaving him with a toddler to bring up alone.On March , , he dropped Sophie – by then aged five – at school and headed off to work.The school was Dunblane Primary and she was shot dead by social misfit Thomas Hamilton who, armed with the four guns and  cartridges he owned legally, massacred  pupils and one teacher.In , after writing a book about the tragedy, Mr North came on the show to tell his heart-breaking story and to explain why, in , he had joined the Gun Control Network to campaign for tighter vetting.Sympathising with a man who had lost his daughter in such unconscionable circumstances, I simply said something along the lines of, “I’m not surprised” – a comment seized upon as “partisan” by the gun lobby, who then bombarded the BBC with complaints.The next day I was forced to apologise on air.Yes, it’s important that those presenting on the BBC are seen to be impartial when discussing politics but, be it Naga, citing her own experiences of racism or, in my case, sympathising with a man asking for tighter gun laws after his young daughter was shot dead, these are human reactions that should be judged using common sense, not boiler-plate rules.IN Debbie Harry’s compelling memoir, Face It, she writes about the time David Bowie was backstage with her and rock star Iggy Pop.She says: “David pulled out his c*ck – asI were the official c*ck checker or something.“He loved to pull it out, with both men and women.

But in the case of the traditional media, he mustn’t wield the loss of his mother as a weapon to try to shut down valid criticism that questions why, for example, he preaches about climate change one day then climbs aboard a private jet the next.Princess Diana was media savvy and close friends with several influential journalists.In his recent memoir, former Vogue publisher Nicholas Coleridge relayed the story of a lunch they shared that he had gone to great s to keep secret.But as she left, he says four photographers, “sprang forward, taking a thousand snaps”.Another example of “Diana, the hunted” perhaps Later, Coleridge rang a newspaper friend to ask how the picture desk had known and got the reply: “Diana rang herself from her car, on her way to lunch. She often tips them off about where she’ll be.”Equally, on the night of her death, she was safely ensconced in the Paris Ritz but chose, at midnight, to leave in a car being driven by a man three times over the French drink-driving limit.That is not to say the media — and, in particular, the paparazzi — didn’t sometimes step out of line, but unlike her youngest son, Diana knew not to judge all by the actions of a few.Presumably, the Sussexes hope The Mail on Sunday will cave in before it gets to court, but the paper is insisting it will defend the action “vigorously”.If so, Thomas Markle will be the star witness, and potentially Meghan herself — an event that will draw far more publicity to the Duchess’s turbulent family background than any article we have all long forgotten about.During the South Africa tour, Harry told -year-old student Peter Oki he was so overwhelmed by the world’s problems that it was sometimes hard to get out of bed in the mornings.Perhaps he should try embarking on a tour of the UK, where millions of his subjects are coping with issues without the cushion of wealth and privilege he enjoys.Hard-working people who, after the daily grind of keeping their head above water, simply don’t have time to obsess over perceived slights.Of course, there is one sure-fire route to greater privacyHarry and Meghan desire it.Give up the royal title , get a full-time job and pay for your own house renovations, like the rest of us.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

How dare you!”The teen’s fiery speech was hailed by millions, with climate change activists taking to the streets in huge protests around the world.But others were less impressed, including Donald Trump who sarcastically mocked her as a “very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future”.French President Emmanuel Macron also warned her “radical” climate change stance risks “depressing” an entire generation.And some iniduals were even more scathing, with sick trolls branding her “the little girl with mental problems”, and others suggesting she’s “not sexy enough” in vile rants.But Putin said young people who paid attention to environmental issues should be supported.However, he cautioned: “When someone is using children and teenagers in personal interests, it only deserves to be condemned.“I’m sure that Greta is a kind and very sincere girl.“But adults must do everything not to bring teenagers and children into some extreme situations.”But critics point out that despite signing up to the Paris climate agreement last month, Russia has long ignored the issue of climate change.In fact, it even stands to benefit economically as it looks to take advantage of the thawing Arctic to create a new shipping channel along its usually frozen northern coast.Putin himself has also said climate change isn’t man-made and expressed scepticism about renewable energy.He said wind turbines killed birds and disturbed worms – claims he was widely mocked for in Russia despite a law against insulting officials."},{"url":null,"title":"pictures superyachts monaco","story":"The mulit-million pound vessels radiate as they illuminate the water during the glamorous Monaco Yacht Show in Port Hercules.It is understood an estimated £.billion worth of vessels were on display during the opulent showcase.More than  yachts were showcased during the event, which has been running for almost three decades.The billionaires toys ranged from  feet to  feet in .Most yachts were moored up in the bay, but as space is limited others spend the night anchored further out to sea.A-listers such as actor Leonardo Di Caprio, former Beatle Ringo Starr, Tennis champion Novak Djokovic and F star Lewis Hamilton were said to be at the luxurious event, according to Boat International.The show is Europes largest in-water display of yacht and lasted from September  to .Earlier this year, one of the worlds largest and most futuristic superyachts had coasted into Monaco.Russian tycoon Andrey Melnichenko’s one-off £million vessel was designed by Philippe Starck and is ft long, has eight decks, a helicopter pad, a pool and masts that are ft tall.It is named Sailing Yacht A because the super wealthy industrialist likes his vessels to be listed first in shipping registers.Brothers JP Andrews and Mike Andrews, who are from Wolverhampton and specialise in aerial photography, captured the fantastic images using a drone.Mike, , said: We could see tenders shuttling back and forth from the land, which contained guests or occupants of the yachts but the majority of the people on board were inside enjoying the luxuries of their yachts.The glow in the water from the lighting was what sparked our interest.

Why  Because, for the EU, the aim was never to avoid a hard border in Ireland — something these proposals plainly achieve.The aim, rather, was to keep Britain in a subordinate position, still subject to EU law and trade policy.Brussels was reluctant to spell this out in so many words — at least publicly.A fly-on-the-wall documentary caught the staff of the European Parliament’s Brexit negotiator, Guy Verhofstadt, cheering when Theresa May’s Cabinet accepted the backstop.“It took us two years,” said one, joyfully, “but we finally turned them into a colony”. Obviously, though, EU officials couldn’t take this line openly.So, instead of owning up that their goal was to keep Britain tied to their laws, they invented a story about avoiding border checks and making sure that violence did not come back to Irish politics.Still, there was a telling admission when the proposals first emerged earlier this week.Reporting on the Irish government’s response, RTE’s Tony Connelly tweeted: “The main argument against this approach is that all the technology in the world is of no usethe actual customs tarf makes your cross-border business unviable, especiallyyou’re in agrood.”In other words, it’s not about the border at all. It’s about maintaining privileged access to the UK market.At present, more than two thirds of all Irish beef exports come to the UK.Understandably, the last thing Dublin wants is for us to switch to cheaper and better beef from Australia, Argentina and the United States — something we would be able to do outside the EU’s trade rules.Many continental countries also want to make sure that Britain remains a captive market for their exporters.So when it became clear that the UK had come up with a way to avoid infrastructure at the Irish border, they moved the goalposts.What they now wanted was not an invisible border, they said, but common rules on both sides of it.Oddly, this applies only one way. No one regarded it as a threat to peace when, for example, the Republic of Ireland left the sterling zone and joined first the ERM and then the euro. But Britain signing its own trade deals is apparently unacceptable.To be fair to Eurocrats, the only reason they put these outrageous demands on the table was because there was a Remainer majority in both Houses of Parliament egging them on.The concept of keeping Britain in the customs union — or of an “Irish backstop” as Brussels officials cunningly called it — only appeared in late , more than a year after the referendum.Why  Because, by then, there had been a new election in the UK and there was now a pro-EU majority in the Commons.Labour and Lib Dem MPs told the EU, quite openly, that they would not let Britain leave except on terms agreed with Brussels — or “not without a deal” as they put it.The EU responded by offering deliberately unpalatable terms.It, like the opposition parties, plainly hopes that,the terms are hard enough, Britain will drop the whole idea of Brexit.As Michel Barnier, the Brexit negotiator, told EU leaders at the start of the process: “I’ll have done my job , by the end, the terms are so hard that the Brits would prefer to stay in.”What, then, will happen now  My guess is that the EU will reject Britain’s offer — even though it achieves all the things Brussels had said were important.It will do so because it believes the alternative is not No Deal — an outcome for which Britain is far better prepared than are the  — but yet another postponement.When MPs voted to make No Deal impossible, they were in fact making a deal impossible, because they were taking away from the EU any incentive to agree terms.If I am right —Brussels rejects the deal, and Parliament then demands another extension — we will be back where we started.But with one critical dference. It will now be obvious to the entire country that Boris was prepared to go as far as any British leader could to find a compromise.It will be clear that neither the EU nor its fth columnists in our own Parliament have any interest in any outcome short of reversing the referendum.Boris, in other words, will be able to go into a general election having demonstrated good faith.He will have done everything possible to leave on good terms, but will have been blocked by MPs who had previously promised to respect the result.Labour and the Lib Dems will, by contrast, have to go into that campaign explaining why, despite their earlier pledges, they now want to drag everything out again.Why they want months or years more of anger and broken friendships, of business uncertainty, and of Britain being made to look ridiculous before the world. No wonder they keep running away from a new election.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We will not buy that.”The Taoiseachs blast has infuriated Brexiteers with Tory MP Peter Bone calling the comments “extraordinary” and “meddling”.Mr Bone told MailOnline: “We had a once in a letime referendum and there was a very clear majority for leaving the EU.“What is even more strange is this is on the day that the Prime Minister came to the House of Commons with a very generous deal to the EU and particularly to Ireland.”Tory MP Nigel Evans said: “The British people voted to leave the EU. We are democrats in the UK and we have never ignored a result of a referendum unlike other EU countries including Ireland.”But Mr Varadkar has been supported by Brussels as Donald Tusk said he was “unconvinced” by Mr Johnson’s plans.Mr Tusk, European Council President, tweeted: “Today I had two phone calls on Brexit, first with Dublin then with London.“My message to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar : We stand fully behind Ireland.“My message to PM Boris Johnson : We remain open but still unconvinced.”As well as Dublin and Brussels, Mr Johnson must now work to convince MPs that his plan is the right Brexit option.In order to secure a Commons majority he needs to win over the DUP, Tory Brexiteers and Labour Euroscepticshe has any chance of pushing his proposal over the line.Laying out his plan to MPs today, he said: This government has moved.“Our proposals do represent a comprise and I hope the House can come together in the national interest behind this new deal and open a new chapter of friendship with our European partners.“Let us seize this moment to honour our promise to British people, respect Brexit and get Brexit done.”But Mr Corbyn blasted the proposals as a “rehash” of previous Brexit proposals and said Mr Johnson was leading Britain into a “race to the bottom”.The Labour boss added: “Deal or no deal this government’s agenda is clear – they want a Trump deal Brexit that would crash our economy.However, the Mr Johnson was offered a boost when leading Tory Brexiteer Mark Francois spoke out in support of his new agreement.The PM will need the support of Conservative Eurosceptic group the ERG, of which Mr Francois is deputy chair,he wants to get his deal through the Commons.Boris adopted a constructive tone during today’s proceedings in direct reaction to the storm created by the storm caused by his “humbug” comment in the Commons last week.In response he also told opposition MPs that he was “concerned” by their aggressive tone when grilling him over Brexit.Mr Johnson was also keen to show the House his efforts to take a constructive tone with Brussels.He his deal would bridge the chasm between the two sides and the government would go the extra mile to get Brexit done.The change of tack from Boris comes after the PM was rebuked for his constant use of the term “surrender bill” to describe the Brexit-blocking Benn Act, last week.Labour MP Paula Sherf later clashed with Mr Johnson after she suggested that his “offensive and dangerous language” could lead to attacks on politicians and pointed to a plaque of murdered MP Jo Cox.The PM described the comment as “humbug” – causing widespread outrage - but later apologised.Mr Johnson appeared in the Commons after holding a crunch Cabinet meeting this morning.The PM dragged his ministers in for an emergency meeting while EU chiefs pick apart his new Brexit plan.Mr Johnson described his five-point proposal as a “fair and reasonable compromise” during the Tory party conference in Manchester yesterday.Boris hopes to now pull together a majority of MPs to back his Brexit proposals.So far the PM believes he could get the support of the DUP, Tory Brexiteers and Labour Eurosceptics which could be enough to get his plan over the line.Murmurs from No suggest the PM could jet off to Brussels for a whistle-stop tour of EU capitals, the Daily Mail reports.This would start with a trip to German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin.Boris’ main priority in the coming days will be to persuade EU chiefs that his deal is the right option to break the Brexit deadlock over the Northern Irish backstop.Mr Varadkar is one of the leaders that will take the most convincing.The Taoiseach said: “What we are hearing is not encouraging and would not be the basis for agreement.”Mr Johnson’s five points, set out in a letter to the EU, are:The PM used his first conference speech as party leader to tee up his ideas.But he again asserted that Britain would leave the EU on October  “come what may”.Mr Johnson also bluntly declared “the alternative is No Deal”.He told the conference: “That is not an outcome we want.It is not an outcome we seek at all.

Five minutes, max, and that was me done.Then the Channel  continuity woman announced: “Richard Madeley’s going in”, and that was effectively me for the next three weeks.Glued to a series called The Circle, which could scarcely be a bigger waste of my own and everyone ’s time.As wastes of time go, though, this one’s pretty much unbeatable.It’s got a good host, for starters, Emma Willis, who has that happy knack of improving every show she guest-presents or, in this case, takes over from Maya Jama and Alice Levine.Emma, of course, hosted another famous Channel  reality show, which, above and beyond the fact the network has sold this format across the world, is the real reason it is so idiotically excited about The Circle.Finally, nine years after junking the show, it has a viable replacement for Big Brother and all that comes with it.A large building, nominations, evictions and a lot of bone-brained contestants who can message each other, inside The Circle, but never meet, meaning they are free to be whoever they want to be.Among those competing to win £,, we’ve got cat-fishing Scouser James, who’s pretending to be a single mum called Sammieand Katie, who’s taken on the identity of her own son, Jay.Hardly ambitious.The sheer effort of the pretence, though, means the most interesting contestants tend to be the ones who are just being themselves and come with a iety of sob stories and boasts, like “Crohn’s survivor” Georgina bisexual dyslexic Woody, who cannot wait to tell everyone he’s Zoe Ball and Norman Cook’s son and Brooke who refers to her breasts as “the goodies”, because they’re the exact same size as Bill Oddie’s head.Smartest and most interesting of the lot, however, is theology professor Tim, who’s keen to foster the idea he looks uncannily like Robin Williams, presumably to distract attention from the fact he looks uncannily like Harold Shipman. Which may also be the reason they didn’t stick Judy Finnigan in that house. Bad visuals.You already know who the real star is, though. It’s Madeley, who entered the show, babbling like a madman, day one, with an acoustic guitar and a keyboard.Deal was, he couldn’t win but had to take on a dferent identity.Richard fancied “an -year-old woman”but the viewers decided he should be a hot -year-old blonde called Judy.The results have been brilliant, not least ’cos Woody has flirted outrageously with “Judy” Richard, who’s had to respond in kind.It’s tinged with regret, though. The show where Richard Madeley really should be uniting a fractured nation in joy and laughter is Strictly.The Circle understands this only too well, so they had him togged up in a motion-capture avatar suit for an unforgettable game of “guess the dance” on Friday, moshing, dabbing and doing a tango that looked like Groucho Marx’s death stagger.“Forty years in journalism and broadcasting,” he sighed sarcastically, “And the pinnacle has arrived.”Yes, yes it finally has, Richard. Now seize the moment and get yourself on Strictly . A nation demands it.David Craig: “Jack Grealish does exactly what he says on the tin.”David Croft: “Vettel punched through a gap that wasn’t there.”And Matt Le Tissier: “I love scoring goals but equally almost liked creating goals as much.”BBC’S latest Far East celebrity travelogue really should’ve been called Sue Perkins Condescends To Meet Some Foreigners.But it wasn’t.

But it seems to be all right here, I think, ’cos Sue’s a middle-class Cambridge graduate who reads the .No matter where she travels, Sue also remains ever-vigilant for the slightest hint of sexism and clearly thought she was guaranteed plenty of that at a government-sponsored speed-dating night, along with lots of other stuff tosspots like to describe as “problematic”.Soyou want to see irony squared, watch the moment towards the end of episode two when Sue grandly tells a whole room of uncomprehending dorks: “Formality permeates every part of Japanese culture. Everything’s driven by boundaries, rules and regulations.

For the Tories, it is a clear goal of policy.In his ambitious speech to the conference, the Chancellor Sajid Javid – who is the son of a bus driver – declared that the Living Wage would rise over the next five years from the present rate of £.-an-hour to £.-an-hour - and the age limit lowered from  to .Altogether, it is estimated that at least four million people will benefit from these far-reaching changes.The Chancellor’s scheme exposes all the left-wing nonsense about Tory toffs.This is not the action of a Government that is driven by concern only for the wealthy or is indferent to the struggles of those on limited earnings.A modern, thriving economy cannot be built on the back of exploitation and poverty pay.Anyone who goes out to work is entitled to a level of pay that can sustain a reasonable standard of living.Those who object to Sajid Javid’s proposal should be askedthey would be willing to work for less than £.-an-hour.In fact, it is depressing that so many people who do invaluable jobs in the community, like care home workers, hospitality staff and retailers are currently paid less than this.Looking after the elderly or disabled should be well-rewarded positions, not jobs hovering at the level of the minimum wage.Indeed, ever since they came to power in , the Conservatives have prioritised the quest to improve living standards and reward those who hold down jobs.That is why the Government has dramatically cut income tax for the low paid by raising the personal allowance from £,-a-year in  to £, this year.As a result, more than four million people who earn beneath this threshold no longer have to pay income tax at all.Meanwhile, contrary to all the rancid hysteria about alleged Tory bias to the rich, the top one per cent of earners now pay  per cent of all income tax.The Conservatives’ claim to be the party of the workers is further reinforced by their jobs miracle, which far exceeds anything achieved where in Europe.When the Tories took office in , there were widespread predictions that they would preside over soaring dole queues.Just the opposite happened. In the last nine years, no fewer than .million new jobs have been created, most of them full-time.Today, unemployment stands at just . per cent, the lowest level since . Over  per cent of the population is now in work, a historic record, with more women in the workplace than ever before and wages are now growing at their fastest rate in a decade.Inflation is low, while credit and mortgages have never been cheaper, which – along with tax cuts – boosts household budgets.Similarly, a consumer study out this week showed that expenditure on dining out is at its highest level for three years.Tory economic success, in the face of Labour’s hysterical gloom-mongering, points to a fundamental dference between the parties.The Conservatives believe in providing incentives towards diligence and enterprise.In contrast, Labour is ideologically obsessed with levelling down, trying to achieve a dogmatic form of equality through higher taxes, massive redistribution of wealth and lavish social security benefits.As history has continually taught us, it is a disastrous recipe for economic sclerosis and welfare dependency.Raising pay rather than benefits is the best way to bolster living standards.A generous welfare system is a heavy drag on the economy, not only because it imposes a huge burden on the taxpayer but also because it discourages work.On the other hand, a reasonable minimum wage raises productivity in the workplace, puts more money in the pockets of employees and expands the economy.The main objection to a higher minimum comes from employers, who argue that, because of rising costs, staff will be priced out of jobs - but there is little evidence to support such warnings.The same anxieties were voiced when Labour under Tony Blair first campaigned in  for the introduction of a minimum wage.At the time, the Tories said that policy would destroy jobs, particularly among young people. But such dire forecasts never materialised.Thankfully, the Conservatives have learnt that such messages of economic doom are hollow.It will turn our economy into a pioneer, with one of the highest statutory minimums in the world.Inevitably Labour has been carping this week, with the Shadow Chancellor bleating about the Tories’ pathetic attempt at catch-up.But such language just demonstrates Labour’s fear - as their mantle of the party of the workers is steadily pulled from their grasp."},{"url":null,"title":"bercow makes kangaroo testicle joke in commons","story":"Mr Bercow quipped on his croaky voice following the dig by the PM at the Tory party conference yesterday.The Speaker, who was suffering from a sore throat, told the Commons today: “I want to take the opportunity to confirm to the House that the state of my throat, which is purely temporary, is not down to the consumption of a kangaroo’s testicle.“I wouldn’t eat it, it would probably be poisoned.”The joke came after Boris told fellow MPs thatParliament were a TV show they all deserved to be “voted out” before taking a swipe at ardent Remainer Mr Bercow.Boris Johnson mocked the Commons for its efforts to block Brexit and joked that he would like to make Mr Bercow do a revolting Bush Tucker Trial.The Speaker - who once had a b****cks to Brexit sticker on his car - has infuriated Mr Johnson with what he sees as anti-Government bias over Brexit.Mr Johnson told Tory delegates: “If Parliament were a reality TV show then the whole lot of us Im afraid would have been voted out of the jungle by now.“But at least we would have the consolation of watching the speaker being forced to eat a kangaroo testicle.”After the banter in the Commons, Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom was quick to send Mr Bercow her own supportive message.She tweeted: Get well soon @HoC_Speaker_MP! Next timeyou try liquidising the kangaroo testicleit shouldn’t get stuck in your throat...The eccentric Speaker has become known for his booming delivery, turn of phrase and bellowing of Order! while overseeing matters in the chamber.But MPs expressed concern for him during digital, culture, media and sport questions.After his raspy voice introduced the session, Mr Bercow noted: It wont last long, dont worry.Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan said: I hope your voice is fully recovered very soon.Conservative former minister Tim Loughton added: I have Strepsils.Mr Bercow is in his final weeks in the role of Speaker after announcing he will chair proceedings for the final time on October  - the current Brexit deadline - and also step down as MP for Buckingham.He has been in the role since June  and the election to replace him will take place on November ."},{"url":null,"title":"british farmer prepares brexit importing","story":"NewsBritish farmer prepares for Brexit by importing Nazi-engineered cowsEcologist Derek Gow, from Devon, is transforming his farm into a safari, which will be home to wild boar, wild cats and cows.ShareByJohn BettJoel Cooper:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video british-farmer-owns-giant-nazi-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news british-farmer-prepares-brexit-importing-\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

The breed of Heck was engineered by German zoologist brothers Heinz and Lutz Heck, who were commissioned by the Nazis. Derek has imported a herd of the breed onto his farm in Lton, Devon, in the hopes they will help his business flourish after Britain leaves the EU.    Derek said: The reason weaposre doing it is because farming is becoming increasingly uneconomic. Without the EU subsidies,we continued to farm we would be unprofitable. The breed of cows is aggressive and horned - and are thought to be the closest living relative to a historic species of bull called Aurochs. The cows are very large, they resemble cave paintings, Derek said. The Nazis wanted to go out and hunt them, thataposs why they were made.  Most of the breed were slaughtered after the Second World War, but after a lot of experimenting Mr Gow now has  of them on his land. Itaposs been an awful lot of work but I hope people will find it interesting. Derek, who is originally from Dundee, is renowned for his work reintroducing animals into nature.    He pioneered the captive breeding and reintroduction of water voles and played a key role in theof beavers to Britain. Last year Mr Gow had drawn up a briefing for ministers about the potential reintroduction of British wildcats. It is believed that wildcats could help to cull grey squirrels, an invasive species which has driven out native red squirrels from most of the country.

They decided to go ahead with the pregnancy after being told of the error. It was revealed in a report by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authoritywhich shows mistakes are on the rise. The couple first used a sperm donor in  but the treatment was unsuccessful. A second cycle using a dferent donor led to them having a child.    They ed to the clinic in  asking to use the second donor again in the hope of giving their a full genetic sibling. But, because of a mix-up with paperwork at the centre in Chelmsford, sperm from the first donor was used.

George can already drive, pitch and putt the ball despite only celebrating his third birthday last month. His longest shot to date is  yards and earlier this year he completed an entire hole for the first time in  shots. The little lad regularly takes to the course with his own set of clubs and a tiny glove but he can’t wear golf shoes or clothing yet as no brand make them in his size. George’s golf mad granddad Tony Sedgwick, , sparked the youngster’s love of the game when he bought him a set of plastic toy clubs  months ago. “It’s really fun going to the golf range and to the golf course with my granddad,” George said. “I love whacking the golf ball.”  He added: “When I’m famous I’m going to buy my mummy a new house and granddad some new golf balls.” Business manager Tony recognised his grandson’s exceptional skill early on and nowadays the two can regularly be seen together at the -hole Wigan Golf Club. He said: “George just absolutely loves golf, he can’t get enough of it. “He loves going to the driving range and having a whack or even just coming to the course with me when I go for a round. “He’s definitely made me super proud.” The granddad-of-two added: “At the moment it’s all about him having fun but there’s no doubt he has a huge amount of natural talent. “He’s my little Rory McIlroy.”  Tony said George first picked a club up more than  months ago, when he stumbled across one of his in the back garden. “Even at such a young age you could tell he had a natural talent for the game,” Tony said. “The clubs were obviously too big and heavy for him but he was swinging away.” Not long after purchasing the lad plastic clubs Tony went all the way and got him a set of real ones in the smallest possible size. Within weeks George was successfully making solid contact with the ball.  His proud mum Louise Sedgwick, , had to ban him from using real balls in the garden after he nearly smashed the conservatory window. Seventeen months ago Louise’s husband and George’s dad Dave Hughes tragically died aged  due to complications from a heart transplant. Louise, who’s now training to be an organ transplant nurse, said: “George was very young when Dave died but the tragedy has still definitely had an impact on him. “Sometimes he’ll cry and ask for his daddy, which is heartbreaking but we make sure we talk about Dave all the time so he’s a part of George’s le.” She added: “Golf has been a brilliant thing for George to focus on since his dad died. “It’s amazing to see how well he’s doing despite everything he’s been through.” "},{"url":null,"title":"hoarder trapped hallway 30 years","story":"NewsHoarder trapped in hallway for  years sobs as she is rescued from messThe woman was forced to sleep in a deckchair at the property in Maidstone, Kent - until a house clearing company saved her from the mountains of rubbishShareCommentsByGregory Kirby:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video inside-hoarders-bungalow-of-clutter-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news hoarder-trapped-hallway--years-\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

The woman had lived with an elderly relative, who was a hoarder, and filled their home with so much stuff they had to sleep in deckchairs by the front door for three decades. After the homeowner died, the pensioner endured the filth until a removals firm heard about her plight - and cleared the home for free. Kent-based removals firm Klutter King spent a week cleaning the house from top to bottom - and moved more than  tonnes of rubbish to the tip. Owner Kevin Porter said: The poor tenant began lodging with the relative in the early s. The relativeaposs compulsive hoarding got worse when her partner died.  We found piles of clothes, shoes, books, umbrellas and rotting food tins all over the house when we arrived. The food cans had been there for so long the contents had vanished and the tins were crumbling. The relative, who owned the property in Maidstone, Kent, died in , by which time the pensioner was too frail to sht the waste. Mr Porter, , of East Peckham, Kent, added: Iaposve cleared a lot of houses since forming the company. In most cases itaposs when someone has died or moved into a care home. But this one got me emotionally because of how this person had been made to live. They didnapost even have a bed and in the summertime they slept in the garage because it was too hot. Itaposs such a sad story. To make things worse, the landlady left the property to charity and not the relative.  It took six men seven days to clear decades of junk, which involved dozens of trips to the tip. Mr Porter added: It was so satisfying to finish because it seemed like the job was never going to end. At the halfway point I thought aposwhat am I doing , because we didnapost think we would ever finish. The tenant asked the clearance team to look out for a £, piece of jewellery which had become lost in the rubbish. The team were not hopeful they would find it, but eventually uncovered the lost treasure and ed it to the delighted owner. Mr Porter said: Most clearance companies make their profits from selling on expensive items. We donapost do that. I havenapost got it in me. The owner couldnapost believe it when we ed the jewellery. After the mess had been shted, the team mopped the floors and cleaned the walls which had been blocked for years.

It was there that he told me that he was going to quit his job and move to London. I was so relieved, but I was also so angry because cancer hadnapost only taken over my le, it had taken over his too. Emily began chemotherapy at the end of March before having surgery on May  to remove the tumour, which was seven inches long and over three inches wide. Surgeons also removed her right oy, right fallopian tube, appendix and lymph nodes, leaving her with  staples in her sternum.

Nicola Bevan told bosses she would need to take an emergency leave of absence from her job as a registered community health nurse. But while continuing to receive her monthly wage, the -year-old was running her private business, Youthful You Wales in Pencoed, which offered anti-ageing products including Botox injections.After Bevan’s line manager became suspicious an investigation was launched by the NHS counter-fraud team, reports Wales Online.Evidence was found on social media that she was trading.    They also discovered she had been duplicating prescriptions in order to obtain medications from pharmacies to be used in treatments. She did this to circumvent a process which required an independent prescriber to sign the prescription after taking into account the patient’s medical history. As well as avoiding paying fees to the independent prescriber, it was claimed Bevan put her patients at risk as they could have been given treatments that were dangerous for them. A sentencing hearing at Cardf Crown Court on Wednesday heard Bevan, of Pencoed, was employed by the Swansea Bay University Health Board and had worked as a nurse for  years. Prosecutor Carl Harrison said the defendant signed a contract at the beginning of her employment agreeing not to carry out private medical work without the permission of the health board.    Bevan remained on sick leave from December  to June  during which time she received a total of £, in wages. Since her conviction she has fully repaid the amount she received during this period, the court heard. In regards to the prescription fraud, the defendant had duplicated  prescriptions. When confronted about her behaviour Bevan denied she had been working but later admitted to running a business while on sick leave. She also initially claimed she believed prescriptions could be submitted twice to a pharmacy. The defendant later pleaded guilty to two counts of fraud and one count of dishonestly failing to disclose information to make a gain for herself. The court heard she had previous convictions for the possession and production of cannabis.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA row has erupted between parents and school chiefs following a decision to change the studentsapos unorm just four weeks into the new term. The move by Heworth Grange School in Gateshead has been branded a joke and left dozens of mums and dads scratching their heads over the timing. A letter was issued to parents announcing the new £. branded polo shirts bought during the summer holidays were being replaced by plain white shirts and a tie.And it has caused uproar as families are having to fork out more money on top of the expense they faced just weeks ago, reports Chronicle Live.School bosses say the polo shirts will now be used for PE and the tie is free - which just leaves the shirt or blouses to be bought. A fund has been set aside for those in hardship and cannot afford the shirts.    The new unorm came into play on October  and school bosses say the vast majority of staff and students have responded very positively to the change. However mum Samantha Matfin is absolutely furious. I am so angry and so are a lot of other parents, she said. I bought polo shirts with the school logo on for my daughter ing to school last month and now they are changing the unorm. This doesn’t teach kids the value of money at all. It’s a joke, it really is. “It’s just four weeks since she went back to school and now there is a change. I rang the lady at the school and said why can’t we have a meeting and discuss this first. I thought that February in the half term break would have been a better time to introduce this, so at least the kids can get a bit of wear out of them. Just let us get Christmas out of the way and then bring in the shirts. Samantha added: “I bought three white polo shirts and two blue polos for PE, all at £.. Now they say she can wear them all for PE that she has once a week. It really is a joke.”  Owen Englis took over the position as interim headteacher at the school at the start of the term and changes are being made. In a letter produced on September  it said: “We are delighted to introduce ourselves as the senior team at Heworth Grange. “We are taking on the leadership at a very exciting stage in the school’s journey and we will be working very hard to ensure that we secure very positive outcomes for the students we serve. It continues: “As part of the change to leadership, we are also focusing on standards of unorm and behaviour. We make no excuses for the high expectations at Heworth Grange, students who look good and feel positive are more likely to achieve. As a result, we are introducing a few changes to the standards of students at the school. The letter goes on to say that as of October , students must wear a plain white shirt blouse with a collar and a school jumper at all times. It adds that polo shirts will now be for PE only but they can wear either blue or white ones.Parents have also voiced their anger on Facebook with one mum saying she paid £ for her sonaposs unorm in time for September.She added: No way am I going and buying new stuff.” "},{"url":null,"title":"school scraps traditional terms parents","story":"NewsSchool scraps traditional terms so parents can take kids on holiday at any timeFee-paying Shrewsbury Prepatoria in Shrewsbury allows parents to take their children out of school whenever it suits themShareCommentsByDave Burke:,  OCT NewsShrewsbury Prepatoria School \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTwo treasure hunters covered up a find of £million of ancient coins and jewellery so they could pocket the fortune, a court heard today. Metal detectorists George Powell, , and Layton Davies, , allegedly made the discovery while digging in a farmer’s field in April . The haul included up to  coins dating back to Anglo-Saxon and Viking times, gold jewellery and silver ingots, jurors were told. Under UK law they were meant to report the find near Leominster, Herefordshire, to the local coroner as possible treasure. But a court was told they covered up the size of the haul and tried to quietly sell the majority of the coins. Prosecutor Kevin Hegarty QC said the jewellery was so rare it was impossible to put a value on the items.  They included a th century men’s ring, a th century pendant and a th century bracelet in a shape of a serpent. Opening the case on Thursday, Mr Hegarty said: “This case, in two words, is about buried treasure. “Over , years ago, before the Norman Conquest, jewellery, coins and ingots were concealed in the ground. “They stayed there, undisturbed, for many hundreds of years, until June . “On a day in June, George Powell and Layton Davies were out with their metal detectors on farmland. “They were both experienced metal detectors and they found the jewellery, coins and ingots. “They knew when they found this material that this was no ordinary find.  “If they did not know it already, they soon learned it was not simply buried treasure, but a hoard of very valuable coins. “Such a quantity of coins of this kind would attract collectors from all over the world. “They decided to treat the find as theirs and not to declare it to the land owner, the farmer or Crown. In short, they stole it.” Mr Hegarty told Worcester Crown Court that just  coins from the hoard were ever found by police. But he added: “It’s the prosecution’s case that there were many, many more coins were recovered by Powell and Davies. “All we have is a fraction of what had been hidden in the ground , years ago.” Jurors were told experts from the British Museum were drafted in to identy and value the items. The coins included ‘two emperors’, featuring the faces of King Alfred and King Ceolwulf II, worth up to £, each. Other coins known as ‘cross and lozenges’, valued at £, each, were also found in the field, the court heard. Mr Hegarty said the total value of the coins discovered by the duo was “very close to £ million.” He added: “As to the items of jewellery, you may think they are invaluable due to their rarity.” Jurors were told Powell and Davies met an antiques dealer days after finding the haul and showed him  coins. He advised them to declare the find to the coroner after they bragged of discovering “far more”, it is claimed. But they allegedly did nothing until a local finds officer, who had heard about the discovery, emailed Powell.

Here are just some of his fascinating facts and obscure word definitions...English is the official language of  countries and  non-sovereign nations, and is the second most-spoken language after Mandarin, with over  million users as a first or second language. Avocado comes from a word meaning testicle. When the Aztecs discovered the fruit in BC they probably noted its shape, size, gnarly skin and tendency to grow in pairs. J K Rowling invented the term Muggle to refer to those in the Harry Potter universe who don’t practise magic, but the word has been around for centuries. It first appeared in the th century in an epic poem meaning “a tail resembling that of a fish” In the s, ‘muggle’ became slang for a cannabis joint. The origin of the meaning of the word chaperone as someone who accompanies or supervises another is a metaphor, because a chaperon was a hood formerly worn by nobles. In the late th century, a hundred years before the nursery rhyme, Humpty Dumpty was the name of a drink consisting of boiled ale and brandy. Sideburns were originally called burnsides, named after Union Army General and United States Senator Ambrose Burnside , who was noted for his unusual facial hair.

An enneacontakaienneagon is a shape with  sides. The first written example of chicken meaning ‘coward’ appears in Will Kemp’s Nine Days Wonder in . Semordnilap is a word or phrase that spells a dferent word or phrase backwards , e.g. dog, plug, reviled, desserts, deliver. The longest one-syllable word in the English language is screeched.

hopes Mikey Devlin can take his chance with Scotland.The Aberdeen defender was named in Steve Clarke’s international squad for this month’s Euro  qualying double header with Russia and San Marino.It’s Clarke’s third squad as national team boss and Devlin has been selected in all of them.The -year-old has yet to win a Scotland cap, but Irvine – who won nine caps between  and  – reckons he will get his chance soon.And he hopes Devlin, pictured, can take his opportunity at international level when it arises.Irvine said: “I’m delighted for Mikey to be in the Scotland squad again.“The Scotland manager sees something in Mikey andhe can get a cap that will be the icing on the cake for him.“The experience of having been in the squad will help his development as a player.“He has been doing well with Aberdeen and he knows he needs to keep that up at club level.“The chances will come as they have with Scott McKenna and when the opportunity is there it’s up to Mikey to take it.“He’s untested at international level, but it may depend on the opposition as to whether he gets a cap.“If he was going in against Belgium that might not be ideal for a first cap.“But with Russia and Sam Marino the next two games they may be good for Mikey to bed into the national team.“Hopefully, he can keep learning and improving.”Irvine is a big fan of Devlin, who joined Aberdeen from Hamilton Accies in January .He admires Devlin’s approach to his defensive work and believes he could do an important job for Scotland.Irvine added: “As a former centre-half I really enjoy watching him play. Whenever I see Aberdeen play I always watch Mikey closely.“I see a lot of positives in the way he plays. Defensively there’s no frills and he gets the job done.“That’s what the job of a defender is – to win tackles, win headers and organise his back four.“On the ball it’s about playing a simple ball up the line or into a midfielder.“The stock skills you need to be a good defender, Mikey has them all in his armoury.“Some defenders are expected to play great passes and to try to play out from the back all the time.“But I’m not so interested in that. It’s more about being defensively sound first and foremost.“I’ve been delighted to see him do well for Aberdeen and also be involved with the national team.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.33243395-3-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.33243395-3-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.33243395-3-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.33243395-3-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"airline launches new route from aberdeen1","story":"An airline has announced new flights from Aberdeen.Loganair will launch a new service to Cornwall Airport Newquay on April  next year.Flights, which will depart from the Granite City on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays will have one stop at Newcastle, and northbound flights on Fridays and Sundays will also stop at Newcastle.There will also be non-stop services on Saturdays and there will also be extra one-stop flights in each direction on Tuesdays and Thursdays between  July and  September.Loganair managing director Jonathan Hinkles said: “We’re excited by these new routes which we’ve been working for some time to develop at just the right level.

Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible. Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this. Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee. The aim is to transfer all serious patients to one of these centres following pre-hospital emergency care within  minutes.The value of a helicopter air ambulance is therefore obvious.Working alongside the Scottish Ambulance Service#s air fleet, SCAA relies entirely on public donations to keep this vital resource flying.Please consider supporting SCAA in it#s le-saving work during a week when the country focuses on the crucial work of air ambulances everywhere.For further information please visit www.scaa.org.ukDavid Craig, chief executive, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance , Perth AirportSir,I get a magazine called #Clean Slate#.In it this month is an article where a -year-old girl, Greta Thunberg, along with  other youth activists, have issued this invitation to adults around the world: #Starting on Friday September  we are going to kick-start a week of climate action, with a world-wide strike for the climate.

At .pm on Saturday night a flock of Pink-footed Geese passed over my house from north to south, probably heading for the Solway or Lancashire.On the same day, a trip was made to the middle Teviot to look for Whooper Swans as two were reported earlier in the week and six noted at Dowlaw Dam near Cockburnspath.However, the trip produced nothing, so they may have moved on.On September  the local branch of the Scottish Ornithologistrsquos Club organised a field trip to St Abbrsquos Head. Several members met up at the main car park at the visitor centre and shared transport to the car park just near the lighthouse.The sun was out but a strong wind was encountered. The group set off to explore the west side of Mire Loch but found the wind too strong to make the birds show.Birds were present but keeping a low profile and the noise of the wind rustling the leaves did not help to locate birds by their calls. A Blue Tit appeared along with Wren and Dunnock. Several Chfchaff uttered their contact calls and a Goldcrest was seen briefly.On the Mire Loch a pair of Mute Swans protected three well-grown cygnets. Tucked into the reeds was a Little Grebe and as we walked down to the dam end several Moorhen called.Mallard, Tufted Duck and Coot were added to the site list.As the group moved slowly along the track several Speckled Wood butterflies sunned themselves. At the dam end at the edge of the willows there were about  Red Admirals. But no unusual migrant birds.The group headed up the path back towards the carpark, but again few birds. In the bay and on the clfs near the car park were a few Fulmars and a steady passage of Gannets. The odd Guillemot passed but no signicant movement on the sea. At the lighthouse a pair of House Martins were still catching insects for a late brood. The lighthouse walled garden had been receiving migrants but on the visit only two Robin made an appearance. Interesting, however, was the discovery of male and female Small Copper butterflies and seven Pinkfeet coming in off the sea.After lunch at the lighthouse garden, the party headed down to Burnmouth to examine the shore for waders. After scanning the foreshore Curlew, Redshank, Oystercatcher and Turnstone were found. Around the harbour were several Great Blacked Gulls, one of which carried a yellow colour ring, the details of which have been registered on the British Trust for Ornithologist online form for reporting ringed birds.At the moment the result has still to be received as regards where it was ringed. A Mute Swan was feeding in one of the rock pools and a Goosander was asleep at the edge of a pool. The only other birds of interest were a Rock Pipit and Peregrine.From Burnmouth some of the party headed inland to Foulden to view a small pond for wildfowl and waders. On the way down to the site from the village two Tree Sparrows and some Collared Dove were noted. On the pond we found a couple of Greylag but a few days previously there had been several hundred. Some  Pink-feet were present but before we left another  arrived. The pond was scanned thoroughly but no waders present, only four Pied Wagtails. A few Wigeon and Teal were added bringing the total for the three sites to .After the members had finished up for the day, the warden at St Abbrsquos reported on a short sea watch which he had undertaken later in the day. During our visit there was nothing unusual moving over the sea but the warden accounted for an adult Pomarine Skua, a Manx Shearwater and four Red-breasted Merganser. Then at .am the next day another birder had a Sabinersquos Gull with Kittiwakes and an Artic Skua. Then on September  a Mediterranean Gull appeared over the wardenrsquos cottage and there was a fly-past by a Grey Plover.These sightings had obviously aroused interest and a two-hour sea watch first thing on September  saw three Arctic Skua flying north,  Red-throated Divers, nine north, five south and  Common Scoter flying north.Less common migrants began to appear towards the end of the week with Lesser White Throat, Yellow-browed Warbler, Wood Warbler, Pied Flycatcher, Barred Warbler, Yellow Wagtail, Redstart and Black Redstart.In the following week Barnacle Geese passed over. This illustrates that birdwatching at this time of year can be exciting. An odd sighting was that of an Albatross species flying north but it looks as though no one  picked it up."},{"url":null,"title":"selkirk-set-turn-back-time-weekend-festivals","story":"SELKIRK is set to turn back time this weekend.The ever-popular Scotts Selkirk will take place for the th time throughout Saturday.And organisers have even added extra attractions by coinciding the Georgian celebrations with the toe-tapping Selkirk Sessions and the monthly Farmers Market.Viv Ross from Scotts Selkirk told us: \"Having started as a millennium project, this is the th time we have run the event.\"We would like to thank all our volunteers, performers and supporters who have helped us over the years to reach this milestone.\"The main streets in Selkirk will again be transformed into the days when Sir Walter dispensed justice from his courtroom.Period costumes are still available for hire from the events Market Place shop.As well as traditional entertainment, which includes puppeteers, dancers, musicians and performing animals, there will be an array of traditional childrens games on offer, such as splat-the-rat and a coconut shy.Fare from the th century will be served up at Meg Dods Kitchen, and Sir Walter willto the bench to deliberate over a couple of cases.Scotts Selkirk runs throughout Saturday, while the cream of local talent will take to stages in pubs and clubs around the town for the Selkirk Sessions from Friday evening through to Sunday.A car boot sale has also been organised for the Market Place on Sunday.Viv added: \"Our performers include GaelForce, Carlenjig, Riddell Fiddles, Bogie Close Stompers, Highline Fiddlers, and Bob Liddle.\"We are again really looking forward to the open mic sessions where we will no doubt be treated to some exceptional music.\"There will also be a host of talented buskers in both the Market Place and the High Street to add to the entertainment.\""},{"url":null,"title":"latest-new-childrens-park-opens-kelso","story":"THE latest new park in the Borders swung open at the weekend.And hundreds of children turned up to try out the latest equipment to be installed at Kelsos Shedden Park.Susan Glendinning, winner of the Ex-Kelso Laddies Letime Achievement Award, officially opened the facilities.The pound, play park is the sixth to be opened in the Borders in the last  months as part of a pound million investment in young peoples facilities.The new equipment installed at Kelso includes a swirl roundabout with seat and back support, built in trampoline, cradle seat swings and ious play  including a sign language .A central treetops towers unit also has an accessible ramp and wide slide to make it more accessible and inclusive to all abilities.Kelso Provost Dean Weatherston said: ldquoIt was great to be a part of a wonderful day and I enjoyed taking my daughter and nieces into the new park.ldquoIt is a great asset for the town and I am especially pleased there is equipment for children with disabilities.ldquoThank you to everyone who contributed to the project and those involved with the opening.Kelso, Galashiels, Stow, Oxton, Harestanes and Coldstream have so far received new play parks.And Peebles, Earlston, Duns, Eyemouth and Jedburgh are in line to also benefit over the next three years.Executive spokesman for neighbourhoods, councillor Sandy Aitchison told us: \"We have had some great feedback already on the new Shedden Park Play Park and we hope families in the local area will get along to try it out in the coming weeks.ldquoWe have plans for further play parks right across the Scottish Borders as well as new pump skate parks and fitness and youth shelters as part of the investment strategy, which is aiming to improve the right facilities in the right places."},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-rachael-hamilton-msp","story":"Rachael Hamilton is Conservative MSP for Ettrick, Roxburgh and BerwickshireSuccess for MND Blue Badge CampaignLast week in the Scottish Parliament, it was very rewarding to see the Scottish Government finally decide to revise the Blue Badge eligibility criteria for people with MND.Several months ago, I joined forces with Doddie Weir OBE to start a campaign, which called on the Scottish Government to change the criteria for Blue Badges to ensure that people living with MND can gain automatic access.The campaign came about because of a constituent writing to me about their frustrations with the current system, and how the y process of applying for a Blue Badge is incompatible.Currently there is no cure or effective treatment for MND, and the average le expectancy after diagnosis is sadly  months.

played a pivotal role in the formation of the giant fatberg found lurking under a seaside town, scientists have revealed.The -metre monster ndash greater inthan the Tower of Pisa ndash was discovered under The Esplanade in Sidmouth, Devon, just before Christmas last year.A team of scientists from the University of Exeter were asked to carry out an extensive lsquoautopsyrsquo of the fatberg to try to solve the mystery of how it was constructed and whether it posed any environmental risks.The scientists were given four samples from the fatberg, each weighing around kg, after South West Water workers spent eight weeks removing it from the sewer.In total,  tanker loads ndash each , gallons ndash of debris were excavated and removed by a dedicated team of seven specialists.--vw,vw,px, px\"Workers spent eight weeks removing the fatberg from the sewer --The fatberg was taken to a local sewage treatment works where it was fed into the anaerobic digester and produced energy to power the plant.The university team found that the samples they received were mostly made of animal fats ndash consistent with domestic food preparation ndash combined with household hygiene products such as wet wipes and sanitary products, as well as natural and articial fibres from toilet tissues and laundry.They also discovered the fatberg contained no detectable levels of toxic chemicals ndash meaning its presence in the sewer, while increasing the risk of a blockage, did not pose a chemical or biological risk to the environment or human health.Synthetic biology expert Professor John Love, who led the project, said: ldquoAnalysing the fatberg samples in such a short timeframe was an exciting challenge requiring the expertise from a number of specialised scientists.ldquoWe worried that the fatberg might concentrate fat-soluble chemicals such as those found in contraceptives, contain now-banned microplastic beads from cosmetics and be rich in potentially pathogenic microbes, but we found no trace of these possible dangers.ldquoWe were all rather surprised to find that this Sidmouth fatberg was simply a lump of fat aggregated with wet wipes, sanitary towels and other household products that really should be put in the bin and not down the toilet.ldquoThe microfibres we did find probably came from toilet tissue and laundry, and the bacteria were those we would normally associate with a sewer.As well as a straightforward lsquomacrorsquo analysis, where the fatberg samples were melted to see what they revealed ndash which included incontinence pads,  teeth and sanitary products ndash the teams also used state-of-the-art equipment to study the fats, particles, fibres and microbiological DNA included in the material.Scientists from the Greenpeace laboratory, based at Exeterrsquos Streatham Campus, also looked at the chemical composition of the fatberg for their own analysis.The results suggested that the fats found were more in keeping with domestic food preparation than commercial food outlets, while the chemicals were those found in personal care products, rather than pharmaceuticals or pesticides.They also found no evidence of harmful viruses or bacteria ndash offering reassurance given the importance of Sidmouthrsquos bathing waters to the local community and tourists alike.Andrew Roantree, from South West Water, added: ldquoAlthough we deal with around , blocked sewers every year, the Sidmouth fatberg was by far the largest discovered in our service history.ldquoWe wanted to learn as much as we could about it, how it was created and what it was made of to help us avoid further fatbergs in future.ldquoThe results confirm our suspicions, that fat and non-flushable products such as wipes are the main culprits, and that fatbergs are a consequence of the inidual and collective impact that our behaviour has on our environment.ldquoWe will be using these results to help us education, inform and change the behaviours of people in terms

Assisted by Scott Souden’s low cross from the left flank, the substitute striker guided a delightful flick into the net beyond the Glynhill keeper. Taking on the role of target-man with gusto, Radecki played a big part in the Feathers-sponsored Pupils’ fourth goal, when he held off a defender down the right wing and crossed to substitute Calum McKillop, whose back-heel flick found Souden at the penalty spot, and the -year-old winger, making the journey home from Edinburgh for a game, passed the ball into the net with ease to complete the scoring.The game became a procession in the closing minutes with man-of-the-match Crossan, the midfield linchpin alongside the impressive Liam Renton, orchestrating some controlled possession football, but there was some trouble on  minutes when a malicious foul on ex-Dumbarton man D McCallum sparked into a melee with players from both sides involved. It resulted in a second booking for Kenny Kerr, a yellow for J McCallum, and a red card for the original Glynhill culprit, as well as yellow for the visiting keeper from referee Jimmy Litster, after charging from his own goalmouth to become involved.Undeterred, the Pupils settled back down to seal a richly deserved victory,achieved through a disciplined and determined performance.The Kintyre Park side will now enjoy a free week, with ato action scheduled for Saturday October , opponent to be confirmed.For fixture updates, and to see second-half action and goals from last Saturday’s match, see Campbeltown Football on Facebook, or @PupilsAFC on Twitter."},{"url":null,"title":"weather wont play fair for men","story":"Strong winds, for most of the players, deflected several balls into the severe rough and out of bounds and pushed scores upwards.Robert Shaw, one of the first out in the morning ballot, had an excellent round to finish on a nett  from Ken MacMillan on nett .The wind continued in the afternoon but didn#t deter John Docherty from the best scratch score of the day.

However, it was the home side that took the lead on the nd minute when Ashfield’s centre forward cut in from the left before sending an unstoppable shot in to the top corner.A test of character was required from the boys as they fell behind and with five minutes of the half remaining they were rewarded after a corner dropped to Stuart Phillps in the box. The young forward adjusted his feet quickly to send a beautul curling shot past everyone to make it -.Fteen minutes into the second half the Pupils took the lead. New signing Raphael MacLachlan, playing in only his second appearance for the s, sent in a delightful whipped corner that brushed off the Ashfield centre-half into the goal to make it -. The Clachan youngster can be proud of his impact on the game and is already proving to be a valuable addition to the team.As the Pupils pressed for their third of the game a long ball evaded the defence to allow the Ashfield number  in again to equalise with  minutes remaining.As the game drew to a close, it looked like both sides would share the points until a dramatic final minute. A long clearance by Ashfield was misjudged by the Pupils defence to allow Ashfield’s player in with a chance of his hat-trick but the youngster scuffed his shot into thankful hands of Pupils goal-keeper Lorne Paterson.Knowing it was the final minute, Paterson tried to kick the ball up the field as quickly as possible only for it to cannon off the back of Euan O’May’s head! It landed back in Paterson’s hands and he quickly dispersed the ball, long up the field where the ball bounced high over everyone, only for Calum Ellis to nip in front of the Ashfield centre-half, run in on goal, calmly round the advancing goal-keeper and stroke the ball home to make it - to the Ardshield Hotel-sponsored side – much to the delight of his fellow team mates and coaches.Ellis who has now scored seven goals in the Under s# opening four games.This weekend the team will enjoy a free fixture due before playing at home to Glasgow Boys Club on Sunday October ."},{"url":null,"title":"mcfadyens amam a tremendous days golf","story":"It was one of sponsor McFadyen Contractors Ltd#s own teams that won the trophy with a tremendous score of  # a mighty  under par.

Sheep can be used in so many ways to benefit the environment and naivety from mainstream media risks increasing our environmental footprint.’Livestock is also widely criticised for its methane emissions which NSA say is, again, misleading.Mr Stocker added: ‘Methane shouldn’t be ignored it is an emitted gas that has an impact on global warming. However, we now know that it doesn’t behave in the same way as the other major warming gases and the calculations should take this into account.‘Methane has a short, rotational le cycle that means, providing livestock numbers remain stable, methane levels won’t build and build."},{"url":null,"title":"karen penny made champion of alzheimers research uk","story":"The prestigious accolade recognises her #incredible fundraising and tireless dedication raising awareness of dementia#, as well as her #exceptional commitment# in an undertaking that will see her walk continuously around the coast for an estimated three years, a feat never before undertaken by a woman.Karen said: #I am delighted to have been named as an Alzheimer’s Research UK Champion in recognition of my support for the charity.#Dementia has had a profound impact upon my family.

He was in Scotland mainly to play golf and try whisky, he told me. I was trying to convince him Scotland had many other things to offer and we got onto the issue of Scotlandrsquos landscape. He seemed interested in how our land was used, and he told me that back home he owned a ranch, which included a medium-sized forest of native trees.I remember saying ldquowow, thatrsquos so special, but he shook his head, saying: ldquoSpecial  No, not really, a stupid law means the forest is worthless.I was a bit confused, so I asked him what he meant. ldquoTherersquos a preservation order on it, which means that part of my land is unproductive, he said.I realised at this point that although we were having the same conversation about land, we were having dferent understandings of it.He shook his head sadly and said: ldquoItrsquos just a waste of good timber.That kind of ended our conversation. I didnrsquot try to persuade him to think dferently, I felt that I wasnrsquot in a position to do that since he was a paying customer and my tip could have been at stake.That conversation was nearly  years ago. And yet his comment ldquoitrsquos just a waste of good timber has stuck with me ever since. The reason for this was the mindset it revealed. I found it depressing that he could not see the value of something so precious because it would make him no financial profit.As my kids get geared up for the school climate strike this week, I realise now this mindset is one which has to be challenged. When I look back, I am ashamed of myself that I did not have the courage to speak out to the man, simply because I needed his tip.There are many parts of the climate crisis, but one truth within the debate is trees are our le. I have seen one calculation that each human breathes in the oxygen produced by around eight trees. So count the number in your family and those you love and multiply by eight. That is the number of trees needed to help your family and loved ones breathe. For sure, trees arenrsquot the only source of the oxygen we breathe, but they are a signicant part of it, and they hold tons of carbon. Surely that alone is lsquoprofitrsquo enough.But while the riches of woodland go way beyond that of timber profit, I understand that environmental destruction is linked to poverty as well as greed. We need to challenge both. But we will never do thiswe are made to be too afraid to speak out, either because we fear those who wield financial power over us, or the ridicule of others who as yet donrsquot get it.In a storytelling session last week for a P class in an East Lothian primary school, I told the tale of the king who wanted to touch the moon. He always gets his way because people are afraid of him, so the forest in his kingdom is cut down to make a tower of wooden boxes to the moon. But he is impatient and foolish, and falls from the tower, and the boxes all get smashed. The forest has been destroyed for the kingrsquos failed vanity project, while his people remain poor and still afraid of him.One of the girls in the class put her hand up then said: ldquoBut we need trees to live. Later she told me: ldquoThey should get rid of the kinghe doesnrsquot change his bad ways.Many of our young people get it. Itrsquos their future. We can all make our own small personal contribution, but to save our childrenrsquos future, courage is needed to speak out, for adults too.Never again will I remain silent, for either reward or fear of ridicule. There is too much at stake, not just for me but for my children and this dear planet which is home for us all, but dying in our care."},{"url":null,"title":"haddington-parking-plans-discussion-held-private","story":"East Lothian Council is working on designs that would see the parking provision changed in the town, including the possibility of a -plus-space long-stay car park on the townrsquos Whittingehame Drive.However, town centre traders are concerned about the possibility of spaces being lost on High Street and Market Street, with it also being mooted that the long-stay car park at Tesco, which is used by many people working in the town centre, could become short-stay only.The issue was briefly mentioned at the townrsquos community council meeting last Tuesday evening.Usually, these meetings are open to the public and the press however, it was agreed to cut short next monthrsquos meeting to allow community councillors to discuss the controversial plans in private.Jan Wilson, the grouprsquos long-standing chairwoman, said: ldquoIrsquom not sure how much can be made public at the moment.ldquoI know community council meetings should be public but there are times when I have to say no because the proposals are not set in stone yet.

ldquosocial prescribing rather than provide medication.Members of the public can also refer someone.Carol said: ldquoPeople who refer someone at risk of isolation to me may have medical problems that they need attended to, but social prescribing means that they are also trying to recommend other things that will benefit their wellbeing.ldquoIt might be to do with meeting other people, exercise or

What exactly fostered it I cannot say, but for sure the stories of lsquoMadam Butterflyrsquo, a teacher at Preston Lodge, was part of it, and perhaps also the history that I was visibly surrounded by when I left Prestonpans and moved to Edinburghrsquos Old Town as a teenager.What I do remember from these times is a powerful feeling that I was lucky to have this interest. It kept me going when I was having bad times, because there was always something that interested me or stimulated my fascination.I have realised now that part of historyrsquos appeal is the images it creates for us, of a time that is dferent to ours. No matter how many lsquofactsrsquo there may be, itrsquos our imaginative interpretation of them which makes this information interesting or fascinating.This is why archaeology can also be particularly interesting. Itrsquos a tantalising glimpse into the past but leaves lots of scope for our own imaginative recreations. This connects to the fact that we often hold fascination for things we have lost because we cannot physically experience them anymore.For me, this is the case every time I travel through the Hardgate in Haddington. Until the s, a building stood on the east side of the street, where now there is a small grassy park. Locals nicknamed the building Bothwell Castle, although it wasnrsquot a castle in the real sense, but an impressive town house owned by the Cockburns of Sandybed, hence its original name, Sandybed House. Old photos of it show it in a rundown condition even a hundred years ago, but still looking magnicent.Nobody now will remember what it looked like inside before its dilapidated state. A drawing of the interior from the s shows it had wooden ling, described as ldquoexcellent examples of native craftsmanship.The most prominent feature from the street was perhaps the circular stair tower, which also had the original entrance. It was this feature that made the building look like a castle, I reckon. Inside there was a sunken floor, two upper floors and an attic. It enclosed a courtyard and the building ran eastwards to the banks of the River Tyne.There is a scarcity of historical information about this building, which was demolished to widen the road, after ious attempts to save it failed.But there is at least one story which lights my imagination whenever I am standing in the small green park where Bothwell Castle once stood.It involves the notorious James Hepburn, th Earl of Bothwell, the man who murdered Mary Queen of Scotsrsquo husband Darnley and then married her himself, after seemingly abducting her.But the story takes place before all this, during the time when Maryrsquos mother, Mary of Guise, was fighting the Protestant Lords of the Congregation. Despite being a Protestant, Bothwell was on the side of the Catholic queen. He was young but one of the most powerful nobles in the land.In , Bothwell received information that a huge sum of money was being sent by an English nobleman called Sir Ralph Sadler to help the Lords of the Congregation. He lay in wait and attacked the carrier of the money, both robbing and wounding him.This act enraged the leaders of the Protestant cause and some time afterwards the leaders, the Earl of Arran and Lord James Stewart, headed for Haddington to capture Bothwell.The house he was staying in was close to the River Tyne. But he saw the soldiers approaching just in time and fled. He got to the river and waded along its banks until he reached Sandybed House.He knew he had likely been spotted and his pursuers were hot on his heels. So he entered Sandybed House by the back door. He could hear the shouts from the soldiers outside and knew he had little time to hide, but where He ran into the kitchen, where a spit boy sat turning the spit. There was not a moment to lose.ldquoQuick, gie me yer claes tae wear, Bothwell commanded. The young lad, unable to refuse an order from such a powerful noble, immediately obeyed. Bothwell, being a slim young man himself, was just able to slip them on.Then Bothwell sat by the fire and began to turn the spit, pretending to be the spit boy, whom he commanded to leave and to take his clothes. We have no account of the moment the soldiers entered the kitchen. It will have been a tense one. Bothwell will have felt the heat, both of fear and of the fire on his face and hands just a small and very short taste of the harsh le of a spit boy.The soldiers did not recognise that the spit boy was actually Bothwell sitting in disguise in the half dark flickering light of the kitchen. Servants with such a lowly status were barely even noticed anyway by the noble class. They were almost like part of the furniture to them.There is a story that he then fled to his castle at Hailes dressed as a woman. It is said he later rewarded Cockburn of Sandybed for not giving him away, but one wondersthe spit boy was also rewarded.I suspect not. However, I like to think he was somehow able to keep Bothwellrsquos clothes, and I wonderthe woman got hers back.No doubt the spit boy often told his story as he turned the spit, cooking it as much as the meat.Sadly, the kitchen where this took place has gone now, of course. But is it In , a community archaeology project was undertaken, part funded by the Peter Potter Gallery Monument project. Archaeologist David Connolly explains in a fascinating YouTube clip that the dig revealed parts of Bothwell Castle. He shows that the lintel above the door into the kitchen lies just under the ground. In fact, the remains of the kitchen are just part of a mass of archaeological finds in the Hardgate, going back to Medieval times.These finds are covered up now, butyou venture yourself to the wee park in the Hardgate you can still see the disturbed ground where they took place.And look closely at the wall by the road, next to the southern entrance. There is a strange curve in the wall here. Thatrsquos because the lower section of this part of the wall is in fact the remains of the circular stair tower of Bothwell Castle.A buddleia butterfly bush was growing by it when I visited last week, but my long-suffering family waited as I ventured under the bush to take a photo of what I believe to be the old stonework of the stair tower.I then told them the story of the spit boy as we sat on the location of the kitchen. The river is just beyond and as we left the park I couldnrsquot get an image of Bothwell dressed as a washer woman out of my head.As I say, history can be fascinating because it stimulates our imaginative interpretation!"},{"url":null,"title":"pipers-become-movie-stars-bands-unusual-new-calendar","story":"Haddington Pipe Band launches its  calendar this weekend, with this yearrsquos taking on a movie theme.The launch is at the townrsquos The Loft Cafe today , where the  shots that were taken for the calendar by photographer Paul Bock will be on show until January.Alastair Bruce, from Haddington Pipe Band, said: ldquoWe decided on a slightly dferent approach this time round and wersquove certainly had a lot of fun putting these shots together.ldquoOur inspiration was iconic film posters so, working with Paul, we have recreated and re-interpreted  well-known posters and given them all a piping and drumming twist, with band members taking the starring roles.ldquoWersquove also put a spin on the titles and the other text which featured on the originals.The group are recreating posters from popular movies including Braveheart, Trainspotting, Harry Potter, Chariots of Fire, The Sound of Music and Pirates of the Caribbean.Alastair added: ldquoItrsquos a pleasure to pay tribute to Paul Bock, who has done an absolutely fantastic job with the shots his creativity was unbelievable.ldquoAimee Colley of Shaw Marketing and Design also did a terric job creating the artwork and Lori Walker was a huge help in turning band members into film stars with her make-up skills.ldquoOf course, the real stars are the band members themselves!ldquoWe are also extremely grateful to the many businesses and organisations who have kindly sponsored the production.

In addition, through making these positive changes, Riverside has been able to provide more and longer advance bookable GP appointments.ldquoRiverside is growing our team of GPs and has successfully recruited seven new GPs over the last two years.ldquoThe practice is currently going through a period of signicant telephone and clinical systems upgrades that will not only address the limitations patients at the Riverside practice have experienced but will introduce a new low-charge  number.ldquoOnce complete, the upgrades, in line with the new way of working, will provide long-term benefits for all patients in the area.

Guy Madgwick, CEO of Red Rock Power, which owns Inch Cape, said:ldquoWe are naturally very disappointed that our Inch Cape Offshore Wind Farm project has not secured a CfD award.ldquoThe development is a culmination of over  years of hard work and signicant investment and could play an important role in both achieving the countryrsquos green energy targets and supporting economic growth.ldquoWe will now liaise closely with our supply chain to consider how best to move forward with the project, and hope to share an update as soon as possible.Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, which is pushing for a ferry and cruise terminal to be investigated for the site, said the decision raised questions about Scottish Ministersrsquo decision to call in the application.He said: ldquoThis is a very worrying announcement and puts a large question mark overRed Rockrsquos planned substation at Preston Links.ldquoAt the planning enquiry last year, Red Rock placed considerable emphasis on securing a funding subsidy from the UK Government and this decision also brings into question the wisdom of the Scottish Government calling in their planning application and bypassing the local democratic planning process.East Lothian Council said it had held talks with ICOL regarding the site following the announcement and further meetings would be arranged.A spokesperson said: ldquoWe understand [Inch Cape] are considering all options to allow the project to progress.ldquoWe will hold a meeting with them in the near future to discuss a way forward."},{"url":null,"title":"long-awaited-port-seton-sports-hall-works-last","story":"The new facility will be part of the Port Seton Centre on the area currently used as the childrenrsquos play area it will allow the community hub to offer a wider array of activities, including indoor basketball, badminton, tennis, football and gymnastics.Some of the existing outdoor play equipment is being removed from the area to facilitate the building works, though this will be relocated to a new play area where within the park, along with the installation of some new play equipment.Tom Reid, head of infrastructure with East Lothian Council, said: ldquoWe are all very excited about the construction of the new sports hall, which will be an excellent new facility for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton, complementing existing activity areas within the Port Seton Centre.ldquoWe do appreciate that there will need to be an element of disruption associated with the construction work, particularly as the new extension requires to be sited where the current childrenrsquos play park is located.ldquoWe expect to relocate elements of the existing play equipment where possible to the new area and this will be installed to coincide with the arrival of other play equipment in the coming months.ldquoWe recognise this means that there will be a temporary reduction in the amount of play equipment available within the park and we are grateful for the patience and understanding of park users at this time.

After  months, wersquove barely reached base camp, yet we canrsquot give up now. The gardens hereabouts are a constant reminder of how much there is to learn. Some of them are as lovely as Sissinghurst or Inverewe, and quite obviously require as much hard work. As a result, when neighbours meet, conversation is more likely to turn to brassicas and box blight than Brexit and the Backstop. Also high on the agenda are butterflies and bees, the absence or superabundance of rain, heat surges, the proleration of wasps, and the effect of all the above on the quality of their compost. If you chance to look up at the sky, someone will guess, to within a degree of accuracy, what the next dayrsquos temperature will be.This must be because, like gardeners everywhere, they are acutely attuned to the weather. Other than farmers, I doubt there is any single group more intensely aware of our climate, and the ways in which it is fast changing. For some of them, the young Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg is like Joan of Arc, fearlessly confronting the forces of destruction, and inspiring all of us to be more vocal, angry and proactive. If you have a garden, you cannot be unaware that when she says ldquochange is coming, whether you like it or not, itrsquos not a prediction for the far future. Change is already here. Indeed, serious gardeners are already taking steps, tree by tree, shrub by shrub, to mitigate or adapt to its impact.This became particularly evident last weekend at a Gardenerrsquos Question Time, run by Borders Organic Gardeners, in St Boswellrsquos village hall. The room was packed with people so experienced they cast Monty Don into the shade. A  of three experts, including this paperrsquos gardening columnist Dave Allan, held their nerve for almost two hours to answer a barrage of questions that ranged from how to deal with snails and slugs , and the best apple trees for a cold spot .Opinion ied on what tree to plant to replace a dying ash, but in answering, the alpine expert Ron McBeath said that all our ash trees will probably be gone within ten years. There would even be spores carrying ash dieback in the village hall where we sat, he told us, making a few of us shuffle our boots. It was an uncomfortable reminder that certain forces are beyond control, some bad situations irreversible. Other, thankfully less devastating, diseases were mentioned, heading northwards in our direction on the warming thermal tide. Above all, as Emma Emmerson, of Woodside Plant Centre near Ancrum remarked, everyone is noticing the ldquocollapsed seasons, and the challenges they present to making a garden grow as it did in the past.Concern in the hall was palpable. Gardeners are in the frontline of climate change, seeing in miniature what is happening in the world at large. The  discussion ranged over what we could do to help wildle and especially birds to thrive ndash cat lovers should lock up their pets ndash but in terms of plants, it would seem that we are approaching uncharted territory. Old certainties are no longer reliable.Sombre though it sounds, it was not an afternoon of gloom ndash quite the reverse. For a start it was a reminder of how much fun it is to grow things and, in the case of vegetables and fruits, to watch them ripen, before falling upon them with kne, fork and spoon. It was also an encouragement, for beginners like me, to get more serious. To learn that, across the UK, more land is covered by gardens than by nature reserves is to understand the humble back yard or allotmentrsquos place in a giant living patchwork. Each of these plots, and not just those abiding by organic principles, stands guard on the ramparts, defending the gate against attack.This mild month, with bees still nose-deep in our flower beds, and hedges quivering with sparrows, finches and tits with owls keeping us awake from the horse chestnut tree outside the window, hedgehogs rootling in the field we call our lawn, and a young woodpecker learning his trade on the telegraph pole by our fence, it becomes abundantly clear that the place you like to think of as your own is in fact shared with thousands of other creatures.That will not be news to those who have gone out of their way to help feed the birds. A recent survey showed that in Britain enough food is served to sustain  million birds every year. Species that were struggling  years ago are now making a comeback, among them goldfinches and nuthatches.Itrsquos a glimmer of hope amid the increasingly apocalyptic language around climate change. As the villagersquos green-fingered army shows, there is nothing egotistical or self-centred about people devoted to the upkeep of their borders and trellises, their fruit trees and raised beds. When Voltaire wrote, ldquoit is our duty to cultivate our garden he was not, for once, being sarcastic. A passionate gardener who, as he grew older, craved the simple le, he understood the deeper meaning to be found in tending your own patch. The upkeep of that little bit of earth results in spiritual well-being as well as a barrowload of juicy carrots. Those of us cheering on crusaders like Thunberg can still raise our own battle standard. It should be planted carefully between the raspberry canes or beside a clematis or, in our case, among the rampant, bee-friendly weeds."},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  Tories minimum wage shift shows politics is moving left","story":"And what better politician to apply the phrase to than Boris Johnson, accused of what has become known as ldquothigh-gate ndash that he placed his hand on a woman journalists leg  years ago. He denies it, of course. But for advocates of the personal is political, his casual conduct is of immense signicance.Similarly, language and the PMs use of military metaphors betray personal traits that are politically signicant. His resort to words like ldquohumbug and ldquoSurrender Act are supposedly windows into the corrupt soul of a misogynistic micro-fascist. I hereby claim , by the way, on the term ldquomicro-fascist, which is an extension of the idea of ldquomicro-aggressions, so popular on university campuses among people who believe tiny things matter a lot.But do they  The media is obsessed with language right now, and personal conduct, possibly because many of its practitioners grew up with the personal is political phrase ringing in their ears. Twitter cant get enough of this stuff, though its no slouch itself when it comes to aggressive language. ldquoRacist, Liar. Misogynist. Mendacious, philandering scumbag! were some of the more temperate reactions on social media to Boris Johnsons recent round of BBC interviews.But judging from the PMs relaxed and unruffled demeanour on Marr and the Today programme, hes not that bothered. His political advisers believe that most people are, rightly or wrongly, supremely indferent to the question of where the PMs hand strayed  years ago. And the preoccupation with language they find almost comical. People use military metaphors all the time, like ldquostick to your guns. Doesnt mean they want to kill you with cannons.Indeed,military metaphors are to be regarded as incitements to violence, then Sir John Curtice had better watch out when he next talks of the general election ldquocampaign being a ldquobattleground with ldquotarget seats, an ldquoair war and a ldquodecapitation strategy. Boris Johnson just makes jokes about all this synthetic outrage. Why  Because the politics of the PMs personal le and language plays well in the echo-chambers of Twitter, but not in focus groups, where people are bothered about pay, jobs, the NHS and Brexit, Brexit, Brexit.Im not so sure. Torsten Bell, of the low pay think tank the Resolution Foundation, takes it seriously and hailed it as ldquohugely ambitious. Sajid Javid says he is adopting their policy of a living wage set at % median earnings, to eliminate poverty pay in a decade.Now, they may not mean it. But it seems to me something pretty fundamental is going on undergrowth of British politicsthe Conservatives are even talking this way. The centre-ground has moved dramatically and suddenly to the left.Im not saying the PM has become a Marxist, but its striking that he has started to use the language of Keynesian economics. It is rare enough to hear a Tory advocate higher public spending. But Johnson is now echoing Labours argument that low interest rates are a unique opportunity for governments to make massive investments in infrastructure, new hospitals, gigabit broad-band etc.When did you last hear a Tory PM make the case for what is sometimes called ldquoPeoples Quantitative Easing  Margaret Thatcher would be appalled at this abandonment of fiscal prudence and Javids talk of the Tories being a ldquoworkers party. Even Tony Blair regarded redistribution and deficit financing as ldquoold Labour.Of course, a lot of what the PM says is probably electioneering: offering jam tomorrow and bagels after Brexit. But it also marks a big sht in the electoral ldquobattlegroundIm still allowed to use that term. Its a tribute to the work of parties like Labour and the SNP who have rehabilitated social democratic policies after three decades in the wilderness.Indeed, the Scottish National Partys policies, on the ldquosocial wage, borrowing and taxation, are beginning to look distinctly conservative, with a small ldquoc. Jeremy Corbyns policies on nationalisation, public spending, Universal Basic Services etc. no longer seem so extreme.The great moving left show is taking us into very interesting political territory, where many of the dogmas of the neoliberal era, which began with Margaret Thatchers monetarist experiments, are falling way. Im not sure where Brexit fits into all this, but it has clearly been a catalyst. Pressure from the ldquoleft behinds in provincial England has provoked a fracturing in the ideology of the right.People are fed up with austerity, low wages, crumbing infrastructure. They want big changes, not just in the way politicians talk, but what they actually do. I cant remember a time quite like this. Andthe Tories are actually talking left, I want to hear more of it. I want interviewers to interrogate the PM about these policies, and not just thigh-gate because we need to know just how seriously to take this new language.The personal may of of huge signicance to some people, but we should never forget that the political is political too, and thats important for all of us."},{"url":null,"title":"rosemary-goring-women-need-support-partner-men","story":"Those of us unfamiliar with the English judiciary had probably never heard of her until a couple of weeks ago, but as the arc lamp of publicity was turned in her direction and newspaper profiles prolerated, every word Brenda Hale spoke was hoovered up. People were particularly fascinated, it seemed, in her arresting collection of jewelled insect brooches. Yet what has struck me is her advice on how a woman can reach the top of her profession.Lady Hale offered her hard-won guidance at the launch of a group called Cambridge Women in Law. A graduate of Girton College, she told those following in her footsteps that few females can reach the upper echelons of the male-dominated legal world entirely by their own efforts. For starters, they will be battling against an engrained masculine sense of entitlement that puts them at an immediate disadvantage. Even more signicant, however, is their domestic situation. ldquoProbably the most important thing when you are making your way as a woman in the law is to choose the right partner, she said, doubtless making some of her listeners delete their last text message demanding to know what time theyrsquod be home to make dinner.:Boris Johnson cant remember grope allegation eventTwice married, Hale was quick to note that her first husband as well as her second had been completely supportive. Despite all her intellectual and emotional capabilities, which in a perfect universe would catapult her and those like her to stardom whatever their personal circumstances, she was unequivocal. The choice of whether to have a le partner, and who that partner is, will prove vital to a womanrsquos advancement. Clearly, what holds for the law is equally true for other walks of le. Facebookrsquos chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg wrote, ldquoI donrsquot know of one woman in a leadership position whose le partner is not fully ndash and I mean fully ndash supportive of her career.You need only think of Philip May, acting discreetly behind the arras as Theresa Mayrsquos unofficial consigliere to see this principle borne out. While the PM negotiated the most dficult job in Europe, grafting into the small hours, and on call night and day, he provided the psychological underpinning, or scaffolding, on which she stood. That ultimately her plans imploded does not diminish the fact that without his bolstering presence, his enabling faith in her ability to carry on, she would not have had the mental strength to persevere to the bitter end.Finding a partner who will be wholly encouraging isnrsquot easy. Too often the romantic knot has been tied long before the pressures of a womanrsquos career begin to escalate. If by then a couple have children, it takes deep pockets to pay for household help and childcare while two demanding vocations are conducted at full throttle, or an unusually far-sighted and self-abnegating companion prepared to put their own job, and ego, into cold storage for a few years.Such iniduals do exist, but finding him or her, while in the first flush of youth, takes greater maturity than most possess. Conversely, by the time a woman is older, wiser, and more established in her role, the biological clock can be ticking so loudly it drowns out common sense when getting hitched. Add to this the fact that women in all-consuming careers, such as medicine, law or the media, tend to get involved with those in equally full-on occupations, with similarly vaulting ambitions.:Boris Johnson to make final offer to EU on BrexitLady Halersquos comments will have struck a nerve with many working women. You can picture them, conducting a silent audit on their partners over the toast and marmalade, wonderingthey fall into the category of clinging ivy or storm-proof trellis. Yet the evidence of those who reach the top has been there all along, and what this high-flying judge says should come as no surprise.As far back as the s the brilliant mathematician Mary Somerville flourished because her second husband recognised her talent and gave her space to pursue her ideas. She still had to make sure the children were cared for, and was obliged to drop everything when guests unexpectedly called, but by the standards of the day her spousersquos attitudes were truly enlightened. Pierre Curie was another such enabler, while closer to our own times there has been no more devoted partner than Denis Thatcher or George Clooney, each treating his other halfrsquos ambitions with absolute seriousness.Weary of being an invisible launch-pad, some women like to quip: ldquoBehind every great man is a woman rolling her eyes. Yet one of the questions Halersquos speech raises is whether or not men who aspire to be top dog are equally reliant on a partnerrsquos support. Could it be that, even in these more egalitarian times, women are more in need of a human coat of armour than men Like it or not, a high-powered position is not easy to sustain, whether yoursquore male or female. The toll on those at home is heavy. For true harmony, a household has room for only one stratospheric performer. Yet the back-up and moral support essential to someonersquos professional success is not the mundane business of stocking the fridge or doing the laundry, necessary though these are. Five-star house-keeping alone is not enough.If a partnership s like a Swiss watch, each cog performing its assigned role and never missing a beat, itrsquoll soon run into troublethere isnrsquot something more nourishing keeping it ticking. Surely itrsquos the deep emotional connection with a loved one, and the intellectual stimulation essential to a good relationship, that help a person achieve their best I will concede that most women probably need more overt confidence-boosting. Yet given the dearth of us at the pinnacle of whatever profession you care to name, itrsquos far too soon to know whether those who reach the uppermost rungs need more unconditional back-up from their partners than men. Personally, I canrsquot see why there would be much dference. For the moment, though, you could say that on this subject the jury is still out."},{"url":null,"title":"neil-mackay-apprentice-bake-off-says-middle-classes","story":"Thatrsquos what The Apprentice and Bake-Off are, theyrsquore just reality shows ndash but theyrsquore disguised as something .

You learn zilch about le and the people living ityou watch these shows.But this isnrsquot a diatribe against reality TV. I have come to praise the genre, not bury it. Irsquove long championed reality TV. I just donrsquot rate The Apprentice or Bake-Off as great representatives of the genre. The best reality TV gives viewers a glimpse of whatrsquos shting about in the tectonic plates of our world, how humans feel right here and right now, how society is changing, how peoplersquos lives and attitudes are being shaped.Reality TV is the very heart of popular, mainstream entertainment. I donrsquot think you can fully get to grips with the world unless you embrace reality TV and use it to navigate not just pop culture, but wider culture. If you think Irsquom mad, let me call TS Eliot in defence. Eliot, probably the th centuryrsquos greatest poet, was a huge admirer of the Music Hall ndash which was seen, a century ago, as the home of trash entertainment. Culturally, Music Hall was the Edwardian equivalent of reality TV. Eliot, though, believed Music Hall ndash with its iety acts, smut and sentimentality ndash was the truest representation of the society within which he lived. He felt that the Music Hall singer and comedian Marie Lloyd ldquorepresented and expressed something signicant about the spirit of the nation. Roll forward  years and Eliot could have been speaking about Big Brotherrsquos Jade Goody.George Orwell was also a fan of Music Hall. Many like him saw it as having a ldquoredeeming socialas it held a mirror directly up to ordinary le.Big Brother had more social signicance in a single episode than every series of The Apprentice and the Bake-Off put together. From the get-go it showed society changing when it came to sexuality and gender. It revealed chasms of racism in Britain, which were not being discussed. It showed up our culturersquos cruelty, pettiness, narcissism, stupidity and greed. Yes, of course, it was manipulative, gaudy, and loud ndash but so was the Music Hall. You have to accept the bits you donrsquot like to get to the juice within.I find it an endless source of irony that the people who binge-eat The Apprentice and the Bake-Off sneer like Jacob Rees-Mogg confronted with a Greggs sausage roll when mention is made of shows like Big Brother.For the best of Reality TV, donrsquot bother watching The Apprentice tonight. Watch The Circle on Channel . Itrsquos as noisy and day-glo as Big Brother, but itrsquos also the most compelling dissection of the effects of social media on human beings that Irsquove ever seen.The show sees a group of strangers placed in isolation and only able to communicate via social media. On social media, they can be whoever they want to be. The last series was won by a man pretending to be a woman. Contestants are allowed to post fake pictures of themselves, or lie and manipulate. This series sees one man pretending to be a single mother, and a middle aged woman posing as a laddish bricklayer.As in the online world, people immediately place all emphasis on appearance ndash the selfie rules ndash but no-one knows whatrsquos fake, whatrsquos true. Contestants are addicted to clicks and likes. They lose touch with the real world and real human beings. They become needy, nervous, depressed, obsessed. They fall foul of group-think. They fear rejection ndash they crave the love of the online world they inhabit.On The Circle the mere act of posting a good or bad picture can change how everyone thinks of you. Itrsquos about curating your le so others see only your best side, not the real you. People share personal information in a way theyrsquod never do in real le. Acts of kindness are phoney and virtue-signalled. Everything comes with a hashtag and an emoji. Everything is manipulated. And when reality finally breaks in and the contestants meet each other in real le theyrsquore nothing like their digital selves. We see the real them ndash honest, shy, decent hellip normal.This is reality TV which explores the new reality in which we live: a phoney, empty, dumbed-down world thatrsquos a bit like an episode of The Apprentice or Bake-Off.Neil Mackay is Scotlandrsquos Columnist of the Year"},{"url":null,"title":"lib-dem-mp-rather-no-deal-brexit-jeremy-corbyn-pm","story":"Jamie Stone, the partyrsquos Scotland spokesman, seemed to say hewould choose no-deal ldquoevery time over handing the Labour leader the keys to Number .Labourrsquos shadow Scottish secretary Lesley Laird said Mr Stone had ldquolet the mask slip.:Mark Smith: Why on earth do so many people have a problem with Jo Swinson However, Mr Stone later insisted he had been misunderstood and was actually responding to an earlier question in which he had been asked to say which was worse, no-deal or Mr Corbyn as PM.Ms Laird said: ldquoDespite the spin about being a new and invigorated party under Jo Swinson, they [the Lib Dems] are the same party that inflicted austerity on the country and they are now willing to inflict a no-deal Brexit on the country.\"Labour has been saying for months that the Lib Dems would rather a no-deal Brexit than for Jeremy Corbyn to become interim Prime Minister.\"A no-deal Brexit would be a catastrophe for working people across the UK.

The labels specy what can be recycled at kerbside and give details of where more information can be found.Crews will aim to cover all recycling bins by the end of the month, but stickers will also be available for residents at household recycling centres .More information about recycling can be found on the council’s website, from checking recycling bin day to an A-Z recycling guide and what happens to the materials afterwards.Councillor Peter Argyle, chair of the infrastructure services committee, said: “Recycle Week is a great opportunity for householders to make a positive contribution to Aberdeenshire’s recycling efforts. “We hope the information provided during the week will encourage residents to make a push towards increased recycling rates.”For a complete guide on the materials that can be recycled in Aberdeenshire, see the A-Z guide at http:bit.ly AshireAZ.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Guide Dogs are fundraising throughout October to fund the cost of training seven puppies, like six-week-old Goldie.\"  Month-long appeal to fund the cost of new guide dogs viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"For any queries about recycling, visit Recycling and Waste Aberdeenshire Facebook page or email the team atwaste@aberdeenshire.gov.uk."},{"url":null,"title":"these are the top 10 predicted dog names for 2020","story":"These are the top  dog names which are predicted to be popular next year according to Tasty Bone, soyoursquore looking for inspiration therersquos plenty to choose from.

Spending on these ads, often targeted to specic groups, has totalled more than £. million since last October.And while much of the attention has focused on the big parties and pressure groups on either side of the Brexit ide, the data also reveals the thousands of adverts placed at a local level, often seeking to influence constituents on what can appear to be seemingly mundane neighbourhood issues.Under new rules Facebook introduced in October , anyone placing a political advert must declare who paid for it.Our investigation identied around  ads on the pages of local politicians and councils which were run without these disclaimers – including  placed on behalf of sitting MPs.There is no suggestion that any of the adverts had been deliberate attempts to deceive constituents. They were all found and removed by Facebook.Most adverts placed by or on behalf of Scottish MPs from October  to September , , were for amounts less than £.There were a few exceptions – £ spent by Gordon Conservatives, £ by Lib Dem leader and East Dunbartonshire MP Jo Swinson, £ by Angus Conservatives, £ by the Perth and Kinross Conservative Association, £ by Linlithgow MP Martyn Day, and £ by the Conservative Party.For MSPs, the majority also spent sums less than £ promoting material on Facebook.The exceptions were former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson , Anas Sarwar , Johann Lamont , Liam Kerr , Alex Rowley , Alexander BurnettPeter Chapman , Beatrice Wishart , Richard Leonard , and West Lothian Courier Partners .Two Scottish local authorities spent money with Facebook – City of Edinburgh Counciland the SNP Group on North Ayrshire Council .data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.carlukegazette webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Wallace Day  Aug\"  Braveheart spiritlives on in Lanark viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"CARL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"CARL | Article Teaser\"Two Scottish politicans each had a Facebook advert removed as it appeared without a disclaimer – Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East MP Stuart McDonald and Martin Docherty-Hughes, MP for West Dunbartonshire.Unsurprisingly the biggest spenders on Facebook over the past year have included ious Brexit campaigns – People’s Vote UK , Best for BritainandBritain’s Future .Production company Slainte Media spent £, promoting former First Minister Alex Salmond’s televisionchat show.A Westminster Government spokesperson said: “There should be greater transparency in political advertising, which is why we have already pledged to introduce the requirement for digital election material to be clearly branded.

This OpenRoaming technology is being trailed in the county as part of the UK’s most ambitious testbed for connectivity in rural areas, in a project that aims demonstrate the potential and practical use cases that connectivity could bring to rural businesses.CloudNet, is enabling Orkney residents and tourists to use Cisco’s OpenRoaming services across key locations on the island including the ferries, ports, piers, distilleries and libraries. The trial is testing how handsets can provide a frictionless connected experience for residents and tourists in Orkney. G RuralFirst’s public Wi-Fi access network in Orkney is the first of its kind to support OpenRoaming in a live trial environment.OpenRoaming aims to combine the convenience of roaming with Wi-Fi connectivity. Users’ identities are authenticated once before they can access Wi-Fi without needing to login or register again. By linking access providers such as public venues, retailers, ports and offices, together with identity providers, such as carriers, devices and cloud services, OpenRoaming offers mobile users frictionless Wi-Fi onboarding.“OpenRoaming will change the way we connect to Wi-Fi and presents new opportunities for providers in a world where we expect high quality ubiquitous broadband access where ever we go,” said Dez O’Connor, Cisco and project CTO, G RuralFirst.“Customers tell us that Wi-Fi onboarding is a major pain point and there is a perception that it can be unreliable and insecure. OpenRoaming will transform the experience of using Wi-Fi into a seamless and positive one. As well as improving the connected experience for industries like tourism in Orkney, venues providing Wi-Fi to their customers will be able to use it as a means of engaging with them.”He added, “This trial shows the benefit of seamless connectivity in one of the most complex, challenging environments. It lays the foundations for many new WiFi solutions as our most innovative customers and partners join us to develop access networks and identity provider services across the UK and the rest of the world.”Around , tourists visit Orkney every year, making it a signicant contributor to the local economy. By making OpenRoaming services available to tourists, the G RuralFirst project aims to provide a fully connected experience for visitors to Orkney as well as its residents. Furthermore, Cisco say that there is a commercial opportunity for local tour operators and cruise ships through selling Wi-Fi packages which leverage OpenRoaming and augmented reality tourist applications across the island.The technology is also being used to support connected tourism by promoting Orkney Origins, an augmented reality app developed as part of G RuralFirst. The app provides digital tour guides of Orkney’s historic and picturesque sites via tourists’ smart devices, at access points. Tourists are able to download the app on the spot through OpenRoaming, rather than in advance of arriving, and be guided by digital avatars, creating a more memorable tourist experience and narrating the unique history of the Orkney Islands.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

As well as a straightforward lsquomacrorsquo analysis, where the fatberg samples were melted to see what they revealed ndash which included incontinence pads,  teeth and sanitary products ndash the teams also used state-of-the-art equipment to study the fats, particles, fibres and microbiological DNA included in the material.Scientists from the Greenpeace laboratory, based at Exeterrsquos Streatham Campus, also looked at the chemical composition of the fatberg for their own analysis.The results suggested that the fats found were more in keeping with domestic food preparation than commercial food outlets, while the chemicals were those found in personal care products, rather than pharmaceuticals or pesticides.They also found no evidence of harmful viruses or bacteria ndash offering reassurance given the importance of Sidmouthrsquos bathing waters to the local community and tourists alike.Andrew Roantree, from South West Water, added: ldquoAlthough we deal with around , blocked sewers every year, the Sidmouth fatberg was by far the largest discovered in our service history.ldquoWe wanted to learn as much as we could about it, how it was created and what it was made of to help us avoid further fatbergs in future.ldquoThe results confirm our suspicions, that fat and non-flushable products such as wipes are the main culprits, and that fatbergs are a consequence of the inidual and collective impact that our behaviour has on our environment.ldquoWe will be using these results to help us education, inform and change the behaviours of people in terms of what they are putting down the toilet and sink.

It is proven that the steel of the fish farm cages draws many Ashrai to the surface, with only one result: They melt.It also warns that male fishermen working on the farm may be in danger as the fairies ldquowill attempt to lure him with promises of gold and jewels into the deepest part of the ocean to drown or simply to trick him.The document, signed ldquoon behalf of the Flodigarry Fairies by the ldquoFriends of the Eilean Fhlogravedaigearraidh Faeries, adds that what appear to be seals living on the island are actually roanes - water elementals or mermen who take the form of seals - which could be in danger of being shot by salmon farmers. Meanwhile, gnomes and water birds called broobries may also be in danger.It also threatens that water spirits known as the Blue Men of the Minch could cause adverse weather conditions for fish farmers.It says: ldquoThey have told they will protect their gentler Flodigarry neighbours against any fish farm as they were there already in the beginning of time and they have always done so. The Blue Men of the Minch have predicted that there could be some severe stormy weather in the future but declined to explain further at this stage.No consultationFinally, the objection focuses on the fact that the farm would block ldquotwo fairy paths underwater and objects to the fact that the fairies have not been consulted on the issue.The application, lodged in July, states that it is for a ldquonew Marine Fish Farm for Atlantic Salmon consisting of  x m circumference circular cages in an m mooring grid with associated feed barge.

That will certainly catch Mr Trumprsquos attention and make clear that this attack on the Scottish economy, over a dispute which has nothing to do with us, is not acceptable.US tarfsThe tarfs are set to be imposed by the US after the World Trade Organisation ruled in May that Europe illegally subsidised planemaker Airbus, which hurt its American competitor Boeing.The ruling gives the Trump administration the legal right to impose counter-measures on the EU in the form of tarfs, and products targeted include wine, cheese and olives, which are produced in many countries involved in the Airbus consortium. Brussels has threatened to retaliate similarly against US goods, but the EU has said it hopes not have to resort to that. In Scotland, other goods which would be affected include cashmere, cheese and seafood.A Number  spokesman said that the UK government was \"disappointed\" the US had resorted to tarfs, which were \"not in anyones interests. The UK is working closely with the US and the EU to support a negotiated settlement to the Airbus and Boeing dispute, and to avoid these tarfs from coming into force.\"The UK, through the EU, is seeking confirmation from the WTO that we have complied fully with their rulings regarding support to Airbus and should not be subject to tarfs.\"The spokesman added that despite the tarfs affecting Scotch whisky but not Irish whisky, the dispute had \"nothing to do with trade discussions\" with the US after Brexit.However a spokesman for the First Minister said that the tarfs \"undermined the UK government argument that one way to offset the challenge of Brexit would be a very quick, comprehensive, trade deal with the US, its clear the US isnt in a mood to exempt the UK or Scotland from these tarfs.He added: \"This is the hard reality that the US plays hardball on these issues and is not prepared to exclude the UK because of whats been said between Trump and Johnson. The suggestion of a free trade agreement post-Brexit is pretty fatally undermined by whats happened today.\"£bn export marketThe value of Scottish whisky exports to the US has grown from £m in  to over £bn last year, with a third of last years exports being single malts with a value of £ million. The US market accounts for . per cent of global volumes of Scotch whisky exports, with  million bottles of whisky exported to America in .Karen Betts, chief executive of the Scotch Whisky Association, said the tarfs were \"a serious situation for the industry\". She added: \"We heard overnight that a  per cent import tarf will be imposed on all single malts into the United States and also all Scotch whisky liqueurs, and thats from a position of zero.\"Weve had a zero tarf on imports to the United States for the past  years, so this is quite a hike.\"She added: ldquoThe tarf will undoubtedly damage the Scotch whisky sector. The US is our largest and most valuable single market, and the tarf will put our competitiveness and Scotch whiskyrsquos market share at risk. \"We are also concerned that it will disproportionately impact smaller producers. We expect to see a negative impact on investment and job creation in Scotland, and longer term impacts on productivity and growth across the industry and our supply chain.We believe the tarf will also have a cumulative impact on consumer choice.\"We believe it is imperative that the EU and US now take urgent action to de-escalate the trade disputes that have given rise to these tarfs, to ensure that these latest tarfs are not implemented on October , and to ensure that other tarfs ndash including on the export of American whiskey to the EU ndash are removed quickly. In particular, the UK government must now work with both sides to urge a negotiated settlement and to ensure that these damaging tarfs do not take effect.Serious blowScottish Labours finance spokesperson, Rhoda Grant MSP said: ldquoThis will be a serious blow to the Scotch whisky industry. Peoplersquos jobs and living standards should not be put at risk because of a dispute between politicians.ldquoIt is no surprise Donald Trump doesnrsquot care about this. He has spent his whole le using his inherited wealth and power to exploit working people. The UK Government must do all it can to ensure the United States reverses this decision.Scottish Conservative shadow finance secretary Murdo Fraser said: ldquoThis is obviously a very serious blow to the Scotch whisky industry. We will be speaking to our colleagues in the UK Government to see what can be done to sort this out.\"Ultimately, the responsibility here lies with the EU as it stands, and they are the ones who will need to explain to the sector why this has happened. This is something that needs to be resolved as a matter of urgency.Liberal Democrat Scottish Affairs spokesperson and MP for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross Jamie Stone said the tarfs \"will be a bitter blow to the Scotch whisky industry and deeply damaging to peoplersquos jobs on both sides of the Atlantic.\"He added: ldquoThe EU remains the largest export region for Scottish whisky and rather than turning our back on it we need to maintain frictionless trade. Instead the Government is creating barriers with our largest export partner.ldquoThe distilleries in my constituency are already worried by the Governmentrsquos plans to pursue a hard Brexit and Trumprsquos decision adds more concerns to the future of the Scotch export market.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"queen sought advice on sacking prime minister source claims","story":"The monarch reportedly asked aides for first time in her reign just how and when should could dismiss a PM.The Queen sought advice on the circumstances in which she could sack a prime minister ahead of Tuesday’s incendiary Supreme Court ruling, i has been told.A source claims that the monarch asked her aides for the first time for clarication on just when and how she could dismiss a prime minister who refuses to step aside.The alleged consultations reinforce suggestions that the monarch and her most senior aides had deep concerns about Boris Johnson’s decision to prorogue Parliament, even before the country’s most senior court was asked to declare the move unlawful.It was reported on Sunday that Mr Johnson phoned the Queen to personally apologise for the embarrassment caused by the crushing Supreme Court ruling that he had acted unlawfully when he advised the monarch to suspend Parliament for five weeks - advice which she was obliged to accept.: Johnson refuses to confirm he apologised to the Queen​ Constitutional crisisi has now been told that the Queen personally asked for advice on the constitutional circumstances in which she can effectively sack a prime minister.Under the rules of the British constitution the Queen can only \"advise, encourage and warn\" ministers. It is suggested that the monarch has sought her own advice on the circumstances in which she could dismiss a prime minister. Columnist Ian Birrell reports in Monday’s paper: “One well-placed source told me the Queen had, for the first time in her reign, sought advice on sacking a prime minister before the Supreme Court verdict.”Buckingham Palace said on Sunday that it did not comment on rumours.It is understood that while there have been discussions between Downing Street and the Palace about the constitution and the Queen’s role, it would not be the case that the monarch would take it upon herself to dismiss a prime minister or advise him or her to step down.However, i understands that any discussions did not relate to an active attempt by the Queen and her most senior advisors to sack Mr Johnson.: Why the Queen made an error of judgement on proroguing Parliament – Joyce McMillan Legal positionHaving been embarrassed by the Supreme Court’s ruling that the prorogation of Parliament was unlawful, it is likely the Queen would not want to be caught out again, and would want to know her exact legal position should she be approached by opposition MPs in the event of Mr Johnson refusing to step aside after losing a vote of no confidence.It is a quirk of the British constitution that the Queen retains a number of personal discretionary powers which include the right to appoint the prime minister and other ministers. A House of Commons select committee established in  that these powers also include a right for the sovereign in a “grave constitutional crisis” to act contrary to, or even without, ministerial advice.The Queen has been dragged into a constitutional crisis by Boris Johnson over decision to prorogue ParliamentConstitutional experts are indeed ided on the exact circumstances -any - in which the Queen could remove a sitting prime minister.In the event that Mr Johnson lost a vote of no-confidence in Parliament, there would follow a -day period in which MPs can vote to put forward a candidate to replace him.Drag out proceedingsSome experts believe that only in the circumstances in which it could be shown by Parliament that an alternative prime minister can muster a majority, the Queen could require Mr Johnson to resign.Others, however, argue that the Fixed Terms Parliament Act allows a sitting prime minister to recommend an election date after that -day period and therefore Mr Johnson could drag out proceedings in the absence of a clear power for the monarch to dismiss him.The Queen has hitherto scrupulously avoided the use of any of her discretionary powers unless explicitly advised to do so by ministers.She has also been careful to avoid being seen to adopt a position on any political matters. Consequently, the claim by David Cameron that he sought the Queen’s intervention during the Scottish referendum campaign has been reportedly the source of further displeasure in Buckingham Palace.This story originally appeared in the i. ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scotland becomes first part of uk to ban smacking of children","story":"The Scottish Government last night pledged to lead a public awareness campaign along with police and social work chiefs.Read more: Last-ditch bid to halt Scotland smacking ban as MSPs prepare to pass lawMorag Driscoll, the Law Society of ScotlandrsquosFamily Law Committee convener, said the legislation brings Scotland in line with commitments under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.Read more: Smacking ban lsquosends clear message physical punishment isnrsquot acceptablersquoBut she said: ldquoDriving meaningful behavioural change requires much more than changing the law. ldquoNow is the time to move on from the idea that violence against children can be justied.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"prestwick airport waiving fees for us military aircraft","story":"The state-owned Glasgow Prestwick Airport is waiving service fees for inbound US military aircraft as part of an alleged practice designed to increase traffic at the beleaguered airport and safeguard its lucrative commercial relationship with the US Defence Department, multiple sources familiar with its operations have told The Scotsman. The heavily-indebted airport, which is at the centre of a US Congressional investigation over the US military’s financial ties with Prestwick and President Donald Trump’s nearby Trump Turnberry resort, is alleged to have waived the so-called service fees for several hundred flights by branches of the US Armed Forces.Sources with direct knowledge of US military business at Prestwick said the cost to the airport and, as a result, Scottish taxpayers, runs into seven figures. “Scottish taxpayers are picking up the tab for the largest and wealthiest military force on the planet,” one explained.The airport, a publicly-owned asset which is operated on a fully commercial basis, has repeatedly declined to answer a series of questions put to it by The Scotsman regardingthe allegations it is waiving the service fees. The US Embassy in London also declined to confirm whether it was aware of the allegations.But Patrick Harvie MSP, co-leader of the Scottish Greens, called on the airport’s relationship with the US military to be “suspended at once.”He said: “In light of these staggering allegations that the Scottish Government owned airport is giving freebies to the US military, ministers must urgently explain how on earth they have allowed this to happen.”The hub was putup for sale by the Scottish Government in June. A new buyer is expected to be announced shortly. It is running at an annual loss of £.m and is reliant on £.m in loans from Scottish ministers. The US Armed Forces budget stands at £bn. Congressional investigation The South Ayrshire airport does not publicly disclose the exact cost of the service fees it ordinarily charges, but several sources indicated the charges in question would reach around £, for larger aircraft such as Boeing C- Globemaster III military transports, with the fee falling to around £ for smaller aircraft such as C- Gulfstream jets. The allegations facing the airport will likely draw increased scrutiny from both sides of the Atlantic at a time when the powerful House Oversight and Reform Committee in the US Congress is investigating US military payments at both Prestwick and Trump Turnberry amid concerns of “serious conflicts of interest” and potential violations of the foreign emoluments clause of the US constitution.Sources with knowledge of Prestwick’s in-house fixed base operationsbusiness said the alleged waiving of the service fees has been taking place since around  to  with the full knowledge of senior management. One senior source familiar with the airport’s military business said that the decision to waive the fees was made to ensure the troubled hub was seen as competitive in the eyes of the US military, and protect a lucrative multimillion pound refuelling deal with a US Defence Department agency. As revealed by The Scotsman in June, the Defence Logistics Agency , a Virginia-based body which manages the global supply chain for the US Army, Navy, and Air Force, has paid Prestwick nearly £m to refuel aircraft since October . The House committee launched its investigation in June, writing to Pentagon to demand the release of spending records and communications between the US Defence Department and Prestwick and Turnberry. The Defence Department has in turn referred the request for its communications with Prestwick to the White House. In recent weeks, The Scotsman has also revealed how Trump Turnberry was the only hotel named in literature distributed by Prestwick at closed door meetings with US military, despite the fact it is one of  hotels used to accommodate aircrews. The airport’s website was subsequently edited to remove several mentions of Mr Trump’s property, including in a section dedicated to military customers. Taxpayers ‘picking up the tab’ for US militaryOne source familiar with Prestwick’s military business explained: “I would suggest what’s happening is the Scottish taxpayers are picking up the tab for the largest and wealthiest military force on the planet. The US military crews pick up the fuel as part of the DLA contract, and that’s it. “It’s unnecessary. The US military budget is colossal and they don’t care what they spend. It’s just done to try and encourage as much traffic as possible to Prestwick.”Another source with knowledge of Prestwick’s operations confirmed: “The only charges the US military get are fuel costs. Everything  is waived. That’s on the basis the DLA contract is fairly lucrative and those fees should be waived.”The Scotsman can also reveal a series of other fees chargeable to US military aircraft are being picked up by UK taxpayers via the Ministry of Defenceas part of a longstanding reciprocal deal with the US Defence Department. While this specic arrangement - confirmed by the MoD - is little known, even within defence circles, there is no suggestion it is improper or flouts any laws. : US military fuel deal with Prestwick ‘kicked into long grass’ over Trump investigationIt is unclear exactly how many inbound US military flights have stopped at Prestwick in the past three years, but figures compiled by the US Air Forceafter it emerged the Congressional investigation was underway show its aircraft made  stopovers since the start of  through to August this year. The frequency of those stopovers have increased markedly over the period, rising from  in  to  in  and  in . There were  stopovers in the first eight months of this year. Last month, The Scotsman revealed how in August, a new, even more lucrative deal struck by the DLA with Prestwick to provide it with approximately . million gallons of aviation fuel through to the end of September  had been postponed.Costs run into seven figuresA source familiar with the deal said it had been “kicked into the long grass” as a result of the Congressional scrutiny. The DLA said the decision was unrelated to the committee’s inquiry. The alleged waiving of the service fees by Prestwick covers a range of goods and services that are routinely charged by the airport and provided by its FBO team. They include providing marshals, placing and removing chocks and crew steps, and transporting crews and freight. The exact amount that has been picked up by the MoD for the other fees is unclear, although those familiar with the costings claim the bill for the USAF flights that have stopped off at Prestwick in recent years alone would also run into seven figures. That arrangement sees the MoD picking up the cost of so-called landing, navigation and parking fees, and forms part of a reciprocal deal struck with its counterpart in Washington DC which sees authorities in the US pick up the bill for landing, navigation and parking fees whenever UK military aircraft use US airports. However, the economic parity of the arrangement is unclear, and depends largely on the amount of military traffic, and the types of aircraft. The Scotsman has also obtained information prepared by senior management at the airport as it attempts to stem losses before being ed to private ownership. It includes details of discussions to sell off property to a range of interested parties, including the MoD and the housebuilding firm, Persimmon Homes.Prestwick executives have also held talks with Sierra Nevada Corporation, the US firm behind the Dream Chaser space plane, as part of the airport’s ambitions to host a spaceport. A spokesman for the MoD confirmed it was picking up ious fees for US military aircraft at Prestwick.‘Reciprocal arrangement’ He said: “The UK does not pay handling fees for US military aircraft however, under a reciprocal arrangement, the MoD pays landing, parking and navigation fees for US military aircraft and likewise the US Department of Defence pays such fees for UK military aircraft in the US.”Asked about the alleged service fee waivers, a spokesman for the Civil Aviation Authority said airport charges in the UK were discretionary, and that inidual airports could apply “whatever charges they think appropriate to their ious customers” through commercial arrangements. He added that with the exception of Heathrow, airport charges are not subject to regulation.Glasgow Prestwick Airport declined to answer a series of questions put to it by The Scotsman about the alleged service fee waivers, including how it provides value for money to taxpayers, and whether any similar arrangement is in place with other military or commercial customers. Askedit or the Scottish Government was aware, or had any oversight over, or input into, the alleged waiving of service fees at Prestwick, a spokeswoman for the executive agency, Transport Scotland, said: “Glasgow Prestwick Airport is operated on a commercial basis and at arm’sfrom the Scottish Government, in compliance with European Union state aid rules. Ministers do not intervene in the commercial discussions at the airport.“The senior management team at the airport has been tasked with all aspects of taking the airport forward, including building on existing revenue streams. Glasgow Prestwick Airport has handled military and private flights since the s and it remains an important part of the airport’s business.” The USAF referred The Scotsman’s enquiry about the alleged service fee waivers to the US Office of the Secretary of Defence, who referred it to the US Department of Transportation. It was subsequently passed to the US State Department and the US Embassy in London.A spokeswoman for the embassy did not directly address the question of whether it was aware of the allegations that Prestwick was waiving the fees. She said: “The United States has reciprocal understandings with many nations, including the United Kingdom, whereby airports waive landing and parking fees for government aircraft.”: Trump Turnberry resort singled out in airport’s pitch to US military©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad ","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

Spectators got good value for their money and I think this has brought Antrim football up another level.“It was a nail-biting finish – exactly like the last one, two teams who were highly motivated and prepared.“The dference I thought tonight was that no team was prepared to concede. The character of our own team was great because we were trailing for long stages of the match and I think both teams were a bit wasteful towards the end, but the main thing coming out of this was the drama.”Portglenone boss Barry Dillon believes the GAA should look at the policy of replays going to shootoutsrequired as it places unnecessary pressure on players, especially at club level.He was full of praise for the efforts of both teams who again emptied the tank, so this evening’s second replay could come down to who has sufficiently recovered from Thursday’s exertions.“The rules say it has to be decided, but the chairman stopped in and explained his side of it, saying that boys don#t need to be put under that kind of pressure,” he said.“I wouldn#t be for frees in the first place. A game should be won on the football pitch and not by hitting frees.“If someone was to miss a free for either team in that situation, it would be a big cross to bear to miss out on a county final like that.#You couldn#t have written the way it worked out – nine-all after free-kicks and the county chairman intervenes.#It#s great to be involved in games like that, seeing boys giving their all and the two games have been amazing.#Thursday’s game came at a huge cost for Lámh Dhearg as Pearse Fitzsimons was stretchered off with a suspected cruciate knee injury.They are still awaiting confirmation on the extent of his injury, but he certainly misses out tonight.Both teams have had little time to recover ahead od this evening’s third installment of this semi-final saga, but there will be no backward step from either as they aim to join Cargin in Sunday’s final.“We just have to go back and prepare properly,” added Lynch.“We#re up for it, we#re not prepared to concede and inch and neither are they, so it will be another great game for Antrim football.”All proceeds of this evening’s game will be split between deterMND, Paul McKeever’s Cancer Focus NI and Friends of Cancer Centre."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"residents in stand off with contractors at glassmullin green","story":"CAMPAIGNERS opposed to the development of a new sports facility at Glassmullin Green have continued to occupy the space as contractors attempted to move on site this morning.Education NI has provided £.million for the project, which would see a G pitch, car park and pavilion built for De La Salle College.Work was initially due to begin on August , with Contractors Haffey Sports Grounds leaving the site following intervention from the Friends of Glassmullin Open Green , who have campaigned to protect the green space since .FOGOG have occupied the site for the past seven weeks and have opposed today#s attempts by contractors to begin work on the development.La Salle has previously faced accusations of failing to properly engage with residents, who have described the plans as a #land grab#.

customs union, were other potential ways to resolve the border issue.He said a fth theoretical solution, Ireland re-joining the UK, was never going to happen.“There are one in five ways that this can be done, and at least four of those would be acceptable to the Irish Government, but the best one is of course a backstop or some form of backstop, and that’s what we are trying to achieve,” the Taoiseach said on a visit to Sweden.On the prospect of a united Ireland, Mr Varadkar said: “There probably isn’t a majority for that at the moment, although some opinion polls would suggest there is.”Commenting on the likelihood of the UK staying in the EU, the Taoiseach added: “All the polls since Prime Minister Johnson became prime minister suggest that’s what the British people actually want, but their political system isn’t able to give them that choice.”Later, Ireland’s deputy premier said the island of Ireland was not ready for a poll on unication.Simon Coveney warned that such a debate would create more isions at a time when the focus should be on the post-Brexit arrangements.Mr Coveney, addressing the parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee in Dublin, said it was not the time for a border poll.“But all of the isions that flow from that, and the calls for more radical change and so on in Northern Ireland, which I don’t believe we’re ready for,” he said. ”“So these are dficult times where we’re writing history at the moment for what the relationship between Britain and Ireland and the EU and the UK will look like for the next  years and we need to get it right.”He added: “Ultimately, we’ve got to make sure that we aren’t going back to a border on the island of Ireland being a political debating point again, and all that flows from that in terms of the corrosive impact on relationships and the disruption to trade, which has been such a reinforcer of normality and peace in the border region for the last two decades.“We want to work with the British Prime Minister and we’re working as part of Michel Barnier’s team.“We will do everything we can to try to get a deal In the next week or so.“But it’s got to be the right deal so that we don’t let people down and find that the border becomes the topic of debate in Ireland for the foreseeable future.”Mr Coveney added: “If we’re going to replace the backstop with something , it has to do the same job, which is to reassure border communities that they’re not going to face border infrastructure and the disruption in the future.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dup leader criticises dublins rejection of uks

We will not buy that.”Ms Foster added: “The Irish Government’s preparedness to dump the consent principle for their country’s expediency is foolish in the extreme and sends a very clear message to unionists.“From our  manesto to paragraph  of the December  Joint Report, the consent of the people of Northern Ireland for specic solutions has been key.“It is at the heart of the Belfast and St Andrews Agreements, yet the Irish foreign minister is now railing against it because it doesn’t suit his agenda.“There will be noto the flawed backstop.

He maintains any sexual activity was consensual and his lawyer, Donna Rotunno, has said she thinks “the case itself is weak”.It is safe to say that New York City is the least likely place on Earth where Mr Weinstein could receive a fair trialHarvey Weinsteins lawyersMotions to change the location of a trial are rarely granted, but Weinstein’s lawyers argued it should have been in his case given a “circus-like atmosphere” and “hysteria” fuelled by news reports and social media posts.In court papers, they noted that their client’s name was mentioned online on the New York Post’s gossip column Page Six more than , times.“It is safe to say that New York City is the least likely place on Earth where Mr Weinstein could receive a fair trial, where jurors could hear evidence, deliberate and render a verdict in an atmosphere free of intimidation from pressure to deliver a result that the politicians, the activists, the celebrities and the media demand,” the lawyers wrote.Assistant district attorney Harriett Galvin countered that Weinstein and his legal and publicity teams were fuelling some of the media attention surrounding his case.“From the beginning, the defendant’s lawyers have contributed to the media coverage they now complain about by making extrajudicial statements about the case, portraying the defendant as a scapegoat who has been targeted by the ‘Me Too’ movement, this employing the well-worn strategy of trying his case outside the courtroom,” Ms Galvin wrote in court papers.Weinstein’s lawyers filed the change of venue motion in August, just weeks before his trial was scheduled to get under way. At the time, prosecutors said the request was a “transparent attempt to delay the proceedings”.But the trial was delayed anyway after prosecutors had Weinstein arraigned on a new indictment so that they could bolster their case with evidence from actress Anabella Sciorra, who has accused him of a  rape.Sciorra, known for a role on The Sopranos, is not one of the women whose allegations led to criminal charges against Weinstein, but prosecutors have said that her evidence is vital to supporting charges alleging he is a sexual predator who committed sex crimes against multiple women."},{"url":null,"title":"derry public invited quiz karaoke holywell trust support honesty cafe","story":"The Derry public have been invited to a quiz and karaoke night in support of the Holywell Trusts Honesty Cafe this Friday night, September .The cafe, which is the first initiative of its kind in Derry,  allows people to pay what they can.  It has been warmly welcomed by locals for its inclusive ethos and has been running successfully for three months.It is based in the Holywell building on Bishop Street but people can also enjoy their lunch in the Garden of Reflection.There is no till but instead three honesty boxes so people can pay whatever they decide its worth or contribute what they can afford.  If they have no cash they can donate online on our website.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshWith many people in poverty who have to make use of food banks it is a positive scheme which relies on public generosity and kind-heartedness - something Derry people are known to possess in abundance.Customers are able pay it forward so that someone in greater need can eat for less or for freeneeds be.Antoin OHara who frequents the cafe has organised the fundraising event and would urge people to come along and donate what they can.The event begins at pm and people can bring their own refreshments."},{"url":null,"title":"foyleside student night set biggest best yet","story":" Magician Joel Mawhinney who will be performing mindblowing tricks to students on Foylesides Student NightThere will also be music from Q Radio, giveaways from Red Bull and VIP passes provided by Derry’s top student bars on the night to get students ready for some post-shopping drinks.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshTo keep the students refreshed throughout their shopping spree there will be popcorn, slush drinks, a pick ‘n’ mix cart and doughnut walls – there really is something for everyone!Fergal Rafferty, Centre Manager of Foyleside, said: “For this year’s student night, we wanted to introduce entertaining and collaborative activities to get the students excited and encouraged to make great memories with their new peers – as well as grab a few bargains!

The median age is under . Its a wonderful thing to see a new generation rise up and the first in my letime that % of marchers were women.\"I would put all my trust in the young women of Ireland to make a dference. I dont mean to be patronising but they are leaders of the future.\"Campaigns can rise and fall when the excitement passes but it is of the utmost importance that we stay on the same track because together we will save the climate, and world, for another generation.\"On Friday school pupils throughout the North of Ireland joined with millions of people around the world in staging protests.Some primary school classes, accompanied by their teachers, could be seen making their way to the city centre with placards carrying environmental messages.The iconic Free Derry Wall bore a stark message throughout the week. It read: “YOU ARE NOW ENTERING EXTINCTION ”, and encouraged people to join the environmental movement.By Saturday that message had been defaced by someone who scrawled \"globalist agenda\" underneath.The catalyst for the environmental movement is fteen-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg. Last year she protested for more than a month prior to Swedens parliamentary elections by sitting alone on the steps of the parliament building in Stockholm.Following the elections she spent Fridays there demanding the government undertake a radical response to climate change.She has since inspired a mass movement supported by people, young and old, around the world.On Saturday Derry people continued to champion her cause by carrying placards reading, The Sea is Rising and so are We and We Need to Change the Politics not the Climate.Linda O Sullivan of Friends of the Earth told an audience gathered in the Guildhall that we are facing an \"existential crisis\" and people \"need to be held accountable\".And Paddy Nash, musician and environmentalist, sang a song inspired by the Save Our Sperrins campaign against gold mining. Amongst its lyrics: \"Whats more precious than gold \"The land, the sea, the air that we breathe, thats more precious than gold.\"googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"mayor renews call back supporting people programme frontline workers","story":"The Mayor of Derry and Strabane has stressed the need for employers to “review their practices” and value the workers who are supporting some of the most vulnerable people in society.Supporting People Programme workers provide housing related support services, help people affected by domestic violence, those with addictions, families with child protection concerns, people in need of benefit advice and more.Earlier this year the local council unanimously backed a motion which recognised the work of frontline workers and called for an independent review into the programme, including terms and conditions of its workers.In a statement to the Derry News this week, Mayor, Michaela Boyle of Sinn Féin, reiterated the need to back workers: \"As Mayor I would like to voice my support for those involved in the Supporting People Programme, and stress the need to protect and respect the rights of frontline workers.\"This is an issue that affects so many people in the Derry and Strabane area who are dealing daily with the challenges of providing a valuable support service helping some of the most vulnerable people in our society.\"This matter needs to be urgently addressed and I would encourage those employers involved to review their practices and fully acknowledge the value of the staff delivering these much needed specialist services.\"Niall McCarroll, UNISON community branch chairperson said the Supporting People Campaign presented \"damning evidence\" to Derry City and Strabane District Councils Health and Community Committee.It detailed the outworkings of outsourced public contracts and the growing crisis within the Department for Communities and NIHE funded Supporting People Programme - \"a crisis which is impeding service delivery for vulnerable people and denying frontline workers the right to social justice.\"With specic reference to supported living workplaces, he said, the reality of outsourcing within the community sector is that some employers, unchallenged, choose not to value their frontline workers whilst garnishing a select few, who they deem worthy.\"The transfer of public services has many beneficiaries, however working class people are not included but rather excluded from benefiting from an honest days work.\"UNISON Community Branch activists are working hard and are committed to building a community wide culture of solidarity with regards the Supporting People Campaign and now with the direct involvement and support of the Mayor this solidarity focused campaign has become more dynamic and influential.\"The UNISON led Save the Foyle Haven Campaign began with the workers getting organised, the wider community mobilising in support and finally DCSDC joined the campaign through the office of the Mayor and collectively the workers driven movement protected jobs and a much valued and needed service.\"He continued: \"These are the fundamentals of any trade union movement campaigning formula, a blueprint for equality, integrity and the downfall of self serving governance.\"On behalf of our branch membership a UNISON delegation will now meet with the Mayor to deliver a list of human rights based questions, for both employers and all relevant statutory bodies to provide answers.\"The employers and statutory agencies will now be called in front of the DCSDC Health and Community Committee to engage in the UNISON led Supporting People Campaign as we focus on protecting the Supporting People programme and safeguarding frontline workers against corporate greed and those not fit for purpose employers who operate within this sector.\"The right of everyone to the enjoyment of just and favourable conditions of work is recognised in the United Nations International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, its time this same right was honoured and upheld within the Supporting People programme.\"UNISON would like to thank the DCSDC Health and Community Committee for the genuine support offered following the UNISON presentation to council and we look forward to working closely with them in the future.\"googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhoto: DCSDC Health and Community Committee and UNISON Community Branch Activists."},{"url":null,"title":"unique mix entertainment offer bishops castles michaelmas fair","story":"Barrel organ player, Dave Hill entertains crowds at this year#s Michaelmas Fltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtair.

The musket and a creative writing workshop as part of the course inspired Greer to write a poem included in the booklet.Course co-ordinator Shirley Lennon said it was a pleasure to coordinate it, explaining that the  participants came from erse backgrounds.ldquoI was fascinated to see how their learning developed over the course, Shirley said. Many discoveries were made and insights gained into the period but, more importantly, into our attitudes and opinions about this part of the past.ldquoBy choosing the title lsquoour shared historyrsquo for the booklet, the participants demonstrated a key part of the learning, showing how intertwined our past is. I was pleased to see friendships developing during the course and a sense of achievement in the creation of the booklet.Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Charlie Casey mdash who opened the conference mdashpraised the impact the PEACE IV project has had on the community.He said that exploring the legacy of the rebellion and the development of the United Irishmen provided participants with an insight into the heritage of their areas and into the very important topic of challenging preconceptions about history, in particular, the areas of shared and contested history.Cllr Casey said the event also provided participants with a chance to work together ldquoacross the community to discover their own stories and those of neighbouring and dferent communities.Further projects on Crime and Punishment in County Down and lsquoPreserving or Plundering rsquo: Museum Collecting from Hans Sloane to Modern Museumsrsquo will take place next year.

This opera will also be presented in Down High School, Downpatrick.DUNDRUM mdash Local councillor Mr Jarlath Carey is to meet local planners soon in an attempt to save a major housing project in Dundrum.Mr Carey will be accompanied by Newcastle councillor Mr Paddy OrsquoDonoghue, and Castlewellan councillor, Mr Eamon OrsquoNeill, who all condemned a refusal by planners this week to allow the project to go ahead.The project is to develop a -acre site to provide about  new private homes and it has been turned down because it is too big.The planners say the proposed development would be out of scale and character with the existing village and would be prominent in the villagersquos landscape.The have also said the site is outside the area considered suitable for future development in Dundrum.A planning spokesman told local councillors at a meeting on Monday that the bulk of new development of this type should be directed at district towns such as Downpatrick rather that to smaller towns like Dundrum.Mr Carey called on councillors to support a plea to planners to reconsider their decision and said he didnrsquot support the philosophy that larger development projects should go to larger towns.TANNAGHMORE mdash A landmark in the Tannaghmore district for the past century was thoughtlessly destroyed this week mdash not by vandals but by DoE workmen.The landmark took the form of a holly tree, which was shaped like an igloo, and had a seat cut inside it, but it was destroyed when workmen carried out hedge trimming operations in the area.The tree, referred to as the lsquoCourting Treersquo or lsquoCourting Denrsquo by generations, had been maintained for many years by Eddie Kelly. He took pride and delight in looking after the tree, and trimmed it three years a year.A feature in the countryside in the Tannaghmore Road area, the tree was once a rendezvous for the couples of yesteryear. The tradition was thatyou were first at the den, you were set for the night!Many couples fromthe nearly Castlenavan, Seaforde, Loughinisland and Drumaness areas visited the tree regularly, particularly around the turn of the century and after.Now, however, the tree is ruined. The hedge-trimming saw the tree almost dissected and what remains could never be trained back to its former self.This ended the lsquoCourting Treersquosrsquo legend and thatrsquos why residents on the Tannaghmore Road are angry mdash that canrsquot understand how the workmen allowed such destruction to take place.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Police in Ballynahinch are anxious to trace a lsquobogus doctorrsquo who entered the home of an elderly man at Magherahamlet and stole pound.The lsquodoctorrsquo, about  years old, average height, and slim build, was wearing a long, dark coloured coat when he broke into the house on Saturday afternoon. He was found searching drawers in the h ouse by the elderly resident, who is under doctorrsquos care, but he identied himself as a doctor.However, when he left, the man discovered around pound was missing. He contacted police, who believed the intruder was a lsquobogus doctorrsquo.BALLYKINLAR mdash A new training establishment has been set up at Ballykinlar to increase the skills of the Ulster Defence Regiment.This new instructional base will be used by full time and part time members of the UDR who will be taught to counter the increased sophistication of terrorist activity.The camp is staffed by instructors from the UDR, Regular Army units in the province and others from the School of Infantry at Warminster, and will be assisted by the RUC.

We are always the bridesmaid, never the bride. Not this time. We are walking up the aisle married to the cup, he enthused.ldquoFrom the start of the year the team have worked hard to get to where they are.

2019 Spa.jpg","title":"Spa resident’s delight after ‘nightmare’ over sewer issue resolved  ","story":"A CRUCIAL meeting has taken place to establish the scale of work required at a private housing development at the Spa to bring sewers, a sewage pumping station, roads and footpaths up to standard.Residents who live at the Carnglave Manor development say they have had to experience ldquonightmare conditions for the past six years and are pleased that the Department of Infrastructure is to formally adopt the estate, which will mean it will be responsible for its upkeep.In December , Stuart Boyd and his young family moved into the estate but what followed was years of ongoing drainage issues due to a fault with a pumping station, with the problem exacerbated by the fact part of the  year-old development had not been adopted by the relevant departmental bodies.Mr Boyd mdash whose family home sits in the middle of the development mdash is the first to be affected by ongoing technical issues with the water pump that regulates drainage, with Carnglave Manor also affected by flooding problems due to heavy rainfall which results in drains overflowing and sandbags being used to stop water reaching residentsrsquo homes.The frustrated resident revealed that within weeks of moving into the new family home, issues started to arise, with the first problem starting in the en-suite shower where water was not fully draining away after the shower had been turned off. Mr Boyd said he checked for blockages but discovered none.The en-suite toilet started to experience problems by not fully draining after flushing, with water rising to the top of the rim. Then a second toilet became affected with the same issue and could not be used.Mr Boyd contacted NI Water and was informed that the problem could not be investigated fully due to the fact that part of the development had not been adopted and that the issue was ldquohistorical.However, emergency action was taken for the problem to be resolved temporarily and the drains were cleared.A matter of weeks later, the same issue happened again and Mr Boyd made contact with the developer who informed him of a ldquoquick fix to resolve the problem.ldquoI was told by the developer that to sort the problem was to restart the sewage station pump by pressing buttons on an electrical , he said.ldquoThis worked fine over the years but became tedious as I had to do it so often. When my we was heavily pregnant with our third child two years ago the problem happened again, but the switch I normally pressed failed to work.Mr Boyd said repairs were then carried out and steps seemed to be taking place to adopt the street in Carnglave Manor. He was also concerned that despite being told a formal adoption would take place, nothing happened.The resident contacted Slieve Croob councillor Alan Lewis to investigate the issue and is delighted that things are now moving in the right direction as a result of him putting pressure on the relevant departments.Cllr Lewis described the adoption of Carnglave Manor as ldquoan immediate necessity for the progression of completion and resident safety and that the issue had been allowed to go on for too long. He said a process had begun to access so-called bond monies to carry out the necessary repairs.Cllr Lewis added: ldquoThere are a number of issues with the equipment which remain unresolved and NI Water and roads officials have been working in collaboration toward ensuring that bond monies paid by the contractor are utilised to ensure that necessary repairs are carried out which would bring the pumping station up to spec for adoption.The councillor said he was ldquohorried to discover Mr Boyd had been educated on the operation of the pumping equipment to ensure proper drainage which sometimes involved him walking down the street in the middle of the night to reset the electronic pump.ldquoI am also advised that residents have in previous years unblocked drains and battled flood waters they have been living in absolute horror. The purchase of a family home should be joyous, exciting and fulfilling. Instead, residents have had to endure misery, worry, stress strain and hassle.Cllr Lewis confirmed that due to frequent periods of heavy flooding in the development he has contacted Rivers Agency requesting flood maps to assessthe area is prone to or at risk of flooding and has asked Land and Property Services to explore the possibility of a rates rebate for Carnglave Manor residents.A spokeswoman for the Department for Infrastructure said she aware of the situation at Carnglave Manor and, as the developer had failed to complete the site to the appropriate standard, had initiated enforcement action.ldquoThis is with a view to carrying out the necessary works to bring the sewers, sewerage pumping station and roads footways up to adoption standard, she explained.The spokeswoman added: ldquoThe Department is meeting with Northern Ireland Water this week to fully establish the extent of defects in the sewers and sewerage pumping station. The extent and nature of this work will largely dictate the timeframe going forward..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd October 2019 Speeders.jpg","title":"Speeders ‘to face pupils in school trial’  ","story":"DRIVERS caught speeding past local primary schools could soon find themselves in front of pupils who will decide their punishment at a kidsrsquo court.As part of a radical new initiative being proposed by the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership, drivers caught speeding outside a school will be given the option of avoiding a fine by attending a special court where the judges are children.Motorists who do not want to participate in the initiative will have to pay a speeding fine and accept penalty points on their driving licences.The idea of kidsrsquo courts started in England and now is being trialled in Northern Ireland. After each appearance in front of their juvenile worships the offending drivers then watch graphic road safety videos featuring more children, with the goal to change driver behaviour.Those behind the scheme say itrsquos a simple but effective idea where PSNI road safety officers will liaise with particular schools about running kidsrsquo courts or teachers as part of road safety classes.When the go-ahead for the scheme is given, police turn up outside schools on the given morning and anyone they detect ndash as long as they are not travelling inordinately fast mdash will have the option there and then of appearing in front of the children, or taking the fine and penalty points.The PSNI is supporting the new initiative, which has proved successful in other areas, with officers hoping that meeting children face-to-face will change driversrsquo behaviour.The districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnershipis driving the change for an increased focus on road safety across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area with the emphasis on reducing speed to make the areas safer for drivers and pedestrians.And the organisation is fully behind the kidsrsquo court scheme which provides children with an opportunity to talk directly to drivers and send a very clear message about road safety.In addition to the kidsrsquo courts, other measures the PCSP wants to provide include a general road safety awareness campaign across the district, distribution of school safety signs and the installation of speed indicator devices.Local politicians describe the kidsrsquo court initiative as ldquoproactive and say that it will highlight to drivers the vulnerability of children aged between three and  who attend primary schools across the district.They say children will effectively be educating drivers who have exceeded the speed limit outside their respective schools to the potential of what could have happened. Politicians say the scheme is not trying to catch people out, but make the roads safer for everyone.Local councillors Oonagh Hanlon and Willie Clarke have welcomed the new initiative and hope people across the district will be more road safety aware. They believe that working with young people is a very effective way to deliver the road safety message.In addition, they also believe thatthe kidsrsquo court is successful in changing the mindset of even a few drivers it will help make busy roads outside primary schools much safer.Cllr Hanlon said she has been contacted by many primary schools in rural areas, requesting assistance with road safety around their respective locations.She said that with large volumes of children being ped off and picked up within short timeframes, the school run can become a ldquodangerous experience for young pupils in particular.Cllr Hanlon continued: ldquoSchool safety signs will be a visual reminder for drivers to exercise extra caution. Motorists caught speeding outside a primary school will be given the option of avoiding a fine by attending a special lsquokidsrsquo courtsrsquo where the judges are children.ldquoIn front of a  of young pupils, drivers will have to explain why they have broken the speed limit and itrsquos hoped that face-to-face interaction will change driversrsquo behaviour.She added: ldquoThis concept not only empowers our young people but also challenges motorists from a childrsquos perspective on why they would break rules which endanger their safety.Cllr Clarke said road safety was an issue he had campaigned on tirelessly over the years and particularly welcomed the introduction of speed indicator devices across the district.He added: ldquoThis has proved every successful in other areas in reducing speed and increasing safety on our roads..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/17333834.the-buzz-of-the-farmers-mart/resources/images/10496129.jpg","title":"bandstand baby witch","story":"Who are the members of your band and what instrument do they play How would you describe your sound What local gigs do you have coming up What is your favourite song to play and why What has been your biggest gig to date Any funny gig rehearsal stories Who are your major influences What inspires your songwriting What is your dream gig What is the best thing about performing Any last words This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

If the EU wants to insist on border check points on the island of Ireland that is a matter for them. There will be no internal UK border in the Irish Sea.”For the DUP to maintain that these new proposals are compatible with their previousstatements is to take the wider unionist community for fools. The facts are very clear. Northern Ireland would stay in the single market for goods, in an all-island regulatory zone. There would be additional checks for goods travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, which is clearly a breach of the UK’s internal single market.I have no idea what threats have been made or promises offered to persuade the DUP to accept these proposals, but I am very clear that they represent a complete abandonment of the DUP’s previous position that there should be no border in the Irish Sea. I am shocked that anybody describing themselves as a unionist would be not simply accepting but advocating a border up the Irish Sea. I do not know how any unionist can possibly stand in front of the electorate and say that. It is an outrage, and people need to think very carefully where we are going with all of this.If the NI assembly will have a role in whether or not to accept EU regulations, it will certainly not be a veto — there may be some form of consultation. But, lest some will claim that there will be an effective unionist veto over accepting EU regulations for a limited time period, may I point out thata decision of the assembly is needed to agree to that, then Sinn Fein and other nationalists will have a veto over whether or not we can get out of that regulatory regime when any time period would be agreed with Brussels. Is this what the DUP’s Brexit campaign was all about  I do not think they ever saw Northern Ireland being in such a constitutional mess. They have not thought things through.\"  \"  N.I. takeaway owner caught employing illegal immigrant - court orders her to pay back more than £, in criminal profits Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"These proposals are dangerous they clearly weaken Northern Ireland’s position as a full and equal member of the United Kingdom and regardless of whatever is going on with the DUP, the Ulster Unionist Party has no hesitation in saying so.Lord Empey, Ulster Unionist Peer, House of Lordstry catch  TrendingIts official -

Agri-food goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain would do so via a Border Inspection Post or Designated Point of Entry as required by EU law, building on the provisions that already exist to support the SEU. They would be subject to identity and documentary checks and physical examination by UK authorities as required by the relevant EU rules.says that:“Northern Ireland would also align with all relevant EU rules relating to the placing on the market of manufactured goods. This would reinforce the arrangements above by ensuring that regulatory checks can be implemented at the boundary of the zone, as appropriate and in line with relevant EU law, minimising the potential for non-compliance.The official UK government position articulated in this document therefore makes it clear that all goods coming into Northern Ireland will have to do so via border inspection posts.No regulatory border with the Republic, but one with Great Britain! Leaving Northern Ireland alone in the EU’s single market like this is totally unacceptable and it is staggering that any unionist would even countenance such proposals for a moment.\"  \"  Northern Ireland abortion law a breach of human rights commitments rules Belfast courtMan charged with string of offences after trying to sell stolen tools at Milton Keynes cash converter store Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Northern Ireland would remain subject to EU law, not British law, when it comes to the single market. Laws over which we would have no say a vassal colony of the EU. Does anyone seriously believe that nationalists will not use this as a pretext to argue that we would be better off with MEPs in a united Ireland We would remain under the European Court of Justice on all single market issues.While paragraph  commits the government to guaranteeing Northern Irish businesses and farmers continued unfettered access to the rest of the UK market it does not say that in reverse. In fact, it expressly says the opposite. Goods and services will be able to flow unhindered from Northern Ireland to Great Britain,but when they come from Great Britain to Northern Ireland they will be subject to checks — a key flaw in Mrs May’s proposals therefore remains.Under these proposals Great Britain can and will erge from EU single market rules, creating increasing severance with the rest of the UK.Evenone puts aside the very serious constitutional ramications of agreeing to these proposals, economically they make no sense.NISRA publish data annually as part of their Northern Ireland Broad Economy Sales and Exports Statistics.Its analysis of purchases and imports from trade partners split by goods and services for  showed that • The total purchases from Great Britain in goods was £, million while the purchases of services from Great Britain was £, million. • The total imports from the Republic of Ireland in goods was £, million while the purchases of services from the Republic was £ million. In fact, the total purchases in goods from Great Britaindwarfed the total purchases in goods from the Republic and the rest of the EU combined . So, for sake of easy access for £, million of goods from the Republic these proposalsfetter £, million goods from Great Britain — the very goods that stock our supermarket shelves and are part of the vital supply chain to our industry.Doubtless we will be told that these proposals are improvement on those put forward by Mrs May because it gives the Northern Ireland Assembly a say. But let’s consider that.Paragraphs  and  say that the Assembly and Executive must give their consent on an on going basis “before the end of the transition period, and every four years afterwards”. This is a recipe for instability, not stability.This plan creates a new crisis date —  — which you can see becoming the focus for Sinn Fein’s campaign for a unity referendum. It also gives them all the time they need to talk up the supposed clf edge and a new project fear focused around that date.At best it is very easy to see how  will see Brexit become the key feature of crisis Stormont talks.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ministers have attacked our independent judges. The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change. People are already suffering and nature, upon which we all depend, is collapsing. Governments need to be honest about this and act upon the crisis.ldquoWe were over the moon with the response from Penarth residents, who walked with us or cheered us on, the day really gave us hope that the message is seeping in and change can happen. Myself and others had been feeling quite down because climate change is scary, we are worried about our childrenrsquos futures. Lets hope this walk leads to more local action on climate change.The young people on the march also spoke about their concerns.ldquoI went on strike because people cut down rainforests just to be able to eat meat, said seven-year-old Mylo Kitchiner. ldquoIf we keep cutting down trees we wonrsquot have oxygen to breath. I want the government to stop people cutting down trees.

They must know that there are real-world consequences from dangerous language.I have many friends who took a respectful and dferent view from me on Brexit. Like the overwhelming majority of Welsh and British people, they are perfectly capable of expressing that view without resorting to threats, aggression or violence.We must all learn to disagree well, however robust our views and remember that we all share this country and this planet - and that we genuinely have more in common.Meanwhile, it has been another extraordinary week in these turbulent political times.After we had the shock news that I wrote about last week ndash that the Supreme Court had delivered a unanimous judgement that Parliament should not have been shut down by the PM ndash we were able to go back immediately.I was straight back to Westminster having meetings with colleagues, holding the government to account, and of course getting back to work not just on Brexit but on many other issues.I was able to raise concerns in the Commons on behalf of constituents relating to the Thomas Cook collapse, which has affected everybody from holiday-makers to pilots to holiday reps and retail workers in the constituency and to call for a debate on the incineration of waste.And on Monday, I joined Allied Steel and Wire Pensioners from the constituency, and others hit by pensions theft, to hand in a petition to the Prime Minister at  Downing Street. They deserve justice on their pensions and have my full support. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

As well as a straightforward lsquomacrorsquo analysis, where the fatberg samples were melted to see what they revealed ndash which included incontinence pads,  teeth and sanitary products ndash the teams also used state-of-the-art equipment to study the fats, particles, fibres and microbiological DNA included in the material.Scientists from the Greenpeace laboratory, based at Exeterrsquos Streatham Campus, also looked at the chemical composition of the fatberg for their own analysis.The results suggested that the fats found were more in keeping with domestic food preparation than commercial food outlets, while the chemicals were those found in personal care products, rather than pharmaceuticals or pesticides.They also found no evidence of harmful viruses or bacteria ndash offering reassurance given the importance of Sidmouthrsquos bathing waters to the local community and tourists alike.Andrew Roantree, from South West Water, added: ldquoAlthough we deal with around , blocked sewers every year, the Sidmouth fatberg was by far the largest discovered in our service history.ldquoWe wanted to learn as much as we could about it, how it was created and what it was made of to help us avoid further fatbergs in future.ldquoThe results confirm our suspicions, that fat and non-flushable products such as wipes are the main culprits, and that fatbergs are a consequence of the inidual and collective impact that our behaviour has on our environment.ldquoWe will be using these results to help us education, inform and change the behaviours of people in terms of what they are putting down the toilet and sink.

in the vicinity in assisting in relaying real concerns over safety at the crossroads.Mr Irwin said: “These additional works including the implementation of a mph speed limit and extra signage and road markings is very welcomed and I thank Transport NI for their continued efforts in this regard.”He continued: “There has been a high level of collisions at this location and I know that residents and road users generally have been really concerned that sooner or later a fatality will occur. “A number of improvements have been made in recent times however, worryingly, accidents still occur at an alarming rate. “Residents have been very proactive in their lobby and I have joined fully with them in continuing my lobby for improvements. “This is seeing results which is pleasing to see from a safety point of view,” said the DUP MLA.Mr Irwin said:“Additional signs have been erected including a speed limit and there are more warning markings etc to be added to all approaches to the crossroads.“And I am hopeful that this will help in alerting drivers to the fact that they must stop at the junction and wait until the route is clear. “I will continue with the residents to monitor

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals.

The company had been in talks to seek a buyer, with business advisory firm Deloitte being appointed. But this morning the -year-old family-owned firm has now entered administration. Around , of the firms , employees have now been made redundant. Unite addressed staff and journalists on Wednesday morning. The union has warned that up to , workers could be directly, and indirectly, impacted. Directors at the maker of the so-called Boris bus had been in talks with companies including Chinese giant Weichai and entrepreneur Jo Bamford about a potential sale. But talks broke down last week, with the amount of rent to be paid on the companys premises believed to be a stumbling block. Wrightbus, which was co-founded by Sir William Wright, has faced trading dficulties after a downturn in demand for its products. A spokesperson for the Wright family said: \"We are devastated at the news today that the company has been placed in administration by the Wright Group Board. Global changes from diesel to electric in bus technology have caused a sharp decline in demand for buses in the UK. As a shortfall became apparent, one of the steps taken was to move work from our Malaysia facility back to Ballymena to secure jobs here.\" \"These factors have resulted in signicant losses at Wrightbus which our family has been covering for over a year. This was undertaken to both protect the workforce and the engineering expertise in the company. It simply became impossible to sustain that level of support. \"We have worked hard to support the restructuring team based in Wrightbus, and we are confident that a buyer for the business can still be found. We would like to thank the bank for supporting the company over  years and in particular the last six months.\" \"Since it was established in  from a tin shed, Wrightbus has become a world leader in bus manufacture and technology, employing tens of thousands of people. The company has built a culture and tradition of expertise and innovation in the Ballymena area which is recognised across the globe. The production of the world-famous London Routemaster is just one example of the many achievements of the firm and we are hopeful that a new buyer will be found and that work at the factory can continue.\" Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, says \"news that Wrightbus has entered administration is a devastating blow to the staff, the manufacturing sector across Northern Ireland and particularly damaging to the Ballymena economy\". \"Businesses in the supply chain have been doing what they can to support the company over this past year in the hope the business can be saved. \"They to face some very uncertain months as they try to secure the money they are owed and replace the trade they have done with the Wrightbus. \"That wont be easy as theres a signicant cooling of demand across the UK economy as Brexit bites and buyers reluctant to make big capital purchases. \"The company have a great product and a very talented workforce. Hopefully the administration process will see the firm put back on to a firm footing. \"But in doing that, it is important to protect the SMEs in the supply chain.\" Michael Magnay and Peter Allen of Deloitte were today appointed as joint administrators to Wrights Group Limited, Wrightbus Limited, Wright En-Drive Limited, Wright Composites Limited and Metallix Limited. Mr Magnay, joint administrator, said: “It is bitterly disappointing for all concerned that despite extensive efforts over recent months it has not been possible to find a buyer who wanted to maintain the business as a going concern. “We recognise the Companies are crucially important employers in Ballymena, and this will be devastating news for those who worked there, their families and the town, which has already suffered from a number of manufacturing closures in recent years. We will continue to support employees through this dficult time. “The joint administrators will explore all remaining options for the business and assets, and would encourage any parties with an interest to contact them.” The Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Maureen Morrow, expressed her deep sadness following the announcement Wrightbus has entered administration. I am deeply saddened by this announcement and the loss of so many jobs. “Following requests from elected members, a special council meeting will be held on Tuesday evening at pm to discuss the emerging situation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jo-control-room_.jpg","title":"m green energy plan for northern ireland","story":"Posted on Thursday  September  by Ulster Business Northern Ireland’s electricity operator has outlined a major £m five-year investment plan for a green energy system here.

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.
