When one of the girls disappears, her sisters search for her in the forest. Moving elegantly between problematic depictions of authority, cruelty and loss, Walker scooped the award from an all-female shortlist, which was whittled down from nearly 200 entries.The BAME prize, now in its fourth year, is open to black, Asian and minority ethnic writers who have been historically marginalised by UK publishers, and is sponsored by the  and publisher 4th Estate.Niki Chang, judge and literary agent, praised “the story’s island setting – glimmering with magic, mystery and unspoken violence – and the narrative voice of its young protagonist.” She also admired “the story’s engagement with ideas of freedom, authority, cruelty and loss pulsated with the vividness of its characters’ wild surroundings.” Michael Donkor, judge and author, said: “A singular, haunting tale that stayed with me long after I’d read it. I loved and admired the richly evocative descriptions of the landscape, and the narrative voice so confidently pulled me into the unusual setting and family at the centre of the text. Very special indeed.”Walker was born in Toronto to a Jamaican-Canadian mother and a Gullah-Geechee father, and raised in Britain. She is a filmmaker as well as a writer, producing the short film Last Days of the Girl’s Kingdom that was broadcast on Channel 4’s Random Acts.At a ceremony on Tuesday night, Walker won £1,000 and mentoring with 4th Estate. Her story Deep Heart can be read below.We are always barefoot. I try to explain this to the police officers who arrive from the mainland. We’re quieter this way and we need to be quiet when we’re stalking wild animals in the pine forest. Heaven walks in front because she’s the oldest, then me because I’m the youngest, then Bluebird at the rear. When I tell the black policeman we were hunting, Heaven shakes her head. She tells him we were at home. He looks at me, then her, then back at me. We’re sitting at the kitchen table, the soles of our feet muddy and bleeding. Well, says the officer, which one is it?We trap rabbits and small birds and fish. We let the birds go mostly. We go crabbing down by the mud flats. I always make a joke of wiggling my fingers in the bucket and pulling them back before the crabs can snip them off. Bluebird finds it funny but Heaven always tells me off. We help pull the net when the adults go down to the beach but sometimes we sneak out to do it alone, even though we’re not supposed to. We’ve made our own net from scavenged rope. We’re more or less self-sufficient, which is better for Bibi and Grandaddy.Our grandparents are really too old to be looking after us anymore but it can’t be helped. They have to be our parents now, because the ones we were born with are gone. Our real daddy walked into the woods one day and became an oak tree. Soon after that, our real mama just turned into light and dust in the garden, right in front of our eyes. I was too young to remember but I was there, we all were. Heaven and Bluebird said her skin came away like ribbons cut from rainbows. Bluebird said she looked at peace. Heaven said her face was full of fear. I was swaddled against our mama’s back so that when she turned I fell to the ground and cut my head on a stone. That’s where I got this scar.When I asked Bibi if all this was true, she said, Sure enough, I came outside and there you were, lying in the dirt with your head split open, blood everywhere, your mama gone and your sisters looking at me dumb as rocks. When I asked Grandaddy about it, he just shrugged and said, Your mama and daddy got free.Bluebird goes missing when we’re in the forest. We’re tracking a deer. We’ve never caught a deer on our own before. We aren’t really supposed to hunt big game because the government designated the whole island a nature reserve, but we’re hungry and there’s been no grocery barge for weeks because it’s tropical storm season. Every day we eat microwave burgers with bright plastic cheese and washed lettuce from Bibi’s patch in the garden. We want real meat. I’ve been dreaming about eating raw flesh.We’re deep in the forest when Heaven looks over her shoulder, past me, and says, I heard Grandaddy talking about you.He was on the phone. Telling somebody they’re going to send you away.Yeah, yeah, they always say that.He meant it this time. They want to send you to a correctional place on the mainland.Why would they do that?Miss Laura isn’t happy with you at all.Whatever. She can suck a dick.Where’d you even get the gun from? Grandaddy don’t keep guns in the house.We walk a while longer in a growing silence. Eventually Bluebird says, They’re not going to send me away.Heaven has always had a stomach for cruelty. It’s clear she’s joking, at least to me. If she really believed our sister was going to be turfed out, she wouldn’t talk so casually about it. But she shrugs and says, That’s just what Grandaddy said.Miss Laura is our neighbour. We don’t especially like her. At church, she always has something to say about our mama. She’s always asking stupid questions like, Can’t you even get dressed up nice for Jesus? Didn’t anybody teach you table manners? What kind of names are those? Bluebird snapped at her once and said, The ones our parents gave us, dummy. Miss Laura had something to say to our grandparents about that.Bibi always says don’t pay that busybody no mind. She disguises her condescension as concern. I’m worried, she tells Bibi, that your girls are always running around out there with no shoes on. Ever since your daughter went away, they’ve been acting like wild dogs. The little one’s practically feral. Hell, I saw her down by the water with no shirt on. Sister, please, you’re a reasonable woman. You’ve got to do something.We have committed more than one crime against Miss Laura and her grandsons over the years. We used to untie their dog because he was always crying in their front yard. Sometimes we picked oranges from her tree, but only because she never picked them herself, just let them fall and rot in the grass and heat. We left most of what we picked on her porch. We didn’t go out of our way to antagonise Miss Laura but her grandsons were bullies. They deserved whatever they got. I bit the younger one’s arm at Sunday school. I ground my teeth in until I tasted blood. He wanted to play with the toy I was playing with and he’d pushed me over to get it. I pushed him back and then, for good measure as Bibi likes to say, I nipped him.All our neighbours are of the general consensus that we’re not punished enough. Our grandparents are too soft to care for us properly. We need discipline. My week-long grounding after the biting incident wasn’t satisfactory for Miss Laura. Neither was the stern talking to we got when their dog ran away, nor the beating we got when she found the orange rinds we left fertilising under her tree. Miss Laura was just worried, she was always saying, about our lack of supervision. She never failed to call and inform our grandparents when Heaven was seen in cars with boys or when Bluebird beat up somebody’s brother or when she saw us coming back from the forest with a fresh kill.Two weeks ago, Bluebird was at a party with Heaven. Somehow she ended up walking down the old forest road, barefoot and alone. She’d gotten into a fight at the party, which was regular behaviour for her, and had to leave. Miss Laura’s oldest grandson and his friends followed her. They were calling her names, throwing rocks. Bluebird pulled out a pistol, fired a warning shot and then, when it looked like they needed further suggestion, took aim at their heads. They legged it. She said they were just trying to scare her, but Heaven made me turn away when she rinsed her off in the tub. I got a glimpse of her back, the tops of her legs. Raw and colourful, like old meat. It took the boys over a week to rat her out and when they did, they made it sound like she threatened to kill them for no good reason. As soon as Miss Laura found out, she was on the phone.Bluebird’s actions look reckless to outsiders but only because they can’t see the crystal web of her mind. She once built a sculpture out of the good china to calm me down from one of my fits, assembling a towering, precarious bridge on the dining table. As I watched her build it was like seeing music in the air. Something formless suddenly had a shape. I could breathe again. All Bibi said when she came in was, She’s methodical, alright.I know my sister. Everything she does has a logic to it, and a purpose.The police and our neighbours canvass the woods with flashlights and dogs. We can hear them calling out her name, even from the house. An hour ago they found a pair of her shoes, torn clothes. Nobody’s mentioned that they weren’t the clothes she was wearing earlier.We’re still sitting in the kitchen. We’ve been warned by Grandaddy not to move, even an inch, and the evening’s general atmosphere dissuades us from testing how strictly we are to observe these instructions. I want to ask where Heaven thinks our sister would’ve gone but she’s angry at me for getting us in trouble. The room is wrapped in a cool stoniness. There is a tap at the window, then another.She swivels in her seat and pushes the window open. Walter, is that you?Are your grandparents home?No, everyone’s out looking for Bluebird.Walter lets himself by the back door, which has been left unlocked in the event of Bluebird’s voluntary return. Heaven rises to meet him on the patio but she doesn’t close the door behind her. They whisper, he kicks his shoes off. After a couple minutes, my sister follows him in. Her expression has relaxed.How’s it going, Sage?Not bad, I shrug. Wish Bluebird would come home already and stop all this fuss. I’ve got school tomorrow.Yeah, I saw all them going out to look for her.I’m sure she’ll be back soon. She just wants to give them a scare.Yeah, says Walter, sounds like Bluebird. Well, I was just coming over to bring you this when I heard. I brought one for Bluebird too. He hands me a book with a rough green cover and one with a navy cover and a pretty dust jacket. I open up the green one and press my lips to the pages. The print is small and lovely, it has a musty smell that always reminds me of ink.Where’d you get it?It’s alright, I found it at a house I was cleaning out with my dad. There’s loads more down at the dump if you want to take a look. Maybe tomorrow after school.Heaven lifts herself up onto the counter in a way that she would never do if our grandparents were home. With one of her legs outstretched, she balances herself by gripping the edge of the kitchen island with her toes. She looks like a dancer. She cocks her head to one side and her neck clicks. She says, Did you see them all then?Yeah, they were fanning out across the tree line down by where you normally set your traps. You were out hunting?We were, says Heaven, but I wouldn’t have told them that. She looks at me.Aw, you won’t be in trouble for that though, when they find her they’ll forget all about it.That’s what I said!How can you like her, Walter? She’s such a bitch.Heaven sticks her tongue out at me. Walter laughs diplomatically and changes the subject. She just ran off then?You’re not worried?No, she always turns up.Walter says to me, Let us know if your grandparents or anyone come back, alright?I want to say that it was Heaven who made her run off like that but I stay quiet. I let my eyes slide away as Walter takes Heaven’s hand and leads her down the corridor to the den. She starts laughing, then they close the door and the sound is strangled like the sudden hiss of an extinguished candle. The book Walter brought for Bluebird has gold embossed letters on the jacket. It’s a romance, exactly the kind my sister likes to read.We’re very close to the deep heart of the forest. Here is where the pine trees give way to the old twisted oaks, the ugly branches dressed with lacy greenish moss. We see the deer standing in a small clearing. Heaven has the best aim. She raises the hunting rifle we’ve been loaned by Grandaddy. He always pretends not to know what we’re doing out here but when Heaven asks for the keys to the shed, he gives them to her and says only, Be careful with that now.Bluebird and I crouch down carefully. I cover my ears. Heaven draws herself up to her full height. She likes to show off but it isn’t really necessary. At this distance, it’s a clear shot.As Heaven squeezes the trigger, there’s a scream and a flash. Her aim falters. I look up. The shot grazes the animal. It runs into the trees with a superficial wound. Heaven spins around, ready to curse at the two of us. A flock of birds’ dark silhouette spirals into the air above. I wait for her admonishments but none came. Her eyes are bright but wide, hesitant. Heaven says, Where’s Bluebird?We search without urgency. It isn’t unlike our sister to disappear, especially in the forest. I’m sullen. I know Bluebird ran off because of what Heaven said, because it’s true. Miss Laura and her grandson got a lawyer. Grandaddy and Bibi won’t have a choice, they’ll have to send her away for good this time. We wander in the same direction the deer went. There aren’t any broken branches. The pine needles that litter the ground are undisturbed. I suggest we circle back to ask our daddy oak.Don’t be stupid, Sage.I’m not being stupid, I say. Maybe she went there.It’s just a tree.Heaven calls me a baby but we go back to the big oak anyway. It’s the largest tree on the island. It sits at the edge of a deep pond where they used to drown our people way back before our grandparents were even alive. We came here all the time as little kids. At the water’s edge looking for ghosts. The tree’s bark has all these oval-shaped ridges pushing out of it, like faces. They’re the real faces of our people. I touch the one that looks like the pictures of our daddy, where its cheek would be. See? says Heaven. Bluebird isn’t here.As she says it, we hear breathing. Short, frantic breaths that sound like struggle. We walk slowly around the tree, I cling to the back of my sister’s shirt. We see hooves—it’s just the deer.The smell is suddenly overpowering. Powdery, sour decay. We cover our mouths and noses with our sleeves. The same deer we were hunting, blackened and writhing with small white worms. Its fur is dark green and slick. Its devoured stomach is still rising and falling. The deflated black eye rolls glossily in its head, as if it can see us. We take off running.Three days after the last time we see our sister, the policemen carry a body out of the woods. It’s the older grandson. Everyone hears Miss Laura’s howling down the street and they stand on their porches like a vigil. They put him in a long black overnight bag and then into the back of an ambulance. He’s got blood on his clothes that isn’t his, and one of Grandaddy’s neat little pistols in his hand. The chamber’s empty.Walter reluctantly describes it to me — it’s him and Heaven that find the body. He has little cuts all over his face, delicate curves like small moons. His eye sockets are hollow. A deep red that’s barely colour anymore. When the ambulance arrives, Heaven tells me not to look, to look at her. I do as she says, but in her eyes — it’s like I’m not there. She stares at me like we’ll never meet again.It’s clear to everybody what happened. Somehow, Bluebird killed him. But they still can’t find her. The red and blue lights play off the evening-white walls of our neighbours’ houses. Eventually, somebody turns them off.Grandaddy gets quiet and Bibi gets sick. She retreats to her room. She threatens to walk down to the beach and turn into sand, or a wave. We don’t hunt anymore. Walter brings us groceries. He claims he saw Bluebird at a gas station on the mainland. Heaven doesn’t believe him. She thinks he’s trying to cheer me up. Others have seen her too, but none are able to catch her. She melts as soon as they pull their gaze away, reaching for their phone. Gone by the time they start dialling.Heaven goes out with Walter in the evenings and doesn’t get home sometimes until morning. But she starts coming in through the door instead of the window, no matter how late it is, because nobody tells us what to do anymore. Bibi doesn’t have the energy, and Grandaddy doesn’t have the heart.At night, when everybody else has gone or gone to bed, I read the books from the dump. I’m a slow reader, even slower without my sisters to read aloud to me, but I keep going. I’ve left the pretty blue book on the nightstand. I won’t read it.It’s Bluebird who comes in through the window now. She arrives as a flock of birds and perches on the windowsill. I wonder how our parents knew what to name her. This is why can’t nobody catch her. The bluebirds line the sill and weigh down the tree branches. I ask her where she got to but she won’t tell me what happened in the forest. She just asks, Which time? and I don’t know what she means. She says she’s in the same place as mama. She’s following the sun. It’s wild over there but it’s peaceful. She promises I’ll like it. Time folded down until it’s lighter than paper.Eventually, says Bluebird, we’re all gonna get free."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16a295a5bc87a463e1d2cd4225599c4145454fa8/0_62_5115_3069/master/5115.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=369fdca2d71e27720286d2f36003a6cb","title":"more handmaids tale sequels never say never says margaret atwood","story":"Canadian author of The Testaments refuses to rule it out, saying she was pushed to writing the sequel by US moves to police women’s bodiesThe growing similarities between the US and her fictional regime of Gilead, where women’s bodies are policed by a totalitarian state, helped prompt Margaret Atwood into writing a sequel to The Handmaid’s Tale, the author has said.The Testaments was released worldwide today, 34 years after the story of Offred ended in the first book. Speaking about it publicly for the first time, Atwood said that there had been “many requests for a sequel” over the intervening years, but she “always said no”.“However, as time moved on, instead of moving further away from Gilead we moved towards it, particularly in the US, and I re-examined that position,” said the 79-year-old novelist, who attended a midnight launch for the novel in London the previous evening.“I decided that although I could not continue with the story of Offred, I could continue with three other people and tell the story of the beginning of the end. We know from The Handmaid’s Tale that Gilead vanishes, it’s no longer present 200 years later because we’re having a symposium on it … So how did it collapse? How do these kinds of regimes disappear? I was interested in exploring that and also what it would be like for the second generation.”She sent a two-paragraph summary to her publishers in February 2017. The acclaimed television adaptation, which the novelist reads scripts for, but claims to have “no actual power” over, began in April that year.The Testaments follows three characters: two young women, one who grows up inside Gilead and one who has been brought up in Canada and Aunt Lydia, a fearsome and opaque figure in The Handmaid’s Tale, who reveals how she survived during the earliest days of the regime. “What these restrictive laws about women’s bodies are claiming is that the state owns your body. There is a parallel occasion for men and that would be the draft: the state owns your body and you have to go to war. But when they do that, they pay for clothes, lodging, food, medical expenses and a salary,” said a deeply sardonic Atwood.“I say unto them, if you want to conscript women’s bodies in this way, you’re forcing women to deliver babies, forced childbirth, and you’re not paying for any of it. It is very cheap, amongst other things. For a society claiming to value inidual freedom I would say to them, you evidently don’t think those freedoms extend to women.”Until the cold war ended, Atwood said, “the US was selling itself as the alternative to the cold war evil empire. They were the land of freedom, democracy, opportunity for all, and therefore they were not showcasing their shadow side … once that opponent was gone, everything could come out of the cupboard that had always been there. Out it has come.”With protesters around the world adopting the red costumes of the Handmaids to silently campaign for women’s rights, including demonstrations in Ireland, Argentina and recently in Texas, where an all-male council voted to ban abortion in June, Atwood said her creations worked as a form of civil protest.“You’re not making a disturbance, not saying anything ... you’re all covered up, no frightful bare shoulders,” she said. “None of this would be happening if countries were not putting other people in charge of women’s bodies. If everything were fair and equitable, and government really was by consent of the governed, only potentially pregnant women would be able to vote on these matters.”With The Testaments shortlisted for the Booker prize – judges called it a “savage and beautiful novel” which “speaks to us today, all around the world, with particular conviction and power” – and readers so desperate to get their hands on the book that they were queueing up for it at midnight, Atwood gave a wry smile to suggestions that she is a literary rock star.“Considering the lives rock stars lead, I hope not. I haven’t yet died of an opiate overdose, not yet, but there’s time,” she said. “This kind of thing could be quite ruinous for a 35-year-old because where do you go from there? But in my case we kind of know the answer.” One thing she refused to rule out was whether she would ever return to Gilead again: “Never say never to anything.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23e59ec0e125f88fda2cf1245db989d4e0f541ff/0_165_4626_2776/master/4626.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f9dc6b7e75180ef07d4dfe3df6c1fde","title":"share your reviews of the testaments by margaret atwood","story":"Whether you’ve been waiting decades for the sequel to The Handmaid’s Tale or you’re new to Atwood, we’d like to hear from youIt is the literary event of 2019 and 34 years in the making: The Testaments, Margaret Atwood’s sequel to her dystopian feminist classic The Handmaid’s Tale is finally out in the world (a week after Amazon’s embargo-busting snafu.)

We meet Hester Why aboard a mail coach as it lurches through the Cornish night. From Falmouth, she proceeds by pony and trap to her destination, announced in the time-honoured manner by a grizzled driver. “We be on Morvoren land now,” he croaks.We be veering towards outright staginess, too, it must be said. The effect isn’t just Du Maurier-esque it’s Du Maurier-tastic. Which isn’t a bad thing, necessarily. She could ham it up with the best of them – indeed, she was the best of them – and sometimes readers like to know exactly what they are getting. It’s an approach that has certainly worked for Purcell so far: she won the WHSmith Thumping Good Read award in 2017 for The Silent Companions and has since been widely celebrated as a purveyor of well-wrought tales shaded with dark intrigue.The necessary ingredients are here in abundance. Hester is a woman with a secret. Several secrets, in fact. Covering up both a gin habit and a weakness for pilfered laudanum, she is travelling under an assumed name (though Hester Why seems a puzzling choice, since everyone who hears it will surely repeat it at least once in confusion). Formerly Esther Stevens, she has fled her last position in distinctly murky circumstances. The daughter of a midwife, she has a store of medical knowledge and an affinity for the sick, but her former employers have been peculiarly prone to misadventure.At Morvoren House, Hester nurses the enfeebled Miss Pinecroft, who by day is confined to a frigid parlour arrayed with bone china and at night to a locked bedchamber. Conflicting explanations are given for these arrangements, none of them especially reassuring. The other servants are a dour and superstitious bunch, attributing all manner of misdeeds to malevolent fairy folk. Hester is far from convinced, yet these strange tales seem intertwined with the melancholy history of the Pinecroft family. There are, she is told, “strange things on the moors”.Your enjoyment of all this will depend on your tolerance for such melodramatic flourishes, and for Cornish dialect that at times is laid on thickly enough to fill a pasty. If you can get past these, then there’s plenty here to entertain you. Purcell has a sure storytelling touch, a command of atmosphere and a keen eye for the telling details of social history. Oh, and she stores up some satisfying and suitably macabre final revelations.

A combined group will … enhance the long-term resilience and relevance of London and Hong Kong as global financial centres.”When the Refinitiv deal was announced, David Schwimmer, the chief executive of LSE, said it would allow it to expand into Asia and emerging markets.HKEX said its move to thwart that deal would instead drive its own ambitions to “reinforce Hong Kong’s position as the key connection between Mainland China, Asia and the rest of the world”.Laura Cha, the chair of HKEX, said: “We believe a combination represents a highly compelling strategic opportunity to create a global market infrastructure group, bringing together the largest and most significant financial centres in Asia and Europe.“Following early engagement with LSEG, we look forward to working in detail with the LSEG Board to demonstrate that this transaction is in the best interests of all stakeholders, investors and both businesses.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5cdd01100efb444d06791db44c19b9cf42e3be8/0_500_6605_3961/master/6605.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ca9a3bba8fc88457c79ba7916466cb7","title":"retailers call for action as high street store closures soar","story":"Government urged to step in over crisis that has cost tens of thousands of jobsRetailers and unions are calling for urgent government action to help struggling high streets as new data shows the number of shops, pubs and restaurants lying empty is rising at the fastest pace in nearly a decade.About 16 stores closed their doors every day in the first half of 2019 while only nine opened, resulting in a net decline of 1,234 chain stores on Britain’s top 500 high streets according to analysis by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and high street analysts the Local Data Company (LDC).The decline, which does not include independent shops, was faster than the net 1,123 closures during the same period last year – after just 222 in 2017 – and is the highest recorded since LDC began monitoring high streets in 2010.The shop closure data reflects a crisis on the high street that has cost tens of thousands of jobs. The retail industry employed 57,000 less people in the three months to the end of August compared to the same period a year before, according to new data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) released on Tuesday. It was the fifth consecutive quarter of decline.Major chains including Karen Millen, Jack Wills, Bathstore, Patisserie Valerie and Debenhams have gone into administration this year after the collapse of House of Fraser, Evans Cycles, Maplin and Poundworld in 2018. Some of those chains are still in business, taken over by new operators after their collapse, but have closed outlets.Many other retailers, including Topshop owner Arcadia, Monsoon, New Look, Carpetright and Homebase have been forced to seek legal agreements with their landlords to shut stores and slash their rent bills to stave off insolvency.“The government must address the growing crisis on our high streets,” said Paddy Lillis, general secretary of the shopworkers union Usdaw, which has launched a Save our Shops petition.Usdaw, and some of the UK’s biggest retailers including Tesco and Sainsburys, have demanded a review of business rates and other taxes to ensure there is a level playing field with online rivals. Last month, more than 50 major UK retailers, ranging from Marks \u0026amp Spencer to Harrods, Greggs and John Lewis wrote to chancellor Sajid Javid to demand an urgent review of business rates to safeguard the high street.Usdaw also wants better support for communities and a minimum wage of £10 an hour to help protect 4.5m jobs in the retail sector.The government recently increased its high street rescue fund by £325m to £1bn, promising to pump extra money into 100 towns including Blackpool, Scarborough and Clacton. It has also announced £900m in business rates relief for small retailers and a taskforce of experts to assist local authorities in developing “innovative strategies to help high streets evolve”.But retailers say a complete overhaul of property taxes is required to help fend off competition from online-only operators such as Amazon and Asos.“High streets are undergoing a fundamental change in response to changing shopping habits, new technologies and rising costs of doing business, so it is vital that government supports the industry to make the necessary investment to adapt,” said Dr Liliana Danila, economist at the British Retail Consortium.“The business rate system holds back investment, reduces productivity and increases regional disparities … The government must address the much-needed reforms to this broken tax system before more jobs are lost and stores are closed.”Physical retailers have been hit by a combination of changing habits, unseasonably warm weather, rising costs and broader economic problems. In 2018 Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld disappeared as a result.In terms of habits, shoppers are switching to buying online. The likes of Amazon have an unfair advantage because they have a lower business rate bill, which holds down costs and enables online retailers to woo shoppers with low prices. Business rates are taxes, based on the value of commercial property, that are imposed on traditional retailers with physical stores.\u0026nbspAt the same time, there is a move away from buying ‘stuff’ as more people live in smaller homes and rent rather than buy. Those pressures have come just as rising labour and product costs, partly fuelled by Brexit, have coincided with economic and political uncertainty that has dampened consumer confidence.Retailers with a high-street presence want the government to change business rates. They also want more political certainty as the potential for a no deal Brexit means some are not only incurring additional costs for stockpiling goods but are unsure about the impact of tariffs after October 2019. Retailers also want more investment in town centres to help them adapt to changing trends, as well as a cut to high parking charges which they say put off shoppers.In the October 2018 budget the government announced\u0026nbspsome relief\u0026nbspon business rates for independent shopkeepers. It has also set up a £675m ‘future high streets’ fund under which local councils can bid for up to £25m towards regeneration projects such as refurbishing local historic buildings and improving transport links. The fund will also pay for the creation of a high street taskforce to provide expertise and hands-on support to local areas.Some retailers could go under. Weakened by a difficult Christmas – which accounts for the entire annual profits of many retailers, and with further Brexit wobbles to come – retailers are facing a tough 2019. Another rise in the national minimum wage in April and the falling value of the pound against the dollar, which is used to buy goods in the far east, have also added to costs and hit profits.Retail chains have been hit by a mix of low consumer confidence, which has cut spending, and rising costs from business rates, an increase in the legal minimum wage, and higher cost prices as a result of the decline in the value of the pound since the EU referendum.The rise of online shopping and a shift in how consumers spend their leisure time – towards spending more of their spare cash on holidays and dining and drinking at home – have also hit high streets and shopping malls.Fashion chains were hardest hit in the first six months of this year, with a net decline of 118 stores as chains such as New Look, LK Bennett, and Yorkshire-based menswear specialist Greenwoods either restructured or went bust, according to the PwCLDC study.Restaurants, estate agents, pubs and bars also registered substantial numbers of closures.“There’s been no let-up in the changing ways that people shop and the cost pressures affecting high street operators,” said Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at PwC. “As consumers continue to change the way they shop and spend their leisure time, the reality is that we may need fewer high streets in the future.”There are some high street success stories. Takeaways, health clubs, pet shops and discount stores are the fastest growing outlets.A similar decline in store numbers is expected in the second half of 2019 as recently approved restructurign deals, including Topshop and Dorothy Perkins owner Arcadia, are implemented. Hooker said there could be greater stability next year “subject to world economics and politics.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45b7aedbc89cff918918041e460d67700450b3d4/0_49_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10bf76368e47dbf6ca024f55d73ff5fb","title":"wework looks like a bubble waiting to burst","story":"Wall Street isn’t playing ball with the shared workspace landlord’s inflated valueOne way not to recognise a potentially heavy investment loss is to close your eyes, ignore the evidence and pretend nothing has happened. This seems to be Masayoshi Son’s approach at WeWork.The SoftBank tech investor wants WeWork to abandon its flotation, reports the FT (£), for reasons that are not hard to guess. A listing in New York would expose the horrible truth about the allegedly hip workspace landlord. It ain’t worth $47bn, the value at which SoftBank injected the last portion of its $10.5bn investment. Try $15bn-$20bn, suggests Wall Street.Even the lower range looks rich. The problem with WeWork runs deeper than the teeth-grinding corporate mission statement (“A place you join as an inidual, ‘me’, but where you become part of a greater ‘we’”). First, there’s the losses – $1.9bn last year – with more expected into the middle distance.Second, there’s the unflattering financial comparison with London-listed property group IWG, which has been in the same marketplace for years and makes real profits, but is worth a more sensible £3.6bn.Third, there’s an obvious risk in taking on long leases on big buildings and offering tenants short, flexible rents. In a recession, tenants may decide to trade down and forgo WeWork’s funky murals and cheese-tasting events, but the landlord’s lease costs would remain fixed.Fourth, and perhaps most seriously, there’s WeWork’s breezy style of corporate governance. Co-founder Adam Neumann wasn’t obviously living up to the spirit of collective endeavour when his investment vehicle was paid $5.9m by the company for the right to use the trademarked word “we”. The sum has been repaid but how was the arrangement ever approved?Fans may counter that the sleepy world of shared office spaces was overdue a dose of innovation and global branding. Maybe, but WeWork remains a bricks and mortar company. It is not Alibaba, the Chinese online retailer where Son made a fortune.The flotation conundrum sets up serious tension. WeWork needs to raise $3bn-plus to keep expanding and unlock further investment. SoftBank, on the other hand, won’t want to record a formal loss on its punt while it’s looking to raise $100bn for its next Vision fund. It will still be in money on the early portions of its investment but any valuation for WeWork below $25bn looks likely to imply an overall loss. Even SoftBank’s normally reliable Saudi backers would be unimpressed.The rest of us, though, can cheer Wall Street’s refusal to play ball. It suggests rational analysis is returning to a stock market where, for a while, it seemed any over-hyped mega-venture with famous private equity-style backers could name its price. WeWork always looked like a bubble. Deflation had to happen.Advice for the CBI: damning all Jeremy Corbyn’s economic proposals with equal fury doesn’t work. Sometimes the Labour leader will produce ideas that big business might live with happily, or even come to applaud.A ministry for employment rights and a workers’ protection agency – the central pitch in Corbyn’s address to the TUC Congress in Brighton on Tuesday – should not frighten any responsible employer. Enforcing employment laws vigorously might even benefit companies who would not think of breaching rules in the first place. Free-riders would find life harder and competition might be made marginally fairer.It is not a revolutionary idea – and certainly not a case of “turning back the clock decades”, in the CBI’s excitable catch-all language. Sports Direct was obliged to reform working practices at its Shirebrook warehouse after this paper’s investigations in 2015 and a Commons select committee’s report. The affair struck a chord because workers – and, most fair-minded bosses – can recognise grubby behaviour.The biggest beneficiary, by far, every year would be the Treasury since idends for employees would be capped at £500-a-head. There is nothing inclusive about second-class share ownership, especially when workers’ existing pension schemes would suffer from the share dilution. If Labour wants to boost employee share ownership, cleverer approaches are available.But not every Labour idea is as radical as the CBI seems instinctively to believe. Ensuring that employment rights are respected should not be controversial. It would do the CBI no harm to say so."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a07d41b3dfc1f06670c5f77a5f90841204c66502/1677_493_2992_1795/master/2992.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff464248316957ada444b7ec17bbdd9b","title":"zero waste shops and sustainable fashion meet the new breed of small business owners","story":"Frustrated by the effects of plastic pollution, Kate Robertson and her friends decided to take positive action. The self-styled “mums on a mission” set about creating a zero-waste shop in their home of Bridport, Dorset, launched a crowdfunding campaign and exceeded their £16,000 target by raising £17,000. But, by that point someone else had opened a zero-waste shop in the town, so instead they decided to create Dorset’s first mobile zero-waste shop, The Green Weigh. The women make seven stops a week in their repurposed van (affectionately named “Gertie”), visiting different markets and villages each day so people can top up on everything from beans and pulses to household goods and personal items.The aim is to reduce single-use plastics by refilling jars and containers. Customers go along with their own containers and fill up from those on board the van. “People love it, they enjoy learning a different way to shop,” says Robertson. “It’s a huge change of habit, you have to really think about how you shop. It’s not like going into a supermarket and picking up a bag of pasta, it takes longer, but many people think it’s worth it.” And while perceptions are often that zero-waste shopping is more expensive, they work hard to keep prices down by ordering in bulk and selecting suppliers carefully.The shop has proved so successful that they now also sell online, operating a click-and-collect service. For a shop with no set location, being able to operate on the move is vital, says Robertson. From using iZettle to take card payments to keeping customers posted on where and when they will be in places thanks to social media, they rely on technology to run the business. “We want to make it as accessible as possible,” says Robertson. “Ideally, we want to see everybody shop this way and everywhere to have a shop like this.”When Lucas Barrow-Townsend left university, he knew he wanted to do something worthwhile. Rather than work for a charity or someone else’s business, he decided to start his own. “I saved up a bit of money and went to Gambia, and that was where it all started,” he says. Continent Clothing sells garments made from traditional African wax print fabrics, working directly with local Gambian tailors, seamstresses and fabric merchants in Ghana, Senegal and Ivory Coast.Barrow-Townsend, 29, started selling at Camden Market and went on to have a shop on Brick Lane. Seven years later the business is still going strong and he now has a shop in Reading, as well as selling at festivals, events and online. Barrow-Townsend calls Continental Clothing a “socially responsible business”. “I know every single person in the production chain,” he says. “I know the person who sells the fabric, I know the tailor who makes the clothing, I know the people who send it to the UK. For every single thing, I know where the money is going. I know how much they’re getting paid, which is much more than the average.”When it comes to running a business that deals with people across the world, connectivity is vital, he says. “It enables me to FaceTime my tailors in Gambia, take card payments at festivals, and keep an eye on things wherever I am. Without mobile connectivity there’s no chance this would happen, or it would have been a much slower process. All of my tailors have access to phones now, even when I first started it was a lot harder to get hold of them, but now 3G and 4G is spreading across Africa so it’s a lot easier.”After bringing up four children single-handedly, Yvette Curley learned to take on pretty much any practical job at home. So when she decided to set up her own business, doing the same thing for other people seemed a no-brainer. “I cared for my nan for the best part of 20 years. I used to think: ‘what would she do if she didn’t have me if, say, her lightbulb went?’ She’d probably call an electrician and then get charged a huge call-out fee.” Cue the creation of Tilly the Handylady just 12 months ago. “Tilly”, who sees no job as too small, will take on anything from painting and lopping trees to carrying out repairs and even defrosting freezers. She charges a modest hourly rate and once the job is done she will often see if there’s anything else that needs doing to make sure the hour is met. “I try to keep my prices as reasonable as I can,” she says. “I don’t charge for call-outs, I don’t charge for quotes. I do all sorts – I paint, decorate, hang shelves, and if it’s not on my list I always tell people to call me anyway because I can probably do it.”A lot of Tilly’s customers in Rugby, Warwickshire, tend to be elderly, and she gets much of her business via word of mouth. They like having someone they can trust, she says, right down to being able to pay her by cheque that she can bank via an app in front of them. “I use my phone for pretty much everything,” she says. “Once you organise yourself and get everything set up, you can do everything from banking and payments to booking jobs in your calendar and obviously being contacted by people.”Stay one step ahead with Vodafone Do you run your own small business?

From sliding into people’s DMs to creating knowledge-sharing groups on WhatsApp, here are the tips to knowRunning a business can be lonely at the best of times, but when virtual assistant Chris Heron was struggling with back pain two years ago, she felt very isolated working alone in her rural Devonshire home office. “I was thinking to myself if I worked with other people in a normal job, I probably wouldn’t have gotten so low because there’s interaction with other people,” she says. “With small businesses, there’s often nobody to brainstorm or collaborate with. I realised other women must be going through this as well.”Her solution was to start a WhatsApp group. Now 21-strong, the group of professional women working in the south-west includes event managers, web designers, financial advisers and business coaches. They try to meet in person quarterly, but it’s often the virtual support day-to-day that has proved most helpful. “I think because we work on our own, it’s nice to be able to touch base with somebody else during the day,” says Heron. “We’re there to support everybody.”With the widespread use of social media by business owners, such virtual networking opportunities are increasing in number today’s entrepreneurs must be ready to build meaningful connections at all times. Here’s how to do that effectively, according to the experts.Build connections naturallyOnline networking may be possible 247, but many of the old rules about how to interact still apply, social media expert Paul Sutton says. Most importantly, entrepreneurs must avoid spamming people with a sales message as soon as they’ve connected with someone new. To that end, Sutton advises against sending a direct message straight away. Instead, engage with the content they’re posting, interact with what they’re talking about, and grow the relationship with consistent, regular contact points that build to something bigger over time.Look for relevant groupsLike Heron’s WhatsApp group, the use of private messaging as a networking tool has risen in prominence in recent years, says Sutton. It reflects a shift in how social media is being used more generally, with users more inclined to share content with friends via closed groups rather than engage with content publicly. Entrepreneurs will find relevant groups on platforms such as Facebook and LinkedIn – these might be industry specific, linked to a local area, or bring users together through some other common ground.Sutton has set up a Slack channel with almost 100 members for people in his industry off the back of his podcast, and has found it’s a medium that works well. “In a networking sense, rather than broadcasting information and content to the world … it’s very relevant people getting together in this private space, where we can give each other advice, disseminate lots of information about the industry, and share news.”Anne Sheehan, director at Vodafone Business UK, points out that these kinds of platforms can also boost productivity. “Whether it’s task management apps or collaboration tools, technology offers a huge opportunity to supercharge productivity. The key is to connect people, processes and information in a way that unlocks a workforce’s ability to do their best work.”Add valueRather than trying to sell your business while networking online, Lucy Hutchings Hunt, founder of digital development agency Systemyzed, believes entrepreneurs should give content away for free to build a reputation. “People do not make a buying decision at their first point of contact,” she says. “It’s all about building up that real sense of trust and nurturing your own tribe of raving fans who really believe that you’re the person to help them move forward.” That could be by making introductions if you have a contact who could support a new acquaintance, for example.Your business unlimitedTransform your small business with unlimited data, texts and minutes.

Why risk everything for a no-deal Brexit? Breaking up their own party, losing their parliamentary majority, dismantling the UK, trashing the economy, triggering shortages of food and medicine: how could any objective, for the Conservative and Unionist party, be worth this? What good does it do them?Yes, some people will benefit. To judge by recent donations to the Conservative party, some very rich people approve of Boris Johnson’s policies. A no-deal Brexit might favour hedge funds that thrive on uncertainty, financiers seeking to short the pound, vulture capitalists hoping to mop up cheap property if markets collapse. But the winners are likely to be greatly outnumbered by the losers, among whom are many powerful commercial interests.We make a mistake when we assume that money is the main motivation. Our unreformed, corrupt and corrupting political funding system ensures it is an important factor. But what counts above all else is ideology, as ideology successfully pursued is the means to power. You cannot exercise true power over other people unless you can shape the way they think, and shape their behaviour on the basis of that thought. The long-term interests of ideology differ from the short-term interests of politics.This, I believe, is the key to understanding what is happening today. The Brexit ultras in government are not just Brexit ultras. They are neoliberal ultras, and Brexit is a highly effective means of promoting this failed ideology. It’s the ultimate shock doctrine, using a public emergency to justify the imposition of policies that wouldn’t be accepted in ordinary times. Whether they really want no deal or not, the threat of it creates the political space in which they can apply their ideas.Neoliberalism is the ideology developed by people such as Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman. It is not just a set of free-market ideas, but a focused discipline, deliberately applied around the world. It treats competition as humanity’s defining characteristic, sees citizens as consumers and “the market” as society’s organising principle. The market, it claims, sorts us into a natural hierarchy of winners and losers. Any attempt by politics to intervene disrupts the discovery of this natural order.It was embraced by Margaret Thatcher, Ronald Reagan and most subsequent governments. They sought to implement the doctrine by cutting taxes, privatising and outsourcing public services, slashing public protections, crushing trade unions and creating markets where markets did not exist before. The doctrine was imposed by central banks, the IMF, the Maastricht treaty and the World Trade Organization. By shutting down political choice, governments and international bodies created a kind of totalitarian capitalism.It has failed on its own terms, and in many other ways. Far from creating general prosperity, growth has been slower in the neoliberal era than it was in preceding decades, and most of its fruits have been gathered by the rich. Far from stimulating an enterprise economy, it has created a gilded age for rent-seekers. Far from eliminating bureaucracy, it has created a Kafkaesque system of mad diktats and stifling control. It has fomented ecological, social, political, economic and financial crises, culminating in the 2008 crash. Yet, perhaps because its opponents have not produced a new, compelling story of their own, it still dominates our lives.Unsurprisingly, people have reacted to the closure of political choice and the multiple disasters it caused. But because neoliberalism, in broad terms, was adopted not only by the right, but also by the Democrats, New Labour and similar parties, there were few places to turn. Many people responded with nationalism and nativism. The new politics that Boris Johnson’s government represents incorporates both neoliberalism and the reaction to it. The glitter-eyed essentialists on the frontbenches – such as Dominic Raab, Liz Truss and Sajid Javid – still seek to implement the ideology in its most extreme form. The opportunists, such as Johnson, Michael Gove and Priti Patel, appeal to those who seek scapegoats for the disasters it has created.Johnson uses neoliberal framing to justify his attacks on public safety. He wants to pull down environmental standards, create free ports in which businesses can avoid tax and regulation, and strike a rapid trade deal with the United States that is likely to rip up animal welfare rules and threaten the survival of the NHS.He rages against red tape, but the real red tape is created by the international trade treaties he favours, that render democratic change almost impossible, through rules that protect capital against popular challenge, and shift decision-making away from parliaments and into unaccountable offshore courts (“investor-state dispute settlement”). This explains the enthusiasm among some on the left for Brexit: a belief that escaping from the EU means escaping from coercive trade instruments. In reality, it exposes us to something even worse, as the UK enters negotiations with the US, holding a begging bowl.Now, as the professor of political economy Abby Innes argues, neoliberalism has reached its Brezhnev phase: “ossification, self-dealing, and directionless political churn”. Like Leninism, neoliberalism claims to be an infallible science. Its collision with the complexities of the real world has caused political sclerosis of the kind that characterised the decline of Soviet communism. As a result, “the only way to complete this revolution today is under cover of other projects: Brexit is ideal”.The creation of emergency is the inevitable destination of an absolutist, failed system. But emergency also provides the last means by which the failed system can be defended and extended."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d912397c54ae92fb30e0b6012966b7fa4f0f5f8b/0_131_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa07fa52e9e0586a48cd10e97057bbc5","title":"margaret atwood feminist the testaments","story":"In these dark and difficult political times, I often find myself craving clarity, looking for explanations and reassurances – and rarely, if ever, finding what I seek. When I got my hands on a precious copy of Margaret Atwood’s The Testaments a couple of days ago I was surprised by the almost physical hunger I felt to step back into Gilead. Obviously, I’m not alone, and one reason why this dystopia has hit the spot for many of us is its clarity. I’m not saying that there isn’t complexity of plot in Atwood’s creation, but in Gilead there is also a great deal of moral certainty. There is good, and there is evil. There is oppression, and there is resistance.The appearance of handmaids in their red cloaks has put heart into me at various protests over the past couple of years. I have photographed them at women’s marches in London and seen them gather in courtrooms in the US. Although they are a symbol of a possibly terrifying future, they are also a symbol of shared understanding, which gives me hope. And The Testaments, unlike The Handmaid’s Tale itself, is a truly hopeful tale. It reassures us that we are right to fear our enemies and right to resist them, and it reassures us that totalitarianism can be seen off.This second novel provides even more of this hopefulness, because it is about the resistance to Gilead. We saw seeds of resistance in The Handmaid’s Tale, but they were constantly being smothered or ripped out. Here, we learn how they have taken root – including in some unexpected places. The Testaments is a more accessible novel than The Handmaid’s Tale, sharing some of the tone of the spin-off television series, which necessarily tended to replace introspection with action. These heroines are marvellously resourceful, almost superhuman in their bravery, able to live undercover for years, oversee underground networks, slip across borders, mastermind spy rings, manipulate colleagues, fell enemies with a blow.There is little, here, of the quotidian ordinariness of much political resistance, which can so often turn out to be disappointingly humdrum and compromised. It is massively satisfying to find this kind of heightened reality in fiction, to see the world in an exaggerated mode, the patterns standing out so much more clearly than in the one in which we live.Even though in these resonant books she creates such a stark political vision, it’s intriguing that Atwood has nevertheless been keen to say that she is not writing a manifesto. She has often pushed back in interviews, when asked about her relationship to feminism, against the idea that she will provide “a megaphone for any one particular set of beliefs”. As she wrote in the New York Times in 2017: “Is The Handmaid’s Tale a ‘feminist’ novel? If you mean an ideological tract in which all women are angels andor so victimized they are incapable of moral choice, no.”It is hardly surprising that a writer of such inventive fiction would be nervous of the idea that her work could be pigeonholed into any ideological framework. There is a fear among many female writers and film-makers that to call your work feminist means to curtail its imaginative impact and suggest it should be read as propaganda. This is the same conception of feminist fiction that was so powerfully rejected by another great writer, the late Doris Lessing, whose work was also often claimed for the feminist movement. In 1982 she trenchantly told an interviewer: “What the feminists want of me is something they haven’t examined because it comes from religion. They want me to bear witness. What they would really like me to say is, ‘Ha, sisters, I stand with you side by side in your struggle toward the golden dawn where all those beastly men are no more.’ Do they really want people to make oversimplified statements about men and women? In fact, they do.”Eighteen years ago I had a little exchange with Lessing about her view of feminism. She wrote to me to clarify reports of comments she had made about men and women, but also to double down on her disappointment with the women’s movement, which she said expended too much of its “wonderful energy” in rubbishing men. In my response, I conceded that I should probably stop calling her a feminist. “Perhaps I am wrong to call you a feminist,” I wrote. “It’s silly to stick a label on you that you wouldn’t choose yourself.”I had forgotten about that exchange over the years, but was recently reminded of it by the University of East Anglia, where the letters will be going on display in a new exhibition (Doris Lessing 100, which is opening this week).But when I reread these letters, I realised that despite my concession in 2001, I still see Lessing’s fiction as deeply feminist. Because whenever I dip back into Lessing’s work, particularly The Golden Notebook, the Children of Violence series or her memoirs, I cannot but remember how important she was to the growth of my and other women’s feminism. Without Anna Wulf or Martha Quest and their fiercely uncompromising relationships with their own bodies and their partners, it’s almost impossible to imagine the kind of wry, honest, explicit fiction by women we now take for granted. These heroines killed off the “Angel in the House” that Virginia Woolf complained about, and revealed women in their full, often dislikable, but utterly mesmerising humanity.Lessing’s heroines are too complicated to be easily understood, and they struggle to understand themselves. Their sexual and family relationships are messy and challenging, and their political activity provides no easy journey either, but is fraught and compromised. And that lack of clarity, in itself, is feminist.Because feminism is partly just about finding ways to express women’s full humanity and refusing to accept frames that may flatten our experiences. Feminist fiction is not just about making our political world clearer and simpler. It is not just about providing us with reassurance that we are on the side of the good. We see that complexity time and again in Atwood’s fiction too, even if the popular conception of Gilead, especially the way it has been disseminated through political protest and the television series, has often flattened it out for us. The television series in particular sometimes began to feel as if it was trying to bludgeon us with its lessons about the violence of misogynist oppression.And Atwood too sees her work as feminist in this way. She went on to write about whether The Handmaid’s Tale was feminist: “If you mean a novel in which women are human beings – with all the variety of character and behavior that implies – and are also interesting and important, and what happens to them is crucial to the theme, structure and plot of the book, then yes.”Then, yes. This is the view of feminist fiction that is most valuable. A political novel is not necessarily one that gives you a manifesto, but one that enables you to expand your political understanding of a messy and difficult world. Which is why I would say that there is at least one other important feminist novel on the Booker shortlist alongside Atwood’s. Bernardine Evaristo’s Girl, Woman, Other gives the reader no roadmap for resistance, no advice, no clarification. But by knitting together the lives of a erse set of women, what it does do is explore the experiences and listen to the voices that we need to hear from – and often comes back with uncomfortable and urgent news. Some of her heroines succeed by compromise and some by resistance some live out lies and some insist on the truth, some make their own narratives and some are overcome by others’ needs. For this white reader, this kind of tapestry reminds us of how often black women’s full humanity is skimmed over. This novel shifts our perspectives it complicates our worldview.For me, the most vital political fiction is fiction that makes us feel the irreducible humanity of those who are constantly being forgotten. At a time when empathy often seems to be contracting, when political views admit less and less nuance, let’s not be afraid of complexity. There are no easy answers in our real or imaginary worlds, and let’s not pretend that there ever will be.• Natasha Walter is director of Women for Refugee Women and author of Living Dolls: The Return of Sexism"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/045fa9ca790cd168270fec8ad45d2747f1c6d25a/0_110_5315_3189/master/5315.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cceace289678618c69522e8c0ec849c8","title":"uk work visas for foreign graduates to be extended to two years","story":"Government returns to pre-2012 policy that Theresa May called ‘too generous’International students are to be offered a two-year work visa after graduating from a British university, the government will announce, overturning a key plank of Theresa May’s restrictive immigration policies.Currently, graduates with bachelors or master’s degrees are allowed to look for work for only four months. From next year all international graduates could qualify for a two-year period to work in the UK, increasing their chances of finding long-term employment after studying.The measure goes further than the Home Office’s latest immigration white paper, which proposed extending the four-month limit to six months and the limit for those with doctorates to a year.It is a return to the policy that was scrapped by the coalition government in 2012. May as home secretary said the two-year post-study work visa was “too generous”.That move was blamed for a drop in international student enrolments. Jo Johnson, who resigned as universities minister last week, has campaigned for post-study visas to be extended, and in April he tabled an amendment to the immigration bill calling for two-year work visas.Under the new policy, the visas would have no cap on numbers and would allow graduates to apply for jobs regardless of their skills or the subject they studied. The government said part of the aim was to recruit talented graduates in disciplines such as maths, engineering and technology.Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, said: “The important contribution international students make to our country and universities is both cultural and economic. Their presence benefits Britain, which is why we’ve increased the period of time these students can remain in the UK after their studies.“Our universities thrive on being open global institutions. Introducing the graduate route ensures our prestigious higher education sector will continue to attract the best talent from around the world to global Britain.”The announcement was greeted with enthusiasm by Universities UK, which represents 130 institutions. Its members are braced for falling numbers of students from the EU in the event of Brexit.Alistair Jarvis, the chief executive of Universities UK, said the previous visa regime put the UK at a “competitive disadvantage” in recruiting international students.“The introduction of a two-year post-study work visa is something Universities UK has long campaigned for and we strongly welcome this policy change, which will put us back where we belong as a first-choice study destination,” Jarvis said. “Not only will a wide range of employers now benefit from access to talented graduates from around the world, these students hold lifelong links with the UK.”Last year UK universities educated around 460,000 international students, not including those from within the EU. The government aims to grow the number to 600,000 over the next 10 years.Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, said the move highlighted the “foolishness” of the government’s £30,000 salary minimum for existing work visas. She said: “Many of the graduates doing fantastic medical and other research earn less than that. Government policy will prevent us from attracting them to live and work here.”The DfE said the route would allow students to look for work at any level, and allow them to later apply for longer-term work visas. “Those on the route will be able to switch on to the skilled work route if they find a job which meets the skill requirement of the route,” the DfE said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7af74ed489e80fe393a3d43bbf96cba813a4fb80/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6dc8f38518765d11f31fd10911e3c199","title":"children with special needs are marginalised at school says nao","story":"National Audit Office says the system incentivises schools to be less inclusiveChildren with special needs and disabilities are being marginalised by mainstream schools in England, according to a report by the National Audit Office (NAO) which says the system incentivises them to be less inclusive.The NAO accuses the government of misjudging the financial impact of its changes to education, with rising numbers of pupils with special needs unable to be accommodated in mainstream schools following a combination of funding strains, off-rolling and exclusions.This has resulted in local authorities having to break their budgets to fund additional places in special schools, including in more expensive independent schools, its report says.The investigation found that mainstream schools had incentives to avoid enrolling pupils with special educational needs and disabilities (Send), because of the additional costs imposed on school budgets and from the impact on the school’s league tables.“Stakeholders in the sector have raised concerns that the demand for special school places is growing because the system incentivises mainstream primary and secondary schools to be less inclusive,” the NAO said.“Mainstream schools are expected to cover the first £6,000 of support for a child with Send from existing budgets and cost pressures can make them reluctant to admit or keep pupils with Send.“Another barrier is that schools with high numbers of children with Send may also appear to perform less well against performance metrics.”The NAO’s figures showed that while the number of pupils with high needs has risen over the past four years in special schools, alternative provision and independent special schools, the number enrolled in mainstreams schools was still lower in 2018 than in 2014 or 2015.A spokesperson for the Department for Education (DfE) said the government has committed to providing an extra £700m next year to help educate children with Send, along with launching a review of support.“We have improved special educational needs support to put families at the heart of the system and give them better choice in their children’s education, whether in mainstream or special school,” the DfE said.Gareth Davies, the head of the NAO, said: “While lots of schools, both special and mainstream, are providing high-quality education for pupils with Send, it is clear that many children’s needs are not being met.“I therefore welcome the DfE’s announcement of a review into support for children with Send, following our engagement with them on this issue over recent months. We hope the review will secure the improvements in quality and sustainability that are needed.”“Evidence also suggests that pupils with Send are more likely to experience off-rolling – where schools encourage parents to remove a child primarily for the school’s benefit – than other pupils,” the NAO wrote.The 2014 education reforms replaced statements of special education needs with education and health care (EHC) plans, but the NAO said the DfE misjudged the financial consequences: “The department expected that the benefits and savings would significantly outweigh the costs of moving to the new system.”Tim Nicholls, head of policy at the National Autistic Society, said ministers need to use the review announced last week to address the system’s serious problems.“We hear awful stories every day of autistic children who are being held back from getting the education they deserve because schools don’t understand or can’t meet their needs. This can be devastating for them and their families, and mean they lose all faith in the system. This detailed NAO report shows the extent of this unacceptable situation,” Nicholls said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75e09616b68bf3ced0649d764c649ff3108352b5/0_101_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7bb4676b0028d60dcca56de8775238d5","title":"tuc urges members support student climate strikes","story":"Unions give backing to 20 September day of action while NGO asks head teachers to back global protestsThe Trades Union Congress (TUC) has urged members to support student climate strikers on 20 September as Amnesty International called on head teachers worldwide to back their global protests.At the their annual conference in Brighton, a proposal by the University and College Union (UCU) originally asked the TUC to call for millions of workers to stop work for half an hour, aimed at shifting government complacency over the climate crisis.However, an amendment put forward by the rail union Aslef means the TUC will call for “workday campaign action” instead.The UCU is urging workers to join the action alongside students at lunchtimes and before and after work, and to ask employers to jointly declare a climate emergency with staff unions and student unions.Millions of students and young people have taken part in climate strikes around the world in a movement inspired by Greta Thunberg, who has carried out solo protests outside the Swedish parliament since August last year.The strikers are demanding their governments recognise the severity of the unfolding crisis and take appropriate action.This month’s event comes days before world leaders meet in New York to discuss the climate crisis, and organisers said it was essential that adults join students on the streets to send an unequivocal message.The Campaign Against Climate Change group, which pushed for trade unions to take urgent action on the ecological emergency, welcomed the motion. Its chair, Suzanne Jeffery, said: “We congratulate delegates at the TUC who have unanimously backed a historic motion to support the school students’ global climate strike on 20 September and for all TUC unions to take action on the day. All unions must now turn words into action and build for a huge turnout … standing with students to demand urgent action on the climate emergency.”The leaders of all the main opposition parties in Westminster have backed the climate strikes. An early day motion tabled in the Commons by the Green MP, Caroline Lucas, and supported by the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and the leaders of the Scottish National party, Plaid Cymru and Liberal Democrats, said urgent action was needed to tackle the climate crisis and called on adults to join children on the streets on 20 September.On Wednesday, Amnesty International joined the call, asking head teachers around the world to let their pupils join the 20 September school climate strike, expected to be the biggest yet.Its secretary general, Kumi Naidoo, has written to almost 25,000 schools in the UK and 2,000 more in Canada, Hungary, Spain and New Zealand, urging them to let pupils take part in the global climate strikes without being punished.Naidoo wrote: “I believe that the cause for which these children are fighting is of such historic significance that I am writing to you today with a request to neither prevent nor punish your pupils from taking part in the global days of strikes planned for 20 and 27 September.”Jake Woodier, of the UK Student Climate Network, which is helping to organise the UK strikes, said: “The effects of climate breakdown are already being felt across the world, predominantly by those that have contributed least to the crisis, yet our leaders have historically failed to act.Naidoo said the climate emergency was the defining human rights issue for this generation of children. “Its consequences will shape their lives in almost every way imaginable. The failure of most governments to act in the face of overwhelming scientific evidence is arguably the biggest inter-generational human rights violation in history.”In his letter he said that by taking part in the strikes, children were exercising their human rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly, and to have a say in decisions that will fundamentally shape their lives.And he said his own experience of being expelled from school aged 15, for organising an anti-apartheid protest at his school in Durban, South Africa, had shaped his life.“Thankfully I was able to complete my studies and ultimately take up the role I have the honour of holding today.“But I also had something that children of this generation do not have: the chance to imagine a future that is not overshadowed by the prospect of a climate emergency.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13f5664148331eed6f72359be1d33d1314b7d863/0_178_1917_1150/master/1917.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf58b62817569b69d2c5a94cdc5f6b7e","title":"cerys matthews i wear my driving gloves to go round the corner to the shops","story":"The singer and presenter talks about feeling adventurous, hiding bad hair days and her favourite ever suit and hat comboThis is the kind of outfit that I feel comfortable in, and comfort is up there for me. I’m not big into dresses and skirts, but I love a good suit. This was taken at the Asian awards a few years ago – I love saris and all the extraordinary silks in traditional clothes, but I think that, for my heritage, a suit and a panama hat suits me just fine. When it comes to clothes, I think it’s important to feel like yourself, more than anything. I have become a little bit attached to hats, but I don’t have that many. I had always been a big fan of Clint Eastwood, the suffragettes and Bob Dylan, and they all seem to have hats on in their best photos, so I just started wearing them, too. I find it cuts corners in terms of not having to worry too much about your hair. You don’t even have to worry too much about your outfit if you have a good hat on.I’m also wearing my driving gloves they are ace. I’ve worn them so often I need to replace them. There are so many iconic films where actors wear driving gloves – I put them on just to drive round the corner to the shops and it makes it feel a bit more adventurous and exciting. The pearls were just next to the door, so I put them on, too.In the 90s, I used to wear clothes just for the ironic fun of it. It was often the most bizarre concoctions I could find. I had a gold cowboy hat and massive flares, with “Tommy” written down one leg and “Hilfiger” down the other, in three different colours, red white and blue. I’d wear it with a tiny silk top. My favourite quote is from Vivienne Westwood: “When in doubt, overdress.”At the time, the fashion was for understated looks, just one or two colours or cargo trousers, but I just liked to throw it all on: kaftans, turbans, just to have fun with the clothes, rather than wear anything sleek or serious.

Marie Blanchet, CEO of the go-to brand for celebrities’ secondhand dresses, explains howThe catwalk season has begun, and there is a new It girl in town. She is Parisian, with dark hair that tumbles in that photogenically messy way that only French women ever master. She wears a lot of black (jeans, ankle boots) and not much makeup – just a perfect red lip – and great perfume. Her look is timeless, understated and perennially chic. Think tailoring, iconic accessories and beautiful silk shirts.But Marie Blanchet is a whole new breed of fashion leader, because her look is not about new clothes. As the CEO for William Vintage, the London-based vintage label that dressed Adwoa Aboah for the GQ awards last week and sourced the 1960s Courreges trapeze coat that Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, wore for her New York baby shower, Blanchet stands for a coming age of fashion in which the kudos of the perfectly sourced secondhand piece outshines the appeal of new clothes.Blanchet’s masterplan is to make William Vintage, which was founded a decade ago by the fashion connoisseur and dealer William Banks-Blaney, the first market-leading fashion brand that doesn’t make any new clothes.“Our ambition is to make a look for the contemporary moment, but using vintage clothes,” she says. In an industry struggling to reconcile the environmental impact of clothes production with a fashion news cycle that relies on new collections to drive desire, Blanchet sees an opportunity to create a fashion brand out of pre-loved clothes. The sustainable credentials of vintage fashion are already beginning to make it an alpha choice. Amal Clooney chose a caped ivory silk gown from Jean-Louis Scherrer’s 2007 collection for a black-tie event at Buckingham Palace earlier this year.“Even five years ago, vintage was a niche thing” says Blanchet. “The interest in sustainability has been tremendous because women are more conscious of the impact of what they buy. The importance of caring for our planet has democratised secondhand fashion.” Vintage enthusiasts are pushing back against disposable culture. “We elongate the life of clothes, by giving them a second life,” says Blanchet. And a well-chosen, decades-old secondhand dress may be a better investment, that will last longer in your wardrobe, than an off-the-rack high-street dress on sale today. “In the past, clothes were made and crafted to last, not to wear for only one season,” she says.Crucially, vintage no longer means retro. If the notion of a vintage red-carpet dress conjures up visions of dusty corsages and twee satin sashes, take a look at the snake-hipped, emerald-sequinned one-shoulder sheath Aboah wore last week. Only the nerdiest of fashion-watchers would have spotted that the dress was 15 years old, from Tom Ford’s final collection for Gucci. The “ultra-feminine, but modern and chic” silhouette gives the dress the contemporary aura Blanchet looks for. “I would never choose a piece that looked old, or dated. Believe me, I am as put off as anyone by the idea of looking retro.”Three years at Vestiaire Collective, the leading online resale site for designer fashion, honed Blanchet’s style instincts. Her mantra for vintage shopping is to look for clothes that look contemporary, and align with your personality. She mixes vintage with modern pieces, preferring to buy footwear new – designer heels for evening, Converse hi-tops for day – and scours vintage stores for white cotton blouses and shirts, never buying them new. “One of my biggest obsessions is my collection of Edwardian white cotton blouses and 1900s men’s shirts,” she says. Sizing, she admits, can make vintage shopping hard work. “A French size 42 from the 1970s is the same as a French size 38 now,” she explains.William Vintage operates at the high-end apex, with an edit currently on Matchesfashion that includes an Yves Saint Laurent 1968 Safari suit for £25,000. The partnership with the online retailer, which sees treasures such as a 1993 Gianni Versace flame-red bustier dress (£1,650) and a Thierry Mugler velvet and lamé mini-dress (£1,575) curated under the “brand” of William Vintage, is part of a strategy to position it as a fashion leader, alongside top catwalk designers. But sustainability in such a glamorous light may sprinkle stardust on the more affordable ranks of secondhand boutiques. The Oxfam-led Secondhand September, which hopes to inspire shoppers to buy only secondhand for this month, is intended to mimic the success of Dry January in changing the behaviour of consumers who wish to wean themselves from a dependency on fast fashion.For Blanchet, the most important part of the appeal of vintage fashion is not how ethical it is, but just how fabulous it is. “Of course, we are sustainable,” she shrugs. “By definition we are sustainable. It’s not even something we have to defend.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fa740b4c4b74c9e56347f55d0197c56b9124719/0_51_3112_1867/master/3112.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75264dc0629a84599723c4546eaa700f","title":"rihannas made for tv savage x fenty lingerie show kept under wraps","story":"Guests forced to part with their phones at event featuring Cara Delevigne, Laverne Cox and the Hadid sistersRaised cameraphones have become a ubiquitous part of cultural events over the last decade, but for her Savage x Fenty lingerie show, one of the most hyped of this fashion season, Rihanna made sure that couldn’t be the case.Guests arriving at the Barclays Arena in Brooklyn on Tuesday night were required to deposit devices into sealed pouches at the door – in large part to make sure the show remains under wraps until 20 September, when it will be exclusively streamed by Amazon Prime across 200 countries and territories, giving it a reach well beyond that of a traditional catwalk.The show opened with Rihanna and a small group of women standing stock-still on top of podiums before breaking into dance. There were performances by Halsey, A$AP Ferg and DJ Khaled, as well as appearances from models including Alek Wek, Cara Delevingne, Joan Smalls, Laverne Cox and the Hadid sisters.But it was the erse troupe of women in their underwear – made for different shapes, sizes and skin tones – who took centre stage, with their bodies doing the talking. They danced and stomped across the set routines saw them melt, like a scene from Patrick Suskind’s Perfume, into a mass of bodies, or stand in the inidual segments of a set made to mimic the architecture of the Colosseum – sometimes one would light up and one woman would dance her turn, at other times they would move as one.Camera operators scrambled to capture the action, with performers occasionally working the camera ahead of the room – a reminder that first and foremost this was made for the screen. But the live audience, which included Anna Wintour, Orange is the New Black star Dascha Polanco, as well as an excited Halima Aden, didn’t seem to mind.In a press release, Rihanna explained the thinking behind the line, with bras available from 32A to 42H and sleepwear from XS to 3X: “We want to make people look good and feel good. We want you to feel sexy and have fun doing it.”The underwear on show spoke to the traditional tropes of lingerie – often sheer, sometimes skimpy. But in other ways, the line is designed not to fit the usual mould, with much of the build-up around the show focusing on what it is not.Rihanna herself has positioned her underwear extravaganza as stepping into the vacuum being left behind by the Victoria’s Secret show. Usually a big event in the fashion calendar, this year it is absent as the brand battles with its associations with influential financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, as well as ongoing but increasingly loud criticisms about its archaic take on women’s underwear.Where Victoria’s Secret, which had its spot on network TV cancelled after last year, has historically designed lingerie with the male gaze in mind, Rihanna launched her line in 2018 with the words: “Women should be wearing lingerie for their damn selves”. Comfort is queen in the current underwear market, and athleisure-styles have been on the rise – skimpy sets that are all about “sexiness” and nothing about support are falling out of favour.As many brands will attest, empowerment sells. The Savage x Fenty underwear is already proving popular. A few days ago superstar Lizzo, who was recently described as synonymous with pop culture in 2019, posed in one of its strapless bras. The first year of sales were strong, leading, recently, to the announcement that Rihanna had secured an additional $50m in venture.The line, which is being sold through Amazon Fashion, remains separate from the rest of Rihanna’s fashion offerings, which fall under the umbrella of the luxury conglomerate LMVH, speaking to the clout she has in the industry."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6d48be5519394ceb341c9684f24af98fdef704d/0_761_5126_3074/master/5126.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=514450b1b2fe0e76be4e8300483b6121","title":"nigel slaters midweek recipe sweetcorn chowder soup","story":"Capture the last days of summer with this simple soup, made from the season’s sweetest, sunniest vegetablePeel and roughly chop 2 medium onions, then let them soften with 30g of butter and 2 tbsp of olive oil in a deep pan over a moderate heat.When the onions are soft and sticky, slice the kernels from 5 heads of sweetcorn, then set those from 1 head aside.

The title was chosen because, he laughs, this is “what everyone said”.Yet if his career numbers are low for someone who played most of his career as a No 9 – seven goals from 62 caps, 110 in 516 Premier League games – his 53 assists in the top flight is a clue to his real worth. The figure stands at only two fewer than the vaunted master-creator Paul Scholes. And when Heskey’s seventh place in the all-time appearance chart is factored in, alongside a 21-year, seven-club career that ran from 1995 to 2016 and took in Leicester City, Liverpool, Birmingham City, Wigan Athletic, Aston Villa, Newcastle Jets and Bolton Wanderers, there is further evidence of why he was so successful.The international match cited is the 5-1 victory over Germany in Munich in September 2001, Heskey scoring the fifth, before performing a mock DJ-style celebration.This highlight has top billing in what was, as he says, an impressive career. Heskey was only 18 when he was in the Leicester side that beat Crystal Palace in the 1996 First Division play-off final, drinking a full bottle of champagne afterwards, which, he writes, “finished me”.Sven-Göran Eriksson, the England manager from 2001 to 2006, was the same. “I liked him,” Heskey says. “Very meticulous in preparation. I can’t remember him coaching. But when you go on that pitch you knew everything.”After Alan Shearer retired in 2000 Heskey’s pace and presence made him Owen’s strike partner for three years until Wayne Rooney’s emergence. He expresses surprise at Owen’s recent spat with Shearer - which centred on loyalty and their time together at Newcastle United – given how close they were, “laughing and joking all the time with England”.When Heskey joined Liverpool in March 2000 the club paid a record £11m for him. By then Heskey had claimed two League Cups – in 1997 and 2000 – and been given his England debut by Kevin Keegan in a 1-1 draw with Hungary.Yet homesickness marked his beginnings on Merseyside. “It lasted six months,” says Heskey. “I had to grow up very quickly because I had kids, I had a girlfriend. I literally laid on the floor and started crying. I was like ‘What have I done? I don’t know if I have done the right thing’. But the weirdest thing was I’d go to training and I would be all right.“Then like a drop of a hat I found a barber, I found friends, a routine. Yes, it was a tough time but it was weird, I was silly and, looking back, you think: why didn’t you just go and sit with mates?”Heskey, now 41, played with a glittering array of footballers that included Scholes, David Beckham, Rooney, Ashley Cole, Sol Campbell and Steven Gerrard. While he nominates the latter as the most talented and Campbell his toughest opponent, he rates Cole the “finest” footballer of England’s so-called golden generation.In the book there is an intriguing picture of Cole as an incessant “chain-smoker” who could still keep Cristiano Ronaldo in “his pocket”. Heskey laughs again. “I don’t know what it feels like to smoke but I couldn’t imagine that it helps you a lot,” he says. Heskey is thoughtful on the issue of racism. His paternal grandfather was from Antigua, his maternal side from the nation’s other island, Barbuda. He writes of how his father, Tyrone, and mother, Albertine, arrived in Leicester aged 10 and had to deal with ugly discrimination which included having to read a sign that stated: “No Black, No Irish, No Dogs allowed.”While Heskey himself was “chased from a bar” as a teenager, this season Manchester United’s Paul Pogba and Marcus Rashford, Chelsea’s Tammy Abraham and Kurt Zouma and Reading’s Yakou Méïté have all been abused on Twitter.Heskey, too, still experiences racism. “Recently I was at an airport on the way to France and I sat down there with my drink. A woman was there with her bag on the chair. She picked it up and left. You just take it with a pinch of salt and you move on,” he says. “You can’t let it affect you.”Heskey has seven children – Jamaal, Micah and Liyah with his former partner, Kylee, and Jaden, Reigan, Milanna and Mendes with his wife, Chantelle. All will have been amused to watch the YouTube clip of him meeting Rod and Emu when their father was 11. “It was a great experience,” Heskey says. “I was on television with one of the biggest stars back then. But he kept calling me Emily.”What, then, of the future? Heskey may have no “burning desire” to coach yet he says: “I do want to have a go.” With his relaxed demeanour and deep well of experience Heskey would surely be an asset to the game.Even Heskey Scored is published on 16 September 2019 by Pitch Publishing (£19.99)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/257cd282e7edcdcb60ce1cbdfb1f4f3e8c1d2944/0_30_4495_2697/master/4495.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6f5d1fc193d067efe359aacaba6c622","title":"euro 2020 qualifying roundup cristiano ronaldo portugal france serbia czech republic","story":"• Ronaldo takes international tally to 93 in 5-1 win over Lithuania• Czech Republic leapfrog Kosovo with 3-0 victory in MontenegroPortugal captain Cristiano Ronaldo took his international goals tally to 93 when he scored four times to give the European champions a 5-1 win away to Lithuania in their Euro 2020 qualifier on Tuesday. Playing in his 161st international, the 34-year-old notched his eighth hat-trick for his country and the 54th of his career to help Portugal through what had threatened to turn into a frustrating evening.The midfielder William Carvalho completed the rout in stoppage time as Portugal stayed second in Group B with eight points, five behind the leaders Ukraine with one game in hand.Serbia are a further point behind in third after a 3-1 win in Luxembourg. Aleksandar Mitrovic scored twice to keep Serbia’s hopes of qualification alive. The Fulham striker headed the visitors in front after 36 minutes and Nemanja Radonjic curled in the second 10 minutes after the restart.Substitute David Turpel pulled one back and Serbia were on the ropes until Sergej Milinkovic-Savic produced a delightful reverse pass for Mitrovic to fire in the third 12 minutes from the end.France forward Kingsley Coman grabbed his third goal in two matches as he inspired the hosts to a 3-0 win against Andorra in Group H in Paris. Coman, who scored two in Saturday’s 4-1 win over Albania, put France ahead in the first half and hit the woodwork in the second. Clément Lenglet found the net after the break and Wissam Ben Yedder scored in stoppage time.The world champions stay second in the section with 15 points from six games, level with the leaders Turkey, who won 4-0 away to Moldova, helped by a Cenk Tosun double. Third-placed Iceland slipped three points behind the top two after being sunk by late goals for Albania from Odise Roshi and Sokol Cikalleshi in a 4-2 away defeat.France, who have the best goal-difference but are second by virtue of having lost in Istanbul in June, face a potential group decider against Turkey at the Stade de France next month. The top two teams qualify for next year’s finals.In the other game in England’s group the Czech Republic bounced back from Saturday’s surprise defeat to Kosovo with a 3-0 victory over Montenegro in Podgorica.

In 2015, Amnesty International said at least 7,000 people had died in military detention in the north-east. More recently, thousands of displaced people have been sent back to unsafe areas to provide a bulwark against Boko Haram, according to officials in Borno.More than 3,600 children, including 1,617 girls, were detained by the Nigerian armed forces between 2013 and 2019, according to data collected by the UN, though Human Rights Watch said Nigerian authorities have not allowed the UN access to military detention sites to verify these figures. It is not known how many children are currently in detention.Before arriving in Giwa barracks, several children described beatings at the hands of security forces, the report said.Ten-year-old Ibrahim said his family had fled their village after an attack by Boko Haram when he was five and had been arrested several days later by the military. “We said we escaped from Boko Haram, but the military did not believe us,” he said. “They said that we were part of Boko Haram. They hit us children with a rope of animal skin and slapped our parents with the flat end of a long knife. They beat us every day.”Saeed, 17, who was initially detained in the town of Banki, said he was beaten by the Civilian Joint Task Force, a vigilante group working with the military, in the presence of soldiers.“They asked me if I was a member of Boko Haram and beat me up when I said no. They tied my hands and legs and hung me to a tree and continued to flog me. They flogged me and left me tied to the tree from morning till evening … They shot some people and even beat others to death with sticks.”Once they arrived at the barracks, children said they had to sleep close “like razor blades in a pack”, with up to 300 people in a cell, sharing one toilet. Almost half the children who were spoken to said they had seen the dead bodies of other detainees, who some thought had died because of the heat.A spokesman for Nigeria’s defence headquarters said the military did arrest children attempting to detonate explosives and “provide tacit support to insurgents”, including information on troop movements, but that children were treated as “victims of war and not as suspects”.“Apprehended children are kept in secured places, where they are adequately fed, profiled and de-radicalised before their release,” said Onyema Nwachukwu."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1776c95aaa697176e445e162031e037acdf9cfe/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06e6afb03ba8cbe820ae4f2b28f79a0a","title":"what does living fully mean welcome to the age of pseudo profound nonsense","story":"Inspirational quotes of dubious provenance are just one of the ways in which social media sells a warped vision of ‘living fully’You’ve seen them before, because they are all over Instagram: the captions urging you to embrace your expansion, whatever that means, slow down to savor the moment, and hustle like you’re Beyoncé – all at once.“Start visualizing what you want, then say no to anything that isn’t it,” reads one. Another: “Buy the plane ticket, quit the job, plan the trip, wander into the unknown, open your heart, take the leap.”These reminders to “live fully” are omnipresent on social media platforms. We are constantly told how to live well, happily, adventurously or spontaneously. An army of experts are instructing us to wash our faces, to be a badass, and to say yes.This #inspiration strategy works because humans are wired to want significance and meaning. But what does “living fully” really mean in the age of Instagram, when anyone can wear matching yoga pants as they stand, arms outstretched and back to the camera, soaking in whatever scenic background they’ve found that day?Madi Richardson, 23, explains that if she’d been asked what “living fully” meant a few years ago, she would have said traveling. Right after high school, Richardson was following a plethora of people her age on Instagram, including some with significant followings. “The photos I saw of them were on vacations,” she explains. “Living, I guess, what seemed like everything but worry or negative emotions.” With every scroll, Richardson saw glorious summers packed full with local music festivals and scenic hikes, usually with inspirational quotes peppered in between.Soon, doubt started to creep in. Were her peers living a better, more exciting life than she was? Although she didn’t post those kinds of photos herself, she says: “There was jealousy and feelings of guilt because I didn’t go on a vacation every other weekend, or go scuba ing, jump out of a plane, or camp in the wilderness all summer.”As a photographer herself, she also had to contend with professional pressure, wondering if the better cameras or bigger cities others showcased were missing pieces to even more success.Richardson describes such curated lives as a “pecking order of excitement”, explaining that she had other responsibilities, including her own bills and pressure to attend college, that didn’t align with this narrow definition of living fully. “It took me a while to become at peace with who I am,” she says. “It wasn’t until I tried to mimic the trends that I realized: this isn’t who I am.”Dr Erin Vogel, a social psychologist who explores the influence technology has on our lives and wellbeing, says: “Social media seems to define ‘living fully’ as being adventurous, spontaneous and extroverted. For people who are fulfilled by a quieter life, social media seems to tell them that they’re living life the wrong way.”She explains what most social media users know to be true: when using social media, users often compare their lives with others’. In reality, even your most adventurous friend probably has some lackluster experiences or boring evenings spent watching Netflix.Vogel points to the unfortunate trend of people taking selfies with wild animals and getting injured as an example of how “doing it for the ’gram” can backfire. It can be a positive, she says, if it leads you to push yourself and try new things. Often, it takes you away from the present moment instead. “You may book an excursion for your next trip thinking ‘this will be fun’,” Vogel says. “But in the back of your mind, you might also be thinking about how great the pictures will be.”The same goes for quote photos, which are another element of the “highlight reel” Instagram has come to be regarded as.Gordon Pennycook, an assistant professor of behavioural science at the University of Regina, has published research on “pseudo-profound bullshit”, which he defines as things constructed without regard for the truth. He notes that it is “quite possible that ostensibly inspirational quotes could fit into the broader category”. Pennycook says this type of content spreads online because we don’t spend a lot of time thinking about it. “This is why inspirational quotes often don’t make any sense,” he explains. “Typically, it gets spread because it has some sort of intuitive or emotional appeal.”He points out that the most significant difference between the spread of inspirational quotes and the spread of fake news is that quotes generally make users feel good, while fake news provokes anger or fear. “In either case, emotionality overrides rationality,” he says.But what happens when an inidual does live fully and authentically, and is met with skepticism?When Nicole Roberts, 31, came out the other side of a bad relationship, she opted to move from San Diego to Austin for a promotion without knowing anyone there. “I had many people respond one of two ways,” Roberts says. The first was “are you crazy? You don’t know anyone there!” and the second was “Yolo! Live your life!”It bothered her, she says, to hear so many assume she had not thoroughly considered her new move. All she wanted was a change of scenery and the opportunity to grow after a stifling personal situation.That nuance – that living fully can be quiet that what looks like a grand adventure could really be a complicated personal reset that even our most inspired choices may be steeped in anxiety – goes missing when all we have are visual examples.Behind the projection of freedom, real life isn’t as neat when you’re actually living fully. It’s often messy or complicated and demands we ask ourselves questions that run deeper than advice to “create a life you don’t need a vacation from”.What makes us happy, at its core, is an existential question, according to Sara Kuburic, a psychotherapist and counselor who works with millennials. She believes inspirational tropes are popular because they offer the promise of immediate fulfillment. “I find that people increasingly conceptualize living fully as seizing opportunities, taking risks and exploring the unknown,” she says. “Living fully, in the Instagram age, is often then reduced to doing things that would be worth documenting.”But, Kuburic argues, a full life – which she defines as one full of meaning, freedom, responsibility, and grounded in an authentic relationship with yourself – is the same as it was pre-Instagram.“We are eager to live our lives fully,” she says. “Yet the pressure to prove this to our ‘friends’ is a major reason why we are not.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fa1100c858c5ea497888377ea49873a384e9266/0_374_5940_3563/master/5940.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49efd568bc7a86936655117e770632c8","title":"britten shostokovich festival orchestra jan latham koenig","story":"The two composers were separated by the Iron Curtain and language but united by their art and their deep admiration for each others’ music. A new bi-cultural orchestra inspired by their friendship pays tribute to their common causeBenjamin Britten and Dmitri Shostakovich knew of each other long before they met in 1960. Shostakovich would certainly have encountered Britten’s name in 1948 when the English composer was among western musicians attacked as “decadent and bourgeois” by the Russian composer Boris Asafiev during the debacle of the Soviet Union’s drive against formalism in music. Shostakovich was forced to repeat these words at the World Peace Congress in New York in 1949. The 23-year-old Britten first heard of Shostakovich more than a decade earlier, two months after the Russian composer’s Lady Macbeth of Mtsenk had been denounced in a famous Pravda editorial penned at Stalin’s behest – Muddle Instead of Music – criticising the work for its degeneracy and undesirable bourgeois influences. The opera was immediately banned in the Soviet Union, and Shostakovich cast into disgrace until he rehabilitated himself with his Fifth Symphony in November 1937, an offering at the shrine of socialist realism.Britten heard the opera in March 1936 at the Queen’s Hall in London: “Of course it is idle to pretend it is great music throughout – it is stage music and as such must be considered. There is some terrific music in the entr’actes. But I will defend it through thick and thin against those charges of ‘lack of style’,” he wrote. “People will not differentiate between style and manner. It is the composer’s heritage to take what he wants from where he wants – and to write music. There is a consistency in style and method throughout. The satire is biting and brilliant. It is never boring for a second … Some of the vocal writing is extravagant. But he may have special singers in mind … the ‘eminent English Renaissance’ composers sniggering in the stalls was typical – there is more music in one page of Macbeth than in the whole of their elegant output.”Writing his first opera, Peter Grimes, eight years later, Britten recalled how effective an entr’acte or interlude could be in adding cohesion to the dramatic structure. Neither did he forget that “stage music” was essential to the theatrical aspect of the genre.When the second world war broke out in September 1939, Britten and Pears were in the US, and as declared pacifists and “conchies” decided to stay. Their decision to return to the UK in 1942 was courageous, for many denigrating comments had been made about their “cowardice” in abandoning Europe. Britten was horrified by the tragedy of war and two decades later dedicated his War Requiem to four of his friends who had served in the conflict, three of whom lost their lives.Shostakovich’s compositional response to the war was more immediate, for he started on his Seventh symphony (the so called “Leningrad”) within months of the German invasion of the Soviet Union. The work was seen as a symbol of the victorious struggle against Nazism, and after its premiere in Kuybyshev (Samara), performances were given in Moscow, New York and London. Most impressive, it was performed in besieged Leningrad in August 1942 by a much depleted orchestra reinforced by soldiers. Shostakovich was at the zenith of his fame and appeared, wearing a firefighter’s helmet,  on the cover of Time magazine.Once contact with the west was re-established during Khrushchev’s 1950s thaw, Britten’s music began to be played in the Soviet Union, although initially the composer was known only for his The Young Person’s Guide to Orchestra. When he and Shostakovich eventually met in 1960 at the London premiere of the latter’s cello concerto, they felt an instant empathy. There was much to unite them: their middle-class professional backgrounds, their standing outside conventional society – if for very different reasons – and the fact that their positions were open to misunderstanding.Their friendship was nurtured by the cellist Mstislav Rostropovich, who understood how both composers suffered from the contradiction of being seen as establishment figures, while in reality they flaunted the conventions of their societies. In Shostakovich’s case, this meant making insincere political statements and unwillingly joining the communist party in Britten’s, sustaining an open homosexual relationship with his muse, Peter Pears, at a time that homosexuality was illegal in the UK.Rostropovich cajoled both composers into writing new cello works and masterminded the dedication of Britten’s opera The Prodigal Son of 1968 to Shostakovich. The return of compliments came the following year when Shostakovich dedicated his 14th Symphony to his English friend. Through its settings of poems dealing with the theme of death, the symphony was a considered response to the War Requiem of 1962, which Shostakovich considered a masterpiece. When Britten presented him with the score, he studied it avidly, taught it to students and confessed to Rostropovich that he particularly envied Britten for having created the descending and ascending whole-tone motif in the Agnes Dei.The composers kept their friendship alive by correspondence and visits. Britten was welcomed to Moscow six times, and invited Shostakovich to the Aldeburgh festival he was unable to go because of ill health. Britten compensated by programming and conducting Shostakovich’s music at his festival, and playing the piano part in such works as the cello sonata, Op 40, and Seven Romances on Poems of Alexander Blok. The Russian did eventually come to Britten’s home in Aldeburgh in 1972, when Britten showed him work in progress – his last opera, Death in Venice.Interestingly, Britten and Shostakovich had no common language except for a smattering of “Aldeburgh Deutsch”, yet were said to understand each other perfectly.It seems fitting that their friendship, built on a common perception of music as a communicating force, has been the inspiration for the formation of the Britten-Shostakovich Festival Orchestra. Founded by British conductor Jan Latham-Koenig, this bilateral British-Russian orchestra brings together together young musicians from conservatoires in both countries and is launched at a time of growing diplomatic polarisation, reminiscent of the cold war period.Shostakovich died in August 1975, Britten almost 16 months later. The pair were linked by many things, yet their moral stances in their art united them most. Shostakovich reiterated that conscience was at the base of everything and thanked the poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko for “restoring Conscience” to him through the poems that were set in his 13th Symphony of 1962.In the same year, Britten made his greatest anti-war statement: The War Requiem. Like Shostakovich, he was deeply troubled when human debts to conscience were not paid. But, above all, he believed communication was better than isolation, and that it was fundamentally necessary to “keep the doors open”. He was sure the best way of doing that was through music.• The Britten-Shostakovich Festival Orchestra tours the UK from 17-25 September.

He added: “We will know in those two weeks whether it is possible or not.”Another former Tory said: “There is an element of seeing what the next step is from No 10. A lot would be pretty hesitant about backing a referendum until all other options have been tried. But, more attractive, is a way of bringing a deal back on to the table – a version of what was agreed between May and Corbyn. And then have a confirmatory vote attached to it, or someone amends one on.”Another MP who supports a people’s vote said there were “a number of devices” that could enable MPs to bring forward May’s deal for parliament to work on, and claimed there was “lots of movement in the last 24 to 36 hours” among those trying to stop Johnson ignoring parliament’s direction to request an extension from the EU if a deal is not reached by mid-October.It comes as Ken Clarke, the veteran Tory who had the whip withdrawn last week, urged Johnson to “put together a cross-party alliance to get a deal through,” as he believed it could now achieve a majority with Labour MPs who regretted having not voted for it previously.The father of the House told the Byd yn ei Le programme on Welsh-language channel S4C that he would be willing to be an “honorific figurehead” for an alternative government seeking such a compromise if Johnson does not stitch together a deal.In scathing remarks about the state of politics, he described both Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn as representing “an absurd choice for the premiership of this country” and said the situation was the worst crisis in his political lifetime, amounting to a “tragic farce”.Parliament has repeatedly failed to find a compromise, but there are signs more opposition MPs are prepared to countenance voting for a deal.A separate cross-party group of opposition MPs formally launched a campaign to win support for Brexit via a managed deal on Tuesday.The founders, who include Labour MPs Stephen Kinnock and Caroline Flint, Lib Dem MP Norman Lamb and former Tory MP Rory Stewart – claimed up to 50 MPs may back the plan. Their proposal would involve using elements of Theresa May’s Brexit legislation as the basis for an agreement which Boris Johnson could steer through parliament, possibly in time for a 31 October departure.Those supporting a second referendum would try to amend any proposal for a deal to secure a “people’s vote”.“I think it’s pretty clear there’s a huge number of Labour MPs, Liberal Democrat MPs, SNP MPs, who would vote for any reasonable deal subject to a referendum and I think there’s now an increasing number of Conservatives and ex-Conservatives who would as well, so I think there is a majority there too.”The Labour frontbench would be sceptical about voting for any deal that was not negotiated by a Labour prime minister but could come under pressure from many of its MPs and members to compromise if it achieved a second referendum.Any such moves would increase pressure on Johnson to get his own deal with the EU and on Eurosceptic Tories to back him rather than risk a second referendum.There is still a possibility that the prime minister could climb down on his demand to entirely replace the backstop with another solution and settle for a more minor tweak to the political declaration, before putting that fresh deal to a vote and challenging the Eurosceptic holdouts to vote for it or lose the whip.However, he has so far been insistent that what he calls the “antidemocratic backstop” must be removed while the EU is adamant that is not possible, leading to a stalemate on his prospects for a negotiated deal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0aa58b974ce002db88638edc6df888f0c9348c36/0_274_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf86d8046f4a219f6c4bccd68d546a93","title":"pms pay tribute paddy ashdown tony blair david cameron john major service lib dem leader","story":"Tony Blair, David Cameron and Sir John Major attend service for former Lib Dem leaderPast prime ministers, present-day parliamentarians, diplomats and armed services personnel filled Westminster Abbey to pay tribute to former Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown, described as “ a man for ideals, not shabby deals”.Former premiers Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, David Cameron and Sir John Major joined Lord Ashdown’s widow, Jane, their two children, grandchildren and other relatives, at a service of thanksgiving.Ashdown died on 22 December 2018, aged 77, shortly after announcing he had bladder cancer.In an address that traced Ashdown’s life from “boisterous young Marine” to “elder statesman”, Major described him as a political opponent who had become a friend.He was a “national leader, not a political opportunist”. He was “never a typical politician and rarely predictable”. He was “as energetic in private as public”, Major added.“He was always an internationalist, wedded to reason and consensus and dismissive of tribal politics. A man for ideals, not shabby deals.

Buglers played Last Post and Reveille.His subsequent career as MP for Yeovil, and as Liberal Democrat leader in 1988-99, during which he turned the party into a powerful third political force, was manifest in the presence of colleagues, including the former Liberal party leader David Steel and the party veteran Shirley Williams.Recent Lib Dem leaders Sir Vince Cable, Tim Farron, and the new leader, Jo Swinson, Conservative stalwarts Kenneth Clarke and Michael Heseltine, and Labour’s Peter Mandelson were among the 2,200-strong congregation. The outgoing Speaker, John Bercow, also attended, fresh from the chaos and protests that had engulfed parliament just hours earlier, and just yards away, as it was prorogued.The former Lib Dem leader Sir Nick Clegg read from a funeral oration, attributed to Pericles: “Our constitution is called a democracy, because power is in the hands, not of a minority, but of the whole people.”Ashdown would have wanted the reading, he told the congregation. But “not even Paddy” could have guessed how a speech so long ago “could have so much relevance today” Clegg said.Ashdown’s time as high representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina and EU special representative after he stood down as an MP had been one of the highlights of “an extraordinary life”, wrote Ian Patrick, his former private secretary, in the order of service.He had “rooted out corruption, created multi-ethnic institutions, established the rule of law, brought war criminals to justice, and created a final resting place for those murdered during the Srebrenica massacres”.The grand mufti of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Husein Kavazović, gave a reading from the Qur’an at the service which was attended by Željko Komšić, a Croat member of the presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina.Jeremy John Durham Ashdown was born in New Delhi and raised in Northern Ireland – hence his nickname Paddy. His family chose The Motet by Howard Arnold Walter, set to the Londonderry Air, in tribute to his Ulster roots.“Few people surely have experienced such a variety of careers and opportunities for effective leadership as Paddy Ashdown, the Rt Hon Lord Ashdown of Norton-sub-Hamdon,” said the dean of Westminster, the very reverend Dr John Hall.“It was a magnificent occasion,” said Cable afterwards, pointing to the presence of so many past prime ministers as a reflection of Ashdown’s standing, not just as a party leader but an important national figure. The “slight sadness”, he added, was that Ashdown had died just before his party’s political recovery.Lord Steel described the service as a very special occasion. “He was a fantastic leader, and a very good friend,” he said.David Laws, who succeeded to Ashdown’s Somerset constituency, said: “We have representatives here not just from Bosnia, but from many parties and from the Commonwealth. Paddy was somebody who succeeded in punching above his weight not just in Somerset but across the world.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9b5ac300f9fadec2a33f9c1e87be04648976813/0_72_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e377d522f87b730b9a5c0906e6da93ed","title":"tell us if you have applied for welfare and benefit payments online","story":"We would like to hear about any difficulties you have experienced negotiating computer and IT systems while making a welfare or benefit claimPublic authorities are using robots, algorithms and machine learning to assess welfare and benefit claims, but the systems are often hidden inside a ‘black box’, away from public scrutiny.

(I will post a summary of his speech a bit later). This is from the Independent’s Lizzy Buchan.These are from Jolyon Maugham, director of the Good Law Project and one of the leading barristers working on the Scottish legal challenge against prorogation.From the barrister Adam Wagner.Here is my colleague Severin Carrell’s story about the Scottish court’s decision.From the BBC’s Lorna Gordon.Outside the court of session in Edinburgh the SNP MP Tommy Sheppard has just said parliament should be recalled in the light of the court of session’s judgement.Even though it will go to appeal at the supreme court, Sheppard said MPs should be able to be at parliament to represent their constituents.Joanna Cherry, his SNP colleague, says the recall should happen immediately.These are from my colleague Severin Carrell in Edinburgh.The court of session in Scotland has ruled that Boris Johnson’s decision to prorogue parliament for five weeks was unlawful.This is from Joanna Cherry, the SNP’s home affairs and justice and one of the supporters of the legal challenge.Tom Watson, Labour’s deputy leader, is due to make his Brexit speech very soon. My colleague Heather Stewart has previewed it here.On BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, the Labour MP Owen Smith, who unsuccessfully challenged Jeremy Corbyn for the leadership in 2016, said he agreed with Watson that there was no such thing as a good Brexit. Smith said:An argument in principle that there is no such thing as a good Brexit deal, that all versions of Brexit are going to leave Britain poorer and more isolated in the world, and that’s why there is no good reason why Labour should be supporting that … It’s at odds with our values, it’s at odds with the electoral interests of the Labour party and it’s at odds with the prospects for a better future for our constituents, so we should be opposed to it and we should be clear that Labour doesn’t believe Brexit is a good thing and critically we shouldn’t be bamboozled or bullied by Boris Johnson into going into an election on his terms.But the Labour MP Gareth Snell said he disagreed with Watson, and that he thought the numbers “simply do not exist in parliament for a referendum”. The public did not want a second referendum either, Snell said.Snell said he wanted MPs to have another chance to vote on the withdrawal agreement. He said:The withdrawal agreement bill, which is a very different thing – that was the outcome of the cross-party negotiations - ought to be presented to parliament as a basis on which trying to find a deal … I think minds are sharpening, I think people are seeing what damage could be done from a no-deal Brexit.Andrea Leadsom, the business secretary, has been doing a round of broadcast interviews this morning. Among other things, she gave a surprisingly candid reason as to why the government might not publish in full its Operation Yellowhammer no-deal Brexit planning documents. Here are the main points from her various interviews.You are right to say what potentially might happen. Yellowhammer is, as you know, the reasonable worst case scenario. It is by no means a prediction of anything. It’s simply the government looking at every possible angle and ensuring that we have measures in place to deal with that.Walker persisted. Businesses wanted to know what might happen, he said. Then Leadsom replied:I actually do not think that it serves people well to see what is the absolutely worst thing that could happen. The worst thing that could happen to me is I could walk out of here and get run over. It is not a prediction, but it is something that could happen. And simply putting out there all of the possible permutations of what could happen actually just serves to concern people. Whereas what the government is doing is working flat out to ensure that in all circumstances, including in the event of no deal, we have a smooth transition for the United Kingdom. There is so much work underway to make sure that in all circumstances the UK will absolutely thrive once we leave the European Union.In leaving the EU it will be our government that’s able to determine our migration policy and that’s incredibly important. Now we get to decide and instead of being open to free movement from just the EU, the UK will be able to take advantage of a global talent pool of young people and workforce coming from all around the world and that’s something that’s a great advantage for us.As Sarah Ludford, a Lib Dem Brexit spokesperson later pointed out, Leadsom was wrong to say that being in the EU stops the UK admitting talented migrants from outside Europe.Leadsom might have been trying to make the argument that, because free movement does not allow the UK to stop people from the EU entering the country to work, it does put a constraint on how many workers from outside the EU the government might want to accept if it is worried about overall numbers.There is a move in opinion polls that suggests that migration is now increasingly popular.Well we will not do anything that undermines the UK or indeed UK internal market. So we are looking at getting a deal, getting a good deal that works for the UK and for the EU that is different to the one that was negotiated previously because that couldn’t get through Parliament. Here is the agenda for the day.10am: Tom Watson, Labour’s deputy leader, gives a speech on Brexit. As Heather Stewart reports, he will contradict Labour’s official policy on the subject, saying a referendum should come before a general election and that Labour should back remain in all circumstances.10am: Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, gives a speech to the TUC.10am: The court of session in Edinburgh will hear an appeal against its decision to reject a legal challenge against the government’s decision to prorogue parliament for five weeks.12pm: The high court in London will give its reason for deciding to reject a separate legal challenge against prorogation.As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web.

Soon after becoming prime minister he wrote: “It cannot be right that so many GPs and consultants are leaving the service or cutting their hours, for fear of whopping tax bills.”The DHSC has launched a consultation on three planned key “new flexibilities for GPs, senior nurses and consultants”. If implemented, such staff would be able to choose at the start of the tax year how much their pension pot should grow by and adjust their contributions accordingly.Senior staff would also be able to “fine-tune their pension growth towards the end of the tax year” once they know how much work they have done in those 12 months. In addition, if high-earners receive a big pay rise, they would be able to phase in over several years how much of that goes into their pension.This is the second set of plans ministers have brought forward to tackle an issue that is disrupting care and exacerbating NHS understaffing. However, groups representing doctors gave the plans only a lukewarm response and warned that reform needed to go much further.“It’s a useful contribution to the work that is needed to reform pension taxation laws but, while the options within this consultation will help alleviate the issues, they will not resolve it,” said Dr Phil De Warren-Penny, deputy co-chair of the consultants committee at the British Medical Association.He urged ministers to scrap the tapered annual allowance, annual allowance and lifetime allowances introduced in 2016. Doctors said those measures are the main reason they have been clobbered with big bills.Dr John West of the Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association was also sceptical. The plans would make already complicated pension arrangements even more complex.“The government is essentially gambling with patient care. These proposals will be certain to fuel a bonanza for financial advisers but it is less clear whether they will help address the current unravelling of services,” he said.“There is a strong likelihood that doctors will go for the easy route of ensuring their pay stays below the tax thresholds that trigger huge tax bills.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27eca0ce6ef81e66887c84b2d63cd934b80b1223/0_193_8507_5107/master/8507.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f1fc7386b61afe5a7c5c43f5d812921","title":"stuart etherington ncvo brexit curbing influence charities","story":"The outgoing chief of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations says civil society still has a vital role to play in people’s livesAfter 25 years at the helm of the flagship for charities in England, Sir Stuart Etherington finds himself being piped ashore to the familiar strains of a row over charity bosses’ pay. “It’s something that will keep coming back,” he says resignedly. “We have to keep trying to explain.”As chief executive of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO), explaining and justifying how charities pay staff, how they fundraise and how they safeguard those they work with has consumed much of Etherington’s time recently, as controversies have raged over all three issues. It has, he acknowledges, often kept him on the back foot when he needed to be making the sector’s case to governments increasingly distracted by other things – not least Brexit. “In a very limited way, we have continued to have relationships with government,” he says. “I don’t think it’s reasonable to say we don’t have any influence at the moment, but it’s certainly reasonable to say our influence is less than it was, simply because they’re not interested in policies other than getting this stuff through.”Guidance on a no-deal Brexit issued by the NCVO to its members this week warns of possible “dire consequences” for the economy and the context in which charities work, including the potential loss of at least £258m of EU funding for the voluntary sector. Tellingly, though, Etherington declined to add NCVO’s name to a round-robin letter signed by other charity umbrella groups and charities in protest at the prorogation of parliament. With the streets teeming with demonstrators, he says he does not see evidence of civil society being muzzled. “This is constraining representative democracy,” he argues. “There is an element of participative democracy that should be defending representative democracy, but that’s not what the letter said. It said the government was closing down the space for civil society. There’s no evidence that is the case.”Critics will see that answer as typical of someone they think has been too reluctant to take on the government and too slow to respond to a changing environment. Even a new authorised history of NCVO, commissioned by Etherington and the organisation’s board but given free rein, concludes: ”We finish the story with it searching for a new role, in the absence of a supportive state, with a question mark over how well attuned it is to the new forms of social action that have emerged over the past decade.”Etherington, 64, freely admits that his style has been to work behind the scenes rather than stride out with banners waving. While others were going public with concerns about so-called gagging clauses in government contracts, he was extracting a letter of clarification from Theresa May that charities delivering services would remain free to speak out. “It’s a reasonably powerful letter that we can wave under people’s noses,” he says.When he steps down next week, in NCVO’s centenary year, he will leave a record of solid growth to around 14,000 members and £8.4m annual income, – though that has dipped from a peak of more than £10m – and an unrivalled profile as the sector’s senior spokesman. Not bad for a working-class boy who failed the 11-plus.Etherington says that the early days of the Blair government, from 1997 into the new century, were golden years for NCVO and what was then termed the third sector, chiming with New Labour’s “third way”. Money was flowing into public services, and charities were seen as key delivery partners, with seats at the top table and a voice in policymaking. He now sees David Cameron’s ill-fated “big society” vision as arguably a missed opportunity to regain that level of influence. “Perhaps we could have made more of that,” he muses, but adds that it was hard to try to shape the inchoate idea when Cameron and his advisers were antipathetic to traditional infrastructure bodies like NCVO, and charities were being battered by austerity. “It was difficult to say let’s look at the positive aspects of big society when our members were saying: ‘Hang on, Stuart, we’re closing.’”May made a speech on the voluntary sector while prime minister, he recalls, in which she coined the term “shared society”. “There was nothing to get hold of. We wrote letters saying we’d like to come to talk about the shared society, and what it might mean, but, no, nothing.” There was also a new civil society strategy, published last year, but “not a lot of that has been implemented”.And now the Boris Johnson era, however short it may turn out to be. Last week, Etherington had his first and only meeting with the new civil society minister, Diana Barran, a former charity leader who sits in the House of Lords and is the fifth person in the job since 2014. The conversation was described by the NCVO as “positive and constructive”, but was dominated by Brexit issues, including the need for detail – conspicuously absent from last week’s spending review – on what exactly is going to replace money from the European Social Fund and other EU pots that underpins many charity projects.He has never seen his role as that of cheerleader for charities, however. When there has been bad practice, he has called it out. Eyebrows were raised when he agreed to lead the 2015 inquiry into the fundraising controversy in response to concerns over charities’ high-pressure techniques. This led to reforms including creation of the Fundraising Regulator, which he thinks has worked “reasonably well” in curbing the worst excesses. There have been no subsequent scandals, he notes, and he hopes the issue may have been put to bed by a combination of those measures and the new data protection rules.He is less confident about the more recent safeguarding controversy, sparked by revelations of sexual abuse by Oxfam and Save the Children aid workers. He thinks it will be difficult to eradicate such episodes overseas, not least because manipulative abusers are drawn to the work in often isolated settings. From next month, NCVO will be hosting an online library of training materials for UK charities, which, he agrees, need to sharpen their awareness of safeguarding issues.Managers’ pay is making headlines again after it emerged that sexual health charity Marie Stopes International last year paid its chief executive £434,000, half of which was a performance-related bonus. The Charity Commission says it is “now looking closely” at senior pay in the sector and collecting data for a forthcoming report. Action against inidual charities may follow.Etherington, who is paid £145,734, thinks charities should be required to match NCVO’s transparency by naming their higher earners – above “say, £60,000 or £70,000” – and explain how their salaries are arrived at by way of benchmarking the roles. He says he is “not a great fan” of performance-related pay and does not think charities should pay unconsolidated bonuses. But he knows that his successor, Karl Wilding, will repeatedly have to defend the payment of any remuneration against critics who, he says, still think charities are “all run by volunteers off kitchen tables”.Wilding, currently NCVO’s director of public policy and volunteering, has already begun work on a new strategy for the organisation. “I don’t know what that will look like, it’s none of my business,” says Etherington. “But the time is right for NCVO to move to a position where it is on the front foot.” One piece of advice that the departing chief has been giving his successor, publicly, in recent months has been to ensure that charities are able to preserve the authenticity of what they are and what they do. Growth, he cautions, should never be seen as an end in itself. “We’re talking a values proposition,” he says. “That’s about altruism and that’s not the same proposition as the market. It doesn’t really matter what size you are.”Education: Sondes Place secondary modern school, Dorking, Surrey Brunel University, London (BSc politics and CQSW social work) University of Essex (MA social planning) London Business School (MBA) SOAS, University of London (MA international relations).Career: 1994-present: chief executive, National Council for Voluntary Organisations 1991-94: chief executive, Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID) 1987-91: director of public affairs, RNID 1985-87: director, Good Practices in Mental Health 1983-85: policy adviser, British Association of Social Workers 1980-83: researcher, Circle 33 housing association 1977-79: social worker, Hillingdon council, west London.Public: Knighted for services to the third sector, 2010."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b072d431ea899643781ff9fea0dd8ed2fbb8e84c/0_495_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c8417ce81d3b811a8520963daa54a33","title":"testosterone postmenopausal women uk hormone","story":"Hormone is critical treatment for those experiencing reduced libido in midlife, say expertsThe lack of availability of testosterone for postmenopausal women in the UK is morally wrong, an expert has said.The criticism comes after a taskforce brought together by the International Menopause Society (IMS) found testosterone could help women with hypoactive sexual desire dysfunction (HSDD), asignificantly reduced interest in sex after menopause.Testosterone for women is not licensed by the UK’s regulatory authorities and is only available privately.“There is something really morally wrong about it when men are allowed to get testosterone and Viagra prescribed on the NHS, but women can’t get testosterone formulated for their sexual needs,” Newson said.The IMS’s global position statement on the use of the hormone for women was published this month and follows years of debate. It confirms postmenopausal women with HSDD can benefit from improved sexual desire, arousal, orgasm and pleasure, as well as reduced distress about sex.The statement points out that the evidence does not support the use of testosterone for any other symptoms or medical condition.The Royal College of General Practitioners and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists welcomed the statement.Prof Susan Davis, the IMS president, said: “This position statement has far-reaching global consequences. It reassures clinicians that a trial of testosterone therapy is appropriate for women with HSDD.”Sharon Parish, professor of clinical medicine at the Weill Cornell Medicine facility in New York, added: “The global position statement has been developed, approved and endorsed by a broad group of experts from international women’s health, sexual medicine, endocrine, gynaecological and menopause societies across the world.”“The key message is that testosterone clearly has positive benefits on sexual function and minimal side effects and low-risk profiles, and is a very important and critical treatment option for postmenopausal women with HSDD.”Though testosterone is often perceived as the male hormone, women produce three times as much as oestrogen before the menopause. It plays an important role in sexual arousal, sexual response, libido, bone strength, cardiovascular health, cognitive performance, energy levels and wellbeing in women. Many women with reduced levels of the hormone find that taking testosterone improves their stamina and energy levels, both physically and mentally.Testosterone is not licensed for women and those who are prescribed it have to use testosterone packaged for men.Haitham Hamoda, a consultant gynaecologist and chair of the British Menopause Society, said: “We’ve been using testosterone in the NHS for a couple of decades for women who tell us that they are worried by their lack of sexual drive.“But because it’s not licensed and packaged for women, I have to give them sachets designed for men. Men use one sachet a day but women have to ide that sachet over 10 days. This is obviously messy and tricky. There’s a definite need to have a female preparation but we can’t control companies’ commercial decisions.”Meg Matthews, the former music PR who has become a prominent campaigner on the menopause, takes testosterone. “I use it every two days to get back my libido,” she said.Nick Panay, a consultant gynaecologist who was on the IMS panel, said the benefits of testosterone for women were clear. He advised that women contact the Department of Health to get the hormone licensed in the UK, “because they’re much more likely to listen to women than to us”.A spokesperson for the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency said: “The MHRA will evaluate any application submitted to it as part of the normal licensing procedures for medicinal products. All applications are evaluated on the evidence and data (safety and efficacy) generated in support of the usage proposed for the medicinal product in the particular indication.”The Department of Health declined to comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de7248787883ff5992e5748bb75e0297c7fc83b1/0_75_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca5a9d2e3265b25a59d90fa92bc1ee7e","title":"trevor bayliss joe root under no pressure to give up england cricket captaincy","story":"It was very much in keeping with his slightly incurious nature that Trevor Bayliss, in his final press conference as England head coach, had no idea the man who hired him four years ago had been knighted in the previous evening’s honours list.Andrew Strauss, now Sir Andrew Strauss, recruited Bayliss in 2015 off the back of a trophy-laden record in limited-overs cricket but also because of his reputation as an old-school Aussie who would relax the players after the more intense regimes of Andy Flower and Peter Moores.The mission, Bayliss was told, was to help a promising generation of England players win their first men’s World Cup and it was accomplished on 14 July this summer when Eoin Morgan lifted the trophy at Lord’s after the gut-wrenching super-over drama of that final against New Zealand.Two months on, Bayliss heads into his last Test as head coach and while his place in English cricket history is secured by that glittering piece of ICC-branded silverware, that the Ashes urn figuratively remains in Australian hands leaves a slight sense of disappointment. It is one he shares too.“I’m a traditionalist,” replied Bayliss, when asked about his reputation as a white-ball specialist. “I prefer Test match cricket. I’ve been lucky enough to have been in charge of a few white-ball teams who have won. Winning the World Cup was where England had to make the biggest turnaround in their cricket.“Test cricket hasn’t gone as well as we would have liked. I think we’ve had more wins than losses but trying to find the depth in our Test ranks, as we have in our one-day team, will be a challenge going forward.”Bayliss is just about “in the black”, as he puts it, with 26 Test wins, 25 defeats and seven draws. There have been highs along the way – the 2015 Ashes victory at home, as well as away series wins in South Africa (2016-17) and Sri Lanka last winter – but also some heavy defeats on the road. This week at the Oval they must defend a record of having never lost a series at home under his watch.Ben Stokes bowled in training on Tuesday, meaning Chris Woakes for Craig Overton may be the only change from the defeat at Old Trafford. The tourists, 2-1 up and having retained the Ashes already, can at least be denied a first outright win on English soil since 2001.When asked if the players owe him one last performance, the reply came that “they owe themselves one”. Bayliss in a nutshell. Because for all the talk of results and records, the man himself has maintained since day one in the job that coaches “have had their day in the sun” and in cricket it is the players who win and lose. The primacy of the captain is very much part of this.But while this hands-off, player-empowering method has worked with Morgan and the one-day team, the Test side looks in need of more TLC. Joe Root, in particular, has struggled to stamp an identity as captain and, with his batting returns on the slide, there is a sense that the next head coach must take up more of the slack.Bayliss has witnessed 26 debuts during his tenure and yet not a single batting mainstay has been found. He describes Lancashire’s Haseeb Hameed as the most baffling – even if he, typically, forgot his name – but believes county cricket is not delivering. He fancies there are too many domestic teams, something which will rankle with those who saw him as a selector who rarely attended county games.And then there is the issue about the message of “positivity” which gets brought up after every blow-out by the Test side. They have been bowled out for under 100 four times and posted only 16 totals over 400 in 110 innings, but Bayliss maintains he is misunderstood in this regard.He said: “I seemed to spend two or three years talking to you guys about what that meant. It wasn’t hitting fours and sixes. What we’ve attempted to do in the team is play smart cricket. Everyone spoke about doing the hard yards. That’s been an adage the whole time.”How then does he score his time with England? “I’m a hard marker, so I’ll say five. I gave the guys four, five, six out of 10 for their fielding because I always thought there was room for improvement. If you give them eight, nine or 10, there’s no room for improvement, is there?”Along with a distrust of modern trappings such as social media – “I’ve got no interest in what you’re doing and I’ve got less interest in you knowing what I’m doing” – this is the kind of home-spun charm that has enamoured Bayliss to his players and yet left people on the outside slightly baffled about his approach.But whatever one’s take, this old-school Aussie leaves the role having delivered on his brief of delivering the World Cup.

She can see the hero where others can’t, and if only people could look past the social awkwardness, and the thinly disguised selfishness, and the various nasty businesses, then they would surely realise what heroic qualities truly are.Indeed, perhaps this knighthood foreshadows how someone who has herself exhibited these characteristics in her own career could go on to a highly successful second act in the political commentary box, or on the board of one of the better arms firms. Perhaps in retirement, that someone too will become the effervescent opposite of her playing self. Or perhaps she will grind out the rest of her remorseless innings pointing at potholes for the local constituency paper, as Mrs May was doing this week.Anyway, a recap of the facts: in 1998, Boycott was convicted by a French court of assaulting his then‑girlfriend, a verdict off which he continues to smash soundbites with outrageous abandon. Those who regard no morning as complete if they haven’t lost their shit with Radio 4’s Today programme were certainly given what they wanted on Tuesday, as Boycott was interviewed on the news of his knighthood. “I don’t give a toss about her, love,” was his retort to Martha Kearney’s mention that the chief executive of Woman’s Aid had called his knighthood “extremely disappointing”.So as every reader of the sports pages already knows, this is what you’re dealing with. You always were. Apart from Boycott’s forthcoming acquisition of an honour that ghastly businessmen mostly pay for, nothing – to coin a phrase – has changed. Those who don’t trouble themselves with sport seem to be waking up not just to the news that Boycott has received a knighthood, but that he works for the BBC. Even so, it is not 2005 again.His domestic violence conviction is a longstanding matter of record, and frequently written about by many of us. I see I most recently mentioned it at the end of June. But he didn’t honour himself. Of much more immediate concern, then, must be the person who decided to do so, despite the above. We know all about Geoffrey Boycott. What does this knighthood tell us about Theresa May?We certainly know May continued to adore her childhood cricketing hero, even after his conviction, as did many who found themselves disappointed by, say, the plodding commentary of Ian Botham. But even accounting for this, to knight him is something different.Plenty of people couldn’t believe the domestic violence of Boycs. Was Theresa May one of those? She wouldn’t have been alone. Sports writer Ian Wooldridge described Boycott’s assault charge as “a hiccup in his personal life”, adding that he would “be happy to appear as a character witness on his behalf in a court case still hanging over his head in France”. It is at least difficult to imagine a column like that being written nowadays (even if the current parliamentary sketchwriter of the Times does appear to think his job is to be character witness for the prime minister). Yet if May didn’t accept the conviction, it is remarkable. She was not otherwise famously soft on law and order, nor given to believing the best of people.Or did May believe it but not mind? Again, this would not be of a piece with the May worldview, where redemption and second chances were not in ready supply.Perhaps the most realistic verdict is that she preferred not to think about it, just as she seems to have preferred not to think about the impact of her own egregious acts.Many of us turn a blind eye to certain aspects of our heroes May’s ability to overlook such a monumental one as far as Boycott was concerned suggests a deep personal need to do so. Here was a man regarded as socially inept, never mixing with his teammates during his playing years, or his commentary box colleagues thereafter. Here was a man whose guiding principle was a uniquely selfish form of caution allied to a warped yet clearly intense idea of public service. Here was a man who for many was completely unwatchable, and who for all his glaring character flaws never appeared capable of reflection. Here was a man whose brief England captaincy ended in failure and humiliation.Yet here was a man who, despite enduring the slings and arrows of opponents and teammates alike, will nonetheless be regarded as an all-time great, and who will – especially now – regard himself as having won. Looked at like that, the question is not “how could Theresa May knight Geoffrey Boycott?” – but “how could she not?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3595aba7993014ffc0d2e0e1a1a95388ded21ff/0_345_5311_3187/master/5311.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4efbab9cec605453f04906b6eee423fc","title":"talking horses oisin murphy forsakes leger for champion bid with deirdre horse racing tips","story":"Oisin Murphy, who is on his way to becoming Britain’s champion jockey, has turned down the chance to win his first Classic in favour of a rare return home for the Irish ChampionOisin Murphy, who is on his way to becoming Britain’s champion jockey, has turned down the chance to win his first Classic on Saturday in favour of a rare return home for the Irish Champion Stakes. The Killarney man could have been on Dashing Willoughby in the St Leger at Doncaster but will instead continue his association with Deirdre, who will be cheered on by a TV audience in her native Japan.When it became clear last week that the two races would clash, there was really no decision for Murphy to make. He explains: “When you ride the Japanese horses, you commit a long way in advance and once you’re committed, you don’t change your mind.”Murphy is familiar with the Japanese racing culture from his time riding there last winter. He pulled off a shock success aboard Deirdre in Goodwood’s Nassau Stakes last month, making her the first runner from Japan to win a British Group One race in 19 years, and the jockey is delighted to be climbing aboard her again.Even so, he had hoped to be able to ride in the Leger as well, until the announcement that the Irish Champion would be run two hours earlier than expected, partly to allow it to be shown on Japanese television. The Leopardstown contest will now start just 40 minutes after the Doncaster Classic, meaning jockeys have no hope of shuttling between the two as they have done in the past. Murphy smoothed things over with Andrew Balding, trainer of Dashing Willoughby, now to be ridden by William Buick.“She’s in super form,” Murphy added of Deirdre, having partnered her on the Newmarket gallops on Tuesday morning in front of a contingent of Japanese media. “She’s definitely in the same condition as she was leading up to Goodwood. She’s very fit, that’s for sure, and she’s held her weight very well. I’m thrilled, really looking forward to Saturday. It’s a big race for any jockey but particularly when you’re going back on home turf.“I’ll be disappointed if she doesn’t run very well because they couldn’t have done a better job with her. I’m pleased Leopardstown have stepped in and made it possible for people in Japan to see the race. Obviously, I’d have preferred if the race didn’t clash with the Leger but that’s a debate for another time. There’ll be a lot of people in Japan watching this race.”The 24-year-old Murphy has ridden more than 800 winners since arriving in Britain six years ago but has had few opportunities to impress in front of his home crowd and last year’s Irish Champion, which he won aboard Roaring Lion, remains one of just two Irish successes to his name. The bookmakers make it a 12-1 shot that he will land the race again this weekend.“It’s very competitive. I think Magical will probably go off favourite. If Deirdre runs to her Goodwood level, that’ll make sure she runs a really good race and she’ll be close but she’s going to have to improve a little bit to win.” He picks out Headman as a significant danger.This trip to Leopardstown is a brief ersion from Murphy’s determined attempt to become champion jockey, a battle that will end next month, and he is not remotely tempted to take it easy at this late stage. “I know I’m 28 in front but I’d like to keep riding winners. September is normally a very good month for Andrew and I’d like to continue that.”Wednesday’s best bets will appear here later."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e3950c363cf483eda1ebf23a720cc9b61f307ca/0_0_500_300/master/500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79565d7b975bf475f50b6986340726fe","title":"rugby world cup 2019 scotland team guide","story":"Without a Plan B Scotland loiter on the fringes of being World Cup contenders but on their day can be world beatersWithout a Plan B Scotland loiter on the fringes of being World Cup contenders but on their day can be world beatersIf this is the most wide-open World Cup to date, Scotland sit just outside the realm of credible winners. They are not going to win this tournament, not because they are incapable of beating the best in the world on their day, but because they have proved time and again they cannot make it their day more than once in a while. A lack of heft on the ball-carrying front is a problem, as is the simple virtue of discipline. It places great onus on their skill and pace, which are of the highest order but, by the nature of such qualities, unstable, even ephemeral. The search for that priceless asset, another way to play – or Plan B, as it is so often called – goes on. Encouraging evidence of another way was submitted in the second of their recent warm-up games against France, when they recovered from the sort of rout they remain susceptible to in the first Test in Nice to find a way to victory in the second at Murrayfield. It was almost a relief to see them respond with the sort of victory one might describe as “chiselled out”. For all that, when we think of Scotland, we think of their two most recent outings against England. In 2018’s Calcutta Cup at Murrayfield, they played the rugby of the gods, the kind that could make anyone believe they were world-beaters. Finn Russell and his myriad runners tore the second best team in the world at the time to shreds. It was “their day”, all right. Then, as surely as night follows their day, Scotland travelled to Dublin in the next round and imploded. But the madness of 2019’s Calcutta Cup encapsulated this Scotland vintage as well as any game: 31-0 down after half an hour 38-31 up with three minutes to play 38-38 at the death. Scotland are not dissimilar to this England vintage – richly gifted in attack, all too often all over the place in defence. What they lack, which England do not, is a heavyweight’s punch in the ball-carrying department. Hence their loitering on the fringes of the genuine contenders. But no one will particularly want to face them, not even New Zealand or South Africa, their likely opponents should they reach the quarter-finals. In order to get there, Scotland must negotiate a pool of moderate difficulty. That said, if each pool might be judged by its third-ranked team, Pool A is theoretically the hardest, with Japan ranked higher than Fiji, Argentina or Italy of the others. Scotland will open with all guns blazing against Ireland, their chances of winning directly linked to how accurately they are shooting, but the game that will likely decide the pool is their final-round fixture against the hosts in Yokohama, where the final will be played. It is a reflection of the changing order of world rugby – at least outside the top six – that Japan against Scotland is no one’s idea of a gimme. It ought to be a spectacular match, two teams of deadly speed and skill playing for high stakes. Scotland might be defending the old order in such a contest, but they will do so playing rugby of the future."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b673550f48943c4d1f9fc796d4a705fa88476a75/1080_540_1560_936/master/1560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91f39ccd6a9657c19fee94e8b97bf628","title":"richard blackwood interview comedian tv actor typical","story":"Comedian, TV presenter, pop star … the ‘British Will Smith’ was geared for Hollywood stardom until his life came crashing down. Now, in a powerful play about death in custody, he’s making a fresh bid for stardom ‘People are going to come to the show thinking ‘Does Richard think he’s going to pull this off? OK, let’s see.’” Richard Blackwood is taking his best guess at the motivations of the audience at London’s Soho theatre. When I meet him at the start of a run of Typical – the one-man show he starred in at the Edinburgh fringe and which has now transferred – his mood is pugilistic.The show is a retelling of the real-life story of British-Nigerian Christopher Alder, a commended and decorated paratrooper from Hull, who died on the floor of a Humberside police station while officers stood around, with some accused of making monkey noises. It’s a shocking story that playwright Ryan Calais Cameron decided to retell with the permission of Alder’s family.You might think the challenging, staccato text is beyond an actor whose last major role was on EastEnders. That’s exactly what Blackwood is banking on. “You’re going to think I can only be funny, you’re going to think that I can’t do an accent,” he says. “And then I’m going to blow you out the park.”Blackwood, who remembers the Alder case at the time, admits he struggled with the complexities of the play at first but now sees the casting as fate. “I believe that the role was written for me to play,” he says. “I don’t think it was a fluke. I don’t think it was accident. I think that it’s very much my calling to do this.”More muscly than in his late-90s pomp, when Blackwood tells a painful story his face contorts and the specks of grey in his hair and his wrinkles give the narrative added weight. It’s not hard to see him play a middle-aged black British man who has been chewed up and spat out by life, because something similar happened to him.At the turn of the millennium, Blackwood – the stepbrother of Naomi Campbell – was one of the UK’s biggest entertainment stars. He had his own chatshow, he co-hosted on Top of the Pops and he’d just signed a £1m record contract. Dubbed the “British Will Smith”, Blackwood had every reason to believe that a lucrative career on the other side of the Atlantic was awaiting him. “I was just in this bubble thinking I had the Midas touch,” he says. “Hollywood felt like a given. When I got signed in America I thought, ‘OK, I’m now ready for the next stage.’”Blackwood says Hollywood was always the dream as a schoolboy he had memorised Eddie Murphy’s hit standup special, Delirious, in its entirety. Blackwood was signed by veteran agent Jeff Berg, who arranged meetings between him and major directors and producers, but there was just one problem: Blackwood couldn’t act.Hosting TV shows, he could rely on his improvisational skills, but when he went for a meeting with Terminator: Salvation director McG, who had just had a hit with Charlie’s Angels, it dawned on him that his big chance had come too early and he couldn’t ad-lib his way out of it. “I came in to his house in the Hollywood hills and he was watching a video of me on the big screen,” says Blackwood, who was preparing to appear in Fastlane, a cop show set in New York. “So McG says: ‘You can do a New York accent, right?’ I said, ‘No, I can’t.’ He just looked at me. I was out of my comfort zone.”McG was telling Blackwood how he had him in mind for a remake of Walter Hill’s The Warriors, but without the acting chops, he knew the dream was about to turn sour. “I wanted to shout, ‘Stop!’ Because it was like, ‘I can’t do all these things, that’s not me.’ When I came back home, that’s when I realised you look at America, and want to be out there so bad. But you need to be ready for America.”Out in LA, Blackwood’s life started to unravel. He was staying in the expensive Beverly Wilshire hotel because, he was told, a future star needed to look the part. But no money was coming in and when auditions failed to generate roles, his costs on both sides of the Atlantic began to mount. In 2003, a combination of debt and the implosion of his personal life drove him to try to take his own life.“Bankruptcy happened, my son’s mother left me, and my grandmother – who is essentially like my mother – went into hospital before she died, on the same day,” says Blackwood. “I was broken. One of those things was enough to kill you but all three happening on one day was too much.” An ex-girlfriend stopped Blackwood from going through with it. “It could have gone that way and if it wasn’t for her I would not be here.”But for all the talk of America, it’s the UK where Blackwood feels he still has a point to prove. “I don’t want to be overlooked over here any more,” he says. “I’m not just average. I never have been.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b4e78fd10b6dd6d598ed1e43b36ce729a76f8fb/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d00e551019926285c91aee953ed1b6c2","title":"iphone 11 apple launches new pro smartphones with better cameras","story":"iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max have faster processors, better screens, and new double and triple camera systemsApple has launched its latest iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max featuring new cameras, improved screens, faster processors and longer battery life.Announced at Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, California on Tuesday, the iPhone 11 series of smartphones carries on where the iPhone XS, XS Max and XR left off last year.The new iPhones feature similar designs and screen sizes with slim bezels and the Face ID notch at the top, which was first introduced in 2017 with the iPhone X. A variety of new colours will also be available, with a new matt finish on the back of the iPhone 11 Pro.The iPhone Pro will be available in two sizes, with either a 5.8-inch (147mm) or 6.5-inch (165mm) screen. The improved Super Retina XDR OLED displays have a higher resolution, are brighter and have better colour, and are more efficient on battery.The big new addition for this year’s iPhone is a square lump on the back, which contains a triple camera system for the iPhone 11 Pro. The three 12-megapixel cameras work together in a similar way to the dual-camera system of the previous iPhones, combining an ultra-wide angle, a main and a telephoto camera for zooming from 0.5x to 2x, similar to rivals’ products.Apple said it paired all three cameras for colour and exposure in the factory, pushing the iPhone as a film-making system for both shooting and editing video.The new cameras also offer better low-light performance with a new night mode – a current pain point for consumers – as seen in rival phones. Apple says the phones also produce better all-round, more detailed images using advanced computational photography, and that its new HDR system allows superior lighting.Apple also upgraded the TrueDepth selfie camera to 12 megapixels, enabling wider photos and shooting up to 4K at 60 frames per second. The selfie camera can also now shoot slow-motion video.Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, said: “For those that want something that truly pushes the limits, this is the iPhone 11 Pro. The most powerful and advanced iPhones we’ve ever produced in a stunning new design.”The 6.1-inch iPhone 11 – the direct replacement for the iPhone XR – gains a dual-camera version of Apple’s new system, supplanting the single camera from last year and adding a 12-megapixel ultra wide-angle camera to the traditional 12-megapixel camera. The new cheaper iPhone can also capture video from both cameras at up to 4K at 60 frames per second. Apple claimed it shoots the highest quality video in a smartphone, apart from the iPhone 11 Pro.The iPhone 11 has the same 6.1-inch LCD as the iPhone XR, and the same aluminium and glass build, but now with tougher glass.All the new iPhones also have the new, faster A13 Bionic chip, which Apple says is both the fastest CPU and GPU in a smartphone ever.Apple said the battery on the iPhone 11 was capable of lasting one hour longer than the iPhone XR, which was already the longest-lasting iPhone in the firm’s history. It said the iPhone 11 Pro would last four hours longer than the iPhone XS, and the iPhone 11 Pro Max five hours longer than the iPhone XS Max.Both iPhone 11 Pros also ship with a faster 18W charger in the box, something others have been doing for years.Apple has also improved its Face ID facial recognition system, implemented the new wifi 6 standard and faster wireless charging.One big missing feature for the iPhone is support for the latest 5G networks, which recently launched in the UK, US and elsewhere. While the availability of the new significantly faster mobile networks is limited at the moment, the rollout is expected to reach many major towns and cities by the end of 2019.Samsung, OnePlus and other predominantly Chinese smartphone manufacturers all have at least one 5G model on sale, giving them a significant advantage in the new era of mobile connectivity.With a trade war between the US and China likely to affect Apple’s growth in the Chinese market, and potentially increasing the cost of the iPhone elsewhere thanks to tariffs, the next few years may prove difficult. Apple will be banking on the top-end appeal of its most expensive iPhone 11 Pro to continue where the iPhone XS Max left off, while the cheaper iPhone 11 appeals to a wider market by competing more directly on price with the likes of Samsung.The iPhone 11 will cost $699 in the US (£729 in the UK, A$1,199 in Australia), $50 less than the iPhone XR from last year. The iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max will cost from $999 (£1,049 in the UK, A$1,749 in Australia) and $1,099 (£1,149 in the UK, A$1,899 in Australia), and will ship on 20 September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30f7ae0e50398b97474581a1ed4b1056b6bfa268/0_0_5690_3414/master/5690.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4abb4adfcefaaa6e9b08ff475f002cff","title":"utrecht alternative city guide food drink beer bars culture","story":"Utrecht’s picturesque city centre and traditional cafe culture rub up against its exciting music and art scene – and it’s best explored by bikeUtrecht was the most important city in the Netherlands until it was overtaken by Amsterdam in the 17th century during the Dutch golden age of trade and advances in science, art and military power. Over the years since, it has played second fiddle to its big brother in the north – but it has an obvious and growing belief in its own charms, news of which is starting to spread.It’s three years since my previous visit, and this time I hear some Utrechters complaining that the centre – a picture-postcard Dutch feast of canals, curving cobbled streets and baroque and Gothic medieval architecture – has become a little over-full of tourists. Even in high season that is very much relative, however, especially when compared with Amsterdam. In fact, it’s outside the centre that parts of the city have become hotspots lately, as new businesses look for cheaper rents, and residents and in-the-know visitors look for new hangouts off the beaten track.Rotsoord, a former industrial area south of the centre, has seen an influx of creatives, startups, independent stores, bars and restaurants in the past couple of years. Cartesius, to the west, has also been partially transformed by the arrival of various DIY venues, cafes and cultural organisations, among them cinema, cafe and club Filmcafe, art space and cafe De Nijverheid, brewery, bar and restaurant De Leckere and club venue WAS.Lombok, one of the city’s most culturally erse neighbourhoods, is home to the Utrecht Central Mosque (affectionately known as “the techno mosque” for its gigantic neon-lit minarets) and the increasingly popular thoroughfare Kanaalstraat, lined with Turkish and Moroccan grocery stores, bakeries, cafes and kebab shops.I based myself in the old centre and explored by bike. Even in the context of the Netherlands, Utrecht is an exceptional cycling city, ranking third in the world on the 2019 Copenhagenize list, and as of August 2019 is home to the world’s largest multi-storey bike park. The network of buses and trams is comprehensive (a day ticket is €6.20) but the layout of Utrecht’s ancient central streets often creates congestion, so biking really is best for anyone who can.Utrecht’s beer bars are the stuff of fantasy for beer lovers, with encyclopaedic menus, reasonable prices and only a light hipsterisation in even the newest and most cutting-edge places. The canalside Kafe Belgie opened in 1984 and is a beloved, no-nonsense institution offering around 200 brews, its looming slat-board menu watched over by a statue of the Virgin Mary tightly clutching a rainbow Pride flag. The day I visited was the hottest in the city since records began, so refreshment was my primary consideration. I had an Alfa (€2.40) and a Martin’s IPA (€4.60), and dreamed of returning when conditions were less oven-like to delve deeper into the menu.Café Olivier is another beloved central spot, with a wide beer selection and alarmingly moreish bitterballen (deep-fried beef or veal meatballs – the nation’s beer snack of choice, €6.50). De Kromme Haring, a brewpub at the end of a row of startups and restaurants in Rotsoord, is a fine example of the exciting things happening away from the centre. In the spirit of adventure I tried an Electric Clownfish, a weirdly delicious coffee milk stout made using beans from the roastery next door. Informal collaborations like this between young businesses in these areas are commonplace, and contribute to the positive, forward-looking atmosphere.Back in the old centre, the basements of buildings on the Oudegracht canal create a two-level street and, very often, two levels of bars to choose from. One evening a friend and I drank a bottle of prosecco (€27) in the sunshine at PK Kitchen before heading downstairs to the lively terrace of the Rum Club for a cocktail called I’m in Love with the Coco – a gently tart, smooth, almost chewy mix of rum, coconut cream, lime, pineapple, guava and banana (€9.50) – by the water as night fell.The cost of eating out in Utrecht is similar to London, so some knowledge of economical lunch options is useful. I found a fresh, punchy and very filling salmon and avocado poké bowl (€11.50) at Poké Perfect and a herby, creamy lamb pita (€9.50) around the corner at the Streetfood Club. My attempt to sample a Utrecht lunch institution in the form of the cheese, salami and vegetable-filled Broodje Mario was thwarted by the outlet of the same name being unexpectedly shut, but a bulging Parma ham, Old Amsterdam cheese, rocket and pesto roll (€5.25) from the nearby Broodje Ben food truck proved a satisfying alternative at a similarlylow cost.I had a memorable and far from bank-breaking dinner at the friendly SYR, where refugees and Dutch staff work together to create Syrian dishes such as mashawi (a lip-smacking mixed grill of chicken and beef skewers and lamb cutlets served with pita and a spicy muhammara dip, €18) and makdous salad (pickled baby aubergines stuffed with walnuts, red pepper and garlic, €5). An even warmer welcome awaited me at Sunshine, where I worked my way through a combination plate of Ethiopian dishes including kitfo (a dreamily succulent mix of raw beef and Ethiopian butter, €17) and gommen wot (kale with peppers, onions, garlic and chilli, €15). The charming and gregarious Andu, son of the owner, gave me a passionate mini seminar on the history and natural wonders of Ethiopia and even taught me a few words of his native language.Top of anyone’s cultural to-do list in Utrecht should be the wondrous Rietveld Schröder House, a Unesco-protected semi-detached house designed by Gerrit Rietveld, architectural hero of the De Stijl art movement, founded in 1917. Tours of this design masterpiece run hourly (€17), with a guide to demonstrate various aspects of the house and an audio guide explaining the rest. It’s a splendid example of De Stijl, with every room and piece of furniture showcasing the movement’s core reliance on vertical and horizontal lines, primary colours and black and white. It’s also ingenious, with movable walls upstairs that create rooms or open space as required, corner windows that open perpendicular to each other to create the feeling of being outside, and three-dimensional design to maximise the use of space.Another must – as long as climbing 465 narrow, winding steps doesn’t faze you – is the Dom Tower, which still dominates the skyline of the city 637 years on from its completion. The 112-metre climb-cum-tour (€10) is mercifully broken up by stops on each floor to admire the tower’s inner architecture as well as its 13 enormous bells (at 40 metres) and viewing galleries at 70 and 95 metres. The reward for making it to the top is an unmatched panorama of the city: on a clear day you can make out Rotterdam to the west and Amsterdam to the north. (The top is closed for restoration until 6 October 2019, but in the meantime you can still climb to 70 metres, and other rooms have been opened to visitors in compensation.)Exploring the Centraal Museum (€14) could fill a whole day – I had limited time and decided on Duran Lantink’s Old Stock (running until 27 October), a thought-provoking protest against fast fashion, whose most striking aspect was a semi-destroyed recreation of a clothing store with the words “No spending that they did was done with measure” spraypainted on the wall.Although Amsterdam remains the centre of the Dutch music scene, Utrecht punches well above its weight in that regard, with a healthy array of local talent (the dream-pop band Amber Arcades and internationally acclaimed DJ Carista are notable natives) and venues that attract a constant stream of high-calibre international names. The top music-related reason to visit is undoubtedly Le Guess Who?, an annual four-day event that puts most other festivals in Europe to shame for both ersity and organisation (full pass €148, day tickets €43€48). On the second weekend of each November it takes over the city with gigs celebrating “global sounds and musical boundary-crossing” in an array of venues including the thousand-year-old Janskerk church. The main hub of Le Guess Who? is TivoliVredenburg, a world-class, multi-space venue that hosts gigs of various sizes all year round. EKKO, De Helling and dB’s are among a strong clutch of smaller venues that host rising domestic and international artists, many of whom “graduate” to playing TivoliVredenburg further down the line.Things are getting going again now in Utrecht, but it is a student city and the gig and club schedules are light during the summer: some places, including WAS, close until the start of September, while the city’s other high-quality club BASIS remains open but takes the action up a notch from September, with respected DJs and producers such as Shlomo and Mind Against appearing in 2019.One of the purest pleasures in Utrecht is whiling away time in the city’s many gorgeous parks and gardens. I found a couple of hours wandering through the wonderfulBotanic Gardens (€8.50) deeply calming, while in the centre of town another horticultural gem is the Oude Hortus (€8), which has a cafe, century-old greenhouses and an orangery dating back to 1724.Looking for a holiday with a difference?

Some carried babies and small children others clutched small bags of possessions snatched hastily from the rubble of their ruined homes most had just the clothes they stood in.For the 1,435 weary Hurricane Dorian evacuees from the Bahamas who disembarked the Grand Celebration liner and stepped on to the dockside at the weekend there were the pressing concerns of where they would find immediate shelter.But while the Red Cross spoke of how they had received offers from across Florida to help accommodate them, their longer-term situations, and the willingness of the US to offer shelter to more of the tens of thousands of homeless survivors have quickly became politically sensitive questions.On Monday, Donald Trump weighed in, claiming without evidence that “very bad people” including gang members and drug dealers were probably among evacuees seeking entry to the US.The president’s comments also followed an episode on Sunday in Freeport, the capital of the island of Grand Bahama that was torn apart by the category 5 hurricane just days earlier, in which dozens of Bahamians without US visas were ordered off a boat to Fort Lauderdale even though they were admissible on humanitarian grounds without one.The majority of those newly arrived from Freeport on Saturday to the Port of Palm Beach on the cruise liner slipped quietly away, collected by family members already in Florida, or to hotels or private accommodation that friends, relatives and benefactors had secured for them.Of the 857 Bahamian nationals aboard, barely 60 got on buses for a Red Cross shelter set up at a recreation center in nearby Lake Worth on Saturday.Red Cross officials spoke of how they were focused on their immediate needs.“The county asked us to open the shelter temporarily for the people who are coming on this ship, but there is no rolling process, no ongoing process for additional people to be processed this way,” Craig Cooper, national spokesman for the American Red Cross, told the  on Tuesday. “We need to dispel any belief or assumption there is going to be an ongoing situation or absorbing people who are coming over from the Bahamas.”The humanitarian evacuation to Florida so far has involved just a few thousand of the estimated 70,000 islanders made homeless by the most powerful storm ever to strike the Bahamas.Those who have made it to Florida, however, have little time for politics.Some, like Areesha Marshall, 24, have more important concerns as they start to think about how to reconstruct their lives, such as caring for her three- and four-year-old children in a new country. “No one really knows when it’s going to be OK to go back home,” she told the Sun-Sentinel. “The situation is dire.”Cooper, of the Red Cross, said the common theme among those at the shelter was a desire to rebuild. “They’re not looking for handouts,” he said. “Almost the first thing out of many of these people’s mouths was, ‘I need to get to work, I need to find a way to find a job here in the US. My family needs the money, I need the money, I don’t want to sit in the shelter.’”He pointed to “the amazing response” to the crisis by the residents of Florida, itself still recovering from two major hurricane strikes in two years, Irma in 2017 and Michael last year.“We had a call from someone in Jacksonville, a property owner with 150 available places for people to stay, and other calls, inidual homeowners who say they’re not going to be in their house for the next three months, that type of thing,” Cooper said.Support for the evacuees, who have arrived in Florida every day since the hurricane on relief flights, and on an armada of smaller private boats whose captains ferry supplies in and take victims out, has come from many quarters.For example, the Mastroianni Foundation, established by a family of prominent south Florida hoteliers, has provided rooms for dozens of displaced Bahamians in two hotels in Jupiter. “These people have been through the absolute worst days of their lives and have lost everything,” chief executive Nick Mastroianni said in a Facebook post. “They will have a place to rest their head until they get their feet on the ground.”Hurricane Dorian relief and support sites have also popped up on social media, with Floridians posting offers of accommodation in private houses or on Airbnb.Mostly, however, those who have arrived in Florida from the Bahamas have joined family members already living here, proof of the strong bonds and history between the Sunshine State and the Caribbean island nation. An estimated 20,000 Bahamians live in Miami and its suburbs.“Bahamians practically helped build Miami and Broward county back in the 1930s and 40s, so they have a deep connection,” said Shevrin Jones, a Democratic state congressman of Bahamian descent.“Outside of just being a vacation spot, Florida is a place where the Bahamian community migrated years ago for a better life for their families. They found that and now they call Florida their home. They’re now looking for Florida to help build the Bahamas.”Jones has been lobbying the Trump administration to waive visa requirements and open an easier path to admission for hurricane refugees. “I’m almost sure if we would do our research the amount of people who would want to come here is not as many as probably going through the mind of so many,” he said.“The Bahamian people do not want to come to Florida to stay, it’s like your nextdoor neighbor helping you after an ordeal with a place to sleep for a while. I’ll keep saying it until I’m blue in the face, this is a humanitarian effort and we have to think about if it was us, what would we want?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da4e526c97d53dae471e392046d4547244aabc0d/0_185_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20419608f4d40f1e5348a160558718ea","title":"jamal khashoggi last words","story":"Sabah paper says recording was obtained by Turkey’s intelligence agencyIn his final words, Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi urged his killers not to cover his mouth because he had asthma and could suffocate, according to Turkey’s Sabah newspaper.The newspaper, which is close to Turkey’s government, published new details of a recording of Khashoggi’s conversation with members of a Saudi hit squad sent to kill him. The paper says the recording of Khashoggi’s grisly killing and reported dismemberment on 2 October 2018 at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul was obtained by Turkey’s intelligence agency.According to the transcript, Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb, a member of the Saudi hit squad, tells Khashoggi that he has to be taken back to Riyadh because of an Interpol order against him. The journalist objects, saying there is no legal case against him and that his fiancee is waiting for him outside.Mutreb and another man are also heard trying to force Khashoggi to send his son a message telling him not to worry if he doesn’t hear from him, according to the paper. Khashoggi resists, saying: “I will write nothing.”Mutreb is later heard saying: “Help us, so that we can help you. Because in the end, we will take you to Saudi Arabia. And if you don’t help us, you know what will happen in the end.”Sabah also published Khashoggi’s last words before he was apparently drugged and lost consciousness.“Don’t cover my mouth,” he told his killers, according to Sabah. “I have asthma, don’t do it. You’ll suffocate me.”Some of the details of the transcript published by Sabah were already in a United Nations report on Khashoggi’s murder, released in June. The UN report alleged that Saudi Arabia bore responsibility for the killing and said Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s possible role in the killing should be examined.Saudi Arabia initially offered multiple, shifting accounts about Khashoggi’s disappearance. As international pressure mounted, the kingdom eventually settled on the explanation that he was killed by rogue officials in a brawl inside their consulate.The kingdom has put 11 people on trial in non-public proceedings. The 34-year-old prince, who continues to have the support of his father, King Salman, denies any involvement in the killing.Khashoggi’s remains have never been found."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13227e769a2e9895e3be4fe17c97dc4ab40d366a/0_236_6936_4162/master/6936.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2eb5200f8345af4569004df7d6b8a1c","title":"justin welby apologises in name of christ british massacre amritsar","story":"Archbishop says sorry ‘in the name of Christ’ over killing of 379 unarmed protesters in 1919The archbishop of Canterbury has apologised “in the name of Christ” for the 1919 massacre at Amritsar in India, when hundreds of people were shot dead by British forces.Prostrating himself at the memorial to the Jallianwala Bagh killings, Justin Welby said: “The souls of those who were killed or wounded, of the bereaved, cry out to us from these stones and warn us about power and the misuse of power.“I cannot speak for the British government … but I can speak in the name of Christ and say this is a place of both sin and redemption, because you have remembered what they have done and their names will live, their memory will live before God. And I am so ashamed and sorry for the impact of this crime committed here.”Hindus, Christians, Muslims and Sikhs were killed in April 1919 when they gathered in Amritsar, in Punjab, then part of British India. They were protesting peacefully after earlier riots over the arrest of pro-independence leaders.Under the orders of Brig Gen Reginald Dyer, an Anglican, British troops opened fire. According to official figures, 379 people were killed and about 1,200 wounded, though other estimates suggested much higher casualties.Winston Churchill condemned the massacre in the House of Commons, saying it was “an extraordinary event, a monstrous event, an event which stands in singular and sinister isolation”.In 2013, David Cameron became the first serving prime minister to visit the site of the killings, bowing his head in honour of the victims. The episode was “deeply shameful” and should never be forgotten, he said, but he stopped short of apologising.This year Theresa May called the killings a “shameful scar” in British-Indian history but also stopped short of formally apologising.Writing on Facebook during a trip to Sri Lanka and India, Welby said visiting the memorial had aroused “a sense of profound shame at what happened in this place. It is one of a number of deep stains on British history.”He added: “Learning of what happened, I recognise the sins of my British colonial history, the ideology that too often subjugated and dehumanised other races and cultures … We have a great responsibility to not just lament this horrific massacre but most importantly to learn from it in a way that changes our actions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eed5a3479b4e695163a6df408716521197bd53fb/8_57_3864_2318/master/3864.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=487b3d3b518114a52aecdd2f680b2af8","title":"no 10 request user data government website sparks alarm","story":"Privacy campaigners question urgency of move and motives of PM and Dominic CummingsData privacy campaign groups and Labour have expressed alarm after it emerged Downing Street has ordered departments to centralise the collection and analysis of user information from the government’s main public information website ahead of Brexit.While officials insist the move to share user data from the Gov.uk website is simply intended to improve the service and that no personal details are collected, campaigners raised concern about the urgency of the task, and the personal involvement of Boris Johnson and his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings.A leaked memo last month from Johnson to ministers on the cabinet committee tasked with no-deal preparations, known as exit operations, or XO, specifically linked the gathering of the user data to government decision-making over Brexit.The memo, seen by BuzzFeed, said the XO committee had been tasked with making sure Gov.uk “is serving as a platform to allow targeted and personalised information to be gathered, analysed and fed back actively to support key decision-making – in effect, focused on generating the highest-quality analytics and performance data to support exit preparations”.Johnson ended the memo, sent on 19 August, by writing: “I expect everyone to act immediately to execute the above actions.”Nine days later Cummings, who has been the focus of concerns about the use of voter data by the official Vote Leave campaign in the 2016 Brexit referendum, emailed officials to stress this was a “top priority”, BuzzFeed said.Dominic Cummings, the son of an oil rig project manager and a special needs teacher, was born in Durham in 1971. He attended a state primary school followed by the fee-paying Durham school and, in 1994, Oxford University, where he studied ancient and modern history.\u0026nbspAfter three years living in Russia, where he attempted to set up an airline connecting Samara in the south with Vienna, the then 28-year-old became campaign director of Business for Sterling, which worked to prevent Britain from joining the euro.Although he has never, as far as anyone knows, been a member of a political party, Cummings was headhunted to be director of strategy for the then Conservative leader, Iain Duncan Smith, in 2002.While he was seen as a “young, thrusting moderniser”, Cummings quickly\u0026nbspoffended party traditionalists. He quit the job after only eight months, describing Duncan Smith as incompetent.Following the 2010 general election, the then education secretary, Michael Gove, appointed Cummings as his chief of staff. Many in Whitehall found Cummings as difficult as he found them. In 2013, civil servants in the Department for Education\u0026nbspcomplained to the Independent\u0026nbspof an “us-and-them, aggressive, intimidating culture” created by Cummings and Gove.He never hid his disdain for the workings of Whitehall and has derided Westminster figures in eye-catching\u0026nbspmedia interviews\u0026nbspand published\u0026nbsprambling blogposts\u0026nbspthat are obsessed over by Westminster insiders. He described prime minister David Cameron as “a sphinx without a riddle”, and former Brexit minister David Davis as “thick as mince, lazy as a toad, and vain as Narcissus”.In 2015, Cummings and the political strategist Matthew Elliott founded Vote Leave, which was designated by the Electoral Commission as the official EU referendum\u0026nbspleave campaign\u0026nbspin April of the following year.In July 2018, the Electoral Commission announced Vote Leave had been found guilty of breaking electoral law by overspending, following testimony from whistleblowers. The group was\u0026nbspfined £61,000\u0026nbspand referred to the police. Cummings has used his blog to furiously defend himself and the Vote Leave campaign. In March 2019, he was found in contempt of parliament for refusing to appear at a committee of MPs investigating fake news.Tom Watson, Labour’s deputy leader, said: “This centralised harvesting of citizen’s data is very suspicious. Why would Dominic Cummings say this was a top priority for the government, given the national crisis we are in? We need immediate assurances about what this data is going to be used for.”Silkie Carlo, the director of privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: “This data grab raises important questions as to the legitimacy, urgency and purpose of such personal information collection. The government must answer these questions urgently.”The claim that no personal data would be collected “is at odds with its instruction that government websites should urgently gather ‘targeted and personalised information’,” Carlo said.“This secret instruction and contradictory public statement is cause for concern and undermines public trust at an important time. People need to be able to access government information without worrying about how their data might be tracked, recorded and used.”Pascal Crowe from Open Rights Group, which campaigns on digital privacy and freedoms, said: “This decision completely disregards the data rights of ordinary citizens. There is no suggestion of public consultation, seeking consent or promoting safeguards.“The public conversation around the use of data has shifted since the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Where is the public’s consent for this? Dominic Cummings may claim to be a pioneering advocate of data science, but when it comes to its ethical use, he is woefully behind.”Officials have said the only difference will be that anonymised user data currently collected by inidual departments will now be collated across the Gov.uk website, allowing better information on how the site is used as a whole.A government spokesman said: “Across the industry, it is normal for organisations to look at how their websites are used to make sure they provide the best possible service.“Inidual government departments currently collect anonymised user data when people use Gov.uk. The government digital service is working on a project to bring this anonymous data together to make sure people can access all the services they need as easily as possible.“No personal data is collected at any point during the process, and all activity is fully compliant with our legal and ethical obligations.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5bde3b34b1b78ffd31357bee6b7b4601def5170/0_56_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a95277452bf6b90126acff78d9f2649","title":"she said book harvey weinstein twohey kantor","story":"Journalists Megan Twohey and Jodi Kantor spoke to the  about their sprawling investigation into Weinstein’s alleged sexual predation as detailed in their new bookOn Wednesday, 4 October 2017, the New York Times reporters Megan Twohey and Jodi Kantor were finalizing their exposé of sexual harassment allegations against Harvey Weinstein, the now-disgraced movie producer, when they received a disorienting call: Weinstein, from whom they were expecting a final statement after months of intense investigative work, was approaching the building.In minutes, he’d be on their doorstep with a small army of powerful supporters in tow – including the feminist lawyer Lisa Bloom and the former sex crimes prosecutor Linda Fairstein – in a last-ditch effort to kill their story. After months of on-record only communication, would they take the meeting?The fittingly cinematic episode is one of many explosive revelations in She Said, Twohey and Kantor’s book detailing their sprawling investigation into Weinstein’s alleged sexual predation – which won a Pulitzer, along with Ronan Farrow’s exposé for the New Yorker – and its aftermath as gasoline for the #MeToo movement.Twohey and Kantor’s 3,300-word article, the first of many on Weinstein, triggered an avalanche of women’s accounts of sexual harassment and assault under the hashtag #MeToo, first coined years earlier by the activist Tarana Burke. Since then, the tide of pent-up frustration and calls for accountability have exposed and stalled the careers of prominent men such as Matt Lauer, Charlie Rose, and Les Moonves, to name a few. (Weinstein, whose criminal trial for rape and predatory sexual assault has been delayed until January 2020, has denied all allegations of non-consensual sex and pleaded not guilty).The final showdown with Weinstein is just one of several revelations in She Said that portend a much deeper story than the one which seized headlines two years ago.“We pretty quickly realized that our first Weinstein articles were actually just the beginning,” Twohey told the  in an interview. “With this book, we were able to piece together so many more pieces of the puzzle.”Supporting these bombshells are a mountain of smaller, quieter yet still powerful actions – Kantor fielding nervous texts from Gwyneth Paltrow as she deliberated going on the record (which she ultimately did in the second article, published 10 October), or crafting the perfectly calibrated email to coax the actor Rose McGowan into a phone call. There’s Twohey, knocking on the door of a woman who mysteriously left Weinstein’s company in 1990, skillfully volleying small talk into an interview pitch. And there’s an email from Laura Madden, one of the first women to go on the record against Weinstein, recounting how a conversation with her teenage daughters anchored her decision to speak.More than anything, She Said depicts the incremental work of pulling at long neglected threads as well as the institutional heft and inidual bravery required to hold powerful abuses to account.But She Said goes much deeper than a compelling play-by-play of nailing the first Weinstein story. The immediate aftermath of publication, when the dam broke on story after story of sexual indignity, workplace harassment, or assault, “only made us feel greater responsibility”, Kantor told the .“We said to ourselves: we’ve got to try to finally answer some of these lingering questions from the Weinstein story. How can a company become so complicit in predation? What are the systems that enable this kind of abuse? In the face of a “staggering” wave of personal and institutional responses, said Twohey, “We just decided that the most important thing we could do was keep reporting.”That reporting unmasked a decades-long culture of complicity at the Weinstein Company and its forebearer, Miramax, which prized protection from liability over protection of women, and a shadowy cottage industry of out-of-court settlements for victims of harassment and assault sealed with punishing non-disclosure agreements.One Weinstein accuser, Zelda Perkins, revealed to Kantor and Twohey an agreement which prohibited her from discussing her employment at Miramax with anyone, including talking to a therapist without a confidentiality agreement, or even obtaining a full copy of the contract.But a brave few did speak out and the book reveals their personal journeys to going public for the first time: Laura Madden, the first woman against Weinstein on-record in an interview, who participated days prior to a mastectomy and reconstructive surgery for breast cancer. Rowena Chiu, who didn’t tell her family about her 1998 settlement with Weinstein until after Kantor arrived at her Silicon Valley home, now on the record for the first time. And Perkins, formerly of the Miramax London office, who “always had a larger vision of what this was about”, said Kantor. “She said even as early as that, this isn’t about getting Harvey this is about an entire system that silences women.”In the preface, Kantor and Twohey explicitly pose the question: did the cultural change go too far? Or not far enough?It’s less the reporters’ paradigm than “the question we saw play out in the world”, said Kantor. “We experienced the power of the post-Weinstein reckoning and this feeling of buried truth pouring out – this display of mass accountability without precedent.”But they also watched the conversations around #MeToo get complicated, and polarizing. The past two years have revealed “three questions about #MeToo that remain totally unresolved”, said Kantor – what behaviors are under scrutiny? What tools can evaluate truth? And what are the appropriate measures for accountability and punishment?Nearly a year ago, Kantor and Twohey watched as a previously unknown psychology professor from Palo Alto, California, testified before the Senate judiciary committee about her allegation of sexual assault, in high school, by then supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. The final two chapters of She Said follow the personal journey of Dr Christine Blasey Ford as she deliberated over going public with her story – a journey more fraught than previously revealed.The book recounts a meeting, earlier this year, of several high profile figures of the #MeToo stories – Ford, Paltrow, Madden, and others as they reflect on the personal effects of coming forward and ponder the unresolved questions of the movement. What is clear, said Kantor, is that “none of us are done dealing with what’s happened in the past. You can’t fix a problem you can’t see. And it’s become clear that all of us collectively are still in the process of seeing this problem clearly.”For the book, part of that clarity resides in upholding and demystifying the “rigorous standards” of investigative journalism. “At a time when even the truth can feel so compromised and everything can feel so stuck, I want them to believe in that power, that potential.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/610ca7ec5b7172e370ed63bd20828aa2ce36d0fa/0_333_4993_2996/master/4993.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e28f5de895c2bf1cf2001a947064392f","title":"arab leaders denounce netanyahu plan annex palestinian territories israel","story":"Israeli prime minister’s proposal would ‘kill all chances of peace’, says JordanArab leaders have denounced Benjamin Netanyahu’s plan to annex large swathes of the Palestinian territories if he is re-elected next week as an election stunt that would “kill all chances for peace”.The Arab League held an emergency session on Tuesday evening after the Israeli prime minister announced the plan in a live press conference.Netanyahu, who is fighting for his political life before elections on 17 September, said he would permanently seize up to a third of the West Bank, a move that for decades has been considered an endgame scenario for Palestinians’ aspirations of statehood.Arab foreign ministers meeting in Cairo condemned the plan as “a dangerous development and a new Israeli aggression by declaring the intention to violate the international law”.“The league regards these statements as undermining the chances of any progress in the peace process and will torpedo all its foundations,” the ministers said.Jordan’s foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, said Netanyahu’s plan was an outrageous election ploy and a “dangerous escalation that shatters the foundations of the peace process”.Netanyahu made the announcement in front of a large map showing Israeli sovereignty extending over the vast majority of the Jordan Valley and slicing off the eastern border with Jordan.“Killing all chances for peace for electoral purposes is irresponsible, dangerous,” Safadi added in a tweet.Turkey’s foreign minister said the plan was racist and incendiary. “The election promise of Netanyahu, who is giving all kind of illegal, unlawful and aggressive messages before the election, is a racist apartheid state,” Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu wrote on Twitter.“Will defend rights and interests of our Palestinian brothers \u0026amp sisters till the end,” he added.The president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, said he would pull out of any previous agreements signed with the Israeli government if it went ahead with the move – a threat he has previously made without following through.Ayman Odeh, the leader of an alliance of Arab parties in Israel, called Netanyahu’s statement “not just election spin” but “a vision of apartheid”.A White House official said there had been no change in US policy and would not comment further.Late on Tuesday evening, Netanyahu was dragged away by his security team from a campaign rally in the southern city of Ashdod after air sirens sounded. The Israeli military said two rockets had been launched from Gaza, both of which were intercepted by its aerial defence system.Despite the implications for a future two-state solution, Arab states would be under significant pressure not to escalate if the annexation went ahead, analysts said.The fate of the Palestinians has diminished as a priority in many Arab capitals as the geopolitics of the region has shifted. Saudi Arabia and Israel share an interest in combating Iranian influence in the Middle East. Jordan and Egypt have long ago signed peace treaties with Israel, easing the flow of American aid and military equipment on which both depend.Significant implications are likely to be felt across the border with the West Bank in Amman. “Jordan has real existential fears with any outcome other than a two-state solution,” said Osama al-Sharif, a Jordanian analyst and columnist.Roughly 2 million Palestinians live in Jordan, most of them naturalised but barred from certain jobs on the basis they will one day be able to return to their own state. Jordanians living in the East Bank also fear that Israeli consolidation of its occupied territories could push new waves of refugees into Jordan, at a time when the country is already hosting an estimate 1.4 million Syrian refugees.The international community considers Israeli settlements illegal under international law, built on land confiscated from Palestinian families. Extending Israeli sovereignty over such a large area would also be seen as putting an end to fading hopes for a Palestinian state, as there would be little unbroken land on which to create it.Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital early in his term further damaged the two-state ideal. The Palestinians regard the occupied eastern section of Jerusalem as the capital of any future state, and cut contact with Washington after the declaration.Earlier this year, Trump also recognised Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, a plateau Israel captured from Syria in the same 1967 conflict and annexed in 1981. The move broke from the international consensus following the second world war that forbids territorial conquest during war.Palestinians warned at the time that it set a dangerous precedent for land grabs in the West Bank.In Israeli politics, however, annexation is a popular position.

Photos of drills conducted in the Chinese border town of Shenzhen have fuelled speculation that China might mobilise its military to crack down on protests in Hong Kong.People held by China on state security charges are often detained for months at an unknown location and are denied visits from lawyers and families.In March 2017, Taiwanese rights activist Lee Ming-che disappeared on a trip to China and emerged in September at a court hearing in the southern city of Changsha. He was later sentenced to five years in prison for the “subversion of state power” for holding online political lectures and helping the families of jailed dissidents."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/458b7eb8aba657b91ec01d2c0a2426e83e659faa/0_56_1378_827/master/1378.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09c2be055a745d247b99b8cfb6f81d10","title":"shinzo abe promotes rising star shinjiro koizumi in cabinet reshuffle","story":"Speculation rises over Abe’s successor as PM set to become Japan’s longest-serving leaderJapan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has brought one of the country’s rising political stars into his cabinet, sparking speculation over his successor as he prepares to mark a record-breaking period in office.But Shinjiro Koizumi, the son of the former prime minister Junichiro Koizumi, faces an early test of his abilities after he was appointed environment minister on Wednesday.Koizumi, 38, will be instrumental in deciding the fate of more than 1m tonnes of contaminated water stored at the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. His appointment comes one day after his predecessor, Yoshiaki Harada, said the plant’s operator had no choice but to dump the water into the Pacific Ocean.But, according to some observers, he may lack the experience and support inside the ruling Liberal Democratic party to immediately succeed Abe.Despite his inexperience, Koizumi’s family background has guaranteed him widespread media coverage throughout his four terms as an MP.On Wednesday, he became the third-youngest cabinet minister in Japan since the end of the second world war. He made the news again recently with the announcement, made outside the prime minister’s office, that he will marry Christel Takigawa, a well-known TV personality with whom he is expecting a child.Little is known, however, about Koizumi’s views on specific issues, including nuclear power. Under Abe, Japan has committed to restarting some of the nuclear reactors closed down in the aftermath of the March 2011 meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi – a crisis that turned his father into a prominent opponent of nuclear power.“Until now, Shinjiro has been mostly performance and it is not clear how much policy knowhow he has,” said Yu Uchiyama, a professor at Tokyo University. “Now that will become clear.”Abe turned to more experienced colleagues for senior ministerial posts, moving Taro Kono from the foreign ministry to defence and replacing him with the economic revitalisation minister, Toshimitsu Motegi, whose promotion was seen as a reward for his work in negotiating a trade deal with the US. Taro Aso, the gaffe-prone deputy prime minister, will stay on as finance minister.The number of women in Abe’s 19-member cabinet stands at just two after he appointed Seiko Hashimoto, a former Olympic speed skater, as Olympics minister a year before the summer Games open in Tokyo. Sanae Takaichi, a rightwinger who regularly visits Yasukuni, a controversial war shrine in Tokyo, was made interior minister.Some analysts interpreted Abe’s reshuffle as the start of a process to pick his successor. “Abe intends to start an open race to pick the next prime minister or even the one after that,” said the SMBC Nikko Securities chief market economist, Yoshimasa Maruyama.Abe, who began his second stint as prime minister in December 2012, will become Japan’s longest-serving leader in November. His tenure as LDP leader ends in September 2021, so party rules would have to change if he decided to serve another term.Koizumi, often referred to by his first name, graduated from a private Japanese university in Japan and has a master’s degree from Columbia University in New York. He became an MP in 2009, winning the lower house seat vacated by his father.Agencies contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b887f0882473021f3c77364a0dc96bac78bb1d0/0_203_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ac3aa0ff058b893e390c13d69c3d797","title":"shocking news worlds most powerful electric eel found in amazon","story":"Electrophorus voltai can deliver a jolt of 860 volts, much more than existing record of 650 voltsDNA research has revealed two entirely new species of electric eel in the Amazon basin, including one capable of delivering a record-breaking jolt.The findings are evidence, researchers say, of the incredible ersity in the Amazon rainforest – much of it still unknown to science – and illustrate why it is so important to protect a habitat at risk from deforestation, logging and fires.“In spite of all human impact on the Amazon rainforest in the last 50 years, we can still discover giant fishes like the two new species of electric eels,” said lead researcher C David de Santana, a zoologist working with the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History.The research “indicates that an enormous amount of species are waiting to be discovered in the Amazon rainforest, many of which may harbour cures for diseases or inspire technological innovations,” he said.The electric eel, which is a kind of fish rather than an eel, inspired the design of the first electric battery.For centuries, it was believed that a single species existed throughout the region known as Greater Amazonia, encompassing parts of countries including Brazil, Suriname and Guyana.But as part of a project to better understand electric eels and map wildlife in remote parts of South America, de Santana and his team decided to test that theory.At first glance, they found little visible difference between creatures collected from different parts of the Amazon basin, suggesting the fish were indeed part of a single species.But further analysis, including of DNA from 107 samples they collected, upended centuries of assumptions and revealed three species: the previously known Electrophorus electricus, along with Electrophorus voltai and Electrophorus varii.And their research also uncovered another stunning result: E. voltai is capable of delivering a jolt of 860 volts – much more than the 650 volts previously recorded from electric eels – “making it the strongest bioelectricity generator known”.The findings, published on Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications, theorise that the three species evolved from a shared ancestor millions of years ago.The researchers found each of the three species had a clearly defined habitat, with E. electricus living in the Guiana Shield region, E. voltai in the Brazilian Shield, a highland further south, and E. varii inhabiting slow-flowing lowland Amazon basin waters.And they suggest that the particularly strong electric shock that E. voltai can produce could be an adaptation to life in highland waters, where conductivity is reduced.Electric eels use their shock tactics for a variety of reasons, including hunting prey, self-defence, and navigation. They generate electricity from three specialised electric organs that can emit charges of varying strengths for different purposes.But the discovery of the new species raises the possibility that different types of eels may have evolved different ways of generating electricity, perhaps better suited to their erse environments.“Electric eel physiology inspired the design of Volta’s first electric battery, provided a basis ... for treating neurodegenerative diseases and recently promoted the advance of hydrogel batteries that could be used to power medical implants,” de Santana said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6dfae2e35157d61246911d4f840a12db7532686d/1_23_899_539/master/899.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2dd6b1499bd7a46a0e88c91df7bf9db2","title":"why do dubai princesses keep trying run away podcast","story":"Ola Salem discusses the orce case of Princess Haya, who fled to London.

Photograph: Charles McQuillanGetty ImagesAt least he turned up when he said he would.Which counted as a good start.Supporters of the British prime minister may refuse to accept their man has an open relationship with the truth but to the unblinkered eye, the phrase “he couldn’t lie straight in the bed” was invented for Boris Johnson.Not so, say his acolytes. He is not a liar. He is verité fluid.But of course, Johnson was never going to welch on his Monday morning appointment in Dublin with the Taoiseach. He’s not gone the full Trump, yet, even if opponents back in London were darkly predicting this is only a matter of time after his government confirmed it was suspending parliament for over a month.Nonetheless, when Johnson’s arrival ran slightly behind schedule, doubts began to creep in. Because you never know with Boris, do you?It’s why Leo Varadkar needed to be clear and unambiguous when laying out Ireland’s stance on the Border backstop (among other issues) when he had a captive audience in the new UK PM on the steps of Government Buildings.“What we cannot do and will not do - and I know you understand this - is the replacement of a legal guarantee with a promise” he told his British counterpart, no offence and all that.But while Johnson was physically present at the adjoining microphone, it’s debatable whether the Taoiseach had his unided attention. Throughout Varadkar’s polite but pointedly realistic assessment of the Brexit state of play, his guest fidgeted and grimaced and smirked, eyes scanning the rows of journalists as if trying to find a friendly face in the crowd. In contrast, the Taoiseach turned his face towards his fellow leader and listened intently while he spoke.In tone, style and look, the two men couldn’t have been more different. That shouldn’t really matter - Bertie Ahern was celebrated for his beloved anorak and stage-Dubliner approach but he won three general elections on the trot and won respect on the international stage. Before he became Taoiseach and acquired an assistant to smarten him up, it wasn’t unusual to see Bertie’s shirt hanging out. He didn’t have to work at it.Leo is a different kettle of Canali. He looked very smart in his close cut suit as he prepared to greet his honoured guest. When Boris got out of the car and bounded up the steps, baggy of trouser and untethered of shirt, a male voice arose from the ranks of the Irish media.“Jaaaysus, would ya look at the state of him.”That was rather unfair. It takes effort to maintain such a low standard.Well behavedIt was very cordial between the two as they warmly shook hands and faced the cameras. Boris, a la Trump, remarked to Leo that the journalists were very well behaved.On to the statements, Crumplestiltskin mussing up his hair and swinging his arms and making faces while the Taoiseach administered a dose of reality from outside the Westminster bubble.This meeting was a long time coming. Johnson became prime minister back in July but somehow he never managed to visit his nearest neighbour at a very difficult time in their shared history.But never mind. He was here now and scattering optimism and enthusiasm about like fairy dust.Brexit will work out well for all concerned. Boris will overcome the backstop and will lead the UK out of Europe on October 31st despite what the law might say. “I’m absolutely undaunted by whatever takes place in parliament” he declared.Sure what means parliament to a man who left Dublin to return to Westminster so he could suspend crucial proceedings for a month - to BoRogue the institution, as the technical term goes.“We gotta get on and do this….and that is what will get done” said Boris, blathering on while saying nothing about what his government intends to do to solve the backstop conundrum blighting Blighty’s Brexit. “I genuinely think it can be done. I think there is a way forward and I’m delighted it’s been approached in a positive way by governments around the EU, but particularly, obviously, here in Dublin.”Less of the “can do” rhetoric and more candour was what the aforementioned Ireland and the EU wanted. It wasn’t forthcoming.Varadkar said patiently he is ready to hear “constructive ways to achieve our agreed goals and resolve the current impasse.”“Abundant proposals” parped the prime minister.Rolled his eyesBoris said he couldn’t reveal them as he can’t give the game away because, er, he doesn’t have a single viable proposal. At least not one that isn’t bound up in the political future of Johnson and the posterity planning of his handler, Dominic Cummings.He wasn’t best pleased with the impertinence of journalist Kevin Doyle who questioned the bona fides of his concern for the Irish Border, wondering when was the last time he visited the area. Does he still think traversing it is “like crossing from Camden to Islington?”.This, after the Indo man opened with a haymaker. “Prime minister, when you talk about people being found ‘dead in ditches’, there’s a sense in this country that you really don’t understand what’s at stake here.”Johnson petulantly rolled his eyes like a schoolboy getting an ear-bashing from the headmaster.We half expected him to say he had been misheard and what he actually said was “I’d rather dine in Shoreditch than ask the EU for a Brexit extension”. But his heart didn’t seem to be in it.Earlier though, when enthusiastically empathising with Border residents, he drew on personal experience “as someone who went to the Border several times before the Belfast Agreement and shuddered to see watchtowers on UK soil.” That was over 20 years ago.Last year, he said managing that fragile frontier would be no more difficult than administering the congestion charge between London boroughs. He wasn’t shuddering then.On Monday, Johnson answered nothing and had nothing new to say.But he really wants to get on with it.“Our governments have spent three years masticating this problem. I think it is time to honour the achievements of our predecessors who tackled far worse problems by cracking this one ourselves.”After masticating for three whole years, it’s a wonder Boris Johnson could see his breakfast, let alone chew it.Carry On RegardlessPerhaps mastication was on his mind because Leo Varadkar mentioned his hero, Winston Churchill. The Taoiseach also mentioned that he is also an admirer of the “great” man. (You can’t say he wasn’t trying to charm his guest.) Churchhill famously talked of jaw jaw and not war war. That must have brought mastication to mind.After the brief Q and A session, the two leaders repaired upstairs for breakfast. But first there was a photocall when Johnson signed the guest book. He looked at the previous pages. “Michel Barnier” he noted. “A-ha!” he cried triumphantly, as if rumbling some dastardly plot.And he did. Leo has been collaborating with the EU.The visit was done and dusted within a couple of hours. The Magic Roundabout spun again and Boris Johnson returned to London to resume his lead role in Carry On Regardless.He must have been relieved to move on. When he stepped off the roundabout in Dublin he looked dizzy, like a dishevelled Dougal, aimlessly waffling around in circles without the calming magic of Cummings, his Zebedee.The prime minister didn’t look or sound good alongside the measured Varadkar, who answered questions clearly and didn’t rely on waffle. The Taoiseach even treated him to a touch of the Classics, putting him on notice that negotiation post-Brexit is “going to be a herculean task for you” adding “We want to be your friend and ally - your Athena - in doing so”.It didn’t take long for the Google scholars to find out that Athena intervened after Hercules went mad and killed his wife and children, saving him from committing further atrocities in his madness.Leo’s speech writer lectures in history in Trinity College. Irish and American history. The Taoiseach added the reference to Greek mythology in the final draft. Purely “to be constructive” stressed a colleague.Our eyes have seen the glory of the Cummings’ stooge abroad.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: JIM WATSONAFPGetty ImagesUS secretary of commerce Wilbur Ross is facing calls for his resignation after he reportedly threatened to fire senior staff at a federal agency unless they sided publicly with Donald Trump in a dispute over the path of Hurricane Dorian.The New York Times, citing three anonymous officials, reported Mr Ross had called Neil Jacobs, the acting administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), last Friday and warned that heads would roll unless the agency’s disagreement with the US president over the path of Hurricane Dorian – dubbed “Sharpiegate” – was smoothed over.Earlier in the week, the agency’s Birmingham, Alabama, office incurred the president’s wrath by publicly repudiating his false claim that Alabama was at risk from a devastating hurricane. By that point Alabama lay outside the storm’s likely trajectory.In a desperate effort to bolster Mr Trump’s inaccurate statement, a map of the hurricane’s “cone of uncertainty” was presented in the Oval Office that had been altered by Sharpie pen to extend the area of danger over a corner of Alabama.Hours after Mr Ross’s intervention, the Noaa put out an extraordinary official statement that sided with Mr Trump and admonished its own Birmingham office.The news a cabinet member in the Trump administration had threatened to fire politically appointed staff at the agency to force the Noaa to contradict the advice of its own scientists prompted immediate condemnation.The head of the environmental group the Sierra Club, Michael Brune, called on Mr Ross to resign to “maintain the dignity of the federal government”.Mr Brune called the intervention a “shameless abuse of power” that could have “devastating results now and in the future”. Democratic congress members Don Beyer from Virginia and Paul Tonko from New York also called on Mr Ross to step down.An investigation was opened on Sunday by the Noaa’s acting chief scientist, Craig McLean. He sent an email to colleagues announcing he was looking into how the agency had come to disavow its own experts in backing Mr Trump’s inaccurate claim.The email, obtained by the Washington Post, called the agency’s response “political” and a “danger to public health and safety”.The commerce secretary has denied that he threatened to fire staff. A statement made to the Hill called the New York Times story false and said: “Secretary Ross did not threaten to fire any Noaa staff over forecasting and public statements about Hurricane Dorian.”But the denial did little to quell the anxiety of top scientists at the Noaa who are dismayed that scientific findings made at the height of a severe public emergency should have been overridden in order to spare Mr Trump’s blushes. On Monday the director of the National Weather Service, Louis Uccellini, praised the agency’s forecasters in Birmingham for having rebuffed Mr Trump’s false tweet in an effort to avoid public panic.“They did that with one thing in mind: public safety,” Mr Uccellini told a meeting of the National Weather Association. – Read more about the Donald Trump administration"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons september 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraph matt-nl Order The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Brexit latest news: Scottish court rules Boris Johnson broke law by proroguing ParliamentComment: Nigel Farage is the Brexit Icarus.

They are called the iPhone 11, the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max, making them\u0026nbspthe first handset to finally get the Pro name that is present across Apple\u0027s line.But the iPhone wasn\u0027t the only new device, with updates to the Apple Watch, its variety of online streaming services, and other products also\u0026nbsprevealed during the event.Apple unveils iOS 13 - with one strange problemEven with hours left to go until the event, last-minute rumours are revealing what the new iPhone 11 might look like. Or, specifically, what it won\u0027t look like: according to numerous reports, the long-rumoured feature that would allow the back of the iPhone to work like a charger is not actually going to arrive with this phone.\u0026nbspThe feature appeared to make sense: competitors like Samsung already have it, and it could be a useful way to charge up devices like AirPods or even other people\u0027s iPhones.\u0026nbspBut according to reporters including the usually reliable Mark Gurman, that\u0027s not coming. And the reason why could be a little worrying and embarrassing for Apple:\u0026nbspHave heard as well Apple has been having some issues with the reverse wireless charging for AirPodsWatch on back of the new high-end iPhones, despite it being planned, he wrote on Twitter.\u0026nbspThis is a feature Samsung has had for months and would be Apple’s second miss on charging (AirPower) if true.Here\u0027s everything you need to know ahead of today\u0027s event.\u0026nbsp(This is worth taking with a pinch of salt, however: names of devices, like prices, are known only by a very limited number of people with Apple and so leak less often. They\u0027re also not usually actually written on the boxes or anything, which means that they can be changed at the very last moment.)One of the things we\u0027ll get to hear today is the release date for iOS 13. It brings a whole set of features – probably most obvious among them is the dark mode – but it also makes some smaller changes, too.\u0026nbspOne of them is the way that it tries to protect your privacy. On the new operating system, the phone tries to alert you if an app is tracking your location, and asks you whether you really want to share that data with the app. (Android 10 also has a similar feature.)\u0026nbspThat\u0027s probably going to be difficult for apps like Facebook, which have been criticised for the wealth of data they gather on things like location. Which is why the company has published a blog post ahead of the release, explaining why it does that.\u0026nbspFacebook is better with location, the post, written by engineering director\u0026nbspPaul McDonald, reads.\u0026nbspIt powers features like check-ins and makes planning events easier. It helps improve ads and keep you and the Facebook community safe. Features like Find Wi-Fi and Nearby Friends use precise location even when you’re not using the app to make sure that alerts and tools are accurate and personalized for you.Apple is not expected to include 5G support for the iPhone 11, meaning it will fall a step behind rivals like Samsung.\u0026nbspThis may not matter for markets like the US and the UK, where 5G coverage is very limited, but it could have an impact on certain Asian markets.\u0026nbspPeter Jarich, head of mobile data firm GSMA Intelligence has been in touch to share his views on this:\u0026nbspApple can’t rest on its laurels its business success depends on it.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspA lack of 5G support in the new iPhone won’t surprise anyone, though it will still disappoint operators looking for 5G devices to help them drive traffic to new 5G networks. At the same time, new features that are expected – improved camera functionality, improved processor, upgrade to Wi-Fi 6 – may all seem incremental rather than revolutionary, particularly if the product line and form factor line-ups remain relatively constant. In reality, form factor (and pricing) ersity, combined with a compelling case for customers to upgrade, is an important strategy for keeping the iPhone relevant for a broad set of smartphone users, while keeping sales robust. And as services continue to grow as a revenue source for Apple, it’s increasingly important for Apple to get iPhones into the hands of consumers.\u0026nbspIf you want to reminisce on where it all began, you can watch Steve Jobs introduce the original iPhone in full below.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspEvery once in a while, a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything...If you\u0027re wondering about the prices for the iPhone 11 range, the latest leak from SlashLeaks has you covered:\u0026nbspiPhone 11 - $749iPhone 11 Pro - $999iPhone 11 Pro Max - $1,099\u0026nbspThis is the same pricing as last year for Apple\u0027s new iPhones.\u0026nbspApple is also expected to slash the prices of last year\u0027s iPhone X and iPhone XS.For the first time ever, Apple has made it possible to watch an\u0026nbspiPhone unveiling on YouTube.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspYou\u0027ll be able to watch it here:\u0026nbsphttps:www.youtubewatch?v996wliAI_y4\u0026nbspIt wasn\u0027t so long ago that viewers needed some form of Apple hardware or software just to watch the event.Please allow a moment for the live blog to load.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Which is why the company has published a blog post ahead of the release, explaining why it does that.\u0026nbspFacebook is better with location, the post, written by engineering director\u0026nbspPaul McDonald, reads.\u0026nbspIt powers features like check-ins and makes planning events easier. It helps improve ads and keep you and the Facebook community safe. Features like Find Wi-Fi and Nearby Friends use precise location even when you’re not using the app to make sure that alerts and tools are accurate and personalized for you.Apple is not expected to include 5G support for the iPhone 11, meaning it will fall a step behind rivals like Samsung.\u0026nbspThis may not matter for markets like the US and the UK, where 5G coverage is very limited, but it could have an impact on certain Asian markets.\u0026nbspPeter Jarich, head of mobile data firm GSMA Intelligence has been in touch to share his views on this:\u0026nbspApple can’t rest on its laurels its business success depends on it.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspA lack of 5G support in the new iPhone won’t surprise anyone, though it will still disappoint operators looking for 5G devices to help them drive traffic to new 5G networks. At the same time, new features that are expected – improved camera functionality, improved processor, upgrade to Wi-Fi 6 – may all seem incremental rather than revolutionary, particularly if the product line and form factor line-ups remain relatively constant. In reality, form factor (and pricing) ersity, combined with a compelling case for customers to upgrade, is an important strategy for keeping the iPhone relevant for a broad set of smartphone users, while keeping sales robust. And as services continue to grow as a revenue source for Apple, it’s increasingly important for Apple to get iPhones into the hands of consumers.\u0026nbspIf you want to reminisce on where it all began, you can watch Steve Jobs introduce the original iPhone in full below.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspEvery once in a while, a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything...If you\u0027re wondering about the prices for the iPhone 11 range, the latest leak from SlashLeaks has you covered:\u0026nbspiPhone 11 - $749iPhone 11 Pro - $999iPhone 11 Pro Max - $1,099\u0026nbspThis is the same pricing as last year for Apple\u0027s new iPhones.\u0026nbspApple is also expected to slash the prices of last year\u0027s iPhone X and iPhone XS.For the first time ever, Apple has made it possible to watch an\u0026nbspiPhone unveiling on YouTube.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspYou\u0027ll be able to watch it here:\u0026nbsphttps:www.youtubewatch?v996wliAI_y4\u0026nbspIt wasn\u0027t so long ago that viewers needed some form of Apple hardware or software just to watch the event.Please allow a moment for the live blog to load.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

You can at least partly blame the business of moviemaking for that.\u0026nbspThe first outing for Pennywise, the world’s favourite frightening clown, was produced for just $35m (£28.4m) and went on to gross in excess of $700m, making it one of the most profitable films of 2017.\u0026nbspAs a result, Chapter Two didn’t just get the go ahead. It got a much bigger budget, double the original according to director Andy Muschietti, with plenty more where that came from for marketing and promotion. \u0026nbspWith all that extra money he made...\u0026nbspnot a stinker but a collection of great inidual scenes without a coherent narrative behind them.

Each outing is a stab in the dark.\u0026nbspThat risk is much reduced if the film is part of an established franchise which can get people into theatres regardless of what critics say. Just ask Disney shareholders. It took a risk on establishing the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which has gone on to prove that there really is such a thing as a golden goose.\u0026nbspThe name “Marvel Studios” on a film all but guarantees an opening.\u0026nbspHang on a minute, though, I hear you say.\u0026nbspIsn’t there a problem with It: Chapter Two here? Haven’t Warner’s executives allowed Muschietti to shoot them in the foot?\u0026nbspThe film, after all, does something rare, particularly with the horror genre, which could be said to have set the franchise ball rolling given that there were a plethora of them around before the MCU was even a twinkle\u0026nbspin Kevin Feige’s eye.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

For a start, those who slogged through the 1,400 or so pages of the source novel and paid attention to the role played by Ben Anscombe in the final act will be aware that there’s the potential for a literary sequel should Stephen King be so minded. What if Ben, shall we say, missed something, in the tunnels beneath Derry, the fictional New England town where the story is set?\u0026nbspThe film plays out differently. But a bit of exposition here, a flashback there… it’s not as if it hasn’t been done before.\u0026nbspMuch more likely, given what’s been said about the future of the franchise, is a prequel and perhaps a multiple of prequels given the years of history Pennywise has in Derry’s violent streets.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspIt will ultimately depend on the returns. It: Chapter Two\u0026nbspmade $91m in North America plus $94m internationally over its opening weekend. That is quite a bit less than the first outing.\u0026nbspBut that makes it a disappointment only by comparison to its predecessor. For an R- or 15-rating movie it’s still one of the best openings of all time. Factor in that it did this despite a\u0026nbsp169-minute running time, and the lukewarm critical response, and the financial side of the endeavour looks very promising.\u0026nbspForbes put the overunder for the total at $450m, which is, again, more than respectable for a horror film with\u0026nbspa certificate that restricts its audience.\u0026nbspAnything north of that would make the return of Pennywise in some form or another a financial imperative.

The Treasury estimates that a bottle of wine bought in Heathrow duty-free could, as a result, be up to £2.23 cheaper.Holidaymakers will now also be able to bring in limited amounts of alcohol and cigarettes bought at duty-free shops in the EU, saving over £12 on two crates of beer, for example.Chancellor of the exchequer Sajid Javid said: “As we prepare to leave the EU, I’m pleased to be able to back British travellers.“We want people to enjoy their hard-earned holidays and this decision will help holidaymakers’ cash go that little bit further.”Created with Sketch.Protesters take to streets after Boris Johnson suspends parliament  Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Anti Brexit protesters march on WhitehallMany of the protesters carried placardsThe protesters also marched to Trafalgar Square, where they blocked trafficJohn McDonnell addressed crowds in Whitehall.A small group of Brexit supporters attempted to stage a counter protest in central London.Three people were arrested in London, including a woman who sat on the road near Trafalgar Square.In Oxford, locals and students gathered outside Balliol College, Boris Johnson\u0027s alma mater, to protest.Thousands of people gather in central Glasgow to protest against the prime minister.Jeremy Corbyn spoke to protesters in central Glasgow.Anti Brexit protesters march on WhitehallMany of the protesters carried placardsThe protesters also marched to Trafalgar Square, where they blocked trafficJohn McDonnell addressed crowds in Whitehall.A small group of Brexit supporters attempted to stage a counter protest in central London.Three people were arrested in London, including a woman who sat on the road near Trafalgar Square.In Oxford, locals and students gathered outside Balliol College, Boris Johnson\u0027s alma mater, to protest.Thousands of people gather in central Glasgow to protest against the prime minister.Jeremy Corbyn spoke to protesters in central Glasgow.Currently, travellers will be able to shop duty-free when going to non-EU countries.\u0026nbspTravellers within the EU were able to shop without paying certain local taxes and duties, or customs charges, until the 1990s, on the condition that they took the goods out of the country. Duty-free sales were then abolished when the single market was introduced, effectively erasing national borders.\u0026nbspIn a 1997 statement defending the decision, the European Commission wrote: “People enjoy being able to literally fill up their car or baggage with goods bought in other EU countries that are cheaper or not available in their country of residence.\u0026nbsp“Being able to buy a single 1l bottle of spirits and a single box of 200 cigarettes in a duty-free shop if you happen to travel by air, sea or the Channel Tunnel shuttle pales in comparison with the new opportunities to shop in other EU countries.”These opportunities include the freedom to bring in unlimited amounts of goods bought anywhere in the EU without systematic border checks, making shopping in another EU country as easy as purchasing in a local shop, the commission noted.This freedom will be kept in part after a no-deal Brexit, according to the Treasury statement. People travelling back from the EU will still be able to bring back unlimited amounts specifically of alcohol and cigarettes, provided they did not buy them in a duty-free shop.The Treasury’s decision on duty-free shopping will not apply to movements of goods from Northern Ireland to EU member state Ireland, as EU law does not allow the Irish government to operate duty-free at the land border.A no-deal Brexit, which until last week looked increasingly likely, faces a fresh hurdle after parliament passed a law to stop such an outcome. The bill requires Boris Johnson to request an extension to Brexit negotiations until the end of January unless he can secure a deal or parliamentary approval for no deal by 19 October.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Brexit is not a big deal for Primark, it is more of an event for other people.”ABF also said it has “completed all practical preparations” for Brexit and has contingency plans in place for potential disruption.ABF expects full-year sales at Primark to be 4 per cent up on last year, but much of the growth is due to additional stores being opened.Primark is still the face of fast fashion as growth continuesLike-for-like sales, which strip out that effect, are set to fall 2 per cent globally and 1 per cent in the UK, the company said.

One of the key reasons why the average age of teachers is low is because fewer teachers are staying on in the profession due to heavy workloads.Despite the government’s recent efforts to tackle the issue, many teachers who enter the classroom in British schools still find it very difficult to achieve a reasonable work-life balance.Education unions say this has been worsened by funding cuts that schools have faced as teachers have been left with longer hours, greater responsibilities and more children to look after.The report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) also found that Britain is one of the few countries that have seen class sizes increase since 2005.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The peloton rides past the Angel of the North during stage four of the Tour of Britain from Gateshead to Kendal.Australia celebrate the wicket of England\u0027s Craig Overton, which meant they won the fourth test and retained the Ashes.Manchester City celebrate after Caroline Weir scored during their Women\u0027s Super League match against Manchester United at Etihad Stadium.

Swinson beat fellow candidate Ed Davey by 47,997 votes to 28,021 votes.Managing poor behaviour among pupils is one of the key drivers for teachers quitting the profession and larger class sizes are likely to have made the job harder for some members of staff.In addition, teachers’ salaries in England and Scotland have declined in recent years amid austerity measures – which has prompted experienced staff to look elsewhere for jobs with more money. \u0026nbspRecent statistics show a third of teachers in England leave within five years of qualifying so it is not that surprising that the UK has a less experienced, more youthful workforce than other countries.In recent years, the government has attempted to boost the recruitment of university graduates into the classroom to counteract the low retention rates among teachers.UK teachers ‘younger and poorer than in any other developed country’Government bursaries and graduate schemes, like Teach First, have helped to fill shortages in schools with younger teachers – who often come fresh from university with high ambitions and high energy.But the reality of the day-to-day can be shocking to those who have limited experience of schools. Especially if their own education was vastly different to some of the more challenging schools. \u0026nbspIs a younger workforce a bad thing? It is true that they will have less experience but they are also likely to have more energy to work the long hours associated with the job. They may also be more up-to-date in the latest teaching styles, government reforms and technology. \u0026nbspHowever, a better balance of youth and experience can only be a good thing in schools. The government has announced plans to finally improve teachers’ salaries but it will take a lot more to stop older, more experienced teachers from leaving the profession in droves.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

It includes a whole host of new features, but Apple mostly spoke about the camera and the colours.Read more about the iPhone 11.Just like its cheaper sibling, the iPhone 11 Pro was introduced with a lot of talk about its camera and its new finishes. But Apple also offered some more explanation of its unprecedented new phone.It is the first time Apple has used the pro name in an iPhone. And marketing boss Phil Schiller said it lived up to the name, with a variety of changes that would make it suitable for real professionals. (But, again, they were mostly about colours and cameras.)Read more about the iPhone 11 Pro.Apple has been making a big push into services, and they received a huge and detailed introduction at the start.The company showed off some more details about Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade, which allow people to stream television and games respectively.It also finally revealed how much they\u0027ll cost, and when they\u0027ll come out.Read more about Apple\u0027s new online services.The Apple Watch can finally tell the time, all the time. The biggest update with the new Apple Watch is that the screen is always on.There were some other features, too, such as a compass and some new materials. But the biggest by far is that the awkward wrist-flick that was required to use previous models is now gone.Read more about the Apple Watch Series 5.This\u0026nbspwasn\u0027t\u0026nbspannounced during the event, but was conspicuous in its absence. Apple has had a strange rollout of its new iPhone and iPad operating system, and that continued this time around.After the event, we found out that it would be coming out later this month.

Or, specifically, what it won\u0027t look like: according to numerous reports, the long-rumoured feature that would allow the back of the iPhone to work like a charger is not actually going to arrive with this phone.\u0026nbspThe feature appeared to make sense: competitors like Samsung already have it, and it could be a useful way to charge up devices like AirPods or even other people\u0027s iPhones.\u0026nbspBut according to reporters including the usually reliable Mark Gurman, that\u0027s not coming. And the reason why could be a little worrying and embarrassing for Apple:\u0026nbspHave heard as well Apple has been having some issues with the reverse wireless charging for AirPodsWatch on back of the new high-end iPhones, despite it being planned, he wrote on Twitter.\u0026nbspThis is a feature Samsung has had for months and would be Apple’s second miss on charging (AirPower) if true.Here\u0027s everything you need to know ahead of today\u0027s event.\u0026nbsp(This is worth taking with a pinch of salt, however: names of devices, like prices, are known only by a very limited number of people with Apple and so leak less often. They\u0027re also not usually actually written on the boxes or anything, which means that they can be changed at the very last moment.)One of the things we\u0027ll get to hear today is the release date for iOS 13. It brings a whole set of features – probably most obvious among them is the dark mode – but it also makes some smaller changes, too.\u0026nbspOne of them is the way that it tries to protect your privacy. On the new operating system, the phone tries to alert you if an app is tracking your location, and asks you whether you really want to share that data with the app. (Android 10 also has a similar feature.)\u0026nbspThat\u0027s probably going to be difficult for apps like Facebook, which have been criticised for the wealth of data they gather on things like location. Which is why the company has published a blog post ahead of the release, explaining why it does that.\u0026nbspFacebook is better with location, the post, written by engineering director\u0026nbspPaul McDonald, reads.\u0026nbspIt powers features like check-ins and makes planning events easier. It helps improve ads and keep you and the Facebook community safe. Features like Find Wi-Fi and Nearby Friends use precise location even when you’re not using the app to make sure that alerts and tools are accurate and personalized for you.Apple is not expected to include 5G support for the iPhone 11, meaning it will fall a step behind rivals like Samsung.\u0026nbspThis may not matter for markets like the US and the UK, where 5G coverage is very limited, but it could have an impact on certain Asian markets.\u0026nbspPeter Jarich, head of mobile data firm GSMA Intelligence has been in touch to share his views on this:\u0026nbspApple can’t rest on its laurels its business success depends on it.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspA lack of 5G support in the new iPhone won’t surprise anyone, though it will still disappoint operators looking for 5G devices to help them drive traffic to new 5G networks. At the same time, new features that are expected – improved camera functionality, improved processor, upgrade to Wi-Fi 6 – may all seem incremental rather than revolutionary, particularly if the product line and form factor line-ups remain relatively constant. In reality, form factor (and pricing) ersity, combined with a compelling case for customers to upgrade, is an important strategy for keeping the iPhone relevant for a broad set of smartphone users, while keeping sales robust. And as services continue to grow as a revenue source for Apple, it’s increasingly important for Apple to get iPhones into the hands of consumers.\u0026nbspIf you want to reminisce on where it all began, you can watch Steve Jobs introduce the original iPhone in full below.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspEvery once in a while, a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything...If you\u0027re wondering about the prices for the iPhone 11 range, the latest leak from SlashLeaks has you covered:\u0026nbspiPhone 11 - $749iPhone 11 Pro - $999iPhone 11 Pro Max - $1,099\u0026nbspThis is the same pricing as last year for Apple\u0027s new iPhones.\u0026nbspApple is also expected to slash the prices of last year\u0027s iPhone X and iPhone XS.For the first time ever, Apple has made it possible to watch an\u0026nbspiPhone unveiling on YouTube.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspYou\u0027ll be able to watch it here:\u0026nbsphttps:www.youtubewatch?v996wliAI_y4\u0026nbspIt wasn\u0027t so long ago that viewers needed some form of Apple hardware or software just to watch the event.Please allow a moment for the live blog to load.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Just as with the cheaper model, the company focused primarily on the camera in its announcement.The company said that its improved screen as well as new colours justify the pro moniker, which has only ever been used on bigger devices.This is the first phone that we\u0027ve called pro, said Apple\u0027s Phil Schiller, as he unveiled the phone.For us that means it\u0027s the first device that pros can count on to get work done. But it\u0027s also a device for all of us who want the best product made, even if we\u0027re not a pro.The iPhone 11 Pro costs $999 or $1,099 for the bigger Max version, the same price as the XS and XS Max they replace. Pre-orders will begin on Friday – at the slightly later hour of 5am pacific daylight time – and will all start shipping on 20 September.The new phone comes in a number of colours, including a brand new green. And those finish are also matte, rather than the shiny gloss in previous versions.It also includes three different lenses in the camera. As well as the normal one, and the zoom that arrived in recent iPhones, it also has an ultra-wide camera that can allow for images that take in twice as much as the previous phone.New Apple Watch finally brings screen that will never turn offThe iPhone can take photos with all of those different cameras at once, Apple said, letting people choose either to zoom in or to use the new wider lens to take in the full detail. The three cameras are able to talk to each other, so that they are aligned ready for switching between the different lenses.It also includes a feature called Deep Fusion which can use machine learning to take a variety of different photos at once and combine them into the best version of any photo. It is computational photography mad science, said Mr Schiller, it is way cool.It also includes new video recording features, as well as updated editing tools to allow them to be adjusted after the fact. The phone has the ability to record through two of the cameras at once, and switch between the two even as video is being recorded.Inside the phone is Apple\u0027s brand new A13 Bionic chip. The company said that will be vastly quicker than all of the chips it has made before, but that it can also work less hard to preserve battery life.The iPhone 11 Pro can last four hours longer than the iPhone XS that it replaces the bigger Max version can last five hours longer than the XS Max, Apple said. It will also come with a new more powerful charger to allow it power up more quickly.Apple said there was also a variety of new features it did not have time to discuss, including upgraded material\u0026nbspthat gives it the strongest glass in a smartphone.Follow the latest from the iPhone event below:Even with hours left to go until the event, last-minute rumours are revealing what the new iPhone 11 might look like.

So on the 11th I awoke late, groggy. My wife had already left for work. Our dog kept me company while I shaved and showered, dressed and caffeinated. I was aiming to leave for the office by a quarter to nine.I was one minute late.So it was 8.46am when I bent to say goodbye to Charlie Brown, and off to the side some fast movement caught my eye, with a whirr-whoosh that sounded like a cartoon version of an incoming missile, some disaster about to befall Wile E\u0026nbspCoyote. I spun my head to the window where the noise had shot by, but I saw nothing. I stood up. I turned to the south. That’s when I saw.This was not a great apartment. But one corner of the loft was lined with huge windows that faced the Hudson River to the west, and the World Trade Centre\u0026nbspjust a couple of blocks to the south. The view was breathtaking, the immensity of the towers filling your field of vision. Sometimes I’d just sit and stare at the towers, awestruck.Now, at 8.47 on a Tuesday morning, I was staring at a hole in one of the buildings.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch. Show all 21Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.I immediately called my wife, told her, “I think the World Trade Centre just got hit by a missile.” I turned on the television, which was at first reporting nothing definitive, but the situation was definitely alarming. I was still staring out the window, listening to nothing on the TV, when the second plane hit. The fireball briefly looked like it was never going to stop expanding, it would engulf me. I flinched away, nearly toppled over my chair.Now we knew that New York was being attacked. But was that attack finished? Or were these planes just the first two salvos of a massive bombardment, an invasion of the country, the end of the world as we know it?On 911, people remember their favourite story about Steve BuscemiI definitely didn’t want to go outside. Our home was surrounded by high-value targets – City Hall, Wall Street, both the New York and the American Stock Exchanges, the Federal Building, every level of government and finance, the main switching station for transatlantic and East Coast telephone calls, big bridges and long tunnels, all this crucial infrastructure was right out the door. Back in college in the 1980s, I’d taken a poli-sci class called War and Peace in the Nuclear Age, and one of our assignments was to determine the single spot in the entire world that could do the most damage – human fatalities, economic disruption, political upheaval – with a modest-sized nuclear device. Everyone in the class came up with the same answer: that spot was right here. It was demonstrable it was math.What was I going to do? I definitely wasn’t going to the office. But should I be behaving as if the city was\u0026nbspbeing invaded? What would that behaviour look like?I started to notice pieces of building falling off a tower, one bit after another, from the very top. This didn’t make sense, I didn’t see any damage up there. So I looked more carefully. Those were not bits of building. Those were people. They were jumping off the roof, a thousand feet in the sky.When the south tower began to collapse, for the briefest second it wasn’t obvious to me what was happening, then I understood, but it still wasn’t thoroughly clear how exactly the building was going to fall, or how much of it, or in what direction, and if that tower fell over like a lumberjacked tree, and tipped my way, it would land on me.When the debris cloud hit, the building shivered, and I heard a small crash, like someone had dropped a wineglass at a partyThe immense cloud of dust and debris came hurtling towards me, a terrifying mass containing... what? Girders, I-beams, mammoth chunks of concrete, who the hell knew, maybe the entire collapsing building was in that cloud – was that cloud – headed my way at a hundred miles an hour, two hundred, who could tell? So I picked up Charlie Brown and fled from whatever was going to come crashing through the window, through the walls, through the roof. I shut us in the dark of the windowless bathroom.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Right now.When the debris cloud hit, the building shivered, and I heard a small crash, like someone had dropped a wineglass at a party. Was this the last noise I’d ever hear? I waited, my hands shaking as I stroked the dog, my heart racing...After a few seconds of nothing, I opened the door.I hadn’t turned on any lights that morning, because it was a spectacularly beautiful day, as usual for that time of year I have since come to think of it as 11 September weather. But now the rooms were almost completely dark in the blackout of that cloud. I couldn’t see anything out the windows, just thick dark greyness pushing up against the glass, like Stephen King’s fog. I turned on lights. The sound of shattering glass? That was a picture that had been shaken off the wall.I couldn’t even see the building across the street, 40ft away. But the cloud slowly dispersed until finally I could dimly make out the World Trade Centre site, where there was now only one Twin Tower. Was there really nothing left?The cop was there to enter every home before the residents, to look around quickly for anything horrifying that might have come hurtling through a window. I heard that people had found body partsJust a few minutes later, the other building came down.\u0026nbsp How did I not see that coming?I eventually went downstairs, outside, to reconnaissance. It was slow-motion chaos out there, shell-shocked people staggering through the mess, papers fluttering in the sky, everything under a thick coat of ash, like fresh snow. The only thing that seemed to be happening quickly were the sirens, they were wailing from every direction, fast-moving vehicles somewhere I couldn’t see. I found a policeman, who told me I should prepare to leave, the electricity was going to be turned off, the gas, the water too, all for safety. My building was going to be evacuated. The whole neighbourhood.So in the middle of the afternoon, I left home carrying a single change of clothing, and basic toiletries, and a couple of meals for Charlie Brown. My dog and I trudged through the ash across City Hall Park, up and over the Brooklyn Bridge, from which I couldn’t stop turning back to look over my shoulders, where there were no Twin Towers left at all.It didn’t occur to me that I wouldn’t step back into our home for two weeks, and even then it was only a brief visit on a grim Sunday, accompanied by a police escort who was there to make sure we didn’t stay, or stick around too long. Also the cop was there to enter every home before the residents, to look around quickly for anything horrifying that might have come hurtling through a window. I heard that people had found body parts.My wife and dog and I were living with relatives uptown, in a spare bedroom. Indefinitely.We were finally allowed to move home in mid-October. Our neighbourhood had become the Frozen Zone, ning a few blocks in every direction from Ground Zero, penned in by thousands of feet of newly erected chain link patrolled by National Guardsmen in battle fatigues and helmets carrying assault rifles, militarised checkpoints, we had to present ID to prove our residency, our identity. The local school had been repurposed as a staging area for a rescue effort that never rescued a single person then for the recovery, the cleanup.The thing that’s impossible to understand if you weren’t there was the smell. Those massive piles of rubble – what was left of two tremendous buildings, each more than a quarter-mile tall – those piles were on fire for one hundred days, acrid clouds of smoke that weren’t fully extinguished until mid-December. The stench was sickening. The sounds of the earth-movers constant. The stadium lights glared all through the night, every night. The armoured vehicles and uniformed men, weapons everywhere: a warzone.But by 13 September\u0026nbspI’d returned to work. I was 33 years old, married but childless, a moment in life when nothing seems as important as career. So of course I went back to work. But my publishing house’s office building was threatened with bomb scares every few days, we needed to evacuate and wander around Midtown, anxiously awaiting the all-clear. Eventually we stopped believing, we stopped leaving, even while anthrax attacks were invading other media offices in the neighbourhood, killing other people who walked these very same streets, people who could have been me. Everyone jumped every time a truck rumbled by. I never slept through the night, and repeatedly injured myself in the kitchen, knife cuts, burns. At the time, I didn’t recognise\u0026nbspPTSD. I just knew my hands and arms were covered in wounds.This is a terrifying way to live. That’s the point, isn’t it? That’s what terrorism is, that’s what it accomplishesWhat was coming next? We were all convinced it was something.In New York, especially down in the Frozen Zone, 11 September\u0026nbsplasted a very long time. The terror seemed permanent. It wasn’t.Fifteen years later, I rarely thought about terrorism anymore it became something that happened somewhere else. But then I went to one of those somewhere elses: Paris, still reeling from its own series of brutal terror attacks, a city with soldiers everywhere, bomb-sniffing dogs, everything suffused with tension, fear. This felt so familiar, this felt exactly like New York after 911, this new category of historical moment: a global metropolis sieged by terror.Not only did this remind me of 2001, it also reminded me of something that had become a constant part of my recent life: suspense novels, which I’d started writing in 2009. The beautiful foreign setting. The definite sense that something bad was going to happen, but the fundamental uncertainty about what exactly that bad thing would be, to whom, and why, and when. Is it now? What should I do? Should I be acting as if this is a life-and-death situation?Trump’s bizarre quotes about 911 before becoming presidentSeptember 11 memorial’s architect looks back, and ahead911 anniversary: Handwritten notes reveal how George W Bush reacted This all defined my experience of 911 and its aftermath, the uncertainty and confusion and mistaken assumptions – was that a missile, is the fireball going to engulf me, will the building fall on me, are there really bombs in the office, or anthrax, was that sound an explosion or a car backfiring, why the hell am I bleeding all the time?This is a terrifying way to live. That’s the point, isn’t it? That’s what terrorism is, that’s what it accomplishes.This is also what a certain type of suspense novel can do.Ever since 911, it had dwelt in the back of my mind that I’d someday write a novel that revolved around a terrorist event. But I didn’t want to write the expected novel, with the expected villains, the expected heroes I don’t want to write the expected anything.\u0026nbspThat someday was right now. The something that was happening next in Paris wasn’t an explosion, it was something much more mundane: I was going to write that terrorism novel, right now. I took my laptop to a café on the rue de Grenelle, opened a new file, and started work immediately, a story that begins on an autumn Tuesday morning at a quarter to nine, when normal ends.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The Treasury estimates that a bottle of wine bought in Heathrow duty-free could, as a result, be up to £2.23 cheaper.Holidaymakers will now also be able to bring in limited amounts of alcohol and cigarettes bought at duty-free shops in the EU, saving over £12 on two crates of beer, for example.Chancellor of the exchequer Sajid Javid said: “As we prepare to leave the EU, I’m pleased to be able to back British travellers.“We want people to enjoy their hard-earned holidays and this decision will help holidaymakers’ cash go that little bit further.”Created with Sketch.Protesters take to streets after Boris Johnson suspends parliament  Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Anti Brexit protesters march on WhitehallMany of the protesters carried placardsThe protesters also marched to Trafalgar Square, where they blocked trafficJohn McDonnell addressed crowds in Whitehall.A small group of Brexit supporters attempted to stage a counter protest in central London.Three people were arrested in London, including a woman who sat on the road near Trafalgar Square.In Oxford, locals and students gathered outside Balliol College, Boris Johnson\u0027s alma mater, to protest.Thousands of people gather in central Glasgow to protest against the prime minister.Jeremy Corbyn spoke to protesters in central Glasgow.Anti Brexit protesters march on WhitehallMany of the protesters carried placardsThe protesters also marched to Trafalgar Square, where they blocked trafficJohn McDonnell addressed crowds in Whitehall.A small group of Brexit supporters attempted to stage a counter protest in central London.Three people were arrested in London, including a woman who sat on the road near Trafalgar Square.In Oxford, locals and students gathered outside Balliol College, Boris Johnson\u0027s alma mater, to protest.Thousands of people gather in central Glasgow to protest against the prime minister.Jeremy Corbyn spoke to protesters in central Glasgow.Currently, travellers will be able to shop duty-free when going to non-EU countries.\u0026nbspTravellers within the EU were able to shop without paying certain local taxes and duties, or customs charges, until the 1990s, on the condition that they took the goods out of the country. Duty-free sales were then abolished when the single market was introduced, effectively erasing national borders.\u0026nbspIn a 1997 statement defending the decision, the European Commission wrote: “People enjoy being able to literally fill up their car or baggage with goods bought in other EU countries that are cheaper or not available in their country of residence.\u0026nbsp“Being able to buy a single 1l bottle of spirits and a single box of 200 cigarettes in a duty-free shop if you happen to travel by air, sea or the Channel Tunnel shuttle pales in comparison with the new opportunities to shop in other EU countries.”These opportunities include the freedom to bring in unlimited amounts of goods bought anywhere in the EU without systematic border checks, making shopping in another EU country as easy as purchasing in a local shop, the commission noted.This freedom will be kept in part after a no-deal Brexit, according to the Treasury statement. People travelling back from the EU will still be able to bring back unlimited amounts specifically of alcohol and cigarettes, provided they did not buy them in a duty-free shop.The Treasury’s decision on duty-free shopping will not apply to movements of goods from Northern Ireland to EU member state Ireland, as EU law does not allow the Irish government to operate duty-free at the land border.A no-deal Brexit, which until last week looked increasingly likely, faces a fresh hurdle after parliament passed a law to stop such an outcome. The bill requires Boris Johnson to request an extension to Brexit negotiations until the end of January unless he can secure a deal or parliamentary approval for no deal by 19 October.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Brexit is not a big deal for Primark, it is more of an event for other people.”ABF also said it has “completed all practical preparations” for Brexit and has contingency plans in place for potential disruption.ABF expects full-year sales at Primark to be 4 per cent up on last year, but much of the growth is due to additional stores being opened.Primark is still the face of fast fashion as growth continuesLike-for-like sales, which strip out that effect, are set to fall 2 per cent globally and 1 per cent in the UK, the company said.

It remains surprising that one of their few films to evade any nominations is this endlessly quotable mistaken identity comedy starring Jeff Bridges as The Dude.Brian De Palma doesn’t exactly make films in the hope of winning award, but his political thriller - based on Michelangelo Antonioni’s Blow Up – would have deserved any Oscar it was nominated for.Breathless\u0027 failure to receive a nomination is proof that the Oscars can’t be trusted.

Nearly , died here.After the collapse of the World Trade Center people began referring to the World Trade Center site as Ground Zero.Ground Zero is a .-acre area in Lower Manhattan in New York City.The site is bounded by Vesey Street to the north, the West Side Highway to the west, Liberty Street to the south, and Church Street to the east. Ground Zero originated as a term to describe the site of a nuclear explosion and later was used to refer to the point of any dramatic or violent event.New Yorkers started calling the World Trade Center site Ground Zero shortly after suicide hijackers destroyed the twin towers and killed nearly , people.For several years the site was also known as “the pit” because reconstruction of a new World Trade Center was stalled, leaving a large hole in the ground. But now it is an active construction site with two of four planned skyscrapers under construction and the memorial plaza opened in time for the th anniversary of the attacks. The renaming came after the New York mayor Michael Bloomberg urged the city to move past a term long linked with the World Trade Center’s Twin Towers destruction.Seventeen years after the terrorist attack, it has been replaced by a rebuilt complex which opened in . The centrepiece is One World Trade Center which is a ,ft skyscraper."},{"url":null,"title":"september 9 11 conspiracy theories","story":"Despite the terror attack being broadcast live across global TV screens, there are still conspiracy theories surrounding the horric events of September , . We look at the most common ones still floating around.On September , , a group of Al-Qaeda terrorists hijacked four commercial airliners.Two planes - American Airlines Flight  and United Airlines Flight  - were flown into the North and South towers of the World Trade Center complex in New York.Another was flown into the Pentagon in Washington and the fourth, United Airlines Flight , crashed into a field in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, after a struggle between the hijackers and passengers.There are dozens of conspiracy theories floating around seventeen years after the attacks took place.The most well-known conspiracy theory relates to the collapse of World Trade Center Tower .It fell later after the collapse of the neighbouring Twin Towers.The conspiracy theory suggests the collapse of the buildings was not solely caused by the plane attacks but also by explosives already installed in the towers.The official report into the tragedy cites flaming debris from the burning skyscraper crashing into the -floor Tower , sparking fires on several floors.The heat generated brought the tower down, concluded the National Institute of Standards and Technology – making it the first steel skyscraper in the world to collapse because of fire.In November , a group of top engineers from the University of Alaska said “office fires” could not have caused its destruction.Presenting the team’s findings at the Justice In Focus Symposium in New York, leader Dr J Leroy Hulsey revealed: “It is our preliminary conclusions based upon our work to date that fire did not produce the failure at this particular building.”Their verdict stoked theories that the World Trade Center buildings were brought to the ground by controlled demolition explosions but there is no evidence to support such a theory.Conspiracy theorists have always questioned why the US Air Force did not intercept any of the four hijacked planes.They claim that then-US Vice President Dick Cheney ordered the military to stand down and not to intercept.However, official reports claim that this was a highly unusual multiple hijacking with on-board violence.The transponders of all four aircraft were also turned off or changed, meaning the planes could not be identied.The hijacking also took place on a day when routine military training exercises happened to be taking place at US air defence command.Data suggests there was confusion and a lack of communication between the civilian air traffic controland the military at the time.Theorists have repeatedly questioned how an amateur pilot was able to fly a commercial plane in a complicated manoeuvre and crash it into the headquarters of the worlds most powerful military,  minutes after the first report of a possible hijack, without leaving any traces.Based on this question, they claim that instead of a Boeing , the Pentagon was in fact struck by a small missile or unmanned drone, or even a signicantly smaller aircraft.When it was confirmed that flight AA did hit the Pentagon, the theorists shted their focus to how the plane managed the dficult manoeuvre, with hardliners claiming the plan was actually being controlled by the Pentagon itself rather than Al Qaeda terrorists.While some early video footage did not show much wreckage at the Pentagon, there is a good deal of video and still photography from the aftermath which shows plane wreckage and evidence of the flight path, such as broken lamp posts.The remains of crew and passengers on the plane were also found and positively identied by DNA, and multiple witnesses also saw the plane strike the Pentagon.Conspiracy theorists chose to focus their questions on why the crash site at Shanksville, Pennsylvania, was so small and why aircraft debris was not as visible as other sites.They claim instead that the plane was shot down by missiles, causing it to disintegrate mid-air – this would have scattered the wreckage over a large area.However, this has been refuted by official photographs that show the full wreckage and recordings of the pilot’s voice confirmed that there had been a passenger revolt when hijackers had attempted to take over the aircraft.The pilot can also be heard confirming that the hijackers caused the plane to crash.Among the most absurd claims made by conspiracy theorists include saying the planes were not real.They suggest that the “planes” that hit the Twin Towers and the Pentagon were missiles surrounded by holograms that were made to appear as planes.However, while this is a popular theory, it fails to take into account the missing planes, passengers and hijackers. One theory revolves around New York property tycoon Larry Silverstein who purchased the entire complex on a nine-year lease six months prior to the attacks.The deal was worth million- but he is said to have walked away with .billonafter taking out a huge insurance claim following the tragedy.Not only that, Mr Silverstein also reportedly explicitly included terrorist attacks as a clause in the new agreement - which fact-fearing oddballs see as a sign of an inside job.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And I do too. Health, education and safer streets are what people need to get on in le, just as they were for me when I was ­growing up.The teachers who got me to study and work hard the police officers who kept us safe when the street I grew up in became a centre for drug dealers and the NHS that cared for my dad in his final days.As every parent knows, nothing is more important than giving your kids the best start in le.That is why I am providing schools with a cash boost to give every child a superb ­education, with the schools that have been historically underfunded ­getting the most.The NHS is one of this country’s ­shining achievements and all of us rely on the care, dedication and expertise of our amazing doctors and nurses.That is why the promises of more money we have made to the NHS are being delivered and why we are putting more money into social care, to give every older person the dignity and ­security they deserve.And to keep our streets safe, I have announced more money to fund our commitment to recruit , new police officers and create , extra prison places.This is the kind of thing that really matters to our daily lives — and it has all been achieved in just six weeks of this new Government.But there is, of course, one big thing that still hasn’t been done after more than three years: Delivering on the ­people’s instructions to leave the European Union.That is why we set a Brexit deadline of October , deal or no deal. We want to get on with it and focus on other priorities such as our public services. No more distractions, dither and delay.Unfortunately, that is exactly what ­Jeremy Corbyn and his allies voted for in Parliament last week, undermining our country’s negotiations with the EU at the final hurdle.Because of their actions, the only way to sort this out once and for all before the deadline would be to go back to the British people in a General Election.But after spending two years constantly calling for an election, suddenly Corbyn is trying to block that too.The day after tomorrow, in Parliament, he and the Labour Party have one last chance to do the right thing and stop running scared of the public.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But talk about vorsprung durch technik. They are quite a distraction.According to my notes, though, Motsi’s also: “Hoping to give them a bit more encouragement. It’s a tough journey and blah blah blah.”So, aside from being hopelessly compromised by the presence of her contestant sister, Oti, it was situation normal at Strictly’s pairing ceremony, which was a bit like the NFL draft for Z-list celebrities. Nothing happened and yet everything happened.An occasion that actually asks quite a lot of the contestants, who have to feign wild enthusiasm for the announcement of their partner, no matter who they get.Levels of sincerity ied on Saturday.Dear old Anton Du Beke looked genuinely delighted to be paired with the dance-trained Emma “Honey” Barton off EastEnders and avoid the Anneka Rice bullet.While BBC pundit Alex Scott resorted to the pat footballer’s response: “I’m over the moon,” to avoid saying anything too specic about how she really felt about Neil Jones, and Giovanni Pernice wasn’t fooling anyone with his fist pumps for landing Michelle Visage .Before we even got to that stage, though, viewers had the almost as tricky task of identying this year’s celebrities, who came with some pretty desperate pleadings.“You may know me from being a CBBC presenter.” No.“You may have seen me on BBC’s Animal Park.” No.“People may have seen me cooking on Saturday morning TV.” Yeah, and they may have seen aliens doing a conga down Falkirk High Street at closing time, Viscountess Emma Weymouth, but I haven’t and I’m supposed to be doing this stuff professionally.It’s the height of arrogance, of course, for the BBC to serve up such an anonymous line-up on its biggest show and, one day, it will bite them on the backside.At the moment, though, a certain level of complacency is probably justied, because I’m pretty sure I said the same thing about Seann Walsh last year, and he turned out to be one of the most talked-about bookings in Strictly history.As unimaginative as these new bookings are, there’s also the tantalising prospect of some serious dancing stfs among that line-up, particularly from the blokes.My expectations are especially high low for Mike Bushell, Chris Ramsey, the ping-pong bloke and rower James Cracknell, who’s “got Luba” , but is already being talked about by the presenters in terms that wouldn’t have flattered Professor Stephen Hawking.“He’s used to sitting down.”All of which, you may have noticed, ignores the real elephant in the room at Saturday’s pairing ceremony, who was teed up perfectly when Mike Bushell laid out his dance credentials.“I like jumping up and down to Faithless.”Well, today’s you’re lucky day, Michael. You’re going to be jumping up and down WITH Faithless.“It’s Katya!”And may that be a lesson you’ll never forget, young lady.Celebs On The Farm, Caprice: “We need to encourage Arg.”Good Morning Britain, Piers Morgan: “Mickey , it’s great to see you in such great shape.”And please send flowers and tributesPiers ever thinks Mickey looks “a bit off colour”.HAVING almost run out of people to offend, patronise and revolt in Los Angeles, it was time for Gemma Collins to choose a fragrance for her new brand of perfume on last week’s final episode of ITVBe’s Diva Forever.Something to reflect her “personality” was the instruction.But with Novichok now on the proscribed list, it looked like being a long old haul as she road- tested a few of the alternatives supplied by her visibly horried US agent.“Nah, car air ­freshener,” said Gemma, pulling a face at the first one.“And this one’s got something that makes me feel sick.”“They don’t know who I am,” she bellowed. “You have to explain who I am. The GC.”Ladies and gentlemen of the US press, meet Godzilla’s Cousin.Fair.THOSE eye-watering meatballs Neil “Razor” Ruddock served up for London Zoo staff last week have already passed into Celebrity MasterChef legend, but probably not out of the systems of anyone who ate them.The size and consistency of hand grenades, they were. And one of the keepers should probably have checked the elephant house, just to seethe bulls were missing anything.They were definitely the culinary highlight of the week though, on a show that always stands or falls on the quality of the bookings.Last week it stood thanks to Razor, Joey Essex and dear old Zandra Rhodes, , who now occupies the same DNA space as a Barry Humphries impression of Su Pollard.A lot of the camera’s attention, of course, was focused on Joey, who was funny here in a way he’s really not on a lot of other shows, probably because so much of his food was “dense”, “thick” and “simple”.The real danger to le and limb, however, was Zandra, who’s deaf as an egg whisk and absolutely lethal with a ft-long kebab skewer in her hands, which may or may not have explained a slight edge to the commentary.“On the red team, Zandra and Oti are preparing the trout for the smoker.”A bit harsh.

And aged , he stopped taking the hormone in a bid to conceive.Im now one month and three weeks off testosterone, he says in the documentary.And now I feel a little bit soft and almost like Im shrinking from inside.Freddys body effectively went into reverse after he halted his injections, meaning he had periods again, his facial hair got wispier and his hips broadened, thereports.I dont like it. Every time I think about it, its like what the f*** am I doing  he says in the film, before sobbing into the camera and admitting that he feels like a f***ing alien.I dont like the idea that Ive got f***ing tampons in my bag, he adds.Freddy felt that having his own child via articial insemination, using a sperm donor, was the simplest option for him as a both gay and transgender man.Not only women feel broody, explains the multimedia journalist, referring to his decision as the pragmatic thing to do. This is a physical process and I will be the dad.Mother Esme adds: I loved being pregnant.Everyone should experience it, shouldnt they  I think... especially men.Freddy, who started the process of trying to conceive in  and visited a fertility clinic, conceived his son on just his second round of insemination after his first attempt failed.He paid £ for the sperm, which he selected from a range of donors. In the film, he reacts with disbelief as he peers down at the positive Clearblue pregnancy test.What  Am I imagining that  he says, turning to his mum beside him.That looks like a positive result to me, darling, Esme replies.Freddy, who describes his heart as f***ing racing, is later filmed attending a pregnancy scan with his mother, where the pair listen to his childs heartbeat inside his womb.But while Freddys bump grew over following months, he was never recognised as a pregnant transgender man, with strangers assuming he simply had a beer belly.Yet after his pregnancy made the headlines, he was targeted by cruel trolls and even received death threats, with some claiming theres no such thing as a pregnant man.As a trans man to carry your own child is a scary, daunting prospect, Esme weeps in the film, wiping her eyes. You just worry for your child that you want them to be happy.By the time Freddy went into labour last year, he was ready to be on the other side of pregnancy.Filmmakers followed him to hospital, where he battled through contractions, clambered into a birthing pool, groaned loudly in pain and finally delivered his gorgeous boy.If men had to go through this all the time, youd just never hear the end of it, Freddy says.Yet despite being legally recognised as a man at the time of his sons birth, Freddy was not allowed to be listed as the father or parent on his birth certicate, only as the mother.He took the decision to Londons High Court earlier this year - where in July judge Sir Andrew McFarlane lted a previous reporting restriction banning his identication.If Freddy wins the case, his boy would be the first child in Britain to legally not have a mum.Today, Freddys fight to be formally registered as his childs dad continues - amid an increasing hostility towards transgender people in Britain and where.UK Government figures show that anti-trans hate crimes soared by nearly a third in just a year - from , in  to , in .Yet Freddy finds comfort in the beautul little boy whom he carried and delivered himself.I obviously feel a very strong bond with him, he says, cradling his tiny son. I just know that I want to be near him all the time. And I miss him... even when hes in bed at night.He adds: I think anyone has the potential to feel that way.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He annoyed people because he was clever, pompous and headstrong.”That description could be given today by many MPs, who have tired of Bercow’s constant attention-seeking and his delight in the sound of his own hammy voice.Just as aggravating has been his bias towards the anti-Conservative opposition. That was reflected yesterday in the Commons at news of his imminent resignation.In a nauseating display, Labour MPs who queued up to heap praise on him before they gave him a standing ovation.The Speaker should be a neutral referee who allows the game to flow freely and fairly.But, throughout his  years in charge of the chamber, Bercow was a whistle-happy, partisan official who acted as an additional player for his favoured side and continually put himself at the centre of the action.To understand Bercow, one incident is particularly illuminating. An early turning point in Bercow’s young le came when the head of his primary school refused to put him forward to grammar school, despite Bercow being so precocious he already read The Times .Instead he had to go to the local comprehensive, where he was bullied.On one occasion he was thrown in a pond as his chief tormentor said triumphantly, “Bercow is in there with the other amphibians.”But the experience fed Bercow’s determination to achieve, which he channelled into politics.To his army of left-wing supporters, he was a great reformer who modernised the practices of the Commons, expanded the role of backbenchers and held the Government rigorously to account.But to his enemies, he was squawking egomaniac who demeaned his office with his behaviour. His explicit cheerleading for left-wing causes and Remain was bad enough.This is a figure who subverted the rules of Parliament to wreck Brexit and undermine the Tory Government through endless procedural manoeuvres, as he has shown again this month.The notorious “B******s to Brexit” sticker on his family car, parked at Parliament, has reflected his attitude.His enthusiasm for the fashionable cause of ersity was highlighted in March  when, at a Westminster ceremony, he bizarrely described Elizabeth II as “a kaleidoscope Queen in a kaleidoscope country in a kaleidoscope Commonwealth.”In another typical move, he barred President Trump from addressing Parliament during his recent state visit, justying his stance on the grounds of Britain’s “opposition to racism and sexism.”Nor has he been helped by his eccentric conduct of his we Sally, who is almost as big an attention-seeker as he is.She worked in public relations and was a Labour campaigner when they married in , but it was his elevation to the Speaker’s chair in  that really gave her the opportunity to bask in the limelight.Having appeared on Celebrity Big Brother – and been the first contestant in her series to be evicted – she went on to take part in an reality show with Paddy Doherty, the CBB winner, bare-knuckle fighter and My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding star, with the pair taking it in turns to experience the other’s lestyle.She caused more embarrassment with other incidents, like the infamous stunt in  when she was photographed in the shadow of Big Ben wearing just a strategically placed sheet.After that, Bercow reportedly “read her the riot act.”Yet she caused him further humiliation when it was revealed in March  that she had indulged in a long, passionate affair with the Speaker’s cousin, Alan Bercow.Though she rebuilt her marriage, she admitted that she was “a terrible we and always had been.”Perhaps the darkest episode of all was when used social media to hint that the former Tory Treasurer Lord McAlpine was a paedophile, a baseless smear for which she ended up in court in , was convicted of libel and ordered to pay undisclosed damages. Despite his legal victory, Lord McAlpine died soon afterwards.Before his marriage to Sally, Bercow had few serious relationships.Conceited and awkward with women, he was described in his youth by one female contemporary as a “loudmouthed” and “not attractive young man.”A female journalist who went on a few dates with him recalled that he “was a very odd little man and socially quite gauche. He was restless and found it hard to relax.”His insecurities were fed by his stature and also his unusual background, which gave him the sense of being an outsider.Further friction is generated by Bercow’s manner, which combines self-importance with linguistic showing-off and flashes of rudeness.Part of this stems from small man syndrome.Standing just  feet six inches tall, Bercow tries to make up for his lack of stature by parading his authority.The former Tory Minister Sir Simon Burns memorably described Bercow as “a sanctimonious dwarf.”Several Tories were so exasperated with him that in  that they tried to throw him out of his job.The MP James Durridge, who organised this unsuccessful bid, said that Labour find Bercow “convenient because he is a more effective opposition than their own leader.”But since then Bercow’s pro-Remain antics have stretched Conservative tolerance beyond breaking point.That’s why the party decided to take the unprecedented step of standing a candidate against Bercow in his Buckingham constituency at the next election in defiance of the long-standing tradition that the Speaker is never opposed by any of the main parties.There have been repeated accusations that Bercow has bullied his staff, allegations he denies, just as he disputes the claim that he called Andrea Leadsom “a stupid woman.”Whatever the truth, he has not established a harmonious atmosphere at Westminster or enhanced his reputation.Unlike some of his predecessors like Bernard Weatherill and Betty Boothroyd, he leaves office under a cloud.Bercow was brilliant at tennis, even becoming a junior British champion. As a young player, he was described by a professional as “unbelievably talented and invincible.”To this day Bercow retains his deep enthusiasm for the sport and is a big fan of Roger Federer - particularlyhe can watch him for free.An investigation last year found he had received more than £, in freebies since he became speaker - most of which were tickets to tennis and football matches.Indeed, he was spotted at Wimbledon this year wearing a t-shirt with the Federer logo on it, while he was also caught by a BBC camera saying, “We all love you, Roger, all of us.”Im not sure the same can be said of Bercow.After a decade in the role of Speaker, he leaves behind a tainted legacy.He sees himself as a champion of Parliamentary democracy. But in reality, he has presided over a woefully discredited Commons.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

At other times of the year the source region is neither cold nor snow-covered and winds from north-eastern Europe bring a form of tropical continental air.Over the late August Bank Holiday, Britain basked in temperatures of C.And while season change has seen the trees start to drop their leaves, forecasters have warned it could be one of the hottest autumns in a century.Forecaster Brian Gaze said: “Computer forecast models support the three-month period ahead being among the warmest on record.“Indian summer-like settled and sunny weather is forecast to start in a week’s time, lasting a week or more and seeing highs up to C.The deadly Hurricane Dorian was expected to merge with Tropical Storm Gabrielle to batter Britain with mph wind and ins rain.Further gusts and deluges are expected on Thursday and Friday after the winds are sent spinning past the Azores.By the end of the weekend, Northern Ireland and Scotland will see some cloud and rain, with the West of England drenched by the beginning of the week.Rain clouds from the west will spread over much of the country and Monday will be very dferent to todays weather with lots of wind and rain as the Dorian and Gabrielle team up."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa may honours list quentin letts","story":"Flagrant pro-European MPs started brawling in Parliament. Theresa May gave lordships and knighthoods to her Brexit-blocking favourites.And Commons Speaker John Bercow allowed Remainers to coat him with unctuous praise after he said he was off to spend more time with his £million pension pot.After the vain and aggressive Bercow announced he will finally quit at the end of October, he allowed MPs to spend the next hour and a half nishing him with a weird mix of treacle and bulls**t.“Ah, Mr Snodgrass, you want to say what a marvellous chap I am  The floor is yours.”And yes, they really did go on for an appalling, toe-curling hour and a half — even while they were moaning about being short of time to discuss Brexit.Long after closing time in most pubs, a group of anti-Brexit MPs engineered a physical tussle around the Speaker’s Chair.They hoped their stunt would symbolise their disapproval of Boris Johnson closing down this madhouse parliament for a few weeks in his “prorogation” gambit, which has been approved by the courts.What a pathetic spectacle ensued. One prize prat, Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle, tried to jump into Bercow’s lap, pleading with him not to leave the Chamber.It was like seeing a poodle try to jump on to its mistress’s knees.Russell-Moyle was then yanked out of the way by Bercow’s tailcoated minders, and some baby boxing wrists were flapped — handbags at midnight. Classy, eh Some of the House’s most verbose MPs held up sheets of paper saying, “Silenced”.They bleated, “Shame!” and booed when the twirly ceremonial closure of the House began. Bercow added to the hysteria by screaming abuse at Tory MPs.The country must have looked at these maniacs and thought: “Oh do act your age.” What will the outside world have made of it all You occasionally see TV news footage of punch-ups in foreign parliaments, places like Taiwan and Turkey and Uganda.This time the farcical argy-bargy was happening in our own House of Commons. Vladimir Putin must be laughing so hard his plastic surgery may soon rip.Our allies in places such as the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand must be slapping their foreheads and thinking: “What on earth has happened to the once-calm, reasonable United Kingdom.Can we really do business with this deranged political elite that is ignoring a national referendum ” Theresa May’s resignation honours list was little better.It has long been the custom — heaven knows why — for departing Prime Ministers to nominate a few friends for honours. That practice must now, surely, please be reviewed.Apart from the knighthoods for cricketers Andrew Strauss and Geoffrey Boycott , Mrs May rewarded a bunch of no-hopers in her political circle.Peerages went to her useless chief of staff Gavin Barwell and to her Brexit negotiator Olly Robbins, the civil servant with whom May bypassed elected Cabinet ministers before the Chequers summit of .Various spin doctors were on May’s list, too. Ditto former deputy PMDavid Lidington and big-bucks Tory donors Ehud Sheleg and David Brownlow.One of the few creditable things about Mrs May used to be that she resisted dishing out honours to her mates. Now she has blown even that part of her reputation.If Mrs May had managed to get us out of the EU, as instructed by the electorate, that might have just about passed the smell test.But these drongos were a catastrophic flop. The May team pursued a “Brexit in name only” and could not even achieve that.Honouring them is like giving an open-topped bus ride through the streets to a football team that has just been relegated. What will voters make of this gongs-for-the-boys culture A harmless bit of fun  Or a remote parliamentary crowd giving twirly titles to a long line of sub-par operatives The worst thing is that few of us are surprised by this stuff. I don’t suppose many of us genuinely believe politicians’ promises any more.How can we, when they said they would “honour the referendum” but now tell Boris Johnson to go to Brussels with a surrender letter This same elite, which so casually bungs honours to its pals, always sneers at the word “populist” as being something almost dirty.Instead, it wants the status quo. But the status quo, as we can see, is this gang of grotesques who are histrionically opposed to Brexit and who are so greedily self-rewarding.Why on earth is Jeremy Corbyn so keen on them  The country is desperate for change from these crooks and limpets. We want to get rid of them. Yet Corbyn’s Labour wants to keep them in power. He has become the establishment’s stooge.If populism is the alternative to Bercow and Co, that sounds pretty good to me. Boris Johnson has already shown himself ready to upset the elite. Let’s have more of that.If it takes some sort of electoral pact with Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party, who cares  The elite has chosen to float away from us.

The new policy rips up the current grace period of four months and will be available for students who start any undergraduate-or-above courses from Autumn .Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the new system will let international students unlock their potential and start their careers in the UK. It is a screeching departure from the hardline policy of Theresa May - who closed down two-year graduate visas in  claiming they were too generous. And it comes after months of warnings from universities that Britain could be left without key skills in a no-deal Brexit .   Opposition parties claimed victory over the announcement - but said it had took too long and must go further.

Many of the graduates doing fantastic medical and other research earn less than that. Government policy will prevent us from attracting them to live and work here.”SNP MP Stuart McDonald said: This screeching Tory u-turn is a huge victory for the SNP , Scottish Government and Scotlandaposs education sector.This long-overdue move underlines the absurdity of this shambolic Tory government, and their harmful and erratic hostile environment policies. The devil will be in the detail as to whether this proposal is a full replacement and meets Scotlandaposs specic needs. The government said international graduates in any subject will be able to stay in the UK for two years to find work. Government officials said students will need:To start their course in   or later To be studying at undergraduate level or above To have graduated successfully To be at a trusted UK university or higher education provider that has a proven track record in upholding immigration checks and other rules To have Tier  leave - a general student visa - at the point the route is introduced.There will be no cap on the number of students who can apply for the new Graduate route, the government said.

Labour and SNP MPs had a sing song  while men in tights speaking Norman French officially announced the ending of the marathon session. We should remember the session was only curtailed by a few days and Parliament was due to break for the party conference season at the end of this week in any event. But amid the theatrics, incomprehensible procedures and outbursts of sentimentality the MPs are right to be furious about  the unilateral action of the Boris Johnson. Opposition MPs cannot fulfil their mainof holding the Government to account.The Home Affairs select committee, for example, has been denied the chance to question Priti Patel about how a no-deal Brexit would impact on our security. Johnson will now avoid a session of the Liaison Committee which wished to quiz him about his Brexit plans, or lack of them. MPs who tabled questions about Government policy have received replies from ministers saying they will not receive an answer because Parliament is now prorogued. This matters.  Often these questions relate to constituency matters or are ways of shining a light on the government’s failure to deliver public services or misuse of expenditure. It is not the MPs who lose out when Parliament is not operating, it is the public. One of the ironies of John Bercow’s time as Speaker is that, despite his efforts to enhance the power of MPs, Parliament has rarely been held in such disdain by the public.

Current deputy Sir Lindsay Hoyle is the favourite while Labour grandee Harriet Harman is bidding to become only the second woman to hold the post. It comes after Mr Bercow - regularly accused of anti-Brexit bias but hailed as a hero of Parliament by his fans - finally announced he will bow out after  years. The Speaker wept as he announced he would quit on October  in a declaration watched by his we Sally. The timing of his resignation is no coincidence. It means the election to replace him is likely to come before a general election, allowing the current Parliament - not a new one - to choose his replacement.    That is important because it means a group of MPs who are against a hard, no-deal Brexit will be choosing the next person to oversee the legislature. So how will the election work and who is running  Heres everything you need to know. How does the election work   MPs would normally be expected to vote for a new Speaker on Monday  November - the first sitting day after John Bercow quits. Candidates must submit their nomination papers, signed by at least  MPs from at three parties, to Commons authorities between .am and .am on the day of the election. Names of all the approved candidates are then published at am before a snap hustings in the Commons chamber at .pm - consisting of a speech from each hopeful. MPs will then be given half an hour to vote for their favourite candidate on a ballot paper. If no single candidate wins more than % of the vote, the lowest-ranked candidateis eliminated and there is another round of voting. This continues until one candidate has won more than % of the total votes from MPs. A motion is then put to the Commons proposing the winner as Speaker. It can go to a vote again but by this point, they are likely to win. Traditionally the Speaker is dragged to the grand seat, supposedly against their will.

Odds:    The Lancashire-born businessman went to private Lordaposs College in Bolton and ran his own screen-printing firm before becoming an MP in . He has been a Deputy Speaker for nine years where his no-nonsense manner led to clashes with MPs - including telling off the SNP for singing EU anthem Ode to Joy in . In the same week he had a fierce clash with ex-SNP leader Alex Salmond, with the pair shouting at each other across the chamber over time slots given to Brexit scrutiny. Despite this Mr Hoyle is generally regarded as a popular figure who hasnapost made enemies in the same way as Bercow.There was an outpouring of tributes in  when his -year-old daughter Natalie was found dead. An inquest recorded an open verdict. Mr Hoyle was one of just three Labour MPs who did not declare their voting intention in the  EU referendum. His Lancashire district backed Brexit by % to %. Harriet Harman Labour, Camberwell  Peckham, age . Odds:     As Westminsteraposs longest-serving female MP, the QC is known as the Mother of the House with  yearsapos unbroken service.

Following a torrent of stories in the Daily Mail, she later said she regretted the NCCLaposs decision to grant affiliate status to a pro-paedophile group before she joined the staff. When she was elected barely  women had served in the Commons in its history. Her decades of activism for womenaposs rights led to mockery from right-wing pundits, including when she toured a pink bus round the country in . Her four-month stint as acting Labour leader, before Jeremy Corbyn took power, was marked by her decision not to oppose cruel Tory tax credit cuts that were later scrapped.

Her warning that she will take a robust stance could spark fears she will be a continuity John Bercow. Dame Eleanor Laing Conservative, Epping Forest, age . Odds:     The privately-educated solicitor from Paisley has spent six of her  years in Parliament as a Deputy Speaker, meaning she did not declare how she voted in the  EU referendum. She was a Special Advisor during the Thatcher and Major governments, and after her  election was an early Tory backer of equalising the age of consent at  for gay men. But she attracted controversy in  when she allegedly criticised a pregnant MP for leaving a debate to eat. She also voluntarily repaid £, during the  MPsapos expenses scandal over claims relating to a second home. Announcing her candidacy, she said the next Speaker should definitely be a woman as people need a breath of fresh air in Parliament. Meg Hillier Labour, Hackney South  Shoreditch, age . Odds:     The privately-schooled former journalist and councillor served on the London Assembly before her election in . As Gordon Brownaposs Identity Minister she was tasked with promoting the failed ID card scheme - but was left red-faced in  when forgetting her own ID card at a photoshoot. She later served as Shadow Energy Secretary under Ed Miliband before rising to prominence as the hard-bitten chair of the powerful Public Accounts Committee. Pro-EU Ms Hillier voted Remain in the  referendum, voted against triggering Article  in , and earlier this year said Parliament should seriously consider delaying or revoking Article  to cancel Brexit. Chris Bryant Labour, Rhondda, age . Odds:     The privately-schooled former Church of England vicar dabbled with Conservatism as a student, before leaving the priesthood in  when he realised other members of the church believed the Bible doesnapost really like gays. He moved to London and rose through the ranks of the capitalaposs Labour groups through the s before his election to Parliament in . He shot to prominence soon afterwards for his role exposing wrongdoing in the press, including extracting a confession by then-Sun editor Rebekah Wade in  that the paper had paid the police for information in the past. He has become an outspoken voice on skin cancer after discovering he had melanoma on a trip to the barber. The MP voted Remain in the  referendum and said the whole country should have a chance to hold a second referendum on Brexit. His opening offer to MPs marked him out from John Bercow, emphasising that he would stick to rules and fairness. Sir Edward Leigh Conservative, Gainsborough, age . Odds:  Not available  The privately-educated veteran MP since  has only an outside chance due to his tub-thumping backing for Brexit. He has highly conservative views on social issues including backing the anti-gay Section  and voting against civil partnerships. Briefly a junior minister under John Major, the MP has spent all but three of his  years in Parliament as a backbencher including on the trade, procedure and parliamentary restoration committees. Sir Henry Bellingham Conservative, North West Norfolk, age . Odds:  Not available  The Old Etonian Leave-backer was elected as an MP in  after a career as a barrister.

Iaposve had quite a few questions of this. Did I ever catch anyone in the mile high club  No, I didnapost. Honestly never, Lucy said. I mean there were a few occasions where two people come out of the toilet together, like it was a husband and we. There were a few of those but I donapost know what theyaposre doing in there, who knows right   They could have just been going to the toilet together but I never actually thought to myself theyaposre up to x, y and z in the toilet.  I never actually heard of any anyone catching anyone either so maybe it is a little bit of like a scandalised myth. Iaposm sure someone at some point has caught someone doing it on the plane but in my personal experience, no. Lucy was askedshe and her co-workers suffered from jet lag as a result of flying to far-flung destinations. Yes absolutely, all the time. I think any long-haul cabin crew member will experience jet lag - itaposs kind of unavoidable really,apos she said.  Lucy said the only bad experience she had with a customer was when they ran out of a particular snack on board. A lady got really funny with me once because I ran out of Pringles for her kids. I mean, I do not stock up the airplane so I have nothing to do with the fact that weaposre out of Pringles, nothing I can do, itaposs just the way it is,apos she said. But some people like to get really funny about the most ridiculous things and that is one of them - the fact youaposre out of something that they want on the trolley.apos    Thereaposs are so many dferent positions you can work, you can either be working at the back or you can be at the front or you can be on the trolley. They do try and give you something called a crew rest which means you get a certain break on the plane. There are beds on the planes so cabin crew can get sleep and catch some much-needed shut-eye. There are beds on the planes... Thereaposs a crew rest room where cabin crew go to sleep, they usually either upstairs or downstairs on the plane, she continued. As a cabin crew member, Lucy said they were required to look immaculate on board at all times and adhere to a strict dress code. Yes they do take that kind of thing very seriously,apos she said. Youaposre actually marked on each flight on your personal grooming soyou are meeting the grooming standards like is your lipstick red, your hair correct, are you wearing the unorm correctly     In regards to hair, Iaposd try to wear it like as a cabin crew does - so up in a bun and smart appearance. Lucy said she was given up to seven free flights a year as a perk of the job - but was still required to pay tax on them. They were only standby flights - meaning they werenapost definitely booked sothe flight was oversold or full, you wouldnapost get on,apos she said. aposSo they werenapost definite tickets which was kind of annoying because I like to plan everything. I donapost really like to be waiting around. I also didnapost get the chance to use any of it because I was so busy all the time. You donapost get to choose specic dates or anything like that, you kind of get what youaposre given when you first join so I didnapost even get a chance to use any of my free flights. Lucy said all their meals were provided on board and admitted to liking the food served to passengers at ,ft. I love aeroplane food. So they give you vouchers for food. They also load them onto my credit card for food when you are staying in whatever country youaposre in, she said. She revealed that she would sometimes bump into Hollywood celebrities, including Kate Winslet and Charlize Theron.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA gang of nine men and one woman cynically groomed vulnerable girls, treating them as objects to be used and abused at will, a court heard. Today a jury heard four socially isolated girls in the Huddersfield area were treated as sexual commodities against their wishes by older men. Prosecutor Richard Wright QC told Leeds Crown Court there was a sense that those in authority did not do enough to engage with these girls and find out what was happening to them. The alleged abuse happened in West Yorkshire between  and . Mr Wright said: The girls targeted by those men were children and the men knew that and they did not care about it for a moment.  These men cared only for themselves and viewed these girls as objects to be used and abused at will. You will readily understand that these vulnerable youngsters, who were also socially isolated, very rapidly found themselves drawn into a world in which they had little or no control of their lives and were unable to make truly free or informed choices about anything they did with these men. Discussing the complainantsapos backgrounds, the prosecutor told jurors: What they plainly had in common was their young age, their social isolation, and the fact that each of them was in their own way extremely vulnerable so that they were easy targets for abuse. He added that the defendants, all from Huddersfield, had deliberately targeted the vulnerable children, bent them to their will, abused them and passed them around other men for sexual purposes, using threats and violence when necessary.  The prosecutor told jurors that, after being offered friendship, cigarettes, alcohol and drugs, some of the girls, who were aged between  and  at the time, were taken to parties and used as a commodity. The court heard how, prior to and during the alleged offences, the complainants had been deliberately avoiding home and people in positions of authority. Mr Wright said: There is here regrettably a sense that those in authority who handled the concerns of parents and friends expressed at the time of these offences did not do enough to engage with these girls and find out what was happening to them. The prosecutor said that one of these children had been intelligent and close to her mother prior to the abuse, but became immersed in a very dangerous lestyle when she moved schools and befriended a group of children who regularly truanted and associated with older Asian men.    Jurors were told that another of the four complainants had similarly been bright, but went off the rails. Mr Wright said that the girlaposs mother had desperately tried to stop her daughter from going out and had contacted police and social services, but was failed by their inaction. A -year-old man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, denies one count of rape and two of trafficking for sexual exploitation, while Iftikar Ali, , of Holly Road, Thornton Lodge, is charged with three counts of rape and one of attempted rape. Basharat Hussain, , of William Street, Crosland Moor, faces two rape charges, while Manzoor Akhtar, , of Blackmoorfoot Road, faces three counts of the same offence and one of trafficking for sexual exploitation.

The -year-old claimed the alternative trousers offered were not tailored which goes against the schoolaposs policy. Theresa also claimed placing pupils in isolation could affect their mental health and body image.  I agree with school unorm, but I think they are just picking for pickingaposs sake to lord power over the kids, Theresa, from Shipdham, said.If they are going to be so picky maybe the school should start providing it because children are being punished for the way that their parents have interpreted the unorm policy - they have not gone out and bought it themselves. It is such a pathetic thing to have a go at a school child for. Why chastise them for something so minimal and meaningless  I had a problem with her school skirt last year, because like many girls she is slim with long legs. What theof a skirt has to do with her ability to learn I have no idea. The way the teachers are dealing with it is degrading and humiliating and it is making the girls more body-conscious. I think they are doing the children harm mentally. It is no wonder some of them donapost want to go to school.The school said it issued it issues unorm policy to parents beforehand so they can buy with confidence and that isolation was only used as a last resort.

Lisa Daw said her daughter Beth was marched out of lessons for wearing the wrong trousers and taken to the unorm supplier to get a pair that fit the schoolaposs rules. However, on arrival, the shop confirmed that Beth was in fact wearing the correct unorm. Lisa said her daughter has been made to feel fat by staff at Queen Elizabethaposs School in Crediton, Devon, and she has demanded an apology, DevonLive reports. The policy says trousers have to have a crease down the front but on her -year-old daughter the ones that fit her waist are tight on her thighs.  Beth plays rugby for Crediton and was in Devon under-s last year. Her mum said: Sheaposs being made to feel fat and sheaposs not. The ones that fit her waist are tight around her thigh - so thereaposs no crease. Itaposs not her fault sheaposs the wrong shape. Lisa said the school has clamped down on school unorm rules since the start of the new term and claims  students were given aposred cardapos detention on the first day. She said that students are lined up for a unorm check and inspected like prison inmates. Lisa said: She has had three red cards already this term. I told them that she was wearing the right trousers from Town and Country, which is their supplier. Basically they are calling me a liar. Iaposm fuming. Today she was humiliated and embarrassed when a classroom assistant came and took her out of class and marched her down to Town and Country. She had to try on the trousers in front of strangers - and they said aposYes sheaposs wearing the right onesapos. Itaposs just her shape. Now I am waiting for an apology from the school. They should apologise to Beth too for humiliating her in public and they should take all the red cards off her record. Sheaposs fit and strong and Iaposm proud of her. Sheaposs not overweight. To get trousers big enough to have a crease, she would have to have a huge baggy waistband. We already have to take these ones in.  Lisa, a single mum, said she broke down in tears in the principals office because Bethaposs trousers were bought with a grant from the school and she cannot afford to buy new unorm. She said she feels that the children who come from poorer families are the ones who are being punished. Lisa added: She went to Red Card at break with her food from the canteen because we get free school meals and she was told to put it in bin. She refused to throw it away, so she ate it and was then given another red card for Monday. There were  red cards on the first day back at school -you are living on the poverty line your child will keep getting red cards until you can afford to put it right. Thataposs not fair to punish the children. I agree there should be a unorm policy - but Bethaposs trousers are the regulation ones. Queen Elizabethaposs School said it has worked closely with Lisa and with good positive discussions it can resolve any issues.  School principal Rupert Poole said: QE staff have been working hard at the start of term to ensure our unorm policy is consistently applied. Students and their parents and carers have responded very well to this and the vast majority of students wear clothing that meets the policy. In the cases where they do not we have had good support from our parents and carers in correcting any issues. In relation to the concerns raised by Mrs Daw, the student briefings that we hold every morning allow us to come together to celebrate successes. They create a prompt and well organised start to the school day, as well as ensuring the unorm policy is consistently applied.

She beamed as she chatted and played with the kids, dressed in a floral blue and pink Emilia Wickstead dress.

It features trampolines surrounded by trees, two treehouses, linked via a walkway with slides, and a living willow pod.  In her speech at the opening, Kate said: As a parent, I have learnt just how important it is to foster our children’s development, in all areas, not just physical, as soon as they are born. We build the blocks, the foundations, for future success and happiness later in their lives. Kate, a keen gardener, advocates for spending time amongst nature - and even got George, Charlotte and Louis involved in her Cha Flower Show garden. They were pictured playing amongst the foliage and near a tee-pee made from sticks.

Sue Biggs, RHS Director General, says: “RHS Garden Wisley is our flagship garden, welcoming over a million visitors a year, many of whom are families with young children, who we want to become the next generation of gardeners. “How magical for these children to play somewhere that has been inspired by gardens co-designed by The Duchess.

Her mum, Meabh, paid tribute to her daughter in front of mourners at Belfastaposs St Brigidaposs Church - the same church in which Nora was baptised. During the service, the poem was read out and recalled a raucous squeal of hilarity and a memory sure and raw. The -year-old died in Malaysia after surviving for around a week as search teams desperately tried to find her. She had been on a family holiday with her French-Irish parents Sebastien and Meabh Quoirin, and her siblings Innes, , and Maurice, eight.    She disappeared from her hotel room on August  and was found ten days later in a nearby area of rain forest. Nora, who was born with the brain defect holoprosencephaly, died of starvation and stress, her autopsy determined. The principal celebrant at the service was Father Edward OaposDonnell, parish priest of St Brigidaposs.The priest told the congregation how “ years ago on a joy-filled afternoon” Nora’s parents “together with all the family came to this church and carried Nora to the Baptismal Font”,  the Belfastreported. He spoke of Noraaposs “gentleness and her innocence”  and said her death left her loved ones “in terrible pain”. “She, as we all know, depended greatly on others but, Nora in turn, gted others with immeasurable love and joy before such an ability we can only feel gratitude, the priest said. Fr O’Donnell went on to explain how much Noraaposs loved ones had been tested when their prayers for her safehad not been answered. Yet, even as I voice my complaint my eyes drt to the Crucix and my ears hear yet again the anguished cry of Jesus from that Cross, ‘My God, my God, why have you deserted me ’ he said. “And I am reminded immediately that the cry of Jesus from the Cross, while one of deep distress, was not one of despair. I hear him say to us in this moment, ‘Trust in God still, and trust in me’.” The priest added: “Meabh and Sebastien, Innes and Maurice, remember Nora’s love for you, and know that she still loves you, and as you continue to love her, love one another.”  Noraaposs body was finally discovered naked by a team of volunteer hikers close to the Dusun Rainforest Resort where the family had been staying. Over a hundred police, volunteers, snfer dogs, helicopters and even shamans had been deployed to track down Nora. Nora’s paternal grandfather Sylvain Quoirin rejected the idea that the vulnerable teen wandered off from her hotel room. “She wasn’t there yet [during previous searches]. Someone put her there, to get rid of her,” he told the . “Can you imagine her walking .km, naked and barefoot, over rocks, in the middle of the night ” Sylvian added. “For me, that’s absurd.”  Following the autopsy results Nora’s parents said there were still questions to answer surrounding the strange circumstances of her death. Her distraught family, who live in London, said they believe the vulnerable teen was snatched out her bed despite a post-mortem saying she died from stress and starvation. However, police in Malaysia announced they have so far found no evidence of abduction or kidnapping. One part of my is a part unknown, The truth within I know defies, Not true to mind but true in time, The tutor in my le has come. One core to mine is a core passed on, Its path untraced, its vision blurred, It reaches heights I cannot learn,Instinctive and still brave it runs. One raucous squeal of hilarity, Of teasing, squashing, caring fame, The constant turn of fortunes games,No fun, no punch an easy peace.

One rebel must beside me stay, The eldest innocent my care, No more anxious notes, the prayer, For the gruffest angel ever made."},{"url":null,"title":"prince andrew pictured celebrity lawyer","story":"NewsPrince Andrew pictured with celebrity lawyer who represented Harvey WeinsteinPaul Tweed has acted for a string of Hollywood A-listers and is an expert in reputation managementShareCommentsByPaul Byrne:,  SEP Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video duke-york-marks-bruges-anniversary-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:,],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:\"\"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

His parents have never been able to afford one before. They even had to take out a loan to afford this one after scrimping and saving all they could. Shockingly, the working family is left with £-a-month of wriggle room for unexpected expenses after paying all their bills. The Jeals live on a former council estate in Blackburn with mum Sarah, , admitting she struggles with anxiety over her money worries. They are not entitled to any benefits - including a free nursery place for daughter Skye - because dad Michael earns £ over the threshold.It means Sarah canapostto work as she canapost afford private childcare.Data collected exclusively for the Daily Mirroraposs Town  series reveals that Blackburn and the surrounding district is the fourth most deprived area of England.

Mrs Jealaposs two older children also live locally. And they say despite promises from politicians they have never been worse off. Mrs Jeal admits she “tosses and turns” at night thinking about the familyaposs bills.  My husband comes home and says there’s no overtime this week and I have to sit and think - what can I cut back on  What’s going ” Sheaposs fortunate never to have to approach a foodbank - saying her mum would never let the family starve. “We have my mumI ever get desperate, she said. She’s always put food in the cupboard, I’m lucky. But then not everyone has a mum. See how your area ranks for deprivation with the Mirroraposs exclusive interactive map    The Jeals are up to their eyeballs in debt, trying to make do with little more than the minimum wage. But they did all they could to throw Jayden his birthday party. “His friends get presents, decorations, balloons- my son’s never had them, said Mrs Jeal. He’s five - I didn’t have the heart to say you can’t have a party like your friends. “It’s worth it just to see his face, but we’re having to take a loan to do it.” Mrs Jeal is thrty and proudly mentions how she managed to make up kids’ party bags from the local discount store at a cost of around £. per child.  If that figure sounds oddly specic - it’s because the Jeals’ budget scrutinises every last penny. Mrs Jeal says her family has been penalised because her husband earns just £ over the minimum wage an hour in a job he’s worked at for six years as a medical supplies warehouse operator.  She says the family has lost access to benefits they desperately need because he brings home £ extra a week in his paypacket. Sheaposs now calling on the Government to end the cruel benefit caps freeze. She says: “It makes me really, really mad because we’re doing the best we can for our family.” The familyaposs financial situation even affects the food they eat.  When the family eats chicken as a treat, Mrs Jeal goes without so her husband and children have enough to eat.“I’m not a big meat eater or anything soI get something like a chicken I give it to my husband and my kids and I just make do with potatoes and gravy.” The mum says she is in poor health because of these sacrices - she struggles to lose weight - finding that healthy food like fruit and vegetables are the most expensive. Mrs Jeal says that Jayden had the benefit of a free nursery early childhood education when he turned two.However, his little sister Skye won’t qualy for the free  hours a week that could have enabled her to go back to work. Because her annual wage has risen by £ over two years in line with the recent national minimum wage rises, the family no longer qualy for the nursery place - they earn £ annually over the threshold. Mrs Jeal is desperate for her “bright, intelligent” toddler to get the same early education as her son- also pointing out it’s meant to help parents back to work.

N’Jie, who plays Ellis Chapman in the soap opera, had to be escorted out of the Hilton Park Hotel by security staff. This is intolerable behaviour from someone in the public eye. The actors in soap operas are role models, for young people especially, and too many youngsters are dying in our streets from the brutal use of blades.

Brooke Skylar Richardson can be seen with a baby bump in the image, which was taken when she was on Spring Break in . The -year-old was also photographed heavily pregnant at her high school prom, two days before she had the child. Richardson was just  when she secretly gave birth in her bathroom and allegedly buried the tot, named Annabelle, in her backyard.    No one around her knew she was pregnant, and she did not reveal to anyone that her child had died, going on to graduate from high school just two weeks later. She was arrested in July  when she ed to the doctoraposs practice where she learned she was pregnant to ask for birth control. When doctors asked what the outcome of her pregnancy had been, she confessed to burying everything, according to US media reports. Prosecutors at Warren County Court in Ohio, USA, claim she bashed in the babyaposs skull after researching aposhow to get rid of a babyapos. She faces charges of aggravated murder and involuntary manslaughter which could see her jailed for lefound guilty. The cheerleaderaposs lawyer said the baby was pale when she gave birth on her bathroom floor and there was no umbilical cord attached. The baby was not breathing, they claimed, and she panicked and buried her shortly afterwards. It is claimed she thought she had months until her due date, but the baby arrived just  days after she found out she was expecting in April . Prosecutors at the Ohio trial read a text message she sent to her mother - who had no idea she was pregnant.    It said: Iaposm literally speachlesswith how happy am... I am literally so excited now just for dinner to wear something cute yayyyy my belly is back and now Iaposm takin this opportunity to make it amazing. She also visited the gym hours after giving birth and took a selfie in the mirror which showed off her stomach.  In the image, which was presented for the first time at trial, she is seen lting up her t-shirt and standing to the side. The teenager sent it the same day she gave birth, they said. Prosecutors presented it along with an image of her babyaposs bones. Richardson shook when the image was shown to the court. Among those who testied on Wednesday last week, the first day of the trial, was -year-old Trey Johnson who claims he is the babyaposs father. He said he and Richardson had sex twice in August , once without protection, and that is when she likely fell pregnant. He was never told about the baby.    The doctor who she told she was pregnant said he advised her that she did not have to have the babyshe did not want to.   Prosecutors presented Richardson - now  - as a premeditated, image-obsessed cheerleader.    While her family were sleeping, she gave birth quietly and destroyed all evidence of her birth and buried her in the backyard, prosecutors said. Dr William Andrew told the court that during a medical appointment, Richardson had told him: I canapost have a baby. Iaposm going to college in September. Another medic, Dr Casey Boyce, said when she asked her about the pregnancy when she ed to the doctoraposs office in July , she started sobbing and told her: I had it alone in my house and buried it in my backyard. She didnapost want me to tell anyone that I knew. She then consulted with Dr Andrew and called the police. Two crime scene workers said they were drawn to a fire pit in the back yard where the babyaposs remains were thought to have been tossed. But bones found in the fire pit belonged to an animal. Richardsonaposs defence team say the text message to her mum was taken out of context and speaks more about concern with her body image and history of eating disorders rather than the pregnancy.

Now , Dr Chynn could see the burning towers while he was out walking his dog on Manhattan, New York, that morning. He grabbed his roller blades and rushed to the scene. The medic was working at a local hospital during a previous terror attack scare and knew how vital his experience would be at the scene rather than waiting for any victims to be taken to hospital.  When Dr Chynn, who lives in New York City, arrived at the scene he was surrounded by debris and smoke but got to work setting up what he claims to be the first triage centre on site.

As soon as I arrived I was surrounded by smoke, debris and paper inches deep but I had to go and find the buildings. Along the way I met other volunteers and after about  minutes of looking we found the remains of the Twin Towers, which were only about three stories high. The scene was awful, people were trying to clear debris and body parts from all over the place.    I quickly did what I could to help and - as the first physician on the scene - set up the first triage centre. I was on the scene volunteering for about a week and captured these photos whilst I was there. They were captured on a film camera, so took me a while to get them developed, but as soon as I got the physical photos back I knew I had to share them.  As distressing as the time was and the photos are, they show the pure compassion that people have for other strangers.

Anne Jensen, , is  weeks pregnant with her first child and decided to swap from vegetarianism to fruitarian three years ago after finding videos about the lestyle on the internet. She now eats nothing but uncooked fruit and veg, claiming that sheaposs never looked back. She said: Before this, I was eating a lot, but it wasnapost the right fuel. Most of my friends are fruitarian too and agree that it’s the healthiest choice and my loved ones are very supportive. “But people online, who don’t understand the raw vegan diet, have been critical, telling me I should be drinking cows’ milk while pregnant to give my baby everything it needs.    “I believe cows’ milk is for cows’ babies, though, and that humans can get all the nutrients they require from plants. Nutrition student Anne, who has lived all over the world but is currently staying in Denmark with her fellow fruitarian boyfriend Grant Painter, . She was vegetarian for eight years but when she was  and living as an au pair in France she started to have bizarre symptoms including muscle shakes and hair loss and felt generally sluggish - prompting her to search the internet for answers. She explained: “I was living with a family there and eating what they ate, which was dferent to my diet back home – lots of cheese, lots of cream and lots of processed food. “I think my body just couldn’t cope. I began to get all sorts of health issues. My muscles would shake, my hair would fall out and I’d feel so tired and sluggish.”  Anne added: “Something in my head clicked that the healthiest way to live was to eat fruit and vegetables – the most natural things in the world. “I didn’t go into it lightly. I spent around a year researching it, reading dferent studies and papers. “I wanted to make sure that I would be able to stick to my new diet, and that it would give me everything I needed, nutrition-wise. “I did worry about things like sugar, as people kept saying how sugary fruit was. The way I understand it, though, the sugar in fruit is completely dferent to the processed kind. That really put my mind at ease. So, three years ago, aged , Anne decided to officially turn fruitarian and says she soon began to see a dference, especially in her energy levels. She continued: “It was a really easy transition. I honestly haven’t missed my old diet. “My muscle shakes and hair loss soon stopped, and I suddenly had so much energy. I was waking up at am and going for runs, with no recovery time afterwards. “I could run a half marathon and feel absolutely fine the next day. Before long, I was running km every morning, just as a way of using some of my extra energy.   “I also noticed things like headaches and period cramps, which I had suffered with before without even really realising, had gone. It’s all these things you don’t realise had been affecting you until they stop.”Since falling pregnant Anne admits she has had to introduce some cooked vegan meals to her diet to help combat nausea. But once her child is born she plans toto a  per cent raw vegan eating plan – and hopes to raise her baby on the same diet. Anne continued: At the moment, I am mostly fruit-based, but do eat the odd cooked meal, as it seems to help with nausea, I’m not sure why. When I’ve given birth, though, I would love toto a completely fruitarian diet and hope my child will do the same – but I will just have to wait and see.” On an average day, she will begin with a ‘monomeal’ – which is made up of just one kind of raw fruit or vegetable – such as three melons, or half a large watermelon. Lunch will usually be smoothie, with one of her favourite recipes entailing blending five bananas with around  dates, fresh berries and water. “That will keep me full for hours,” she added.    For dinner, she will then enjoy a fresh salad made up of spinach, two romaine lettuce heads and tomatoes, as well as a mango, orange and strawberry juice. Grant eats the same things she does – though often adds herbs and spices for extra flavouring. “People follow dferent raw vegan diets. Some people like lots of spices, or nuts and seeds,” she said. “But I prefer to keep it really simple.” Anne, who ed to Denmark in March after living all over the world, from Australia to Thailand, followed a standard diet until she was  years old. Then, in a bid to “fit in” with her school friends, most of whom were vegetarian, she decided to ditch meat. She explained: “Initially, I went vegetarian to be a part of the group. Previously, I’d been a fussy eater, and didn’t like many foods. Once I went vegetarian, though, I found I was eating more and more, and realised that actually, I wasnapost fussy, I just didnapost like meat.  “When I got a little older and read about the ethical, animal rights side of being vegetarian, of course, that was an important factor too.” Towards the beginning of the year, Anne was overjoyed to discover she and Grant were expecting a baby. “From the off, my intention was to stick to my fruitarian diet for as long as I could,” she said of her pregnancy. For four months, she did just that, but recently, she has found her nausea has been getting worse, and so has tweaked her diet slightly in a bid to combat it, introducing the odd cooked vegan meal. And, though she does struggle with morning sickness, she is convinced that being fruitarian has kept her energy levels up as she prepares to bring a new le into the world. Once she gives birth, she plans to listen to her body to work out what sort of diet is best for her, but hopes she can go back to fruitarianism full-time. “I’d love to raise my child as a fruitarian, but I can’t do thatI’m not following the diet myself,” she said. I am planning to breastfeed as long as the baby wants to do so. I know that is the main source of calories for the baby and will introduce food slowly alongside it. “I will just wait and see what is best for my baby.”    By speaking out, Anne hopes to encourage others to consider a fruitarian diet, and is convinced it has improved her health tenfold. Not only that, but she is also passionate about the environmental benefits. “Nothing I eat is in plastic packaging, and there’s very little waste,” she said. “I think it’s better for the planet to be fruitarian. “You also save lots of money, as you aren’t buying treats like takeaways, meals out, or even the odd chocolate bar and can of cola. “Once you get over your old eating habits, it’s really very easy to stick to. I believe that your body will only crave what you’re putting into it, soyou don’t eat junk food, it won’t want junk food. “If you aren’t  per cent passionate, it can seem easy to slip back to your old ways, but you just have to remind yourself of why you are doing this, and how it is best for your body.”   Dr Daniel Atkinson, Clinical Lead of  Treated , said: “The biggest issue with a fruitarian diet is how restrictive it is, because it excludes key nutrients and vitamins like B, which you can only get from animal sources. While whole fruit is healthy, juiced fruit tends to have high sugar concentration, and consuming lots of it might increase the risk of gestational diabetes.“Anaemia is a common issue during pregnancy, and a fruit-heavy diet isn’t rich in iron which might mean you’re more at risk of developing anaemia. If you are pregnant, itaposs better to speak to your doctor or health visitor before making any drastic changes to your diet.

It seems a bit of a scare story.”Sophie said: “It seems like scare tactics.“I heard about the tweet and the grab bag with a radio and stuff, but I always have stuff with me.“It did sound like it was an apocalpyse coming the way it was worded.

We only allowed one goal five-on-five all weekend, so defensively it was good but our offence went dry.“I thought we generated a lot of chances against Fe but didn’t capitalise. Maybe we faced a hot goalie but, at the same time, we had a few chances we should have buried.“I warned the guys in the second that we had to play solid defensively and we had one breakdown and they scored.”On Saturday, Stars were just a goal down to Manchester Storm after one period as Tyler Fawcett scored on the powerplay.However, Dundee then gave up another two powerplay goals to fall - behind.Fawcett scored his second and Cam Critchlow added his name to the scoresheet before Dundee’s star man Elgin Pearce made it -.A scoreless third period was not what the Stars needed as Ryan Finnerty’s side killed off the game and sent the Dundee side home with nothing to show from their first Elite League game.On Sunday, both teams had full line-ups for their Challenge Cup clash and the first chance of the game went the way of the home side.Dundee’s Matt Marquardt drove through the middle of the Fe defence before flicking the puck across goal but his on-target shot was stopped by the arm of Adam Morrison in the Flyers goal.Egils Kalns was then denied by a spectacular save by Morrison as Stars continued to threaten early on.With no goals in the first period, a tense second stanza lay ahead for both sets of fans.Again, Dundee dominated the opening minutes but found no breakthrough.Later in the period, it was Fe who had the best opportunity as Chase Schaber forced Alex Leclerc to make a great double save.After  minutes of play it remained scoreless but Brett Stovin had a chance to change that  seconds into the third period as he went on a breakaway into the Fe end but Morrison pulled off a flashy glove save.However, Schaber broke the deadlock  seconds later.The Stars keeper spilt a rebound and a waiting Schaber quickly put the loose puck into the net to give the visitors the lead.The Stars were handed two late chances to equalise as Mike Cazzola and Jones both took penalties but their powerplay continued to falter.Danick Gauthier then sealed the victory for Fe with  seconds left on the clock, when he scored into an empty net.Pacha must now get his players to move on and begin to prepare for this weekend’s home double-header against Nottingham Panthers and Sheffield Steelers.Elsewhere in the Scottish National League, Dundee’s two teams were also on the losing side of their games.Dundee Tigers came up short in a close match with Aberdeen Lynx at home, losing -, while an injury-hit Dundee Comets were thrashed - by Solway Sharks."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/08/5d679612509057.11323954-842x564.jpg ","title":"exclusive plans for flagship five star hotel at city quay no longer going ahead","story":"Long-running plans to create a flagship five-star hotel in Dundee City Centre lie in tatters after operators decided against developing the property, the Tele can exclusively reveal.Apex Hotels originally announced plans to renovate the Custom House building on East Dock Street into a boutique hotel back in .At the same time, the group announced it would renovate its existing property, Apex Hotel City Quay and Spa, which sits adjacent to Custom House.But Apex has now confirmed that planned work will not go ahead after they pulled the plug and decided to sell the Custom House.A spokesman for the hotel chain said: “Having carried out a full market assessment that looked into the future plans of Custom House and considered ious options, we have taken the decision to sell the property.“With the number of hotels increasing within the area and having already invested heavily in our Dundee property with a £. million upgrade, now is not the time to develop Custom House and bring more accommodation to the market.“We will continue to invest signicantly in Apex City Quay Hotel  Spa, with a £ million programme of works to refurbish our front of house getting under way in the coming weeks.”Previous management at the hotel raised concerns that the Foxlake aqua park directly outside of Athe Apex could have a detrimental impact on bookings.The aqua park has gone from strength to strength and offers wakeboarding and paddle- boarding as well as sessions on its inflatable assault course.Since plans to construct the VA were announced in , there has been a signicant surge in the number of hotels built across the city.Hampton by Hilton, Hotel Indigo, an expanded Premier Inn and Sleeperz above the rail station have all opened within a -minute walk of the museum.But city development convener, Alan Ross, has insisted he is not concerned by the amount of accommodation for visitors in the city centre and said: “This decision has been made solely by the Apex for its own reasons. vw, px\"  “I’m not worried about the number of hotels operating in Dundee.“We identied the number of beds required by the city some time ago.

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

The deadline was broken on  minutes when Lee MacLean broke from midfield and managed to beat the offside trap, his cross from the left channel was met by the in-form Stuart MacLean whose shot beat Martin to give Star the lead.Tarbert looked to commit bodies forward in a bid to get back into the game which made for a more open contest, however the Star defence of Coll McCallum, Ricky Reid and Kyle Selfridge coped well throughout.Red Star should have made the closing stages a lot more comfortable for themselves with Gregor Peacock going close with a couple of opportunities and Aaron Moore having a shot well blocked but in the end Stuart MacLean’s goal was enough for a hard-fought but deserved win.On Saturday August  Star welcome Dunoon to the joint campus for their final game of the group stage, where a victory for the Lochgilphead side will see them progress to the quarter-finals.The kick-off time will be announced on the club’s social media pages during the week."},{"url":null,"title":"get dancing get fit and have fun","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowBack in April, the Mid Argyll branch of the Royal Scottish Country Dance Society held a ‘Bring a Friend’ evening.The result was a super evening of dancing and laughter, not to mention some delicious home baking at half time, and the branch was delighted at the number of people who came along.Now the dancing season is starting again after the summer break and the members are hoping to welcome those friends – and others – to their regular Monday evening classes.Scottish Country Dancing is a really great way to stay physically and mentally fit while having a lot of fun and listening to some lovely music at the same time.

These songs were associated with the Tlell River on Hai Gwaii in Canada. These tracks, with a selection of later collaborations, make up River to Sea from Tlell to Tiree. The title documents Sheila#s journey from the coast of Canada to Tiree, where the track All You Really Need is the Sea was written.This artist is probably best described as a folk blues singer. She has the sharply observing, descriptive eye of the classic singer songwriter troubadour and while her voice is given gravitas and character by time, she swings and has the timing of the blues singer.Wild Biscuit#s musical accompaniment gives Sheila#s characterful voice depth and presence. The menacing guitar on I#ve Waited a Long Time and the atmospheric double bass and keyboards on Where the Pebbles Grind and Scrape complement Cameron#s lyrics and singing.Remembering Mr Toast is an atmospheric and evocative, less bombastic or overblown Scottish Jim Morrison, finding real beauty in a melancholic memory. The delicate hesitant guitar and reflective lyrics continue on Don#t Sigh and Go on Then, beautul, bitter sweet country love songs. All You Really Need is the Sea and Deep and Real are spiritual songs, again moving between an intimate relationship to consider the huge landscape and the restorative natural world.Is it blues, country, easy listening, folk or poetry set to delicate sympathetic music  It doesn#t matter. Close your eyes, listen to Sheila#s rich voice, with its cadence and rhythm. Enjoy the flow of words and the pictures they conjure on this warm and captivating set of recordings."},{"url":null,"title":"macalister wins tarbert golf championship","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe delayed fourth and final round of the Tarbert Golf Club championship took place at Glenralloch on Saturday August  in glorious conditions.The greens were freshly cut with captain Smyth choosing some interesting pin positions to test the players# skills.Iain Macalister held a one shot lead over Bruce MacNab and a five shot lead over John MacNab heading into the final round.If there were any nerves at the start of play this was not evident as Iain started with four fours then followed that with an excellent -foot birdie putt at the fth and a chip-in birdie at the sixth.

Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

She also enjoyed sewing, knitting, embroidery and crocheting, last year completing a dozen poppies for the lsquoSelkirk Remembersrsquo armistice cascade at Selkirk Parish Church.Dr John Wilson, who worked as a GP at Selkirk Health Centre, remembers Helen Russell with particular affection. ldquoThe whole team at Selkirk were absolutely fantastic, he said, ldquoand the support and help Helen gave me in my early days in the town was wonderful.ldquoShe and her fellow district nurses had a lot of responsibility, and it was a great eye-opener for me to see just how professionally and selflessly they carried out all their ied duties. Helen understood exactly what was expected of her, always going out of her way to give patients the best possible care.Margaret Young, a fellow district nurse and midwe at Selkirk Health Centre, describes Helen as lsquoa force of naturersquo who was completely committed to the job.ldquoAs well as working as a school nurse she also ran parent classes in the evening, and started up a slimming club at the health centre. Nothing was ever too much trouble for Helen - she was kindness itself.ldquoI remember when the district nursesrsquo office was moved from the Cottage Hospital to the back of the health centre, we all commented on how ghastly the curtains were. On Monday morning Helen came in with a set of beautul curtains shelsquod made at the weekend, and I think they were still there when she retired!ldquoShe was such a talented person, and Irsquom sure there are many people living in the local community today who will be very glad Helen Russell was there to look after them during her time as district nurse.Helen took special delight in following the progress of her two teenage grandchildren, Angus and Allie, both of whom had stayed with their grandparents at Lindean the week before Helen was admitted to hospital.Helen Russellrsquos funeral service will be held at the Borders Crematorium on Thursday, September , at pm, to which all friends are respectively invited.J.D.R.S."},{"url":null,"title":"31-year-old-remanded-following-town-centre-disturbance","story":"A -year-old man has been remanded in custody after being accused of causing a disturbance in the town on August .Mark Turnbull is alleged to have threatened the occupants of a property in Brisbane Place and wilfully and recklessly damaging the front door.He is also charged with struggling violently with two police constables and possession of cannabis in Cross Street, Kelso, on the same date.Turnbull also faces charges of stealing cigarette lighters from Home Bargains in Galashiels on June  and then being the owner of a lurcher type dog which was dangerously out of control and bit a police constable at Gala Water Retail Park on August  as well as behaving in a threatening or abusive manner.Turnbull of Berrymoss Court, pleaded not guilty at Jedburgh Sherf Court to all seven charges and a trial date was set for September .He is currently remanded in custody in connection with the matter."},{"url":null,"title":"galashiels-man-accused-driving-disqualified-a7","story":"A -year-old Galashiels man has been charged with driving while disqualied, with no insurance and no test certicate on the A between Selkirk and Hawick on August .Ashley Martin from Larch Grove is also accused of possession of cannabis.His case was continued without plea at Jedburgh Sherf Court until September ."},{"url":null,"title":"principals-celebrate-20-years-friendship","story":"A FRIENDSHIP between three communities was celebrated on Saturday in the remote hills above Stobo.Back in  it was agreed for the Principals representing West Linton, Peebles and Biggar to end the Festival season with a show of friendship.A central meeting point point at Hopehead and a date at the end of August were agreed.Over the past two decades the Spurs Ride has continued to bring cavalcades from the three proud communities together.On Saturday close to  riders - almost  from each town - made their way from opposite directions to reach the hillside.Cornet Andrew Napier led his followers up from Peebles, while Whipman Guy Thorley was at the front of the West Linton mounted cavalcade.A shoulder injury prevented Biggar Cornet Alan Bartholemew from saddling up for this years Spurs Ride.But he was on hand to open gates for the -strong cavalcade from his hometown who made the eight miles trek out to the Stobo Valley.Alan told us: \"I was unable to ride due to my shoulder but I still played my part by opening and closing gates for the riders from Biggar.\"The Spurs Ride is a great tradition - West Linton and Peebles are our friendly neighbours and it is a great opportunity at the end of the summer for us to meet up.\"Im pretty sure the Spurs Ride will continue for at least another  years.\"As is tradition all of the riders enjoyed a drink from the customary quaich.And the three Principals were presented with engraved Spurs to mark the occasion."},{"url":null,"title":"lights-camera-action-peeblesshire-39-s-community-gardens","story":"The cameras were rolling in Peeblesshire last week to discover the rise of community gardens flourishing in towns and villages throughout the Scottish Borders.ITV film crews captured green-fingered volunteers from Borders Food Community in Peebles, and Innerleithenrsquos Edible Garden, for a Border Le feature which uncovers how communities are being strengthened by the ground up, one garden at a time.Community gardens are spreading roots across the Borders countryside. Not only are volunteers providing fresh food for locals, they are also regenerating unused spaces, transforming them into lush green patches for all to feast upon. When filming wrapped, reporter Hilary Scott caught up with community gardeners Adam Skelton and Shirley Spence, to ask them how their gardens grow.THE High Street is the heart of the bustling town of Peebles.A derelict bit of land behind the former court building has been transformed into a tranquil greenspace and is now the Courthouse Community Garden.Adam Skelton told the Peeblesshire News: ldquoDuring the filming we discussed Borders Food Community Facebook Group which is a popular place for people to share food, plants, seeds, tools, and materials, as well as advice and information related to food growing, preparing, cooking and storing.ldquoAnyone can join the group free and there you can connect with lots of knowledgeable and very helpful grower, composters, cooks, preservers, picklers. The list goes on.ldquoWe also discussed land sharing. Various group members have allowed us to share their land and create group food gardens.And the Courthouse Community Garden is one of those havens.ldquoIt was an unused overgrown patch of land and we have converted it into a very productive little garden, explained Adam.ldquoThere is no contract or rent and we have not received any funding.The creation of this garden is down to the hard work of green-fingered volunteers and waste products, which Adam says is a ldquowin-win for all involved.He added: ldquoThe land owners get their land tended and access to free fresh food on their doorstep and we get to grow as we wish in this lovely space.Despite the success of Borders Food Community, Adam says he finds it odd that the vast majority of people are not eating truly local food when there are so many benefits.ldquoFor example therersquos the environment. There is no packaging or food miles, itrsquos so much tastier when fresh and all the nutrients intact and its better for local economy.Adam is very passionate about the work of community gardens and is encouraging locals to join Borders Food Community Facebook Group where they can discover their nearest community garden and get involved.The ITV crew headed to Innerleithen in the afternoon to discover a garden maintained by little and large green-fingers.Volunteers from community gardens across the Borders gathered at the Edible Garden along with St Ronanrsquos Primary School pupils.ldquoEveryone who wanted to got the chance to say a few words. It was great to have people from all the community gardens together in one place discussing more ways to collaborate together to further promote local food growing across the Borders, said Adam.The Edible Garden team were delighted to host the ITV Border Le crew.Shirley Spence said: ldquoWe enjoyed meeting the dferent groups of community growers and making new contacts. We were pleased with the comments and feedback about our garden and learning about other community gardens and their work in the Borders.And the children from St Ronanrsquos Primary School also enjoyed their moment in front of the cameras. ldquoThey were talking about what they liked to plant and grow and how gardening has encouraged them to try and eat dferent vegetables and fruits, explained Shirley.ldquoWe hope there will be many more initiatives for community growing starting up in other Border towns and villages.It might be a wrap for the film crew, but these community horticulturists continue to work hard growing fresh fruit and vegetables in their tasty gardens throughout the year.ITV will be airing the show later this month, and being involved in the creation of a community garden which is fresh, free and enhances the environment is a worthy  minutes claim to fame."},{"url":null,"title":"andy-set-toast-peebles-highland-games","story":"FORMER athletics coach

be added and  apartments to be created.A spokesman said: \"The proposal to alter, extend and convert the hotel to form  apartments represents an appropriate use for the building restoring it to its

Ryan McConnachie opted to go straight down the middle and evaded the e of the Dunoon keeper.There was a moment of worry at the other end, though, when goalscorer Souden also committed a handball in the Pupils’ box, and referee Peter Laing pointed to the spot. Dunoon halved the Pupils’ advantage, making it -.Then, just  seconds later, the Pupils restored their two-goal lead through Donald McCallum, who met left-sided substitute Kenny Kerr’s low cross to squeeze a shot between the Dunoon defenders and the frame of the goal.Soon after, the Pupils made it -, when Kerr guided another delightful cross onto the head of John McCallum, who guided an effort past the keeper from six yards, but it was the goal creator Kerr who was rightly mobbed by his team-mates.Not content with four, the Feathers-sponsored Pupils scored again, with # stand by # Kerr making it three assists in one match.Played in by McConnachie after some strong play in midfield by fellow substitute Michael McKinlay, Kerr set up young winger Ross Brown, who gladly tucked home goal number five with a close-range finish.With the match drawing to a close, McConnachie sealed his brace # and the Pupils’ sixth goal # with an excellent inidual effort, surging past a defender before rounding the hosts’ keeper and slotting the ball low into an unguarded net, adding gloss to an already emphatic cup win.After a great team performance, the Pupils will be hoping for more of the same tomorrowwhen they welcome a Tarbert side # who last week also defeated Dunoon # in a Kintyre derby.The match is scheduled for a pm kick off at Kintyre Park."},{"url":null,"title":"third round of tarberts golf championship","story":"Former champion Bruce MacNab held a four-shot lead going into the third round but a horror start saw the lead wiped out at the very first hole when Iain Macalister birdied and Bruce had a seven.Iain went on to birdie the second hole as well and despite the windy conditions was very much in control of his game over the first nine holes to be out in .John MacNab was also playing his normal steady game also ing , enjoying birdies at the st and th holes.After nine holes Iain had turned a four-shot deficit into a four-shot lead over Bruce and six ahead of John.Over the next four holes both Iain and John dropped four shots allowing Bruce some breathing space to claw back some of the deficit.When play was complete and all scores checked the totals after round three were as follows: Iain Macalister , Bruce MacNab , John MacNab .In the John Reid Quaich the silverware again headed south to Largieside with Duncan Johnstone retaining the trophy, shooting  nett over the two rounds.

It will reopen in spring .The closure plan was greeted with dismay in Campbeltown, with board members attacking the #scandalous# plan # with a promise to fight the #tooth and nail#.Chairman Allan McKie told The Courier this week that the move was finalised last Friday.#The decision was taken as the coreof the office is being moved to Oban,# Mr McKie said.#Membership was being handled in Campbeltown for the whole board area, and there is far bigger back-up in Oban. It was not a financial decision # it was an administrative one.#Pressed on whether he thought the closure would have an adverse effect on tourism, Mr McKie said: #I don#t think Campbeltown will suffer at all.#He continued: #In winter months, it was totally unrealistic to stay open and serve tourists, for all that there are. It is unfortunate. We took a long time to come to this decision and it is highly regrettable.#FIFTY YEARS AGORoad bridge row comes to an endThe #dry bridge# at Bridgend, Islay is to be raised to give clearance of ft ins.This was announced at the meeting of the Islay District Council on Monday.The total cost of the improvements will be borne by Western Ferries and several of the island#s distillery companies. Work is expected to start at the end of the month and should be completed by the send of September.Councillor Frank T. Spears stated that the work would not involve any long-term closure of the main roadway.The #dry bridge#, owned by Lord Margadale, has been the subject of much discussion and minor rows for the past several months. Since Western Ferries Ltd. began their sea service, heavy articulated lorries carrying malt and grain to the island#s distilleries have been unable to go under the bridge. Matters came to a head three months ago when Argyll County Council re-imposed a weight limit on the Glen road # the ersion used by the transporters to avoid the bridge.The bridge owners came quickly to the rescue and allowed the heavy traffic to use their private road at Bridgend for a three-week period, but following local protests and legal consultations the transporters were again allowed to use the Glen road.Leboat saves three on rocksThe crew of a lobster fishing boat were marooned on a partially-submerged rock for more than two hours when their vessel foundered off the north-east coast of Islay on Thursday morning.The ft #May#, owned and skippered by -year-old Mr Lachlan Clark of Port Charlotte # the veteran of several sea-dramas # struck the rocks while they were lting lobster creels.The Islay leboat was called out to rescue the skipper and his crew # Alastair MacDonald, a -year-old fisherman, and Norman Gardiner, a -year-old Colonsay doctor#s son who was making his first trip and deputising for a sick crew member.Following the rescue, the crew # who were unhurt # were landed at Port Askaig.ONE-HUNDRED YEARS AGONational Health Insurance ActA number of contraventions of the National Health Insurance Act were the subject of prosecutions in Campbeltown Sherf Court on Thursday # Sherf MacMaster Campbell on the bench.The first case was that of a Clachan merchant who was charged with neglecting to stamp the card of a female servant.Mr M. Dick, solicitor, who appeared for accused, tendered a plea of guilty, and said the observations he was about to make would apply equally to all the cases subsequently to be heard. These were the first prosecutions of the kind in this court. The Act, as his Lordship knew, was a most voluminous and complicated measure.The sherf observed that some excellent and very lucid summaries had been circulated.Mr Dick, proceeding, asked his Lordship to examine the contribution card. He would find that the part which was the very kernel of the offence was embodied in the middle of Art.  in very inconspicuous type. The employer was there required to stamp the card #not later than the time at which wages are paid# but to read that one required to hold the card at about  degrees.The sherf askedhe was to understand that this was the first occasion on which a domestic servant had been employed by accused  If not, he must have been trained in the use of this wonderful document years ago.Mr Dick said his Lordship must consider this, that in cases of this kind there were two standards of clearness. What was clear to the judicial mind might be very far from clear to the lay mind.It was a matter of common knowledge that there was a very general belief in this part of the country thatinsurance cards were stamped at the time they were run out the Act would be complied with.The card, of course, bore that the stamps must be affixed #not later than the time wages are paid#. He asked his Lordship to consider the phraseology. These cards came into the hands of many rustic employers of labour. Why should it not be stated in bold characters on the card that the stamps must be affixed at the time wages are paid In the country wages were paid sometimes by the half-year, sometimes by the month, and sometimes at irregular periods suitable to the circumstances of the worker.The cards represented not the half-year of the feeing terms, but the calendar half-year. All these circumstances contributed to the confusion of the lay mind, and encouraged the widespread impression thatthe cards were stamped at the end of the period the duty of a citizen was thereby fulfilled."},{"url":null,"title":"leader august 23 2019","story":"The Courier is honoured to deliver news to the community # during the good times and the bad.This week we were delighted to share the news that Campbeltown now boasts the #whisky bar of the year#, according to judges at the Scottish Bar and Pub Awards , who bestowed the title to the Ardshiel Hotel.Since buying the hotel more than a decade ago, Flora Grant and Marion MacKinnon have more than tripled the number of whiskies on offer, turning the hotel into something of a tourist attraction in itself.However, we also revealed that nine jobs have been lost at Campbeltown Creamery.While it is still hoped that a take-over by local farmers is the future for the site, it is terrible for the iniduals who have lost their jobs, some after many, many years.We know there is a market for Campbeltown cheese, and while the number of farms supplying the creamery has fallen over the years, there are still almost .Here#s hoping the future is bright for both Campbeltown#s whiskies and cheeses."},{"url":null,"title":"fun in the sun at first mokfest","story":"India enjoyed herself at this year#s Up The Close event, which included children#s entertainer Funky Chicken and ious fair attractions, and was made all the better by the glorious sunshine.India was joined by her mum Lynsey Mcshannon, who was able to get into the spirit of things this year having been heavily pregnant last year, and her dad Gary Anderson.This year#s Up The Close was a particular hit, with the welcome , after nearly a decade, of indie rockers a new hope "},{"url":null,"title":"more music in store for the wee toon","story":"On Wednesday, September  at .pm, well-known folksinger, entertainer and broadcaster Alastair McDonald will be in concert in Campbeltown Free Church.This will not be Alastair’s first visit to the Wee Toon.

Last weekend, we were fortunate to be invited to an orchard in East Lothian to pick some apples.As we entered Lewis stopped for a moment and said ldquoWow.He has seen apples growing on trees before, but I think it was the sight of so many apple trees together all in fruit. It was a visual feast, even for me.And so we picked some apples, in the company of a friend who uses local fruits to make juices. Lewis just couldnrsquot decide which apple tree to pick from first. He wandered about in awe, eyeing the apples.There were many ieties in the orchard, but I sadly canrsquot remember all their names.ldquoI think Lewis is in paradise, I remarked as I watched him.ldquoWhatrsquos paradise  asked my nearly six-year-old inquisitive daughter Skye. I had to think about my answer.ldquoSome people say itrsquos a perfect place, but other people say itrsquos a perfect feeling.ldquoCan be both then, maybe at the same time Skye replied.I smiled and agreed. We both watched Lewis, as he wondered under the small trees, dancing with delight at the sight of so many delicious looking ripe apples.ldquoYea said Skye, ldquoLewis is definitely having paradykes.ldquoWe say in paradise I said, in a bit of a teachery tone.ldquoBut you can have it too insisted Skye ldquobecause itrsquos a happy feeling.How could I disagree  ldquoYoursquore right I smiled.ldquoThis one Lewis called out. The apple was just out of reach and so his sister ran up and carefully picked it for him, in the way she had been shown. Lewis studied the apple before eating, savouring the moment.He was indeed both in, and having, paradise.We collected a small basket full of apples of dferent ieties, and after giving our thanks we started our walk back to the car. As we meandered along the path Skye asked for a story about an apple.So I told the story of Johnny Appleseed. Then a riddle ldquoA wee roond hoose, sometimes red, sometimes green, the maist bent lum ye hae ersquoer seen. Nae windaes or doors tae open or slide, it has a secret, therersquos a star inside.The answer of course is an apple. The bent lumbeing the stalk, and the star being the seed core when the apple is cut horizontally through the middle.As we walked, I reflected on the symbolism of the apple, and how it has been used in folklore and legend. And of course there is the famous apple which fell on Newtonrsquos head.Well it probably didnrsquot really fall on his head, as that seems a later embellishment, but for sure Newton himself often told the tale of the falling apple and the inspiration it gave him. He lived well into old age, and I think he understood the power of a story to convey the meaning of an event or idea.We approached our car and I took my sonrsquos hand to keep him safe as we crossed the road.ldquoDad he said looking up at me, ldquoyou are my walking apple.I laughed at the image and wondered what he meant. Was he referring to my rotund body shape perhaps ldquoWhy am I your walking apple  I asked him.ldquoCause I love apples and you are walking with me he said, with a sense of poetic meaning only a young child can convey.I was momentarily overwhelmed by this simple but moving comment. Lewis, aged only four, conveyed a powerful symbolism for apples that morning.The apple falling from the tree in front of Isaac Newton was a symbol of scientic discovery. For my son, an apple is a symbol of love. And my son loves the apples he eats, and the ones which walk with him.

I am really honoured to have been invited to take part in the Pinkie Cleugh commemorative ceremony and look forward to saying a few words at it about our project.Musselburgh Area Partnership has also helped fund the project and is working to provide a mobile phone app and leaflet about the trail.Group chairman Iain Clark said: ldquoNow the trail is complete, hopefully this will encourage the community to get active and see the benefits of the town and its history through walking and cycling.Area partnership manager Stuart Baxter added: ldquoThis is a fantastic project. Not only has the archer attracted so much local community support, it also has provided the opportunity to introduce a new trail through Musselburgh that will be appreciated by residents and visitors alike.The battle, known as lsquoBlack Saturday,rsquo took place on September , , and was the last battle fought between Scotland and England.It is marked each year by a ceremony organised by the Old Musselburgh Club which is preceded by the raising of a saltire flag at the memorial stone and battlefield walk, led by Dr Andrew Coulson and Roger Knox, which leaves from the Roman Bridge at am on Tuesday.

It is about teaching people basic cooking skills and using healthy food. Rather than putting on a microwave meal, in my opinion, you can cook a healthy meal cheaper.

Firstly, the reader must be able to walk in the subjectrsquos shoes and inhabit their world. It must also have a fair scattering of interesting ndash the more gasp-inducing the better ndash personal anecdotes and revelations. And finally, perhaps most crucially, it should reveal something universal about le itself. Good memoirs have one or two of these attributes great memoirs possess them all.How many ndashany ndash will David Cameronrsquos hotly-anticipated book contain, I wonder  The former prime ministerrsquos memoir, For The Record, is due out in  daysrsquo time, which means by rights I should already be able to answer that question. It is normal protocol for editors and reviewers to be sent copies weeks, sometimes months, in advance, but this book is apparently so hot it will stay under lock and key until the release date of September .Does this mean Mr Cameron is about to spill the beans on Boris Johnson  Does he have something up his sleeve that could bring down his old Eton, Oxford and Bullingdon Club chum  Are we to take it the revelations contained in this book are so explosive they will cause another major tremor in what has been a summer of political earthquakes : Johnson called Cameron a girly swotI fear those of hoping for such an outcome will be let down. After all, with Mr Cameron reportedly paid pound, in advance for the book ndash therersquos also a TV series in the offing ndash itrsquos more likely his publishers are simply ensuring they get plenty of bang for their buck. Indeed,there was anyone left who believed Mr Cameron had been laying low over the last three years because he feels ashamed about the misery and chaos he has inflicted upon the rest of us by holding the EU referendum, the penny must surely have dropped that he is under contract to keep schtum.By rights, of course, this is a man who should, evenonly in print, fall on his knees and beg forgiveness from us all. So arrogant and wrong-headed was his decision-making that we now sit on the precipice of a no-deal Brexit that has the potential to cause economic, political and social misery. Not that wealthy, privileged, cosseted Mr Cameron and his family will suffer its effects, of course, just as he clearly didnrsquot feel any sympathy or responsibility towards the families and communities he and his government plunged into austerity from  onwards.Evenno-deal can be avoided, the damaging isions Mr Camerons referendum created and fed upon will last for generations. To say he changed his country for the worse is an understatement. As for the apology he owes the people of Libya, thatrsquos another can of worms.Andthe memoirs of his predecessors are anything to go by, rather than apology and candour, Mr Cameronrsquos tome will be filled with dull procedure, maddening attempts to deflect blame and crass legacy-making.As for the standard of writing, it will be interesting to seehe has more talent than some of the previous inhabitants of Number . Even that great verbal communicator Tony Blair revealed himself to be a terrible writer his  book overflowed with clicheacute and wince-inducing pop psychology. Werenrsquot there also some really bad sex scenes  Crucially, he refused to confront Iraq.:David Cameron toto political limelight next month to publicise his autobiography For The RecordGordon Brownrsquos memoir ndash with its ghastly title My Le, Our Times ndash was criminally dull, as was John Majorrsquos, which I remember reading on my sickbed in the early Noughties after picking it up in an actual bargain bin for p. I only read two volumes of Mrs Thatcherrsquos autobiography and can attest that despite the grand delusion, at least they werenrsquot boring.For a truly skilled and revelatory take on the political world, we must turn to those who surround the powerful. All three volumes of Alastair Campbellrsquos diaries make for scintillating reading, as do those of the late Tory MP Alan Clark. Neither Campbell nor Clark emerge as likeable people, yet both are talented writers who exude wit, humour and honesty in spades. Their books embed readers in their heads, shock us, and in dferent ways, tell us about the nature of power.Mr Cameronrsquos publishers claim he will ldquotalk candidly, though itrsquos hard to imagine this former PR man, who, in common with his pal Mr Johnson has never seemed burdened by self-doubt, will feel the need or inclination to explain himself to the likes of us.

And it recognise it will not make progressit cannot find a solution for heavy transport.Anna Richardson, the councillor who leads on the climate emergency, said: ldquoTo tackle carbon reduction in Glasgow effectively, it is essential the council gets its own house in order.ldquoBoth transport providers and environmental campaigners are looking to the council to take a lead toward carbon neutrality for our fleet.ldquoElectric vehicle technology is evolving rapidly and will be able to support a wide range of tasks undertaken by our vehicles.ldquoBut the green technology for heavier vehicles is still emerging and so we have the opportunity to influence the market for ourselves and other major transport providers.ldquoThe funding award from Transport Scotland will help to ensure larger dual fuel hydrogen gritters are up and running in the early part of next year.ldquoThese dual fuel vehicles should act as a signicant stepping stone towards emissions-free gritters and refuse trucks as part of our wider strategy for a zero emissions fleet.ldquoA wide range of discussions is currently underway on we best secure green hydrogen for our vehicles and move away from traditional sources of energy.ldquoWe are absolutely focused on ensuring renewable energy drives our fleet in future.Anna RichardsonHydrogen remains controversial among environmentalists, some of whom see it as a ldquogateway drug fuel for big hydrocarbon firms.Richard Dixon, of Friends of the Earth, said: ldquoHydrogen is a dead end for transport fuels which is being heavily promoted by the fossil fuel industry.ldquoIf Glasgow invests in hydrogen vehicles they will find them to be very expensive white elephants in the future.ldquoThere are already electric single and double decker buses in London, electric buses in four Scottish cities, electric bin lorries on trial in Sheffield and plans to build electric waste trucks in the UK.ldquoElectric vehicles, even large ones, are the future, so there is no need to go to the expense or take the risk of using hydrogen to run vehicles. ldquoThe plan admits that hydrogen trucks are extremely expensive. ldquoElectricity is clearly winning the big vehicle war over hydrogen. If you are going to spend lots of money replacing a fleet, spend it on electric vehicles because they are the only sensible option.GrittersThe dispute centres on whether hydrogen, current described as ldquogrey because it is made with either natural gas or coal, can be ldquogreen in the future.Supporters of hydrogen technology stress that it will massively reduce emissions compared with the current solution for powering big trucks: diesel. Even dual-fuel vehicles are understood to offer a % cut.The Scottish Government is also eager to pursue hydrogen for heavy vehicles and ferries.Transport Secretary Michael Matheson, praised the councilrsquos efforts to move towards a zero emissions fleet.Mr Matheson said the city was ldquoyet again leading from the front in taking steps to improve air quality and through their new plan to decarbonise their existing fleet of vehicles by .He added: ldquoThe   Programme for Government outlined our commitment to phase out the need for new petrol or diesel cars in the public sector fleet by  and for all other vehicles by .ldquoGlasgowrsquos new fleet strategy directly responds to this ambition and supports our Climate Change Plan alongside our ambition for Scotlandrsquos air quality to be the best in Europe.ldquoTransport Scotland officials have been working closely with Glasgow City Council to support this strategy and Irsquom delighted we are providing pound, from our Switched on Fleets Fund to convert over  gritters to dual-fuel hydrogen.ldquoWe will continue to work in partnership to ensure that we can collectively maximise the economic opportunities for all of Scotland through this crucial transition to low carbon transportation.The overhaul and upgrade of the councilrsquos fleet is due to begin with new electric cars being introduced in early months of next year along with the tower vans used to repair the cityrsquos lighting columns.New electric road and precinct sweepers will be deployed next year also. Aberdeen has already put Scotlandrsquos first hydrogen dual-fuel street sweeper in to operation.A Glasgow council spokesman added: ldquoThe fleet strategy also provides the opportunity for new technology to be installed within vehicles that will to boost the operation performance of vehicles, sharpen the scheduling for collection routes and ultimately improve recycling rates.ldquoThe safe operation of the councilrsquos vehicles for employees, contractors, other road users and the general public is the key principle that underpins the strategy.Glasgow council is mulling a whole series of policy proposals from a working group to reach zero net carbon by , including reforms to its own estate.The fleet strategy was approved last month so is one of the first initiatives to get official blessing from the local authorityrsquos ruling SNP administration."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-set-confirmed-venue-major-un-climate-change-summit-2020","story":"COP, as it is known, will see scores of heads of government as well as up to , delegates converging on Scotlandrsquos largest city to draw up a new climate change strategy.The event has been described as the most important gathering on climate change since the Paris agreement was signed in .Scotlands Climate Change Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said: ldquoI am pleased that Glasgow has been confirmed as the host city of COP , now that the joint UK and Italy bid to host the summit has been approved. ldquoIt is right that this conference should come to Scotland given our leadership in climate action.Read more: Glasgow chosen to host major UN climate change summit\"Scotland was one of the first countries in the world to acknowledge the global climate emergency and the Scottish Government has introduced the toughest targets in the UK to ensure our action matches the scale of our climate ambitions.ldquoWe look forward to working collaboratively with partners to deliver an ambitious and effective conferencethat ensures Scotland plays a leading role to help promote the increased global effort to tackle climate change.ldquoI have no doubt that Glasgow will deliver a highly successful conference and I look forward to welcoming delegates to Scotland.Councillor Susan Aitken, Leader of Glasgow City Council, said: ldquoIt is a tremendous honour for our city and recognition of the strides on sustainability we have made that Glasgow will host an event of such global signicance.ldquoThe Climate Emergency is the issue of our age and COP will be the most signicant coming together of world leaders to discuss it since the signing of the Paris Agreement.ldquoThis is the century of the city and cities are best placed to get to grips with the global climate emergency.

The society now also delivers animal welfare educational programmes, reaching more than , children in .So it’s fair to say that it has come a long way in the last  years.But for all the successes, there are also new issues it has to face – not least thanks to the advent of the internet.Mike explained: “For years, we have looked after all of Scotland’s animals – wild, farm and domestic.“Farming has come on leaps and bounds in the last few decades and we now have very few problems in the industry.“When I was a kid growing up, you used to have pet shops selling cats, dogs, budgies and the like.“Now, thanks to the internet, people have far more exotic animals in their care which all of our inspectors need to know how to care for and handle – from bearded dragons to massive boa constrictors!“We also have to contend with puppy farmers plying their trade online and selling puppies from car boots.“Some of the puppies die within a few days of people buying them, having paid a lot of money for the animal and thousands on vet fees.“Sadly, we also still see things that I saw  years ago such as Dobermans with every rib on their body sticking out.“However, thanks to our education programme, we are reaching the children of today who will be the animal lovers of the future.“And the majority of people our inspectors visit are not harming animals for fun – it’s a case of ignorance and neglect. In those cases, we’re not just helping the animals, but humans too.“Only five to ten per cent of cases every year are intentional cruelty. So Scotland is still a nation which, in the main, loves and cares for its animals.”That care and concern shines through as the public helps fund the SSPCA’s £ million budget annually.That covers the cost of  employees, including  inspectors,  ambulance drivers and the -strong team based at its nine centres across Scotland and its widle sanctuary.The society receives no government funding and relies solely on the public to fund its work.Mike added: “We are really lucky that, from a population of five and a half million, only  people were prosecuted last year for animal cruelty.“We will never be out of a job but the vast majority of people in Scotland are law abiding and animal loving.“And we couldn’t do what we do without their support.”In December, the Society plans to launch celebrations to commemorate the th anniversary that will run throughout .Anyone with interesting anecdotes or memorabilia they’d like to share should get in touch via its website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.The SSPCA is the only animal charity in the UK able to report animal cruelty cases to the Crown, with reports sent to the Procurator Fiscal Service. The charity receives no government funding and relies on donations and grants to continue its work, which costs £ million each year.In , it found homes for  rescued animals, helped more than  wildle casualties and spoke to more than , children.For every pound it receives, p is spent on animal welfare, p on fundraising and promotion and p on administration.So you can rest assured that the bulk of any donation you make will make a huge dference to the animals in the SSPCA’s care.Last year, its animal helpline received almost a quarter of a million calls, the inspectorate attended more than , incidents and more than , animals were cared for across its nine rescue and rehoming centres and at the national wildle rescue centre.

Pro-Remain, anti-separationist Scots – including those who identy with the Conservative Party – are being particularly let down by pro-Brexit English politicians who advertise themselves as supposedly passionate unionists. Perhaps a profound sense of personal disappointment over the Brexit approach adopted by the Tory leadership at Westminster was the driving force behind Ruth Davidson’s resignation – with the Scottish Conservatives now deprived of her uplting and charismatic leadership: Tories set to lose all Scottish seats to SNP in general election, poll suggestsFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website here The unfortunate reality is that Brexit has only served to intensy existing English-Scottish tensions.The  UK referendum on EU membership was itself a product of Conservative Party internal management, with then PM David Cameron producing a pledge to hold it to help stem the loss of support to the UK Independence Party in the affluent Tory-voting shires in order to appease hard Eurosceptics on his own benches. Every single Scottish local authority –  in total – voted to remain in the EU. Out of the top  Remain votes across the UK’s local authorities four were Scottish: EdinburghEast RenfrewshireEast Dunbartonshireand Stirling . Scotland overall delivered a Remain vote of  per cent.Yes, the referendum was a UK-wide democratic exercise. But the prospect of Remain-voting Scotland being dragged into a no-deal Brexit spearheaded by PM Boris Johnson, who himself seems increasingly focused on wooing Labour Leavers in the provincial Midlands and Northern England, has inevitably provided the SNP and the broader Scottish independence movement with a major boost.Indeed, a recent poll by YouGov suggests that all  Conservative-held seats in Scotland are at risk of falling to the SNP –with the real takeaway figure being that across the  constituencies polled,  per cent would vote for the UK to remain in the event of a second vote on EU membership .And much of this is because Brexit is increasingly coming across as an inward-looking English enterprise – one which seems very much at ease with the heightened possibility of Scottish independence. Another poll conducted by YouGov of Conservative Party members demonstrated this very point – with  per cent of respondents claiming that Scotland breaking away from the UK was a price worth payingit was a consequence of Brexit being delivered . The concern for genuine unionists is that deeper expressions of “Englishness” and “Scottishness” are very much at odds when it comes to the UK’s broader relationship with the EU. While prevailing expressions of English political identity are intertwined with Eurosceptic sentiment, Scottish political identity is associated with a far more positive view of the UK’s membership of the EU. With this also being the case among young people, there is no doubt that a disruptive no-deal exit from the EU – one led by a Conservative Prime Minister who clearly has little time for the SNP’s -strong Westminster contingent, and has so far adopted a belligerent approach to delivering Brexit – could inject considerable youthful energy into the push for a second referendum on Scottish independence. Considering the political circumstances, genuine pro-Leave unionists – on both sides of the border – have their work cut outthey intend to secure the UK’s withdrawal from the EU as well as neutralising the very real prospect of post-Brexit Scottish independence. As it stands, Brexit could be the straw that breaks the camel’s back – breaking apart our family of nations.

There it remained until , when the then Scottish Secretary, Michael Forsyth, arranged for its transfer to Edinburgh Castle.This exercise in “nationalist unionism” on the part of the Secretary of State had signicant symbolism, as for centuries the presence of Scotland’s historic coronation stone in London had been a source of grievance for the Scottish nation, and not just for those of a Nationalist persuasion. But even at the time of the Stone’sto Scotland, there was much debate as to where it should be located, with a strong case being made for itsto Perthshire.The future of the Stone is again in the news, with the Scottish Government having launched a consultation on whether or not it should be moved from Edinburgh to Perth, where the Conservative-led council has ambitious plans for it to become the centrepiece of a proposed new museum and visitor attraction in the former Perth City Halls. This development is supported by £ million from the UK Government by way of the Tay Cities Deal.: SNP heavyweights call for Stone of Destiny to be relocated from Edinburgh to PerthFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereThe alternative is to retain the Stone at Edinburgh Castle, in a redevelopment of the existing, rather disappointing, display, which has the Stone sitting ignominiously, and almost unnoticed, in a glass case alongside the Scottish Crown jewels. The Stone of Scone, as it is often known, is certainly of signicant historical importance. According to legend, it was Jacob’s pillow from Biblical times, which came to Scotland by way of Ireland and became the seat on which Kings of Scots were crowned.Whether the Stone that we know today, a block of Perthshire sandstone, is really this historic relic is a matter of debate it is widely believed that the monks of Scone concealed the real Stone when Edward’s men came knocking and palmed them off with a fake.: Edinburgh MSPs say Stone of Destiny should stay in Capital: Salmond: ‘Stone of Destiny is fake’But evenit is not, the Stone that sits in Edinburgh is nevertheless an artefact of signicant historical interest, of which the Kings of England, and then monarchs of Great Britain, have been crowned ever since the th century. And, in the absence of the ‘real’ Stone, it is all we have. I have for many years been a supporter of the campaign to have the Stone brought back to Perthshire, and now is the perfect opportunity to make that happen.As the centrepiece of a new development in the centre of Perth, the Stone will be presented in its appropriate historical context. The whole project has potentially enormous economic signicance for the local area, and will bring both locals and visitors into the city centre of Perth in large numbers.It is hard to see what economic benefit exists from retaining the Stone at Edinburgh Castle, already Scotland’s busiest tourist attraction. I cannot believe the argument that visitor numbers to the Castle would in any way diminish were the Stone to be removed. Moreover, there is no historical connection between the Stone and Edinburgh, in that prior to  it had never rested in the Scottish capital.I am encouraged that the Scottish Government is now running a consultation on the question of the location of the Stone, and I have absolutely no doubt that now is the time toit home to Perthshire. I would encourage those who share my view to complete the consultation, which is open until  September. Whether we care about the economic prosperity of Perth and Perthshire, or are interested in ensuring that our cultural heritage is properly recognised, this is the right step to take.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"looking back when a young jacob rees mogg campaigned in scotland with his nanny","story":"The Scotsman recalls his first foray into Scottish politics.Brexit campaigner Jacob Rees-Mogg started his political career back in Rees-Mogg was just  when he was selected by the Conservatives to contest Central Fe ndash a traditional Labour seat ndash at the  general election.The Etonian travelled to Scotland with a mind to hitting the campaign trail, but his upper-class background soon put him at odds with a largely working-class electorate.The son of late Times editor William, Rees-Mogg made the inauspicious decision to knock on doors in the former mining town of Leven on the Fe coast.But reports quickly emerged of the English candidate taking the familyrsquos nanny, Veronica Crook, in tow during canvassing while driving around the back streets of Fe in a Bentley.Rees-Mogg turned into cannon fodder, particularly for the tabloid newspapers.He was photographed in a pin-stripe suit visiting the doors of constituents in the Broom estate in Leven.Declarations by Rees-Mogg that people on benefits were the ldquoscourge of the earth didnrsquot help his position.Adding to his back story were reports of Rees-Mogg having to be saved by his Labour opponent Henry McLeish from being beaten up.McLeish told the Daily Record earlier this year: ldquoAt one point, somebody threatened to come onto the  and beat him up.ldquoA touching part to that was that after saving him from a potential duffing up, his father, the very distinguished editor of the Times, William Rees-Mogg, sent me a letter thanking me for how Irsquod managed to protect him, for which he was very grateful.Why your new suitable cabin baggage might actually fall foul of Ryanair rulesldquoIt was a delightful letter, basically saying lsquoI donrsquot often write to Labour MPs, but I would like to thank you very, very sincerely for the way you looked after my sonrsquo.ldquoJacob was like a fish out of water and clearly bewildered by places like Methil and Kennoway.ldquoI did not get the feeling he was the dangerous ideologue extremist we know him as today.ldquoHe was reasonably well behaved in my company because I think he was in fear of his le.ldquoThe fact he is looked upon by some as a future Prime Minister seems well beyond the realms of comprehension.

The party lost all its seats in Scotland.Rees-Mogg refused to accept his background was an issue.He said at the time: ldquoNobody says to Tony Blair in Sedgefield lsquoyoursquore Scottish, so what are you doing in an English constituency rsquo.

But this week the #Peatbogs# will be back on home turf to showcase their energetic brand of traditional-inspired electronica as part of this year#s Skye Live Festival.The rare Skye gig will mark the start of another autumn tour for the six-piece group, for whom constant re-invention has proved key to longevity spanning almost three decades.The sound that#ll boom out in the tent high above Portree Harbour this Saturday will be far removed from the group#s roots as a folk band playing in local pubs. But the Peatbogs, like more recent successors such as Niteworks, are a reminder that a grounding in traditional music is no barrier to a letime of instrumental experimentation.Le for the Peatbog Faeries began with a gig in Edinbane Lodge in the spring of . Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable.

I went and got a GCSE in English and Maths and spent three years up in Derry doing the course.Martin was accepted into St Mary’s University College and after his first teaching job in West Belfast, has moved to the North of the city.“With my engineering background, my first job was a Technology and Design teacher in St Colm’s in Twinbrook and I spent  years there. I loved it there, it was a great community and a school that was thriving.“I moved on to Mercy where there was just  kids. I started off as a teacher before becoming Principal and I’ve been in the role for ten years.”Martin then reflected on the many changes in education over the years, not least the challenges and successes of Mercy College.“When I came in, it was about building up confidence and profile of the school, given our location in North Belfast.“Pupil numbers now are  but our challenges now is very much to do with space and classrooms.“We have been co-educational for a few years now which is fantastic. We have a   ratio girls and boys in Year . Our LLS programme is still really successful and we were the first school to start that.“The standards are amazing – % of girls are getting three A-Levels from A* to C which is very unique. % of our GCSE students got five GCSE’s at the top grades and there are not many other schools in the North that can boast such results.“Finances remain a huge challenge for us. There is no room for any extra money in the system. It is not easy at all.”Away from school, Martin is kept a busy man being a father of ten children.“I am a family man. I am a father-of-ten so at home it is a very busy household, with the kids ranging from  to .“I am very much an outdoor person. I like nature and sunshine. I am also big into running and gardening. With my technology background, I like a project such as a pond or a patio to keep me entertained.”As for the future, Martin is content at Mercy College but would love no more than see a new building for the school in his working le.“I am  now and I suppose you start to think about how many more years I can give in education.“I probably have another ten years in me. I am happy at Mercy College – there are so many challenges every year.“I really want to see our newbuild come for the school which is in the pipeline – just need Stormont up and running to approve it.“The future of the school is very bright. There is a lot of work still to be done to maintain our standards and results and improve facilities for the kids.“"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"sunflowers for sharon","story":"MOUNT Eagles roundabout has been transformed into a “sunflower garden” in support of resident and West Belfast’s own ‘sunflower’ Sharon McCloskey.The mother-of-three is currently undergoing a stem cell transplant as she continues to battle an extremely rare form of leukemia.Sinn Féin Councillor Danny Baker told the Andersonstown News that the sunflower planting was the communities way of showing Sharon and her family that they are behind them.“When we all found about Sharon’s news, obviously our hearts went out to her but there was a real sense of hope and that came from her family and friends,” he said.“We really saw and felt that at one of the early stem cell registration events at the Mount Eagles Community Centre.

Discussions are ongoing on potential additional support for the Northern Ireland hospice sector from public funds, Stormonts health department said.Mrs McCrystal said: \"Why should we not get that over here - are our kids not as important as the kids over in England \"It makes me so cross, why do we have to miss out on that \"I just feel like we dont matter because the funding has not been provided for Northern Ireland - it is not fair.\"Jack cannot walk and weak muscle tone affects his stomach muscles, so he is tube-fed for  hours a day. His mother said: \"That part of things is hard, while we are sitting eating a meal we would love nothing better than to see Jack eating as well. That muscle conditiondoes not allow him to absorb food, he has been tube-fed from when he was about an hour old, that is all he has known - he has never tasted food.\"The hospice provides a safe environment for Jack so his parents can gain some respite from the   demands of his care.Earlier this year, an additional £m of funding was directed to support childrens hospices in England, and more recently a further £m was announced by the Prime Minister.Demand for services in Northern Ireland is high and relative costs are rising. Funding includes a mixture of state provision and charitable giving.The Stormont Executive has not sat for more than two-and-a-half years and there are no ministers to introduce any increase corresponding to England.The McCrystals first came to the north Belfast-based hospice more than  years ago, when Jack was nine months old. He was born extremely ill and doctors did not give much hope of the infant surviving. His condition was undiagnosed for a decade.Stormonts Department of Health said financial pressures across the health and social care system are well documented.\"The DoH faces many competing demands on its already-constrained budget. We are of course very mindful of the vital services provided by hospices in Northern Ireland. Discussions are ongoing on potential additional support for the NI hospice sector from public funds,\" a spokesperson said.

As part of his instructions, which he wrote in , £, was each given to Labour MP Dennis Skinner and Private Eye investigative journalist Paul Halloran. Another £, was donated to two English residents.The remainder of his estate, which included assets in Ireland, England, Singapore and New Zealand, was handed to the executors and trustees of his will - Joe Cahill and Dessie Mackin - for Sinn Fein.At the time Mr Cahill and Mr Mackin were the partys national treasurers. Their address is listed as  Parnell Square, which is the partys headquarters in Dublin.It was outlined in Mr Hamptons will that the money was to be used to cover election expenses, to fund Sinn Fein offices and advice centres, and to aid republican prisoners and their families in both Ireland and Britain.Mr Hamptons will stated: \"In the event that the organisation which is now known as Sinn Fein should cease to be in existence or should have split or taken a dferent name at the date of death then I direct that my executors and trustees are to apply my monies to the political party to which Mr Gerry Adams MP then belongs.\"\"Should Mr Adams pre-decease me or not be a member of any political party at the date of my death then I direct that my executors and trustees shall apply my monies to the republican or nationalist political party in the six counties, other than the SDLP, which has the largest number of elected councillors.\"Mr Hamptons donation was made public on Thursday by the Electoral Commission.A Probate Registry of Wales document confirms that when he died on January , , at a nursing home in Pembrokeshire, Mr Hampton left an estate in the UK worth £,,.However, at the time of writing his will in , he was living in a mobile home in Ireland.

The pensioner, who was unmarried and had no children, was born in London and was a long-term supporter of Sinn Fein.Mr Hamptons will and probate document, as in the case of any deceased person, are available for public inspection. The donation to Sinn Fein was paid to the party in instalments of £m and £, in April and May this year.The size of the UK estate and the mention of other global assets means that Sinn Fein may yet be in line for further donations from Mr Hampton.Under HM Revenue  Customs rules, Sinn Fein will not have to pay any inheritance tax on the £.m gt as any political party that has at least two MPs in the House of Commons is not liable to do so.Sinn Fein has seven MPs but because of a Westminster abstentionist policy they do not take their seats in the house.A political party also qualies for exemptionit has one MP and received no less than , votes at the last general election.

Members were told that a key element of this innovation project was the provision of mechanism to support the transfer of skills and expertise to company staff and university students.Personalised MedicineIn relation to the prioritisation of the Future Fund of £m and the further anticipated match funding from NI Government and other partners, the emphasis is on advancing with projects such as the Graduate Medical School as a key catalyst for the much-needed expansion of the Ulster University Magee Campus. The delivery of a Personalised Medicine Centre of Excellenceat Ulster University and Altnagelvin is also a priority for this fund as is the provision of an integrated, Council-wide, multi-skills employment pathways intervention support programme.The report advised that work on these innovation projects as well as the proposed SMART and digital city projects were advancing in close collaboration with local industry and partners and relevant government departments, while the strategic outline cases for major regeneration projects for Derry City and Strabane Town Centre are at an advanced stage of progress.The Personalised Medicine Centre of Excellence intends on harnessing the power of Genomics to predict and diagnose inherited and acquired disease, and to personalise treatments and interventions.The Ulster University representatives said it will expand its partnership with Genomics Ireland and other commercial enterprises to sequence the genomes of % of NI’s population contributing to a research database that can be interrogated to develop personalised medicine solutions with worldwide application and valuable I.P. and how it will also contribute to health improvement locally through a unique ‘community buy-in’ approach.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":"https://img.resized.co/derrynow/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3MzLWV1LXdlc3QtMS5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tXFxcL3N0b3JhZ2UucHVibGlzaGVycGx1cy5pZVxcXC9tZWRpYS5yaXZlcm1lZGlhLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAxOVxcXC8wOVxcXC8wOTEyMTkwNlxcXC9TVFJBQkFORS1ERVZJQ0UtLnBuZ1wiLFwid2lkdGhcIjo2NDcsXCJoZWlnaHRcIjozNDAsXCJkZWZhdWx0XCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL2NhY2hlLnJlc2l6ZWQuY29cXFwvbm8taW1hZ2UucG5nXCIsXCJvcHRpb25zXCI6W119IiwiaGFzaCI6IjhlOTFmNGZjY2ExNDE2YjZiOGFkN2MwMzExOGY0ZWQ0NThmOWJlMmIifQ==/strabane-device.png","title":"security operation creggan area derry following discovery mortar device strabane","story":"District Commander Superintendent Gordon McCalmont said: \"It is our assessment that the New IRA is responsible for the mortar device that was discovered outside homes in Church View Close in Strabane on Saturday morning th September.

Competing in the competition for the first time, Andrew ploughed excellently over both days, winning a bronze medal on day one.With an aggregate score over the two days of competition used to crown the world champion, it was all to plough for on day two which focused on grassland.And Andrew was in good company with three former world champions making up the top five positions on the first day.He ploughed another fantastic plot to finish in fth place on day two, which placed him fourth overall, picking up the best newcomer award.Andrew said it has always been his dream to compete at the world contest.ldquoIt has been an unbelievable experience and I am so delighted to have won a medal. I am indebted for all the support I have received, particularly from my family, he said.Listooder Ploughing Society chairman Martin Gill spoke of his delight following the gala awards presentation.He said: ldquoTo go to the world contest for the first time, using borrowed equipment and to compete with the best in the world, winning a bronze medal and best newcomer title is a fantastic achievement.ldquoListooder has a long and successful history in ploughing. All three of our members who have competed at the world contest have all come home medal winners.In the reversible class, Hillsboroughrsquos James Coulter, who was also competing at the world contest for the first time, produced another fantastic performance.After finishing th on day one, James ploughed a fantastic plot the day after to win a bronze medal on grassland, finishing fourth overall and winning the best newcomer for the class.There will be little time for Andrew and James to celebrate as they prepare to compete in the Northern Ireland Championships at Cookstown this weekend..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th September 2019 Aughlisnafin.jpg","title":"Aughlisnafin primary school opens new sensory garden  ","story":"CHILDREN, teachers and parents at St Maryrsquos Primary School, Aughlisnafin, celebrated the completion of a sensory garden and outdoor learning centre at the school with a barbecue and family fun night last Friday.The garden was officially opened by the school principal, Paddy Hardy, and Laura Brennan, chairperson of the schoolrsquos parent-teacher association.The Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service and the RNLI were in attendance to advise the children on fire and water safety.Another special guest was Down gaelic footballer Rory Burns, who took on the children in a lsquoBeat the Goaliersquo competition.The school staff got involved by raising funds with a lsquoSponge the Teacherrsquo event which was a highlight for the children.A total of pound, was raised from all the activities and the barbecue.The school wishes to Fresh Food Centre, Castlewellan, Finnegans Butchers, Castlewellan, and Eurospar, Clough, for their donations.The school also wishes to thank everyone who attended the event for their support..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th September 2019 Ban.jpg","title":"Ban on circuses with live animals  ","story":"CIRCUSES using live animals will be banned from performing throughout the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area.The move calling for the council not to grant entertainment licences to circuses using live animals was passed at Monday nightrsquos full council meeting.It echoes back to a previous ban enforced by the legacy Down District Council which prohibited circuses with live animals performing on council facilities.The notice of motion, tabled by Alliance councillor Patrick Brown, was supported by  councillors. The only dissenting voice came from the DUPrsquos Harry Harvey, who voted against.The DUP councillor took an alternative view on the perceived harmful effect that circus le has on animals.Cllr Harvey said: ldquoI wonrsquot be supporting this motion as circus animals are very well trained and well trained animals are generally happy and well looked after.Cllr Brown told the meeting that many animals travelling with circuses were ldquosubjected to constantly being moved around cramped temporary housing, forced training and performance, loud noises and intimidating crowds of people.He continued: ldquoTravelling circus le is likely to have a harmful effect on animal welfare as captive animals are unable to socialise, get enough exercise or exhibit natural behaviours. Many animals develop behavioural and or health problems as a direct result of the captive le that they are forced to lead.He said that a recent report commissioned by the Welsh Government concluded that: ldquoLe for wild animals in travelling circuses... does not appear to constitute either a lsquogood lersquo or a lsquole worth livingrsquo.ldquoThe Irish government recently saw footage from the Animal Defenders International group which showed elephants and camels being repeatedly punched and hit with sticks to perform, said Cllr Brown.He added: ldquoIn May, the UK Government announced it would be banning wild animals in circuses from early . The Irish Government banned wild animals in January .ldquoAs usual, this being a devolved issue, Northern Ireland is behind the times yet again. This issue was actually raised in the Assembly as far back as  by my good friend Jim Wells MLA, who was very critical of the failure of Michelle OrsquoNeillrsquos Agriculture department to include such provisions in the Welfare of Animals Act .The councillor argued that some of the worldrsquos best circuses, such as the Cirque de Soleil, ddid not use any animals which ldquoreflects a global trend towards human-centered performances that no longer use animals, including the Russian and Chinese state circuses.He added: ldquoHopefully council will lead the way on animal welfare and pass this motion.The motion was seconded by fellow Alliance councillor Gregory Bain.Downpatrick SDLP councillor John Trainer, who also supported the motion said circuses did not provide a natural habitat for animals.DUP councillor Billy Walker, UUP councillor David Taylor and Sinn Feacuteinrsquos Willie Clarke all supported the motion on behalf of their respective parties..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th September 2019 Community.jpg","title":"Community bid to halt church’s sale of Crossgar centre  ","story":"CHURCH officials in Crossgar are being asked to abort plans to sell a building and consider donating it to local people instead.The community centre in Downpatrick Street mdash which was a former pub mdash was purchased two decades ago but is now on the market for sale as a commercial unit.Representatives of the Church of the Immaculate Conception and St Joseph are planning to meet with community representatives to explain the reasons for the sale which are understood to centre around increased running costs and reduced numbers of people using the facility.Community officials have expressed an interest in working with Newry, Mourne and Down Council to take over the running of the building,agreement could be reached to donate it to the people of Crossgar.They believe that the building offers major potential and could be developed to provide a range of services to meet the needs of a wide range of cross-community groups in the village.Community representatives want the meeting with church officials to be open to localpeople, arguing that a lot of public money has already been invested in the property over recent years which is used by the Crossgar Youth League among others.ldquoThe building could be transformed into a modern community centre with the right investment and commitment. There is a parking area at the rear with spaces for around  vehicles andthese are lost what happens, especially during the summer months when the villagersquos popular Youth League is in full flow, said one community official.ldquoLocal people have been using the property for around  years and we would very much like church officials to consider donating it to them so they can take it over and work with others to manage the running costs.Community officials say there was a need for a dedicated indoor community facility in Crossgar which would meet the needs of many groups and organisations.The added ldquoplans for a major new sports complex unveiled a number of years never came to fruition and were unlikely to in the future.Officials believe thatthe Downpatrick Street building was donated to the people of the village, its future as a community base could potentially be guaranteed.Community officials insist that one of their key priorities is looking after Crossgar Youth League which continues to go from strength to strength and also uses the car park at the rear of the building to store equipment.ldquoIt is no onersquos fault that the Downpatrick Street building is being sold. If there are concerns around its running costs why doesnrsquot the parish come and talk to us and give us the opportunity to work alongside others and take it over  suggested one community official.ldquoThere was a major push to open this building many years ago and a lot of public money was invested in it. The property is critical to the success of the Crossgar Youth League and is an enormous community benefit. It is the best thing we have in the village.ldquoThe loss of the building would have an enormous impact on the Youth League and indeed the Crossgar community. There is potential to do so much with the property and we hope it is not lost to the people of the village.

Existing paths will also be upgraded.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker mdash who has been lobbying for the existing pedestrian crossing to be upgraded mdash is delighted that it is finally going to happen.ldquoThe scheme has been included in the Department for Infrastructurersquos programme and will be installed as pat of the forthcoming environmental improvement scheme, he explained.ldquoI am delighted that after years of lobbying, this much-needed scheme is finally now in the programme and will be delivered. I hope that it will be delivered as soon as possible, given the huge volume of traffic which passes through the centre of the town each day.Cllr Walker said a number of traffic surveys have been carried out over the years to determine the need for an upgraded crossing and is pleased that one is finally going to be delivered and will be paid for by the Department for Infrastructure.ldquoThe importance of this puffin crossing cannot be highlighted enough, he continued. ldquoThe new crossing will see the provision of Killyleaghrsquos first set of traffic lights which in itself is signicant. The traffic lights will ensure drivers come to a complete halt while people are crossing.Cllr Walker said a number of people using the existing pedestrian crossing were hit by cars, while there were ldquocountless near misses.ldquoWhen people press the button on the new puffin crossing, traffic will stop immediately to allow them to cross safely. My thanks go to roads officials for finally agreeing that an upgraded crossing is necessary, he continued.ldquoThe biggest concern many in Killyleagh have is the speed of vehicles approaching Catherine Street from the Comber direction. The new puffin crossing will address this issue at what is a particularly busy main street which is notoriously dficult to cross, even with the presence of the current crossing.Cllr Walker said people need to be able to bring traffic to a halt so they can cross in safety. He is also delighted with the planned environmental improvement scheme and has no doubt it will have a positive impact on the town centre.He added: ldquoA number of similar schemes carried out in other towns and villages across the district have had a signicant impact, helping restore pride and encouraging businesses and residents to spruce up their respective premises.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed the council was developing proposals to bring forward seven environmental improvement schemes across the district, one of which is proposed for Killyleagh.ldquoIt is anticipated that this will include upgrade works to pathways, street lighting and street furniture, he explained.ldquoImplementation of the works is however subject to planning approval and the council being successful in an application for funding to the Rural Development Programme.

But he conceded that theof -hour AE services may be dficult.Mr McGoran was invited to address the Down Community Health Committee and said it was important that the South Eastern Trust was having a conversation with campaigners who are keen to continue discussions with officials to ensure the retention of existing services and the delivery of enhanced provision moving forward.Over previous years, relations between both organisations was particularly fraught at times and while they did not always see eye to eye, Mr McGoran hopes they can now move forward together.He said he had ldquonothing but respect for the Down community because local people cared about their health and social care services, committing time and energy to make sure the area gets the best provision it can.ldquoThis is not always obvious everywhere in Northern Ireland, Mr McGoran continued. ldquoYou have been at this for a long time and I have no doubt that without your campaigning work we would not have some of the things we have in this organisation today. I am also not sure that we would have the Downe Hospital.ldquoYour contribution and those who went before you has been fundamental in keeping this area in the spotlight, fighting ultimately for your services. I take my hat off to you. The Downe is here to stay and we have a fantastic facility and there are no staff better. In fact, we have incredible staff who work right across the organisation.Mr McGoran said that while administrators and campaigners may not have always agreed in the past about how the health trust did things, he suggested they all had the same aim mdashwanting the best health and social care that could be delivered, sometimes within challenging resources.Looking to the future, the health chief referred to an ongoing review of emergency care which has resulted in the group overseeing the exercise visiting the Downe and meeting with senior health officials.ldquoI do envisage that there is going to be further change for emergency medicine but when I was asked the question what did I think about the future of the service at the Downe, Ulster and Lagan Valley hospitals in  yearsrsquo time, I could not really answer that, explained Mr McGoran.ldquoI was prepared to say what it would be like in five yearsrsquo time, but could not look beyond that. A five year vision is really something that you can get a hold of and we made it clear to those in charge of the review that the emergency care model we have in place at the Downe will be here in five yearsrsquo time.Mr McGoran said the health trust was on record with the Department of Health during the early stages of the current engagement that it still sees the current model at the Downe comprising the emergency department, out of hours GP service and weekend nurse-led minor injuries unit remaining in place.ldquoWe will still have acute beds in the Downe and it will deal with medically unwell patients. All of the current infrastructure we have will remain in place and our vision is to expect these to remain in place for the next five years, he confirmed.Mr McGoran said the one caveat was that it remained to be seen what the Department of Health will do with the information it has been provided with in relation to the future of emergency care, suggesting serious conversations about the way forward have only just begun.He added: ldquoThere is work ongoing and at some point there may be a consultation exercise. I do not know where all this is going to go and it is a bit early to speculate.Community Health Committee chairman Eamonn McGrady welcomed the health officialrsquos ldquoconstructive and honest engagement with campaigners.He said: ldquoWe need to go forward in a partnership, but that does not mean that we will always agree. Our community supports the Downe Hospital and also the centres of excellence in the bigger hospitals that our delivering our health needs.ldquoBut we need as much care as possible provided as locally as possible, safely and well adequately resourced in a brilliant building.Mr McGrady added: ldquoI hope that in five yearsrsquo time we will be looking at a very major extension at the Downe and a major increase in capacity.

Council because of the murders at Warrenpoint and Mullaghmore was rejected the SDLP and Alliance members.The motion to adjourn was defeated by ten votes to six and immediately the Unionists walked out mdash not in protest but as a gesture of sympathy to those bereaved by the murders.The motion was introduced by Saintfield councillor, Mr William Finlay, who said he looked back with horror at the murders, the victims including  soldiers at Warrenpoint, Lord Mountbatten, his grandson, Nicholas , the Dowager Lady Brabourne, and a  year-old boy, Paul Maxwell.Acting chairman, Mr Paddy OrsquoDonoghuesaid he would be impartial in the matter and was quite sure they all shared the revulsion, horror and disgust and would like to show their sympathy with those were bereaved ldquoin such a dreadful way.He pointed out that there had been two committee meetings of the council since the murders occurred, but since Mr Finlayrsquos motion was a procedural matter councillors must decide without any debate whether or not they wanted to adjourn the meeting.He added: ldquoHowever, whether or not the council decides to adjourn should not be interpreted as to whether or not councillors approve of the vile deeds which have been perpetrated.After the vote, in which the SDLP and Alliance members voted against the Unionists, Mr Finlay said he was sorry about the decision which the majority had made.NEWCASTLE mdash The fireworks display organised as the climax of the Newcastle summer season did not go down with a bang, but instead fizzled out.Torrential rain minutes before the fireworks bonanza was due to begin washed the show out and it now seems likely that the display will be held at Halloween at Downpatrick racecourse instead.Drumgath Accordion Band and Ballykeel Pipe Band were about to march into the arena to put on a marching exhibition when the rain came down.More than pound had been spent on the fireworks, but the rockets, roman candles, catherine wheels, shells, mortars and numerous other favourites were saved from the rain. Disappointed spectators had their money refunded.The fireworks bonanza, sponsored by Down District Council, was to have marked the end of the Percy French Festival.However, the stage will now switch to Downpatrick in October where a successful display was staged last year.ARDGLASS mdash Suki, the cat escaped a horrible death at Ardglass harbour recently, has found a new home in Lisburn.The story about how Suki survived an attempt to have her drowned aroused so much interest that the person who found her, Mrs Joan Owens, was inundated with phone calls to give the cat a home.Mrs Owens, of Ardgtreenan Crescent, Belfast, accepted the first of more than  calls and the cat left for its new home in Dundrod Walk, Lisburn, earlier this week.ldquoSomeone had tried to get rid of the cat, Mrs Owens explained. ldquoSuki was tied in a paper bag and thrown off the side of the harbour, but instead of hitting the waves she landed in our cabin cruiser, which was anchored.ldquoWhen we were taking our boat out of the water for repairs to the hull we came across a torn bag on the deck. Then we heard noises from a cabin mdash and found Suki mothering three new kittens.ldquoUnfortunately, we had to have the three kittens put down and Suki neutered. And then when our two tom cats took a dislike to Suki we were forced to appeal for a home for her.Mrs Owens added: ldquoThe response was overwhelming and the first of many callers took Suki away. My husband, Jim, and I will be ing to our caravan at Ardtole, near Ardglass, this weekend. We hope we donrsquot find any more animals in distress!DOWNPATRICK mdash Downpatrickrsquos new maternity hospital, which is due to replace the Hardy Greer House unit early in the New Year, will not become fully operational until staffing dficulties can be resolved.It is expected that an advertising campaign is to be mounted shortly for all grades of staff required in the bright, new up-to-date hospital.The -bed unit in the grounds of the Downshire Hospital will require up to % more midwery staff than the -bed Hardy Greer House on the Strangford Road, which seems to be permanently under-staffed and struggling along.The new unit will also accommodate an out-patient centre which will mean the transfer of ante-natal and post-natal work which is currently conducted at Downe Hospital.The expected completion date for the new building is November. It is already a couple of months behind schedule because of a host of supply dficulties, the cement strike among them.Once it is handed over it will have to be equipped and sterilised before it can be commissioned. That could take a couple of months.BALLYNAHINCH mdash The September Flower Show organised by the Presbyterian Womenrsquos Association connected to st Ballynahinch Presbyterian Church proved to be a huge success.The Huston Hall was crammed full of baking, handiwork, flowers and vegetables.

After the judging the ious articles were sold at bargain prices, raising almost pound for church funds.KILLYLEAGH mdash Killyleagh artist Leo Casement is making a big name for himself in France. Leo set off for Europe last year after staging a successful one-man exhibition in Downpatrick Library.Now many of his paintings are finding their way into French homes and the name Leo Casement is appearing in French newspapers.Leo had originally indicated that he might be ing home at the end of this month, but he has put his travelling boots on again and is in Amsterdam at the moment.PORTAFERRY mdash Euro MP John Taylor has joined the fight of Portaferry residents, who are angry about the new sewage works scheme which they say will be pumping untreated sewage into Strangford Lough.Mr Taylor is to table a question at this monthrsquos meeting of the European Parliament, askingthe scheme is receiving financial backing from the EEC.Mr Taylor is also demanding to knowthe plant would qualy for help from the EEC regional aid fund,it was modied to include the treatment of sewage.The Euro MP, who was the site engineer in charge of the storm drainage scheme in Portaferry in the late s and who says he has a good knowledge of the problem encountered by residents, intends bluntly askingthe EEC encourages the disposal of raw effluent into the lough.KEARNEY mdash A yacht which was taking part in a race from Bangor to Portpatrick in Scotland struck rocks at Kearney Point on the Ards Peninsula during thick fog at the weekend.Donaghadee Leboat answered the Mayday call and towed the boat and the eight people on board to safety.Yachtsmen competing in the race, organisedby Royal Ulster Yacht Club, said that conditions were probably the worst experienced for the event.The crews found it most dficult with the thick sea mist cutting visibility down to  yards at times as rain lashed down.

This was foreseen in the design of St Johnrsquos Point lighthouse where there is excellent lantern sidewall and cowling ventilation in a tower  feet above the ground in this remote location. There is little hazard from the liquid mercury since it is not readily absorbed dermally.Campaigners have suggested that it would be interesting to see CILrsquos lighthouse keeper health monitoring records for mercury covering the past  years and more when the lighthouse was manned and used the present system. They also said it would be interestingto see the training records for keepers in safe mercury handling during all these years. ldquoPresumably, these would have been managed by independent bodies of experts since the Commissioners probably didnrsquot previously have and donrsquot today have any toxicological experts on your permanent payroll, says the campaigners letter.Another area of concern highlighted is the poor state of the lighthouse, including adjoining housing which a delegation from the Commissionerrsquos office recently visited.Campaigners point to the ldquolamentable state of the walls of the lighthouse station and the grounds, suggesting that they present a picture of ldquowoeful neglect and asking how CIL can expect the public to be impressed with a lack of basic asset maintenance.The letter highlights that the current Fresnel lens system turns  hours a day and is clearly visible from the road outside the lighthouse station.Campaigners say this in itself is a visual attraction during daylight hours ldquosince the magnicent large lens system is big enough to be seen turning on itrsquos mercury bearing and is even more magnicent at night.The letter continues: ldquoWe believe that CIL will miss a tremendous opportunity to preserve this lighthouse and its sweeping beamyou persist with your alternative bearing plans. The whole lighthouse station could become part of a wider tourist attraction in the area. Future generations will thank you for retaining the current historic beam system, still going smoothly after  years and showing no signs of obsolescence. You have not made an economic case for change of lens system at St Johnrsquos Point as far as we know and it is dficult to see how you can.ldquoWhat happens at the lighthouse remains the focus of keen and widespread local and political interest in this area and we will ensure this continues to be a high-profile local issue.The letter adds: ldquoLecale Lightkeepers are willing to fully support CIL and others in any preservation programme that involves retaining the sweeping beam. However, we reject the idea that the use of mercury in this lens bearing application represents a health hazard that cannot be managed by a sensible, low-cost maintenance programme involving chiefly adequate ventilation.

This case,left unchallenged, would set a very dangerous precedent for future iniduals who seek tohome and visit their children and families.“In light of the reasons we have been provided to date, we remain of the view that the decision to remove Mr Volrath on Monday morning was unlawful and we have firm instructions to challenge the validity of same.“It is still very much our position that the Irish state’s actions have infringed our client’s human rights and we have firm instructions to initiate proceedings against the Irish state for his removal.“These proceedings will seek to have this incident expunged from his records, and to claim damages for his unlawful detention and infringement of his right to family le.”A spokesman from the Irish Department of Justice said: “The Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service does not comment on inidual cases.“Under the Immigration Act , the question of entry for any inidual, visa or non-visa required, is determined by the immigration

could not resist sharing a fun moment with a young mother and her daughter as she launched her latest family-friendly garden.Kate put her hands on -month-old Matilda’s head, danced with the youngster and playfully rubbed her hair as she relaxed with families invited to the opening of her Back to Nature play garden, at the Royal Horticultural SocietyGarden Wisley in Surrey yesterday.Celebrity chef Mary Berry, an RHS ambassador, joined the duchess for the event and the pair even travelled on a tractor trailer to a fete-style festival at Wisley that marked the garden’s launch.Kate’s new open space – which encourages children to play, explore and engage with nature – has been inspired by previous gardens she co-created with landscape architects Andree Davies and Adam White, with input from the RHS..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default

I will not comment on the details, but I might have thought that that money — even at this late stage — could be given to charity. That would be no bad thing.”Last month the News Letter revealed that Mr Smith had reinstated photos of the Queen which had been removed in .A source close to Secretary of State said at the time: “The Secretary of State was clear that the Head of State’s image should be on display in Stormont House.”Boris Johnsons prorogation of parliament ruled unlawful by three judges in Scotland Coremetrics

Image: BBC SpotlightAlthough it has long been known that Mr McGuinness was an IRA commander, he refused to discuss his actions in the organisation and insisted that he had never killed anyone.The images will be broadcast next Tuesday in the first part of one of BBC Northern Ireland’s most ambitious projects, a two-year re-examination of the Troubles which will run over seven programmes. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button The first programme in the series also includes a former colonel saying that he was shown evidence by the RUC that Ian Paisley, the future First Minister, had supplied the money for explosives which caused one of the first explosions of the Troubles.The rare footage of an IRA car bomb being assembled was filmed in Londonderry in the early years of the Troubles.During the programme, former IRA bomber Shane Paul O’Doherty commentated on the pictures, saying: “There’s a huge charge there. A very dangerous alarm clock timer that could blow them all to hell.”When asked who he recognised, he said: “Well, there’s Martin....Martin McGuinness.” Mr O’Doherty said he was certain that it was the future deputy First Minister, saying “nobody walks like him, with a stoop in his back”.The car containing the bomb could be identied by its number plate. The BBC programme includes footage of the bomb exploding  minutes later in the centre of Mr McGuinness’s home city, Londonderry.The day after the bombing, Northern Ireland Prime Minister Brian Faulkner was brought to London to be told that security powers would be removed from Stormont and taken on by Westminster, leading to the collapse of Stormont.The Spotlight programme also includes footage of Mr McGuinness showing guns to young children and handing them bullets while seated in a car.Commentating on the film pictures, Mr O’Doherty said: “It’s Martin McGuinness. Very young, tall, handling weapons – a rle and a revolver – rolling up to a load of kids who are staring in the windows, craning in the windows and showing them bullets.“It’s horric, really, because here was McGuinness showing eight, nine and -year-olds guns and bullets that were exciting. People had a feeling that you were on television, you know, you were superstars.”Police had evidence Ian Paisley paid for Troubles bombing, says ex-colonel Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The programme does not explain the background to the footage. However, Spotlight reporter Darragh MacIntyre said that it would be made clear in a future film in the series.He said that it had been shot by an American documentary maker and was never broadcast.Mr McIntyre, the reporter who in  exposed the then DUP MP Iris Robinson’s affair and financial dealings with property developers, said that the  footage “speaks to a time when within Free Derry and where in the north there was a sense that the IRA had it won, that they were the original guerrilla fighters and within a matter of months would see their way to a new united Ireland...so they were quite free - not just Martin McGuinness - when they were filming with this documentary team”.In , Mr McGuinness told the journalist Eamonn Mallie that he was “very proud that I was a part of the IRA in Derry” but declined to say whether he had ever killed anyone.Last month, former IRA member Kieran Conway said that as the IRA’s chief of staff at the time of the attack which killed Lord Mountbatten and others, including two children, Mr McGuinness had to “take responsibility” for what had happened that day.Another former IRA man, Anthony McIntyre, said of that attack: “If they knew about the children, and were quite prepared to go ahead and to sacrice their lives in order to get Mountbatten, then it’s a war crime”.However, Sinn Féin MLA and former IRA man Raymond McCartney denounced such criticism of Mr McGuinness, saying that he was “held in the highest of esteem across Ireland and internationally”.The Foyle MLA said: “It is reprehensible that anyone would make unfounded allegations against a man who is no longer here to defend himself.”Spotlight on The Troubles – a Secret History involve two -minute programmes and five hour-long episodes. The series has been overseen by editor Jeremy Adams, deputy editor Gwyneth Jones and producer Chris Thornton. It involves three senior Spotlight reporters – Darragh MacIntyre, Jenner O’Leary and Mandy McAuley.The first programme will be broadcast on BBC One NI on Tuesday at .pm and will also be shown on BBC

Of those,  have been empty for more than two years.Landlords will be given incentives to bring long term empty properties into use as the council says they attract crime and anti-social behaviour, drive down values and become ldquodetrimental to the lives of residents.Measures are set out in a draft strategy which the councilrsquos cabinet, on July , agreed to publish for public consultation.While the council wants landlords to accept help to get homes in use, the strategy says theauthority will take actionnecessary.Vale council deputy leader Cllr Lis Burnett told the meeting she was ldquostunned more than  homes in the Vale have been empty for more than two years.ldquoItrsquos absolutely staggering, she said. ldquoA strategy on a way we can tackle it is very welcome. Empty properties are detrimental to the lives of local residents.ldquoThey are often a magnet for crime and continue to blight neighbourhoods. They can also be a risk to emergency services.Some  Vale properties have been empty for more than  years, but most long-term empty properties are vacant for six months to two years. In April , the St Augustinersquos ward in Penarth had the most long-term empty homes, with  empty for more than six months and  for more than two years.Penarthrsquos Plymouth ward had more than  empty for more than six months, and more than  empty for more than two years.The proposed strategy calls on the council to maintain and improve its empty homes data, provide financial incentives to landlords, prioritise empty homes for enforcement action such as enforced sales and compulsory purchase orders, and to raise awareness of the issue of empty homes.The strategy says: ldquoA voluntary way forward to renovation and re-occupation is always the preferred option, and officers make all available endeavours to encourage and persuade such progress.ldquoHowever, in instances where owners cannot be traced or where exhaustive attempts to encourage and promote progress from known owners prove unproductive, orthere is an imminent risk to health and safety, there is little option but to proceed with a statutory solution,The draft empty homes strategy will be put to public consultation after the councilrsquos August recess. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

We speak to founder Daniel Crawford and his team about the journey so far A spark in the mind of Daniel Crawford as he studied for his masters degree in Glasgow just a few years ago has grown into a business at the sharp end of technology. axialD is tasked with turning the complicated and laborious process of converting D medical scans into D models – and producing them for use by surgeons and medical professionals. It’s an ever-growing business, spun out of Ulster University, which is expanding its reach across the UK, Ireland and now into the US where it’s targeting a burgeoning fresh marketplace. The company has been involved with Catalyst since , been directly involved with a host of its programmes, and is participating in the EU INTERREG funded North West Centre for Advanced Manufacturing , managed by the Special European Union Programmes Body . Catalyst is Northern Ireland’s leading technology hub, home to  companies and around , staff. Daniel has a strong team around him – growing to  staff based in Belfast city centre, including Niall Haslam, chief technology officer, Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships and Cathy Coomber as operations manager. While studying medical visualisation and human anatomy in Glasgow, Daniel was exposed to the raft of imaging available – including CT, MRI and ultrasound, and began examining how the crucial data could be better used. The biomedical physics undergraduate grew the idea into his thesis – looking at converting D data sets and converting them into fully D printable files. “That allows us to turn images into D models to allow surgeons or registrars, to understand digital pathologies, before going in to theatre,” he said. “But we discovered it wasn’t just good for that and surgeons also wanted to get their hands on the D models.” That gave Daniel greater scope for developing the concept. In one early case, a surgeon was able to use one of the D prints to identy small fractures in a patient who had suffered a motorcycle crash, that weren’t initially apparent using more traditional methods. The company was thrust into Catalyst’s Springboard programme in  – a  week scheme which allowed a would-be entrepreneur, fresh out of university, access to business training and development, which included working with PathXL’s Stuart Harvey. From there, it was into the Halo programme – bringing axialD together with angel investors in order to get the start-up off the ground. It landed £, through Techstart and private investors, which allowed the company to get the ball rolling. Through Catalyst, Daniel also got the opportunity to visit MIT and the entrepreneurial development programme, Way to Scale, bringing axialD to Massachusetts and the Boston area – the global heart of the health technology sector. Niall Haslam is axialD’s chief technical officer. He said a Belfast and Boston partnership has helped strengthen the links between the cities, bringing firms from Northern Ireland to the US for both networking and scoping out the potential for setting up shop across the Atlantic. “The Way to Scale program brings entrepreneurs together. It’s a great networking opportunity,” Niall says. axialD is now a partner in the EU INTERREG-funded NW CAM, which brings together a network of research institutes, universities and enterprises to carry out research in advanced manufacturing. It is working with Ulster University on a number of projects, including looking at developing custom designed jigs for hospitals to produce D models. Cathy Coomber has been with axialD for three years. “What we have done in that time is looking at standardising the processes,” she says. “Biomedical engineers from Ulster University and those across the UK are producing data, manually segmenting thousands of medical images in order to help them develop an algorithm. “That allows us to massively improve our standardised process and reduce the time involved in producing those files.” That could mean reducing the time down from up to five hours, to as little as an hour. “When the company started, Daniel was able to get those early users excited in Glasgow, and then setting up in Belfast there were key surgeons which helped set the pace,” Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships said. The company has since been involved with NHS frameworks as a means to help remove as many bottlenecks as possible. This involves developing and marketing the products to the NHS and HSC in the Republic – helping them to learn about the product, the process and what area of specialism it can be used in. “In the last  months with the development of the algorithms, we are moving in to the US,” Katie said. “We’re seeing a lot of growth in the US.” And the axialD team is also growing fast. “We have  staff at the moment but are looking to expand in  months,” Daniel said. “That includes new staff in the US to help grow and manage that market as we further expand our software team back home.” The success of axialD mirrors the overall success of Catalyst, since its inception  years ago. It’s an independent not-for-profit organisation across its four sites – including its largest base at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast, alongside its Londonderry hub, Ballymena, along with the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub at Danske Bank in Belfast city centre.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jm_1.jpg","title":"how do you retain staff and keep them enjoying their job","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by Ulster Business With such intense competition for talent, the challenge for employers isn’t just finding prospective candidates, it’s also keeping them, writes John Moore, managing director of Hays NI Astonishingly, almost half of professionals surveyed in the Hays What Workers Want Report said that they left at least one new job within the first  months because it didn’t match expectations formed during the application process. A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"new  bedroom boutique hotel planned for belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by John Mulgrew A listed Belfast building could become a new hotel and restaurant as part of wider plans for a £m revamp of the city centre. Tribeca Belfast, formerly Royal Exchange, will see UK developer Castlebrooke redevelop much of the north side of the city centre. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. As part of the revised plans it wants to turn the listed former Assembly Rooms building at the corner of North Street and Waring Street into a new -bedroom hotel, with a restaurant and bars. That would involve knocking down part of the newer extension to the building, including the rear part of the former Northern Bank and the adjacent - North Street to “accommodate the new extension to form the proposed boutique hotel”. “The proposals for the existing building are similar in scope to that which was included as part of the extant approval. It is proposed to conservatively repair the existing historic fabric of the former Northern Bank,” a design statement says. “A key feature of the proposed extension is that the interface with the rearelevation of the existing listed bank building will be improved by setting back the footprint of the proposed extension so that the north west corner of the original building is readable.” The scheme includes the re-use and adaptation of the existing building as well as an extension on the footprint of the existing s extension on North Street. The extension will be set over five floors, with a rooftop bar, while upper floors are set back with metal cladding to the facades to “reduce the overall massing of the building and reflect the roofing materials or upper story treatment of surrounding buildings”. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. This summer the developer ran a fresh public consultation amid revised plans for the scheme, which included signicantly reducing a huge -storey building to around , retaining additional facades and dropping plans for an underground car park.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm.

What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed.

Founder and managing director David Whelan speaks to Ulster Business about a business which boasts the right tools for the job David Whelan’s vision and mantra for what is now one of the leading telecoms businesses is clear – telecommunications services are only as good as the foundations on which they are built, with engineering front and centre. He’s the entrepreneur behind Clarity Telecom – a successful Belfast-based full-service telecommunications solutions company with almost  years under its belt, helping develop top-end connectivity – including lines, calls, mobile, broadband and cloud software – for businesses across Ireland and the UK. And for David, telecoms is all about engineering at the core of finding the best comprehensive solution to its customers, having the right tools for the job, and having world class people. For Clarity Telecom, it’s about developing a bespoke system for companies, focusing on engineering from day one. Since its inception in , Clarity Telecom has grown to have a greater engineering capability than any other independent telecommunications company in Northern Ireland, and is now rolling out its leading byphone VoIPsystem throughout the UK and Ireland. David also says through Clarity Telecom and its burgeoning byphone technology, the company could double revenues in the next three years as well as growing its workforce. “The phone network stops at a plug in the wall and from that point on, you have to provide the infrastructure and management,” David says. “What we do is focus on the engineering. It’s all about how well it works and adapts to your business. “By focusing on that we are looking at the way things are being built, and we can then get insights on how we can change and improve things.” Led by engineering, the Clarity team is driving change within the telecoms industry ensuring client infrastructure is fit for purpose and for the future. That starts with assessing a business’s needs, making sure the network is suitable, reviewing the workforce needs and bandwidth requirements. From there, Clarity Telecom can develop a bespoke solution – from cabling, to switching, cloud services, routing and phone systems. Clarity Telecom now has a team of  staff – a third of whom work directly within the engineering side of the business. But that number could grow further still, as the company expands its business across Northern Ireland, and develops its byphone technology. The company developed its subsidiary, Voxbit, in  – specically to design engineering solutions. And through that has come one of its most successful products, byphone. A simple to use VoIP , byphone is a drag and drop system that allows users to configure their own phone set up suited to the exact needs of the organisation and enables a range of analysis tools that can help business owners drive up efficiencies. “In  as VoIP started coming along, I realised that was a signicant opportunity,” David says. “Where the communications industry is going is into the cloud. It’s going from traditional storage within buildings, into something in the cloud. The traditional telephone systems are evolving. “We started making a series of innovations surrounding cloud technology. We realised you can make it simpler – we were asking ourselves, can you make it work without a manual, for example. “If you can, in the same way as Apple’s iPhone made things easier for users, people will start using the services. It’s about making everyone’s le easier. “The end user wants to be able to use the system easily, from managing their telephone number, to having access to voicemail. It’s about the ‘power of simple’. “We now have around  resellers for the byphone system in the UK, and we are looking at trebling or quadrupling those sales,” he said. One of Clarity Telecom’s customers is Mid  East Antrim Borough Council. The firm was tasked with bringing together the complex communication needs of the new ‘super council’ following the amalgamation in . “With bringing three councils together, one of the main problems was having a single phone number that people could call. If you have numerous sites, spread across three council areas, that would involve a lot of rip and replace,” David says. “But we gave them one telephone number and then managed the routing to all those bits of equipment across the council areas.” Hotel giant Andras House – which operates seven hotels and , rooms in Belfast including the Crowne Plaza at Shaw’s Bridge and the new Hampton Hilton – is also another major customer. “Businesses trust us to be able to provide the engineering solutions in order for them to run their companies,” David says. So, why should a business consider Clarity Telecom for its crucial and comprehensive connectivity needs  David says Clarity is all about improving how companies interact with their customers – making it easier, and thus, improving revenue and sales. “As you manage your telephone connections you become better at dealing with your customers – you become more efficient at dealing with them, and they will have a better experience. It’s about improving customer contact. “As a business you are able to do a lot more, such as listening to call recordings, access to statistics and using data which will help manage that contact, as well as saving on costs and making your business more efficient. “What solution depends on your business. That is where we come along. We never put a system in without doing a full engineering visit.” Some of the connectivity includes the ability to connect landline with mobile phones, call forwarding and being able to access voicemails as digital recordings, by phone or computer. “When companies deal with us, they can come along and say ‘this is what we are trying to do’, and we are able to work the engineering and infrastructure, before then providing the services,” David says. “It’s also about fighting against the view that it’s all about price. Yes, you have to be competitive, but you need the right infrastructure. For example,a shop loses connectivity for two days, then they lose two days of sales, simply because they don’t have the back-up for the credit card payment system. “It’s about getting businesses to think about the infrastructure and all of the issues. It’s not just about how cheap you can make a call. It’s about how customers can engage with your business – and we are at the heart of making that happen.” For further information, contact Clarity Telecom on    or visit www.clarityteleView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/greggssss.jpg","title":"greggs to open new belfast city centre store","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by John Mulgrew Greggs looks set to open a new store in the heart of Belfast city centre, it can be revealed.

Trade NI – the new alliance between Hospitality Ulster, Manufacturing NI and Retail NI – is unveiling a -year plan called ‘Vision ’ at a Westminster reception on Wednesday afternoon, as the UK’s political system enters its most volatile period in a generation.

In a joint statement, Trade NIs Colin Neill , Stephen Kellyand Glyn Roberts , said: “Northern Ireland is facing a huge challenge as it struggles politically and economically with a growth forecast of around % or below. This is simply not good enough and we can’t sit idly by and let events overtake us. We must break the cycle of limited economic growth.” “Our three organisations represent most of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland. Therefore, a louder voice needs to be heard on their behalf so that they don’t suffer in the wake of the local political issues. We want a reboot of the economic policy of Northern Ireland, in order to benefit our economy and safeguard our growing business community.” “We need to be bold and ambitious about creating % or even % growth over the next few years, but that requires decision makers to be pressed into action and a series of policy and legislative decisions to be taken and driven through. Our local economy and businesses have taken a back seat and we simply cannot afford that situation any longer.” “Our Vision  document sets out a bold new ten-year plan for creating , new jobs and creating a high growth economy. We want to make Northern Ireland the best place in the UK and Ireland to shop, socialise, locate and start a business “The Vision  plan sets out to create a better ing business environment and attract further inward investment that will lead to a revitalised economy taking on the challenge in turbulent times.” “We want to make Northern Ireland an eco-system of innovation.Trade NI is keen to work with all business organisations, chambers of commerce, trade unions and voluntary sector representation to create a new progressive partnership for change in Northern Ireland.” And Kevin Kingston, chief executive of Danske Bank, sponsor of Trade NI’s Westminster reception, said: Danske Bank is proud to be one of the main sponsors of Trade NI’s Westminster reception. Trade NI is seizing the initiative and ensuring that the voice of the local business community is being heard loud and clear at a time of upheaval and uncertainty.” “The vibrancy of the Northern Ireland private sector is imperative to the strength of our economy and we need to ensure that local businesses are protected and well positioned to be able to compete globally in the post-Brexit environment.” Emma Gilthorpe, executive director, Heathrow Expansion, said: “Heathrow is delighted to support the launch of Trade NI, echoing Heathrow’s commitment to connect Northern Ireland to global growth and to share the benefits of an expanded Heathrow with the businesses and communities of Northern Ireland.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/dm11.jpg","title":"tech entrepreneur named catalysts innovation founder","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by Ulster Business A top tech entrepreneur has been named as Catalyst’s Innovation Founder for  by a  of leading judges.
