To illustrate this he recalled a maternal great aunt named Gertie once telling him in his youth that ‘your father is not a bad man. He’s just English’.He has also admitted that his mother was worried that as his political career progressed and he met the world’s top leaders he might let the side down with the Queen.Biden first met the monarch as a young senator. Just as he was leaving for the airport to fly to the UK, he recalled in a 2013 speech, his mother phoned him.‘Joey, be polite but do not kiss her ring,’ Biden told his audience she had instructed him, adding, as laughter broke out among listeners: ‘Swear to God.’Mr Biden repeated his mother’s concern about showing undue deference to the Queen in his autobiography, this time recalling: ‘When I told my mother I was going to have an audience with the Queen of England, the first thing she said was: “Don’t you bow down to her.” He went on: ‘ “Remember Joey,” she’d say, “you’re a Biden. Nobody is better than you.” ’Painting his mother’s defiance as one of spirited refusal to kowtow to power rather than a hatred of the British, Mr Biden also said she’d told him not to be obsequious to the Pope either when he met him.However, it’s difficult to imagine Mrs Biden — a staunch Roman Catholic — reacting so violently to the idea of sleeping in His Holiness’s former hotel bed as she reportedly did over the Queen.Described by genealogist Megan Smolenyak (who investigated Mr Biden’s roots) as ‘quintessential Irish-American’, Jean’s father, Ambrose, was a newspaper librarian while her mother was the daughter of a state senator.Mr Biden has recalled how while at a grammar school run by nuns, one of them had once mocked his stuttering. His mother — just 5 ft 1 in — stormed into the school and told the nun: ‘If you ever speak to my son like that again, I’ll come back and rip that bonnet off your head.’ The Queen may have got off lightly."},{"url":null,"title":"Prince Harry leaves Meghan home attend Super Bowl cousin Princess Eugenie","story":"Share this articleCorsets are no longer just a sexy lingerie staple they\u0026#39ve been championed by many famous faces to become an everyday piece we should all have in our wardrobes.Katy Perry is proving they can easily be dressed up with a little jewellery thanks to stylist Tatiana Waterford.Her structured khaki corset with contrasting black panels, square neckline and contrast stitching is by Stella McCartney.

We continue to follow government guidelines.” Camilla, 74, is triple vaccinated, sources said. She carried out a string of engagements last Thursday – the day the Prince of Wales tested positive for Covid-19 for a second time. The vehicles were barred from the city. Police directed them to a parking place on the outskirts of Brussels, from where protesters continued on foot to a square in the city centre and the area housing European Union institutions. Reuters reporters saw around 150-200 protesters in the city centre and a similar number in the European quarter. Brussels mayor Philippe Close said.told Belgian LN24 television the protest, inspired by “Freedom Convoy” demonstrators who have gridlocked the Canadian capital with trucks, had no permit from the Brussels authorities, no leader and had made no demands. Philippe, a French protester from the city of Valenciennes who had earlier protested in Paris, told reporters pandemic restrictions were only part of his problems. “I came particularly for our children’s future. I don’t see how my children can live in the world as it is now. Freedom is swept aside, there’s more and more poverty. Even when you work, when the 15th of the month comes round, you haven’t got enough to live on,” he said. He said he was also protesting against the rise in energy prices and the cost of living. A protest convoy breached police defences and drove into central Paris on Saturday, snarling traffic around the Arc de Triomphe and on the Champs Elysees.The former ambassador to Nepal, Richard Morris, worked long hours under high pressure, helping co-ordinate briefings to ministers at a time when the UK was battling the fierce first wave of coronavirus. On Monday, his widow fought back tears as she told an inquest he had been “totally unprotected” from the demands of the Covid taskforce. Alison Morris said her husband feared there was not enough time to process information in the fast-moving period and if any information error got past him the Government “would be torn apart in the press”. The inquest continuesThe announcement by Clarence House follows that made on Thursday disclosing Prince Charles, 73, had tested positive for the virus. The duchess, 74, carried out a string of engagements on the same day. Concern for the Queen’s health mounted after it emerged the monarch had been in direct contact with Charles two days before he tested positive. Buckingham Palace said on Thursday that the Queen was not displaying any symptoms, but refused to confirm whether she had tested positive or negative, citing medical privacy. The 95-year-old spent time with Charles last Tuesday, when the prince was carrying out an investiture on her behalf at her Windsor Castle home. The evening before his positive test result, Charles and Camilla had met the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and others at a reception at the British Museum. Germany’s Bundestag was originally due to debate motions in favour and against mandatory vaccinations this week, after the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, indicated he considers such a step necessary to cope with a possible resurgence of the virus in the next few months. But the timetable that was meant to see a mandate would be passed in March has already begun to slip, as a Free Democratic party (FDP) politician said his third-way motion proposing mandatory vaccinations for those aged 50 and over would be submitted with a delay. The three motions may not get their second and third reading until the end of March, when Germany’s high infection rates are forecast to be on a downward curve and the government is preparing to loosen restrictions on social gatherings and access to nonessential shops, according to reports in German media on Monday. National and state leaders are set to discuss the opening-up plan on Wednesday, as Germany’s disease control agency reported 6,465 new cases in the last 24 hours, the second consecutive day of declining incidence rates. The OxVent machine costs £1,850 to produce, compared with an average of £22,000 for a model used in the NHS. It was developed by doctors and engineers at Oxford University and King’s College London and has now been certified as compliant with medical regulations. The designs and manufacturing systems will be transferred to low and middle-income countries that cannot afford current ventilators. Prof Sebastien Ourselin, head of school of biomedical engineering and imaging sciences at King’s College London and non-executive director at OxVent Ltd, said:  Last week, the couple had informed Bologna’s Sant’Orsola hospital that they were “adamant that our child will only get unvaccinated blood.” The hospital replied to the request with a note, saying “the surgery cannot be postponed” and that it was “necessary to proceed urgently given the severity of the boy’s pathology.” A judge eventually turned down the parents’ appeal, citing that there were “guarantees of absolute safety in using blood from vaccinated donors.” The parents’ lawyer told Italy’s news agency ANSA that the couple had requested non-vaccinated blood for “religious reasons.” Over the weekend a court in Bologna stripped the couple of their parenting rights and the local social services were appointed legal s of the child.Hundreds of vehicles taking part in France’s so-called freedom convoy were heading for Brussels on Monday, despite warnings they would be prevented from entering the Belgian capital. The protest against Covid restrictions and high energy prices shifted its focus to the symbolic heart of the EU after police prevented most of the estimated 3,000 vehicles from entering Paris at the weekend. About 100 managed to get past the police and converged on the Champs Élysées, where they were eventually dispersed with teargas on Saturday evening. Belgian police said they had deployed forces along several motorways and stopped about 30 vehicles heading for the capital. The mayor of the city of Brussels, Philippe Close, said police were directing vehicles to a parking and rest area just outside the city, capable of accepting up to 10,000 vehicles, and warned demonstrators this was the only place they would be allowed to converge and protest. He said protesters might be allowed to enter Brussels on foot, but they would not be allowed to “take the capital hostage”. The Brussels authorities have banned any demonstrations in the city on Monday. One of the world’s major garment makers, Vietnam reported more than 26,000 infections on Sunday – about double the peak last year, when factories supplying brands such as Nike, Zara, Apple and Samsung were closed for months. “The risk of widespread lockdowns is very low this year as Vietnam has successfully carried out its Covid-19 vaccination campaign,” Dang Duc Anh, director of the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology, told Reuters. On Sunday, the government announced it will remove its Covid-19 restrictions on international passenger flights from 15 February with no limitation on the number of flights.Camilla had continued with her programme of engagements at the end of the week as she continued to test negative for the virus. She described herself as “luckily” negative on Thursday and said she had been tested “so many times”.  It is the first time the duchess has caught Covid-19, while Prince Charles has the virus for a second time."},{"url":null,"title":"inflation nation 15 ways to save money","story":"For many Irish households the cost of groceries is second only to a mortgage or rentThere’s been some talk of rising prices and shopping around of late and Pricewatch can’t help feel a bit miffed at the casual fashion some folk have invaded our territory. But we will leave our grievances at the top of the page and continue to plough our lonely little furrow. With many Irish homes already to the pin of their collar when it comes to making savings – and have done all the shopping around they can do – there are still savings on the table for others. Here are just some of them.Food for thoughtThe hikes: For many Irish households the cost of groceries is second only to a mortgage or rent – although for those homes where childcare is a requirement, food will most likely come in a distant third. If a total of €150 is spent in supermarkets each week, the annual spend comes in at just under eight grand – a figure which does not allow for any class of Christmas blowout or deviation from normal spending patterns. Official figures from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) suggest food inflation has been modest so far this year – although increasing alarmingly fast in some areas – and the latest data from retail analysts Kantar suggests that grocery prices have climbed by 1.7 per cent over the last 12 months. People coming out of supermarkets are counting the real cost of the spike and it seems to be substantially more than 1.7 per cent. If a typical house spends just €15 more each week over the next year than they did in 2021, they will see their shopping bills climb by €780 between now and next February. Is there anything to be done?The tips: 1. You have to be a supermarket ninja and only buy why you need. Do not let yourself be swept off your feet by the two-for-one or buy-one-get-one-free offers dangled before you as you go up and down the aisle.2. Before you walk through the supermarket doors do your homework. Survey what you have in your cupboards and your freezer and then make a list based on that and what you plan to eat for the next seven days. Email the list to yourself, then paste it into your notes app and then as each item is added to your trolley or basket delete it from the note. Buy nothing else. Trust us this works.3. Never shop hungry. We have said it before and we will say it again. A hungry shopper is never ninja-like.4. Experiment more with own-brand products. While we have increased the percentage of generic supermarket shopping from less than 10 per cent little over a decade ago, to around 40 per cent today, we are still a long way adrift of other countries. Making some smart switches could handily see the cost of your weekly shop fall by 20 per cent. Not all of it is great – we’re looking at you cornflakes and cola – but there will be things on the shelves that are not branded which are as good – if not better – than familiar brands you throw in your trolley without thinking. Own-brand Mayonnaise in Tesco, for instance, costs €2.60 per litre while a more familiar brand of the same product sells on the same shelf for €5 a litre.The savings: Even if you manage to shave just 5 per cent off your annual grocery shopping bill you could handily save yourself hundreds of euro between now and next February.The hikes: The cost of heating and lighting our homes has climbed dramatically since this time last year with all the main companies rolling out multiple price hikes, blaming soaring prices of fossil fuels on global markets. The upshot is most households will be paying around €700 to €800 more for their gas and electricity this year with the story even more bleak for those who are with some of the smaller suppliers who have imposed price hikes that will add over €1,300 to their customers’ annual bills.The tips: 1. While every company has increased their prices, every company offers substantial discounts – sometimes of over 30 per cent – to new customers. So be that new customer. Moving provider is easy and – unlike switching cornflakes or cola – the end product is identical with the only difference being price. Get copies of your most recent gas or electricity bill, or both if you’re a dual fuel customer. Note your Gas Point Reference Number (GPRN) or Meter Point Reference Number (MPRN) and take a current gas andor electricity meter reading, so your old supplier can provide you with a final bill and your new supplier can start from that point. Then make the call. You will be on hold for some time but if you can save €500 it will be worth it.2. We are not suggesting you turn off your heat, although the grim reality is that many people have no choice but to do that. But were you to turn the thermostat down by one degree you would reduce your heating energy consumption by up to 10 per cent which might save you €100.3. Cooking more than one thing at a time makes your oven more efficient and resist opening the oven door while cooking, as 20 per cent of the heat escapes each time. Put lids on pots boiling on the stove and always turn down the heat when water starts to boil.4. Do not leave electrical items on standby and look at ways to make your home cosier by plugging gaps – we’re not talking about retrofitting here because, while it makes sense in the long term, in the short term it can be very pricey indeed, even with any grants that are on the table. Try and get your hands on a home energy savings kit from your local library. It allows you to easily gauge how much energy you actually use and work out when your heat is going.The savings: The big switch is where the big savings are to be found but the other steps can make a small difference too.The hikes:  According to the CSO petrol prices have climbed 32 per cent over the last year, while diesel prices have gone by 36 per cent. Many motorists will have experienced that unpleasant sensation of watching as the fuel pump price gauge tips over into three digits before the decimal point. The price of fuel fluctuates from forecourt to forecourt but a rise of close to 50 cent per litre is pretty typical. When spread out over a full 12 months, increases of that level are going to cost motorists a lot of money. How much? The average Irish motorist drives around 16,000km a year so based on pump prices last year, that annual cost of petrol was €1,550. Based on today’s prices, fuel costs, when spread over the next 12 months, will be €2,258. Keen students of maths will have already worked out that this represents an increase of €708 when compared to just one year ago. That is not all. The cost of using Ireland’s toll roads a has gone up by 10 cent so if you use pass through them on the way to and from work five days a week for 46 weeks a year you will be down a further €46.The tips:  1. The best way to save money when it comes to cars is not to use them. If you could reduce the amount of time you used your car by 20 per cent – by walking or cycling maybe – then you will knock €220 off your annual costs.2. Knocking even 5 cent off the price you pay for fuel, meanwhile will save you another €60 over the course of a year. And how might you do that? First get out of the habit of throwing €20 or €40 worth of fuel into your car or filling it. Instead buy a set number of litres, which will make you aware of the price gaps between forecourts. Check out pumps.ie for prices, in your neighbourhood.3. You can also save a surprising amount of money by changing the way you drive. Do not over-rev your engine, drive in the right gear and keep your boot empty. Keep tyres at the right pressure, get the car serviced, do not use air conditioning and remove roof racks. Do all this and you will save a further €100.The hikes:  The price of a pint is on the way up – and a 20 cent increase will see a person who drinks five scoops a week worse off by more than €50 over the course of the next 12 months. Sky increased the cost of its TV packages by 3.4 per cent in recent weeks, while last year Netflix announced a 13 per cent price hike to its premium package while Disney+ announced a 29 per cent price hike to its service. If you have both of these plans you will be paying €324 a year, up €48 on last year. GoMo has increased the price of its sim-only deal by over 15 per cent to €14.99 a month for new customers while Eir implemented a €6 a month increase to many of its broadband and phone plans back. In an odd move Three has said that it plans to increase the monthly charge on its billpay plans by 4.5 per cent every year, starting in April while Vodafone is to increase prices by the rate of inflation plus 3 per cent every year, starting in April too.The tips: 1. By auditing your streaming services and subscriptions you might be able to save a few bob. The good news is such an audit is neither as tedious or as difficult as it once might have been and technology is now your friend. Go through your bank statement online looking for all payments to online services. Work out which ones you use and which ones you do not – if you have not used a service even once in the last month cancel it.2. Sometimes the easiest way to make savings is to make a fuss. If you are getting your broadband and television from Company A then call then and threaten to leave. There is a very good chance they will offer you some class of financial incentive to stay with them. And if they do not then leave.The hikes: Health care inflation is likely to surpass the rate of general inflation this year, which means many people with private health insurance are likely to face more hikes as the year progresses. With the cost of visiting a GP around €70 and the pries of some products in pharmacies also on the way up, people who become ill will likely see a hit in their wallet too over the course of the next year.The tips: 1. For more than two million private health insurance is a luxury they cannot afford. And many of those who do have it are paying too much. If your renewal is coming up, call your insurer and ask for all the comparable plans to the one you have that cost less and use the Health Insurance Authority website to make comparisons (hia.ie) between your provider and others on the market. You might be able to save yourself hundreds of euro with just a couple of hours work.2. Make sure to claim the tax relief on the cost of health expenses. There is 20 per cent tax back on the table for health and medical expenses and non-routine dental expenses."},{"url":null,"title":"college","story":"Options to consider \u0026ndash and reasons to be cheerful \u0026ndash when selecting your move after the examJunior Cycle and Leaving Cert exams to commence on Wednesday, June 8thThe fairness of some aspects of the college application system is open to questionMinister for Education confirms move for Leaving Cert and Junior Cert studentsSudden shift to pre-pandemic standards is not expected, says Department of EducationYou need to register now to apply for college through the CAO, but you have until July 1st to make a final decision on your course choiceCAO 2022: Most applicants get an outcome which enables them to successfully progress to the next stage of their educational journeyFrom nursing to engineering and environmental studies, there\u0026rsquos plenty of choiceThe Higher Education Access Route and Disability Access Route to Education schemes offer equitable access to higher education."},{"url":null,"title":"weather alerts issued with storm dudley and storm eunice set to bring strong winds","story":"A combination of winds and high tides is expected to lead to some coastal flooding in parts.

Met Éireann predicted some coastal flooding in those areas.Met Éireann meteorologist Emer Flood on Monday said: “It’s been a fairly quiet year so far but that’s all going to change this week as an active jet stream steers several low-pressure systems across Ireland and the UK.”Areas in the north and northwest of the country would experience strong winds, large waves and coastal flooding on Wednesday, said Ms Flood. “As Storm Dudley clears eastwards on Thursday morning winds will ease for a time, before picking up again on Friday morning as Storm Eunice approaches. We’re keeping a close eye on this Storm as there is the potential for more widespread strong winds across Ireland which may lead to some disruption and damage.” Along with strong winds, Eunice is expected to bring heavy rain and potentially some snow, according to the meteorologist. Further weather warnings are expected to be issued in the coming days.In Northern Ireland, the UK Met Office has issued an amber wind warning for Antrim and Derry, valid from Wednesday at 6pm until Thursday at 9am.

If the results were replicated in the Stormont election in 11 weeks’ time, it would put Michelle O’Neill on course to become First Minister, although neither of the main unionist parties have yet indicated if they would nominate for the role of deputy first minister in the event of Sinn Féin becoming the largest party.The poll also shows that little more than one in 10 unionists regard the Northern Ireland Protocol as the most important issue in the election.Just 6.7 per cent of all respondents said the post-Brexit trade arrangements were their biggest concern, with unionists (11.7 per cent) roughly four times more likely to regard it as the most important issue compared to nationalists (3 per cent).The DUP withdrew Paul Givan as first minister in protest at the protocol and have demanded that the UK government scrap the Irish Sea Border.But the opinion poll indicates that health is a bigger priority among unionists with 29.6 per cent indicating it was their biggest concern, while 22.9 per cent said the economy and 17 per cent cited Covid recovery as the highest priority.Nationalists polled also regard health (41.5 per cent), the economy (22.5 per cent) and Covid recovery (11.9 per cent) as the most important issues.The poll also shows that one in five voters do not know who they will vote for at the Assembly elections and 11.9 per cent of those surveyed said they will not vote.The Institute of Irish Studies director, Professor Peter Shirlow, told the Irish News: “The majority of those who are as yet undecided are either unionists or in the middle ground, which suggests they have been influenced by recent events.“The survey began amid the fallout from (Ulster Unionist leader) Doug Beattie’s Twitter controversy and continued through Paul Givan’s resignation — it’s very possible these two factors had a bearing on people’s hesitancy.”Prof Shirlow said the proportion of nationalists who had yet to make up their mind was comparatively small.“We know that this group of undecideds tends to be pro-union and socially liberal, so it would appear to be a battle between the middle ground and elements of political unionism for that vote.”The Institute of Irish Studies University of Liverpool study in conjunction with The Irish News was conducted by Social Market Research Belfast from a sample of 1,002 people between January 25th and February 7th.

Photograph: Barry CroninAFP via Getty Images I was in an Uber on Broadway in New York City when suddenly the world began violently shaking. A van had rammed the Uber. I was stunned, but I was also determined not to miss this semester’s first day of in-person classes at Columbia University, where I’m studying for a master’s in English literature. I gave the driver my information and ran to class. When I got there, I tried to breathe slowly and assess the damage. Was my brain functioning okay? The words in the book before me were swimming past incomprehensibly. “Ineluctable modality of the visible.” “Limits of the diaphane in. Why in? Diaphane, adiaphane.” “Morose delectation Aquinas tunbelly calls this, frate porcospino. Unfallen Adam rode and not rutted. Call away let him: thy quarrons dainty is. Language no whit worse than his. Monkwords, marybeads jabber on their girdles: roguewords, tough nuggets patter in their pockets.”Did I have a concussion, or was it just that I was reading Ulysses? On this centenary of James Joyce’s colossus, we can borrow a thought from WB Yeats’s poem The Fascination of What’s Difficult: Is Ulysses hard because it’s great, or do people assume it’s great because it’s hard? “It’s hard because Joyce put a lot in there,” Dan Mulhall, the Irish ambassador to the United States, told me. “A lot of people are drawn to the novel because of its complexity and derive a lifelong satisfaction from delving into it more deeply. It’s like Wordle for serious readers.”Mulhall has taken Ulysses as his travelling companion around the world, using it for creative diplomacy. He has blogged all 18 episodes on the embassy website, and he marked the 100th birthday with a new book called Ulysses: A Reader’s Odyssey.The epic is often compared to Seinfeld, because not all that much happens. It certainly doesn’t have the action of The Odyssey, upon which it is patterned. But it does boast, as Merve Emre wrote in the New Yorker, “a cultural literacy presented as godlike in its extent”.Colm Tóibín, the renowned Irish writer who teaches my class, wrote in rhe Financial Times about the book: “For the ordinary reader, it has the same cachet as running a marathon does for the ordinary athlete,” he said. “It is a challenge and then, for those who have read the book, a matter of pride.”“Ulysses,’” he added, “in all its generosity of style, its plenitude, the open sensuality of its characters, its lack of piety and respect for authority, its placing of a freethinking cosmopolitan Jewish man at its centre, can be read as a contribution to the Irish argument, the tone of the book as a blueprint for what Irish life might be like after independence.”Era of gobbledygookSmall moments, Tóibín said, “glitter and shimmer” because of Joyce’s wild flights of language. I bought a copy in Dublin long ago. But I had never mustered the will to read the story of love, desire and disconnectedness played out on Dublin strolls on a single day, June 16th, 1904 – the entwined stream-of-consciousness sagas of Stephen Dedalus and Molly and Leopold Bloom – until now.You’d think I would be accustomed to deciphering the incomprehensible after the past five years in DC. Donald Trump’s upside-down utterances. Kevin McCarthy’s demented backtracking. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s inanity, accusing Nancy Pelosi of siccing her “gazpacho police” on lawmakers. This era of gobbledygook has also featured the Republican National Committee issuing a resolution that the barbaric attack on the Capitol was “legitimate political discourse”. This was so outrageous that Mitt Romney had to brush back the chair of the RNC, his niece Ronna Romney McDaniel. Aside from Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, most everything the Republicans do is cowardly they are so afraid of the Trumpsters supporting the vandals that they tried to legitimise illegitimate discourse by calling it legitimate discourse. Shameful.And there’s the government’s indecipherable instructions on Covid-19 – crystallised in the ill-advised picture of Stacey Abrams trying to have it both ways, sitting and smiling, without a mask, in front of masked schoolchildren. The only thing that can save President Joe Biden and the Democrats now is Republicans showing how fringy and far out they’ve got. You know when Mitch McConnell is the guy calling out his own party that many top Republicans are freaking out. McConnell needs to get candidates to win in states that Biden won, like New Hampshire and Pennsylvania. That will be hard, given that we’re watching a party go nuts in real time. Their quarrons dainty are not. The latest Trump embarrassment came when Axios reported that the New York Times’s Maggie Haberman writes in her new book, Confidence Man, that White House residence staff members believed that Trump had wadded up papers found in a toilet. So the former president has a bathroom fixation. (HG Wells said Joyce, who could be graphic about bodily functions, had “a cloacal obsession”.)Nixon had the plumbers. Trump’s the one who needed them.

The scale of things that we\u0027re finding is reflective of that complicated story.The discovery of the First World War training round tallies with the Tower of London being a focal point of combat from 1914 to 1918.Soldiers were garrisoned there awaiting deployment at the start of the war and trained to use guns, while weapons were kept in storehouses within the tower.The tower was also used to contain people who posed a serious threat to national security, with 11 spies executed there.The French jetton, inscribed with the fleur-de-lis, is thought to have been made in Paris.While it is not uncommon to find English jettons, French ones are particularly rare. The find demonstrates how the Tower of London was a focal point of international travel.During the Tudor age, the tower was the most important state prison in the country and gained a reputation for being inescapable. The buckle found by excavators may have belonged to one of the guards.In 1977, at the Silver Jubilee, the moat was used for a garden display. In 2014, to mark the centenary of the start of the First World War, it was filled with 800,000 ceramic poppies in a moving commemoration.Visitors will be welcomed to the moat between June and September this year to see the Superbloom. Historic Royal Palaces plans to host smaller floral Jubilee displays across its other sites, including at Hampton Court Palace, Kensington Palace and Hillsborough Castle.Tom O’Leary, public engagement director at Historic Royal Palaces, said: We hope that this thriving new landscape, surrounding London’s formidable fortress, will celebrate the power of nature to unite us all.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Boris Johnson pledges to say \u0026#39a lot more\u0026#39 on \u0026#39partygate\u0026#39 row after police investigationRussia-Ukraine crisis: Moscow says there is a \u0026#39chance\u0026#39 for progress on talks to avoid conflictUK weather: Storm Dudley could bring 90mph gusts and heavy rainRussia-Ukraine crisis: Join our webinar and put your questions to  journalistsCaroline Flack\u0026#39s mother sparks reinvestigation of police complaintMiddle class, white Christians were most at risk from Covid during third waveMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"eus darkest hour","story":"As Russian forces continued to build along the Ukrainian border last month, Netflix released one of its most popular movies to date – Munich: The Edge of War. The film is set in 1938 as German troops prepare to attack the Sudetenland while Chamberlain and other European leaders negotiate away Czechoslovakia’s sovereignty. Today, it’s almost as if President Macron is reading from Chamberlain’s script. Since his meeting last week with Putin, he’s been pressing Ukraine to implement the Minsk accords, brokered by France and Germany in 2015 as Russian forces and their proxies fought in eastern Ukraine.The imposition of the Minsk accords would see an end to Kyiv’s sovereignty. They would give Russia a say in running the country and its foreign policy and hand seats in parliament to Moscow’s proxies. A few days ago Putin made clear exactly what he wants, telling Ukraine, with undertones of a necrophilia: “Like it or not, you’ll have to tolerate it, my beauty”.It is extraordinary that Macron, whose country now holds the EU Council presidency, should entertain such gunpoint bartering of a democratic nation’s integrity. He has a track record of failed conciliations with Russia and has recently suggested there is “legitimacy” in the Kremlin’s concerns over a putative threat from Nato. It must be obvious to him that Putin will not be mollified by such appeasement and that even if President Zelenskiy were to accede to Minsk it would not end there. But Macron has elections in April and perhaps believes that a Chamberlain style proclamation of peace for our time might secure victory for him.Germany too has looked happy to go along with this “grand bargain”. That is no surprise from a government that has blocked another Nato member from supplying defensive arms to Kyiv and is desperate to placate Putin, having allowed an increasing dependence on Russian energy supplies. The Nordstream 2 gas pipeline is designed to bypass Ukraine, removing the only bargaining chip against Russia in Kyiv’s hands. While some have proposed the pipeline\u0027s termination if Russia invades, Chancellor Scholz has been reluctant to express such a warning, falling back on the unsustainable excuse that it is a “privately managed commercial project”. Germany has also poured cold water on the idea of cutting Russia out of the Swift banking system, which would be a powerful deterrent, threatening to hit its economy hard.As the going gets tough in the East, where have the three EU presidents been? Usually eager to grandstand in the face of global events, they have been remarkably quiet since Putin mobilised in November. Josep Borrell, the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, has spoken of European unity over this crisis as well as “serious consequences” and “massive costs” in the event of Russian aggression. Does he think we haven’t noticed Brussels’s failure to respond to years of Russian-sponsored violence against Ukraine?The EU, a recipient of the 2012 Nobel Prize for maintaining peace in Europe, seeks eastward expansion and loves the trappings of a superpower yet has no appetite for self defence or even to present realistic options to deter or punish aggression on its doorstep. The idea of “strategic autonomy” and the longed-for EU army are laughable. But there is no laughter among member states in eastern or northern Europe. Macron’s proposal of an as yet unspecified new European security architecture independent of the US, his need for a diplomatic process distinct from Washington’s and his open contempt for “brain dead” Nato alarms them. For eastern European states know that ultimately, America alone guarantees their security while the EU compromises it – and that America\u0027s readiness to underwrite defence in Europe will be worn down by continued unwillingness of Europeans to confront their own enemies.This time of appeasement, silence, impotence and disunity in the face of one of the largest aggressive troop concentrations in Europe since the Second World War is perhaps the EU’s darkest hour. Putin may or may not invade in the coming weeks or months, but one thing is for sure: he will not be deterred from doing so by Brussels. Even Borrell admits that for Russia, the EU “doesn’t exist or is not relevant.” Borrell and his fellow EU elites may think that if war comes to Ukraine, they will be protected. But the war would come to them as well, bringing the greatest crisis they have yet faced, with estimates of up to five million refugees fleeing westwards from Ukraine.Colonel Richard Kemp is a former infantry commander and chairman of the Cobra Intelligence GroupMore from NewsPolitics latest news: Boris Johnson pledges to say \u0026#39a lot more\u0026#39 on \u0026#39partygate\u0026#39 row after police investigationRussia-Ukraine crisis: Moscow says there is a \u0026#39chance\u0026#39 for progress on talks to avoid conflictUK weather: Storm Dudley could bring 90mph gusts and heavy rainRussia-Ukraine crisis: Join our webinar and put your questions to  journalistsCaroline Flack\u0026#39s mother sparks reinvestigation of police complaintMiddle class, white Christians were most at risk from Covid during third waveMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"queen has never put foot wrong","story":"Her Majesty The Queen acceded to the Throne seventy years ago, on the death of her father King George VI. He had not expected to come to the throne and indeed did so only because his elder brother, Edward the Eighth, had renounced it in 1936 to marry the doubly-orced American woman, Mrs Wallis Simpson. I remember celebrating her coronation at Royal Air Force North Weald (where I served on 604 Squadron) at a dinner in the Officers’ Mess when only champagne was served, leaving us with little appetite for flying the next day.In all the years since, she has been impeccable. Whilst I was Chairman of the Conservative Party, I also served as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. Since the Monarch is also Duke of Lancaster (which is territorially approximate to the present day County of Lancashire) I saw how well Her Majesty understood all aspects of that Duchy. Wisely, she did not oppose the marriage of the Prince of Wales to Camilla Parker-Bowles and approved the grant to her of the title Duchess of Cornwall. On the succession of Prince Charles to the throne, Camilla will be given the title of Queen Consort. On that topic, I was concerned to read that the Prince of Wale had tested positive for Covid, followed by Camilla, and can only hope that it will not be passed on to the Queen.Despite all the efforts of many Conservative backbenchers to oust Boris Johnson from No 10, I suspect that unless the politan Police bring charges that Boris Johnson broke the criminal law itself and not just Covid advice, he will hang on, at least until the local elections in May.That prediction is of course complicated by the enforced resignation of Cressida Dick, the Commissioner of politan Police. She will have to stay on pending the appointment of her successor. A letter from Mr David Pascall, published in The  last Thursday, sets out the grotesque muddle which the Prime Minister’s lack of managerial skills has created in Downing Street.Mr Pascall wrote that he was “amazed to read that there are now 400 staff in Downing Street” and goes on to say that in Thatcher’s day he was one of but seven, alongside Alan Walters (economics) and Alan Parsons (foreign affairs). There was also the principal private secretary and four other private secretaries about four in the press office under Bernard Ingham two in the political office another four in the honours section Ten garden girls and four or five members of security and police.There was no chief of staff or director of communications. The principal private secretary was in charge, and small flexible groups – at times in the company of the PM – were the most efficient way to discuss issues and crises and come to immediate conclusions.Mr Pascall went on to recall that, in those days, the Policy Unit had direct links to ministers and of them, there was but one civil servant, David Willetts. What a contrast with Boris Johnson\u0027s operation. He now has a Cabinet Minister for “Levelling Up” and a Department to go with him. But does that Minister have authority to instruct the Secretary of State for Education the Secretaries to “Level Up” in schools?Whoever does succeed Boris Johnson as Prime Minister, when that time comes, will have little time for parties in the garden there as heshe sets about creating a rational structure of Government.There are some things that need not wait for change at the top. Home Secretary Priti Patel should act to improve our police services which are too often in the headlines for all the wrong reasons. Lord Herbert of South Downs, who established the College of Policing a decade ago, has suggested that the police “need a Sandhurst-style academy to tackle troubling culture”. He is right, but it needs not just a building, but the adoption of the ethos of Sandhurst and that of the leadership of the Army.Nor is it only the police service which could learn from Sandhurst and the Army. As I have argued before, so too could our National Health Service. Not all of our hospitals are badly managed. Indeed I have been very well treated at my local hospital, but a clear out of those overpaid bureaucrats in the upper ranks of the NHS would save money which could be spent on doctors, nurses and ancillary front line staff.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Boris Johnson pledges to say \u0026#39a lot more\u0026#39 on \u0026#39partygate\u0026#39 row after police investigationRussia-Ukraine crisis: Moscow says there is a \u0026#39chance\u0026#39 for progress on talks to avoid conflictUK weather: Storm Dudley could bring 90mph gusts and heavy rainRussia-Ukraine crisis: Join our webinar and put your questions to  journalistsCaroline Flack\u0026#39s mother sparks reinvestigation of police complaintMiddle class, white Christians were most at risk from Covid during third waveMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"raf deputy chief suspended flashing neighbours garden","story":"The RAF’s deputy chief has been suspended after neighbours complained to police that he had flashed his bottom at them from his garden.Air Marshal Andrew Turner, 54, wrote to the family last week apologising for an incident that he said caused “absolutely unintentional upset”.The neighbour, Simon Herbert, 54, said he was “astonished” to see Air Marshal Turner naked in the paddock of his £1.5 million cottage in Cane End, Oxfordshire.He said that his partner, Leslie Stevens, 52, and her 18-year-old daughter felt “really upset” by the incident in August last year.Mr Herbert said he was initially concerned for his neighbour’s wellbeing, but subsequently complained to Thames Valley police after confronting his neighbour, yet no charges were brought against him. Air Marshal Turner, a former special forces commander, is one of just two air marshals, standing in rank just below Air Chief Marshal Sir Mike Wigston.He was suspended two weeks ago after he informed his senior officer of the investigation, meanwhile commanders were told that he had “stepped back over a personal matter”.An RAF source told the  that “discussions were being held” over Air Marshal Turner’s future within the military. They questioned whether it was “appropriate behaviour from someone in the military”.Mr Herbert, who runs an animal sanctuary on his property, said Air Marshal Turner was still trying to “duck responsibility”. Commenting on the incident, he said: “As I approached, I could see his face as he turned towards me and had a look of shock or surprise. He just turned away from me and started walking slowly back up his paddock towards his house and garden.”A solicitor for Air Marshal Turner said the claims were inaccurate and “vexatious”.An RAF spokesman said: “We are aware of a matter involving a RAF Officer, which has been subject to a police investigation.

Certainly, some might view the Defence Secretary\u0027s comparison as offensive – particularly our Nato allies, who he appeared to suggest are as naive about the chances of a lasting settlement with Vladimir Putin as were the negotiators in Munich in 1938. Ukraine\u0027s ambassador to the UK criticised Mr Wallace, too, saying it\u0027s not the best time for us to offend our partners.In Mr Wallace\u0027s comparison, Ukraine would play the part of Czechoslovakia, which not only lost the Sudetenland in 1938 but which was swallowed up by Germany and its client state Slovakia in 1939.But was Mr Wallace really so wrong? For one thing, there is a plan for appeasement on the table – and it has been promoted by Emmanuel Macron, the French president. He appeared to be seeking a grand bargain with Mr Putin in Moscow last week. One that Ukrainian politicians said would have resulted in their country losing its sovereignty. There was even a sense that Ukraine could be excluded from deliberations on its future, just as the Czechs were excluded from the discussions with Hitler in Munich.There is, of course, a reason appeasement might be contemplated in the first place. In 1938, there was a general view that the Western powers were not ready to fight a war with Hitler. Some historians argue that the Munich agreement was justified, because it bought time for the Allies to rearm. In any case, it allowed conflict to be postponed. This time, the Western powers are similarly unprepared for a fight, even a nonmilitary one. Germany appears to be pathologically incapable of meeting its obligations to Nato and is hooked on Russian gas. It recently sent helmets to Ukraine, while the UK sent anti-tank weapons. The US has been firm, but this is a conflict on Europe\u0027s borders and you do not sense that Joe Biden\u0027s heart is really in a quarrel in a far away country between people of whom we know nothing. And while Britain, Poland and the Baltic States have been robust, even they aren\u0027t contemplating engaging in combat should hostilities break out.Brandon Lewis, the Northern Ireland Secretary, was quick to clarify Mr Wallace\u0027s remarks yesterday. He said that the reference was to the optimism at the time that there may be a diplomatic way through that eventually proved to not be the case. However, Russia\u0027s descent into a state of paranoia and aggression should not be downplayed. If the West capitulates on Ukraine, why not overthrow the Caucasian republics, absorb Moldova and destabilise the Baltics?The comparison is not perfect. Putin is not Hitler, however revolting his regime might be. But this is a test of resolve, and Mr Wallace is correct to point out that compromise in such a context is hazardous.Jeremy Black is a former professor of history at the University of Exeter.

The Governmentaposs levelling up plans have come in for widespread criticism in the North of England when it was published earlier this month. It contains no new funding and  targets, which experts such as Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, have said are highly unlikely to be met . It comes as the Prime Minister is under increasing pressure over rule-busting parties at Downing Street. The Met has sent the premier a legal questionnaire and he has hired a lawyer in a desperate bid to avoid a fixed penalty notice.

After racking her brain to find ways of earning more cash to make ends meet, Tilly decided to do some research into escorting. From there, Tilly decided to try out a new career - and sheaposs never looked back. Over the last nine years, Tilly has worked as a private escort, in massage parlours and in brothels. Tilly, who is gay, told news.au she never had much trouble settling into sex work, because sleeping with men was easy for her. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here Describing how men can climax more easily than women, the Sydney-based worker added having sex with a man was a piece of cake. Although sheaposs now a veteran of the sex industry and can manage clients much better than when she was younger, Tilly admits sheaposs suffered from classic millennial burnout. She added the job has made her far more celibate in her private le, and she only seeks out sex with a proper emotional connection, rather than endless dating or casual sex.  Although she is often getting down and dirty at work, she says most of the sex isnapost good sex but admits sometimes it can be fun. Tilly says her work has never interfered with her personal relationships - mainly because the women she has dated donapost feel threatened by the men she has sex with for work. She claims the only time she butted heads with a partner over her work was when the partner was also working in the sex industry.  If we were working the same sht and I was getting picked by more guys, she would pick a fight with me because she was upset that I was getting picked more than her,” she said. While working in the industry, Tilly has used her social media accounts to try and bust myths about sex work and remove the stigma. She has also released a novel, Nothing But My Body, which is also about a sex worker. But while some aspects of the novel draw upon her own experiences, Tilly is keen to stress the book is a novel rather than a memoir. She said: I wanted the actual topics that the character is interrogating to be romantic love, and mental health, and queer community, and what it means to create a family and friendship and all that kind of stuff. I didn’t actually want sex work to be the problem topic.Do you have a real le story to share  Email jessica.taylor@reachplcShe added the important theme of friendship in the LGBT+ community runs through the book, which she argues is key for queer people who have turned to friends for support when their families havenapost accepted them. Tilly said: “I think that friendship is one of the things that are long-lasting and we need to nurture, rather than a relationship with one person that you exclude everyone  from.”Do you have an interesting story to sell  Email jessica.taylor@reachplc.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON LoveProstitution\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

After years of promising a slimmed-down monarchy when he finally takes the reins, a streamlined coronation is the only way for Prince Charles to prove he means business.In the modern world, the senior royals are acutely aware of the need to prove they are value for money and the weight of this responsibility has weighed heavily on the Prince of Wales. A shorter, cheaper and less ostentatious ceremony at Westminster Abbey, albeit with the rather flamboyant codename Operation Golden Orb, will be welcomed by a public more concerned with the ever-increasing costs of living rather than what insignia will be used on postboxes. Charles might often seem like a man from a bygone era, who may at face value appear less in tune with the modern world than his son William and daughter in law Kate, but those close to him will tell you he cares deeply about the effect he can have on the world around him. As the UK was struggling with record levels of unemployment and spiralling inflation in the s, Prince Charles used his Navy severance pay – £, – to fund a number of community initiatives.  The Prince’s Trust charity has gone on to transform tens of thousands of young people’s lives who would have otherwise been afforded little chance of success. His -year crusade campaigning on the environment, which was so often ridiculed and derided, has also been proved revolutionary in its inception at a time when the type of conversations so commonplace today simply weren’t happening at all.  And another subtle sign that Charles will be doing things a little dferently will be displayed on his coronation day when as the new Supreme Governor of the Church of England, he will declare how he wants to be aposdefender of faithapos not aposthe faithapos. Charles’s time in the top job may end up being a footnote in history compared to the epic record-breaking reign of his mother, but his legacy will undoubtedly reverberate for decades to come.

Abbie Merrett, , and husband David, , had plans to make a £, ground-floor extension, which would feature a sensory room for their severely disabled three-year-old Rory. The sensory room would have provided Rory with vital specialist sleeping and caring facilities at their home. But they have now had to scrap their plans after a builder failed to show.

He then allegedly proceeded to blame fuel shortages, having to attend a funeral and even heavy rain. The -year-old decided to take action in October and emails allegedly show that the builder promised toher cash that day — but then said he could not as he had “phone trouble”.  Four months on, she has still not received the money but has had to pay back the loan she had taken with family.She told The Sun : “It’s been a nightmare, just so upsetting.”She added that Rory had been struggling without a sensory room for this long and that it has left daughter Rozalyn, six, unable to sleep because her brother is crying or upset. A spokesperson from Nottinghamshire Police said: “We are investigating a reported fraud offence and have been liaising with the person affected to gather the necessary evidence.”When approached for comment, the unnamed builder reportedly said he did have the money ready to pay Abbie and that all she needed to do was to reply to his email.A Justgiving page has been set up to help the family pay for the sensory room.

Whether they fell for each other over milk churns or pork chops, or woke up to their feelings after a slap in the face, the threads running through most of our long-term love stories include kindness, tolerance – and a whole lot of laughter...Charles and Anne - wed  yearsA simple notion has underpinned the long marriage of Anne Goody, , and husband Charles, . She says: “I take none of his nonsense and he takes none of mine.” They met at a dance in Dunmow, Essex, in  when Anne was . “It was love at first sight,” says Charles. “Anne was pretty, had great legs and was a good dancer. “I askedI could keep in touch, then borrowed Dad’s car to drive  miles to Epping to see her. Early dates were in a pub with a glass of shandy between us because we had no money.” Anne, who earned £ a week as a seamstress, worked overtime to help pay for their wedding in Epping. She says: “I think the secret to lasting love is to find real love in the first place. “Marriage, children and decades change you. Butyou have real love it’ll get you through. And I have never doubted my love for Charles.”  The pair, who live in an Inspired Villages retirement development in Great Alne Park, Warks, say there have been bumps in their long road. “Anne can be quite volatile,” adds Charles, a retired engineer and company director. “When we were dating I dared her to slap my face, and she did. So I learned to keep my head down and just say, ‘Yes, dear’.We know each other’s strengths and weaknesses. If I’m trying on new clothes, Anne will say, ‘You’re not having that’ and I take them off. But when it comes to finances, that’s left to me.” Anne says: “Charles worked a lot and didn’t believe me when I said staying home and bringing up teenagers was hell. But neither of us wanted to throw the towel in at the first hurdle. “We are both ambitious, love being active and going on cruises. “We’re in a peaceful phase of le. And I’m less volatile now. I only slapped his face all those years ago because he was very cheeky.” Charles and Mary - wed  yearsAfter Charlie Roe’s childhood London house was bombed in the Blitz, he was evacuated to Devon. Working on a farm there, he was captivated by Mary who emptied the milk churns each day. They married on April , , near Orpington in Kent. Mary, , who went on to become a nurse, says: “To find a good partner, make sure they are reliable, likeable and most importantly kind. “They have to have a good character. I love Charlie’s kindness and his stability. I can always rely on him.”Charlie, , who spent the rest of his career as a farm worker, adds his own advice: “Plan your future with your partner, always work hard at your relationship, and have shared interests.” The couple, who moved together into a Care UK home in Chichester, West Sussex, last month - have three children, nine grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. On Valentine’s Day they will be treated to a candlelit champagne dinner cooked by the care home’s head chef. John and Doreen - wed  yearsJohn and Doreen Pitt first met at primary school in West Ham, East London. They saw each other years later at a birthday party and have been together since. Doreen, , says: “We didn’t dance at the party – which is a good job because John has two left feet. But he had a self-deprecating humour that made me laugh and still does.” John, , says: “After our first date at London Zoo, I took Doreen to a cafe in Soho and impressed her by ordering pork chops.” The couple, who now have a Churchill Retirement Living home in Cheltenham, Glos, married in  and welcomed a son, daughter and five grandchildren into their lives. They describe their relationship as “not flowery”.  Doreen says: “John says romantic things, but not in an old charmer way – more of a rough diamond way.We roll up laughing together. John looks after me. He knows just how I like my cup of tea and exactly when I need one. “He was wonderful to my parents and called my mum ‘Old Girl’ which made her laugh. And he has been a fantastic father.” John, who worked for BT, says: “When Doreen’s not here the house feels so empty. “That’s not to say we want to be in each other’s company every minute. But even when I’m in the next room reading my newspaper, it’s a comfort to know she’s in the next room. “We’d be lost without each other. She’s a lovely person - but I wouldn’t say that to her face. “I had an aneurism a few years ago and when I woke up in intensive care, Doreen’s face was the first I saw. I can’t describe how joyous that felt.” Jack and Grace - wed  yearsJack and Grace Priestly met while both serving in the Royal Navy in Plymouth in  and married one year later at St Hilda’s Church in Leeds. The couple have a daughter, Susan, , and a grandson David. Grace, , says: “In  when I left the Wrens I moved into Jack’s house with his parents instead of going home. I’d fallen in love with him because he’s so kind and funny. “I can’t describe how I knew he was the one for me. I just knew.” Jack, , says: “What do I love most about Grace  Everything - she’s Grace.” Grace, who went on to become an office clerk for British Gas, and Jack, who worked in insurance, have planned a Valentine’s stay-home treat at Bupa Care Home Ashley House in Cirencester, Glos. Grace says: “We used to go to the theatre all the time, so the home is setting up a little theatre trip in the lounge just for us after our Valentine’s supper. I can’t wait.” Bryan and Angela - wed  yearsBryan and Angela Shelley found love at a seemingly unromantic atomic energy conference. Angela, , who was a marine zoologist, says: “I was the only female in a group of  men there..” After the conference, Bryan ed to his London home and Angela to hers at the opposite end of the country in Cumbria. But they saw each other most weekends and Bryan, who was a project design engineer, proposed by phone. They married six months after first meeting, in November .  The couple, who now live in Bupa’s Ashby Court care home in Ashby De La Zouch, Leics, have four children,  grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Angela says: “The secret to lasting love is tolerance. It might be old-fashioned but it’s important to stand by the vows you made.” Bryan adds: “We have always been compatible.

Mark Cummins, , from Alton Hamps., has praised a brilliant emergency phone line operator who helped save his two-year-oldaposs le by guiding him through CPR. He now encourages all parents to learn first aid because it could be the dference between le or death.Mark said his daughter Shannon collapsed on Saturday morning after her immune system had become weaker by Covid- lockdowns.He said: I thought she was playing so I walked over to her and I looked into her eyes and there was nothing there, nobody was home.  I realised that she wasnapost breathing and she was blue. Mark, who had never learned CPR, called  and an operator coached him on how to do perform chest compressions with rescue breaths.

Shannon started breathing again, but she remained unconscious until an ambulance crew arrived.

The royal pair were pictured last night attending the Superbowl together in Calornia and were seen relaxing in the stands enjoying the action. Harry and we Meghan Markle are known to have an icy relationship with many of the royals after their decision to step down from the Firm in . They also spoke out against them in their bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey last year where they alleged that there had been conversations about how dark son Archieaposs skin would be. But according to royal expert and biographer Robert Jobson, Harry and Eugenie have always been close - and Eugenie refuses to abandon her cousin.He told the Mirror:Prince Harry and his first cousin Princess Eugenie have always been close.Ever since they were children messing around on the slopes of Klosters, Switzerland, they struck up a loving empathy. Back then, Harry was the court jester and both Prince Andrew and Fergie’s daughters would laugh out loud at his risqué antics. Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up .She is friends with Meghan too and was close to his two previous girlfriends Chelsy Davy and Cressida Bonas - who both attended her wedding to Jack Brooksbank. In fact, Eugenie helped set up actress Cressida and Harry, whose relationship promised so much before it fizzled out after two years until . Eugenie and Harry are known to get on well, and -year-old Meghan actually knew the princess before she had even met Harry - something she revealed during the Oprah Winfrey interview in March . Now Harry is married and settled in the US and his relationship with his father, Charles, and brother, William, is fractured, Eugenie - who is close to the Queen - is one of his only connections to the royal family. She refuses to abandon him.  A close source said: aposEugenie is a sweet lady. Everyone gets on with her in the family. She is a very warm person. But she is fiercely loyal too and she is not one for taking sides in issues that are not her business. “aposShe has always been close to Harry, they just get on. She is not one for taking sides”apos the source said.Harry stayed at Frogmore Cottage with her on the two times he has visited the UK and had to quarantine - since his decision to step down as a senior working royal. With her father Andrew a royal outcast too after his shaming over his Epstein connections and the ongoing civil sex case against him, it is understood the two cousins have bonded again. Harry has also been close to Fergie too, again another who has experienced the royal wrath and exile. While Harry and Eugenie were in the stands at the SoFi Stadium to see the Los Angeles Rams beat the Cincinnati Bengals, there was no sign of their respective spouses Meghan and Jack Brooksbank. Robert added: They sat in leather chairs outside a private box at the stadium and wore face coverings in accordance with local rules.  The presence of the two royals at the star-studded event - hosted the likes of Ryan Reynolds, LeBron James, Kevin Hart, Charlize Theron, and others - was announced publicly.The NFL UK Twitter account shared a photo of them and wrote: aposPrince Harry and Princess Eugenie in the house at #SBLVI.aposHarry, in a white T-shirt and dark jacket and was seen resting his shoes on the barrier in front of him. There was also no sign of Eugenieaposs husband Jack Brooksbank or Meghan. Eugenie paired her mask with a baseball hat, jeans and a blazer, and had a bottle of Aquafina water on the barrier in front of her. Harry also had a glass in front of him on the barrier but its contents could not be seen. It’s not known why Meghan or Jack were not there. Meghan, after all, gets on well with Eugenie. The princess even backed one of Meghan’s many causes. She publicly volunteered to participate in X, an Archewell mentoring programme for women who want toto work after the pandemic.And she shared an image of the Archewell website on her Instagram account to celebrate Meghan’s th birthday.With Harry’s communication with his father and brother at an all-time low, perhaps his cousin is the only small chance of him continuing to maintain a relationship with the royals - especially with the publication date of his bombshell memoir fast approaching.

Another posted: Who would take a photo like that let alone share it with others ”It is believedSouth Yorkshire Policehave been made aware of the latest development.Pickles, from Barnsley, initially pleaded not guilty to murder before changing his plea. A court heard he approached Loui, who he had not met before, and stabbed him over a “perceived relationship”. Det Ch Insp Mark Oughton, who led the investigation, said at the time: This is an incredibly tragic case where an innocent young boy was stabbed to death, simply because his attacker was jealous of a perceived relationship. Pickles located Loui and his friend... and purposely set out armed with a kitchen kne to go and stab him, he added. Speaking after the sentencing Louiaposs mother, Louise Hartley, said: I miss Loui constantly. I miss the small moments like him wandering into the room to sit with me or ringing me to say he will be home soon when out with friends. Loui had the world at his feet. He was young, good looking, and opportunities seemed to be opening up for him. He loved football and was excelling on the pitch. He had also recently started catering college. “He was a very sociable boy and was quite the charmer with the girls. He never left the house without making sure that his hair was perfectly styled. “It was Loui’s th birthday on  November, and I spent it by his graveside. I can no longer smile. I feel physically incapable of happiness. I would feel guilty to do so knowing that my Loui is not able to. I want my son here with me - I love him so much.

In one tweet, Jack showed a kilogramme bag of rice that was back to its old price of p, after jumping last month to £ for g – a price increase of %.  The food campaigner was poised to give the store a hard time for excluding an entire group of customers. But she changed her mind and was left in tears by what she saw on the supermarket shelves which moved her in a way she did not expect. Jack wrote: “I was very quick to vily Asda for what I saw as a change of direction for their company, and a watering down of their commitment to an entire group of their customers.”  The company promised to “do better”, she said, as she praised the “remarkable” speed of the turnaround. “The impact that this will have on millions of people, is impossible to overstate,” Jack said, adding that she “cried, quietly, to myself, in Asda” at the development. She also wrote: “So I guess I just wanted to say thanks to everyone at Asda who has worked really hard over the last few weeks to bring the missing SmartPrice products back.”  Meg Farren, Asda’s chief customer officer, said: “We want to help our customers’ budgets stretch further and have taken on board the comments about the availability of our Smart Price range made by Jack Monroe. “We are taking steps to put our full Smart Price and Farm Stores ranges in store and online to make these products as accessible as possible.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON AsdaSupermarkets\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our money-saving tips and top offers direct to your inbox with the Mirror Money newsletterInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The new guidance would suggest families may like to consider the jab to protect against a ‘potential future wave’. The percentage of people testing positive for Covid decreased but remained “very high” for those aged  years to aged  in the week ending February th, . Officials figures show that . per cent of that age range were positive after a nose and throat test.Currently, , children in this age bracket, who are either most at risk of Covid- or live with someone vulnerable, are now able to get vaccinations against the virus.But in a hint at things to come health bosses at the British overseas territory the Cayman Islands have reportedly been told they will get vaccines for all their  to -year-olds shipped from the UK “in a few weeks”.Families have been complaining that their holiday plans have been thwarted because of the lack of jabs for under-s in the UK. The majority of countries in Europe are now introducing jabs for under-s, and some resorts have banned those who are unvaccinated apart. However, Spain announced that it would relax its rules from Monday, to allow unvaccinated British teenagers to enter the country with a negative test. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationhas been ided about the matter for months and last officially updated their advice just before Christmas. Then they changed their guidance to include children aged  to  who are ‘in a clinical risk group or who has household contact with someone who is immunosuppressed’.  They said the decision was made “following extensive assessment of the risks and benefits of vaccinations” for this age and after considering clinical trials and international data.They added: “Further advice regarding COVID- vaccination for other  to -year-olds will be issued in due course following consideration of additional data relevant to this age group, and on the Omicron iant more broadly.”Professor Wei Shen Lim, Chair, COVID- immunisation, JCVI, said at the time: “The majority of children aged  to  are at very low risk of serious illness due to COVID-. However, some  to -year-olds have underlying health conditions that put them at higher risk, and we advise these children to be vaccinated in the first instance.” The committee is now understood to have recommended to ministers that jabs should be offered to all in that age group, but it is not clearformal advice has yet been given to Government health officials.  A statement from the Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said on Sunday: “No decisions have been made by ministers on whether healthy --year-olds should be routinely offered COVID- vaccines.”Currently, the NHS is offering COVID- vaccine to children and young people aged  to  years.Young people at greater risk of serious illnessthey catch COVID- will need  doses of vaccine,  weeks apart. All other young people will be offered  doses of vaccine  weeks apart. With so much changing so quickly, keep on top of what is happening with the Mirroraposs news updates by email.

Veronika Brosnan, , and Sama Ali, , this weekend received their Covid- vaccination at North East Surrey College of Technologyin Epsom. At the moment as many schools break up for half term, the NHS is sending invites to parents of more than one million  to -year-olds reminding them to come forward for their jab, with over , appointments available for this age group. Other venues lined up by the NHS to get  to -year-olds vaccinated during half term, are a petting zoo, family fun days and a skate park.

In an extraordinary statement on the eve of her Platinum Jubilee, the Queen expressed her wish for Camilla to be known as Queen Consort when Prince Charles takes the throne.For years insiders were sure Camilla would take the title Princess Consort instead - although there had been speculation that Charles wanted his we to be his Queen.  In a message to the nation, the Queen wrote: “When, in the fullness of time, my son Charles becomes King, I know you will give him and his we Camilla the same support that you have given me. “And it is my sincere wish that, when that time comes, Camilla will be known as Queen Consort as she continues her own loyal service.”In reply, Charles paid tribute to his inspiring mother in a moving statement, admitting heaposs deeply conscious of her wish for Camilla to become his Queen Consort when he takes the throne. However, as many applauded the move, Tom Bower, who is currently writing a biography on Meghan, claims the silence from the Sussexesapos has been deafening.Writing in Fabulous, Tom says the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have not sent any of the customary congratulations or messages of loyalty to their family in London.Prince William is reported to have been supportive of the news. Tom further claims that Harry has never liked Camilla and even blames her for his mumaposs marriage failing.  He writes: Their insult was surely deliberate. It has been said by a number of people that Harry has always disliked Camilla and blamed her for wrecking his parents’ marriage. Perhaps the Sussexes’ deafening silence is Meghan’s way of declaring war. It is believed that she has never liked Camilla, and I am sure the feelings are reciprocated. Tom goes on to say that Camilla may have been suspicious about Meghan. He claims she may have found it hard to believe that Meghan would sacrice her independence to serve silently as a team player devoted to the monarchy. His speculation comes as a royal insider has said Prince Harry and Meghan wonapost join Charles on the balcony of Buckingham Palace after his coronation. A royal source told a newspaper that a slimmed-down monarchywill be on display when Charles finally ascends the throne. They said it was possible that only Prince William, Kate and their children would join Charles and Camilla on the balcony when he becomes King.The Queen was surrounded by her family and maids of honour when she waved to huge crowds below the palace after her coronation in .A source told the Mail On Sunday that Charles wants his coronation to be far cheaper than Her Majestyaposs ceremony, which cost £.million - the equivalent of £million today.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON The QueenPrince HarryPrince WilliamPrince Charles, Prince of WalesBuckingham PalaceRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The low pressure systems - named Storm Dudley and Storm Eunice - could see strong hurricane-like winds of up to mph and the possibility of snow, leading to a flurry of weather warnings. Dudley has resulted in an amber danger to le warning from pm on Wednesday until am on Thursday - covering a strip of Scotland, Northern Ireland and northern England.The national weather agency warns there could be power cuts, while injuries and danger to le is likely due to huge waves and beach material being thrown onto the coasts, sea fronts and properties. While a less severe yellow warning, covering a much larger stretch of northern Britain, is in place from pm on Wednesday until pm the next day.  A brief period of calm follows before Eunice strikes, with all of England, Wales and Northern Ireland expected to be impacted. The Met Office says there is a small chance that flying debris will result in a danger to le, with fallen trees, damage to buildings and homes, roofs blown off and power lines brought down. While there could also be a danger to le from waves and beach material on the coasts, as with Dudley. That yellow warning is in place from midnight on Thursday until pm on Friday.  The Met Officeaposs chief meteorologist, Paul Gundersen, said: An active jet stream is driving low-pressure systems across the country, both of which are likely to cause some disruption and National Severe Weather Warnings have been issued. Storm Dudley will see strong winds cross western Scotland and Northern Ireland before pushing eastward to northern England, with -mph gusts possible on exposed coasts and hills. Up to mph winds are also a possibility further inland.  Storm Eunice, meanwhile, will then track across central areas of the UK on Friday, with more strong winds of up to mph inland. The strongest winds and worst-affected areas are uncertain at present. This system is also expected to bring some heavy rain and there is a potential for some signicant snowfall over hills in the Midlands and further north.  Met Office meteorologist, Tom Morgan, said: This whole week is going to see quite a disturbed weather pattern developing across the UK. He said western parts of Scotland will bear the brunt of the strongest winds which could cause widespread disruption. He added: Wind will be the primary cause for concern next week.  Mr Morgan told The Mirror: Through this week northern parts of the UK will see snow. We will see snow in the higher parts of Scotland tomorrow, in places such as the Grampians and the Highlands. On Tuesday morning there will be more substantial snow in the high ground of Scotland and in the Pennines in England.  Itaposs possible that we could see cm of snow above  metres. There could be disruption to rush hour traffic on Tuesday morning along the high routes in central and northern Scotland. He added that the weather will turn milder on Wednesday before stormy conditions set in at night, with snowfall expected toon Thursday.  Snow showers are expected across Scotland, Northern Ireland and northern England on Thursday, Mr Morgan said. Above  metres there could be five to cms of snow in Scotland. It could even each  to cms over the top of some mountains. The tops of the Pennines could see two to five centimetres, while there could be two to four centimetres above  metres in Northern Ireland. It comes after Storm Malik and Storm Corrie brought strong gale-force winds that caused widespread disruption across the country this year. Thousands of homes in Scotland were left without power for days after Storm Malik and Storm Corrie battered parts of the country, causing widespread damage. SSEN said the intensity of the wind storms caused serious damage to the companyaposs infrastructure.

April Alexander - who specialises in hairstyling shoots and has appeared in Vogue magazine - went to the Belgravia Centre in London in April  after suffering partial hair loss.But the -year-old’s hair became hopelessly tangled - “to the point of being entirely matted together” during a scalp treatment at the clinic, court documents claim.The Belgravia Centre claims that her hair only became tangled because she had plaited it into weaves beneath the wig she was wearing and it denies negligence.April claims some of her hair was “ripped out” as two therapists battled to untangle it, but they only made things worse, it is claimed. The freelance model says she was left with no choice but to shave off the matted hair and the trauma caused her to develop a form of alopecia which leads to complete baldness.Now she is taking the clinic - which bills itself as “Europe’s largest and most renowned hair loss centre” - to court in a lawsuit for as much as £,.Miss Alexander, of Brockley, south London, was advised to go to a clinic by her GP after noticing she was losing some hair in early , court documents show. She was treated with oils, moisturisers and shampooing, but claims that the “vigorous rubbing motion” used to work in the treatment was “wholly unsuitable to her Afro-Caribbean hair type”. “The pulling and tugging at her hair was very painful and Miss Alexander became extremely distressed,” her lawyers allege. “She was at the clinic for six hours in total and became so distressed that a relative had to collect her to take her home. “Before leaving the clinic she was offered some money to pay for her usual hairdresser to shave off all her hair as it had become impossible to detangle it.” The Belgravia Centre dispute Miss Alexanderaposs account of what happened, insisting the model opted for a “non-clinical” scalp therapy after declining the treatment specically prescribed for her. They say the scalp conditioning she chose was only designed to clean her remaining hair - not to correct her hair loss - and her hair became tangled as she had plaited it into weaves beneath the wig she wore. Nor did they offer her cash to have her hair shaved, they say. Instead, the centre offered her cash as a gesture of goodwill so she could get her hair cut.  Suing the Pimlico-based clinic, April claims its hair specialist misdiagnosed her condition and adopted the wrong approach to treatment. Staff had then “persisted with futile and inappropriate attempts to detangle her hair which were doomed to failure and bound to cause pain and distress”. Miss Alexander says she already had patchy hair loss, but it would have cleared up within  months with the correct treatment. However, the distress and trauma of her ordeal triggered “alopecia universalis” - total hair loss. “As a model, she took particular pride in her appearance and her natural Afro hair was one of her distinctive features,” her lawyers say. In a hearing at Central London County Court, Judge Alan Saggerson said Miss Alexander is still a hairdressersapos model, but she claims that the treatmentaposs effects both in physical and psychological terms have not yet completely resolved. The case recently reached court as lawyers debated how best to budget mounting court costs - with a four-day trial still some way off.

Lucie Taylor-Theis, , and her family were placed in the tiny flat in Ealing, west London, where they feel stuck and helpless. The mum claims she has been reduced to tears due to their rodent-infested home - and says she has seen mice in her sonaposs bedroom.“You can hear them all in the walls,” she told My London.Lucie told how the family has to sleep on the sofa and how there is no space for her children, aged nine, three, two and  months, to sit. She said Ealing Council placed them in the temporary accommodation after they were forced to leave their former home when the landlord wanted the property back last year. The flat is up several flights of stairs, which Lucie says has also caused her to injure her shoulder carrying the pram up and down every day. Lucie also suffers from several mental health conditions that have been exacerbated by her current living situation. She said: “I constantly am crying in front of my children. My children are always telling me not to cry.  My little girl, she comes and wipes my tears because she constantly sees me crying all the time. It’s so hard.” Although the temporary accommodation was provided by the council, it belongs to the housing provider Middlesex Group. Lucie claims that pest control services visited her flat on Thursday to block some holes and eradicate the problem, but she is unconvinced it has been solved. To make matters worse, Lucie says she has been moved far away from her son’s school and the relatives she relies on for support. Due to her anxiety, she is unable to travel by public transport and instead has to walk for more than an hour to reach her son’s school. She claims her local authority were aware of these mental health considerations. “[Ealing Council] knew all of this,” she said.  “I needed to be by my family for support. Iaposm struggling with getting my son to school and being away from my mum. This situation has affected my mental health in every way. “I suffer with severe anxiety. I can’t tell you the last time I actually slept the whole night. I’ve been having to sleep on the sofa with my babies. I can’t put my son in a cot, because where his room is at the back, that’s mainly where the mice have been getting in.” In May last year, Lucie was admitted to a mental health hospital after her previous living situation became too much for her. She is concerned this may happen againshe is not moved somewhere more suitable. “Things got so on top of me where I was living before, so much that I ended up in hospital,” she said. Lucie’s mum Mandy Forrestal also revealed the toll this has taken on her daughteraposs mental health. She said: “My daughter has had a terrible time, a really bad time. Ealing Council has had numerous letters from all the professionals, psychiatrist, her nurse. You name it, they’ve had it.” She also described Lucie’s flat as “really, really tiny” and said living there has been like living in a “hellhole”.has contacted Ealing Council and Middlesex Group for comment.

Little Astrid Tordoff was born withHypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome , a birth defect that was discovered by a midwe doing a routine check when she was just one day old. The defect is a form of congenitalheart diseasewhich means the left lower pumping chamber of the heart doesn’t develop properly and the aorta, which carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body is smaller than usual.This means the heart is unable to pump blood around the body effectively.Her parents, Amelia and Charles Tordoff toldYorkshire Livethat their daughter was “simply perfect” when she joined the family, who’d been excitedly awaiting her arrival.Alarm bells started ringing as the family waited to be discharged the following day but were held up when routine checks took longer than expected.  “Astrid came flying into the world full-term and seemed absolutely, perfectly fine for the first - hours of her le,” said Amelia. “She was alert, feeding well and generally really lovely. I had a whole night in hospital with her, blissfully unaware of what was to come.” Tragically, it was discovered that Astrid had a heart murmur, which can be quite common in newborn babies. Amelia said: You could sort of tell from their facial expressions that it was a signicant murmur, not a little one. “I’d gone from being in a state of pure joy to thinking, ‘what on earth is going on ’. I was trying to stay calm because I still thought she’d be alright - but it did feel like I was having some sort of weird out of body experience. Later that day, the tot was transferred to the specialist heart unit at Leeds Children’s Hospital. On Friday, two days after she was born, it was confirmed that Astrid had the complex heart defect known as Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome. The family were given two options and faced with an impossible decision.  They could let nature run its course by opting for what’s known as comfort care or opt for a risky surgery which offered a chance to prolong her le. “If we thought it was going to fix her, we’d have opted for the surgery without question, said Amelia. She probably had a   chance of surviving it andshe did, there would be more surgery to come. But it didn’t seem like putting her through it would buy her any quality of le. “It was just a horric choice to make, and I’ll always question whether we did the right thing. But I think deep down I know we did.” It was suggested the family, who expected to have two or three days at the most with Astrid, move to the more homely surroundings of Bluebell Wood Childrenaposs Hospice in Sheffield. The heartbroken mum added: Taking her home didn’t seem right we needed that extra help and support. This may sound strange as Astrid is very much a part of our family, but we needed our home to remain a safe space for our other two girls. “It sounds like a funny thing to say but Bluebell Wood will always be Astrid’s home. We have such beautul memories and the care team were amazing with all of us.” Astrid’s extended family came to meet her over the next few days, acutely aware the clock was ticking. But she continued to defy the odds. “Every day with Astrid was a gt, but because we had the other girls our lives were torn in so many dferent directions, said Amelia. We doubted everything. How could she possibly have half a heart when she was living for days and days  A couple of days later, the Tordoffs moved to a bigger family suite where they stayed for the remainder of Astrid’s  days at Bluebell Wood. Amelia said: It felt more like a home from home and we got into a bit of a routine. The girls would come over after school and see us for a few hours each day. For such a traumatic experience, they have nothing but beautul, positive things to say about Bluebell Wood, which is testament to the type of place it is. She added: You are quite literally going through hell, the worst thing that anyone can experience, and yet you’re so comfortable and so well looked after. “Without Bluebell Wood it would have been so dferent. We wouldn’t have had that support and we wouldn’t have been able to make all those positive memories – not just for us but for the girls and our families too. Amelia said it allowed her and husband Charles to compose themselves for their two daughters so they wouldnapost see them absolutely broken. We were always very honest with them, but I hope we protected them from the worst horror of it all, she said. “People have asked me how I can face going back to the hospice for counselling. I tell them it’s the place where I feel most connected to Astrid – it’s her home.” The little girl sadly died in the arms of her loving parents in the early hours of July .

She said: After everything is plated up, a page chooses at random one of the plates to be served to Her Majesty. Soanyone did want to poison the monarch they’d have to poison the whole lot. That being said, the Queen chooses all of the food that she eats off of specic menus from the kitchen. Royal chef Darren McGrady explained: The chef does three days’ menus and that gives us enough time to get all the produce in and prepare it.  When the menu book goes up to the Queen she puts a line through all the dishes she doesn’t want. If she’s out for dinner she’ll put a line through the page. Andshe has a guest coming she’ll put two or three, so we know she is entertaining,” Darren said. He also revealed that she hates pasta, garlic and onion, but she loves to eat chicken or fish with vegetables or salad. Royal biographer Lady Colin Campbell also revealed that the Queen prefers to eat her dinner in the comfort of her own living room instead of in one of the lavish dining rooms on offer when there are no royal engagements to attend or important visitors to host. She said: She has her dinner off a tray looking at the television. She likes it. Itaposs homely and cosy and itaposs comfortable.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

Mathew Plumb and Lauren Young met at Glastonbury Festival while he was living in the back of his van.He had always been interested in the outdoors but had arrived at a place where he didn’t know where to turn in his le, he tells Wales Online. And he and his partner chose do something about their passion for sustainable living and embracing nature. The pair now live amongst acres of trees in an idyillic location which looks like itaposs out of a kidsapos story book.Do you live off-grid or have a unique way of living  Email webnews@mirror to tell your story “He needed it I think – the outdoors,” -year-old girlfriend Lauren says of Mathew in the middle of their dense  acres of forestry which is like something out of a children’s fairytale. They live here blissfully with Lauren’s three-year-old cat Baby, four pigs, and  chickens. Lauren moved here originally temporarily after losing her job as an events manager in the first lockdown but the chimes of the birds and the hundreds of “gorgeous” oak trees pulled her back.  Drowned almost secretly in the shadow of the Deri mountain in north Monmouthshire they have no wi, no bath, no television, and no office space. They live on the absolute bare necessities and they love every second of it – almost. Asked how he managed to fall on  acres, woodcutter Mathew said: “Dad bought it for my sister because she was in Brownies then and they wanted a space to take the kids. He could afford it back then – times were dferent.  “I first came here when I was eight or nine. Then I started using a saw to chop the wood when I was . I realised straightaway that I loved it.” After living here for two years alone with his chickens and Kunekune pigs, which hang around him as though they are dogs on a Sunday afternoon walk, he’s now happier than ever with Lauren by his side. You’d be hard pressed to find a more eccentric and artsy pair. When Mathew isn’t chopping wood, hosting campers, or helping children at one of the local schools he is writing poetry – and that is how he met freelance artist Lauren.She joked that Mathew “stalked” her and “lured” her to the forest. “I’m a freelance artist and people often approach me to discuss ideas and Mathew had been following me on social media since we first met so he got in touch about working with him to illustrate his book,” she recalled. “I was in Hackney at the time in a cute little flat I shared with my best mate at the start of the pandemic. “I always like to meet up with clients to gauge exactly what they want. We had some breakfast and he ended up staying the night – on the sofa. Baby was all over him which is strange because she can be nervous with people she’s new to.” “She was sleeping on my head,” Mathew laughed.  Lauren continued: “Mathew then got me here on the pretence of doing an art walk and sculpture trail thing and I came here to stay a couple of weeks for that. In the end I stayed for two months. “When I went back to London I hated it. I had to leave the flat really quickly because I lost my job as an event manager in the pandemic. It was a snap decision really.” Baby is right at home milling between the array of sawn-off timber and makesht wooden huts which make up their home. Is Lauren as accustomed to the surroundings  “It’s cold very often,” she laughed. “But I’m getting used to it. It was really weird – as soon as I came here for the first time I had a feeling I could be here.”Originally from Bedford she’s always been a stickler for the outdoors since growing up on her granddad’s fields where she spent many a weekend. “When I was small my only friends were my cats, dogs, and chickens. I’d have full-on conversations with them and I missed that lestyle. I came here and it reminded me of that. “And there are oak trees. As soon as there are oak trees I know I’m in the right place.”  You’d have to be a seriously closed book not to appreciate the beauty in the tranquillity of their forest but for most living out here would surely be too much to take. The shower is a bucket of water with a hole in its centre hanging on a chain and the toilet is a hole in a wooden bench in a small wooden hut. Itaposs is beautully decorated with Lauren’s creative touch, and the main living area known as the “charcoal shelter” relies on a makesht curtain to block out the wind. Askedshe has ever regretted the leap into the wilderness Lauren said: “I have thought ‘I wish I was back [in London]’ and I miss it all the time. But I prefer it here and I always try to focus on the lovely things that we can have here.”  It is a huge disservice to the pair to only make reference to the loo as an artistic masterpiece. The whole place is brimming with bright colours and beautully carved and woven wood. It is remarkable that a few huts dotted around a woodland can look so homely and warm even on a cold winteraposs morning. “My dad is a carpenter and I’ve always loved it,” Lauren said. “This is all stuff Mathew has built from the trees,” she explains as we pass yet more precisely-chopped trunks which smell every bit as good as they look. “Mike our neighbour is helping us with the roof for one of the huts.” Neighbour is a term used very loosely in this instance.  He’s about  yards down the road but is the closest to them. Mathew says Lauren’s creativity has transformed their woodland. “At the start of Covid it hit home how much we needed to start future-proofing the business and Lauren has brought so many new ideas,” he said. “She does art therapy in the woodland for people who want to come and do that and she does an arts trail. It’s all for the mind – it definitely works. “I can’t just be a tree surgeon. As well as the camping we deliver firewood and charcoal. “The people we tend to attract are wild campers who come with really small tents or just with hammocks and just want to test themselves.  “We don’t take many people at one time. We try to keep it to five pitches so people can’t see each other and so they feel like they’re on their own in secluded woodland. “There is a lot of uncertainty to le at the moment and we want people who come here to be reassured that there are other opportunities and dferent ways to live. “We often get people here who are having a really dficult time and they just need time to be here and to have some space. It’s a form of therapy really.” It’s their own uncertainty in le – particularly for Mathew – which has brought them here. Mathew describes how he was one of the thousands of “hidden homeless” in Britain when he lived in the back of his work van prior to moving to the forest near to where he grew up.  As the cost of living rises what better way to save money than to live in your own woodland  “Before I came here I thought about buying a house,” Mathew said. “I had almost saved enough for a deposit on a small house in Merthyr, which was all I could afford at the time. Then it dawned on me: what am I going to do with a house  I cut trees for a living – that’s what I do and this is who I am. I want to do cool stuff. We couldn’t do everything we do here while trying to pay off a mortgage.” Lauren said: “We would never have afforded to do what we do here and rent because this takes up hours and hours of our time. Mathew always has bookings with work. He does the cutting and I do the labour.” Weekly outgoings for heating, electricity, water, and rent amount to less than £ a month. “It’s mental how much money you can save,” Mathew said.  “I spend nothing on rent, zero on electric as we get all we need from solar , and about £ every six weeks on propane gas. We have four pigs that I breed and  chickens we use for meat and eggs.” The pigs act like gardeners by hoovering up any unwanted vegetation like bramble and ivy, leaving the lush wood-meadow. You can’t walk  yards without nearly stepping on a chicken. “We had a lot more than this,” Mathew laughed. “We had  but a fox got hold of them. It was heartbreaking. I know it sounds silly but you begin to feel a real connection to all the animals.”  They’re in the process of building an eco-friendly chicken hut to keep them as safe as possible. Each small cabin or hut made by the pair has been constructed without concrete and instead rests on wooden planks so as not to disrupt the soil. While he was tempted by “the modern world” Mathew knows he is now in the right place. “I think from my early s I realised I didn’t want to live a conventional le.

More and more people are taking an interest in going off-grid. I think the pandemic has been a wake-up call.” Even for Tarzan-esque Mathew sticking it out in the wilderness through another winter has been a challenge – but they wouldn’t have it any other way.“Mud, weather, cold, the general challenges nature presents to us – it’s all been there,” he said. “But it’s a definite buzz. It’s exhilarating – without a doubt.“It’s all worth it in the spring – our favourite time of the year, watching the world waking up around us.” Lauren added: “We wake up at about am and the cockerels start going and then again at am. I get to sit and listen to the birds while Mathew makes me a cup of tea. What more could you ask for ”You can follow the couple on Instagram @bleu_jean _ and @twometresplumb .

The couple have been together for almost six years after their romance started when they were introduced by a mutual friend. However, back in  - the year before they met - Meghan was single on Valentineaposs Day while working as an actress on the hit TV legal drama Suits. But that doesnapost mean she didnapost have big plans for Valentineaposs Day - in fact, she wrote about it on her lestyle blog The Tig and revealed the person to who she was showing love to.  She wrote: I think you need to be your own Valentine. I think you need to cook that beautul dinner even when itaposs just you, wear your favourite outfit, buy yourself some flowers, and celebrate the self-love that often gets muddled when we focus on what we donapost have. In the same post, she also described how she planned to spend the day running amok through the streets of New York, while at the same time drinking pink cocktails and navigating the icy streets in her new shoes.

Because I’ve worked hard, because Iaposm not going to wait for someone to buy me the things I covet , and because I want to treat myself as well as I treat those dearest to me. Because I am my own funny Valentine. Meghan shut down The Tig in  - just before she announced her engagement to Harry. However, last month it was reported that she could be set to relaunch the site after applying to reactivate the trademark name.LA lawyer Marjorie Witter Norman filed a new application to trademark the name in July last year, according to legal records, reports the Daily Mail.

But it turns out there could be a lot your relatives arenapost actually telling you. This was the case for one woman who has recently had her entire le turned upside down after discovering her grandmother had been hiding a major secret.The unnamed woman, who posts on TikTok under the name @thekennedyproj, explained how her family had recently done andMe DNA tests, which uncovered the major lie her gran had been spinning for years - and sheaposd taken the secret to her grave. Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here.In her video, the woman, whose account says sheaposs aposnot Kennedyapos told how the DNA test showed her family they had many relatives on the grandmotheraposs side - despite the older woman claiming sheaposd been an orphan and only child. They also found out that the grandmother had erased her past, changed her name and pretended to be a dferent race to have a better le. She said: My grandmother took a secret to her grave and we just found out what it was. She passed back in  and at the time we thought she was born in , we knew her name and we knew that she was an orphan and she was an only child and that we had no other family connections to her whatsoever and the family line lived and died with her. So find me confused when our family gets results back from andMe test telling us we are African American, when my grandmother said that we were English and I know, looking at me youaposre going to be very confused because I am too.She went on to say that her family is still figuring out all the details, but that the test matched them up with a family in Virginia, which made sense as her grandparents had met in Maryland and were married there. They got in touch with the other family and they exchanged photos, which was when they discovered their grandmother hadnapost been an only child - she was actually one of  siblings. It turns out that Millicent Vaughn was born Mammy Vaughn back in , not . She was born to a family of  children, all African American living in Virginia, the woman continues. While her parents did die when she was young, she was not an orphan and an only child like she had said. She had decided to run away from her family and completely exorcise herself from her identity. She picked up a new name, she picked up a new race and she completely erased who she was. She added: So now I have a whole new family and itaposs surreal and itaposs strange and thereaposs this part of me that doesnapost really know who I am. And I think what surprises me the most is the fact that her story is not uncommon for the US at that time. Because she was white-passing she chose to completely reinvent herself and go by a completely dferent name and racial identity just to create a better le for herself and Iaposm incredibly grateful for the privilege that her decision provided for me, but Iaposm also incredibly sad and confused. Iaposm also excited because I have a whole new family that I didnapost know existed. The woman claries this is just the beginning of the journey for her family and that she will be sharing more info.More than . million people have watched the womanaposs video, with it garnering over , likes and thousands of comments.One person said: Itaposs sad how common this is for survival.

But things dont always go as planned on first dates and can quickly turn into disasters - we run down some of the worst around so you know what to avoidLots of dates go perfectly... others dont Image: Getty ImagesByHarry ThompsonTrends Writer:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |comments The dream first date has a stereotypical shape to it: a nervous but cute greeting, some nice food and flowing conversation that leaves both people feeling like perhaps theyaposve found someone who understands them, someone theyaposd like to see again.But the trouble with dreams is, often they donapost come true. Reality is mucky and scruffy and full of good plans falling at the first hurdle - and dates are no dferent. For some people though, first dates can get a lot worse than an awkward goodbye or making a hash of eating your spaghetti. Sometimes, a dream first date can turn into a nightmare, a nightmare that goes viral on the internet. If youaposre preparing for a special Valentineaposs Day date, hereaposs a round-up of tales to show you exactly what to avoid. The worst dates of all time according to the internet Poo tossing  Everyone has been there. Youaposre having a nice time in a new place youaposre not quite comfortable with, sipping on some coffee after dinner. Suddenly your stomach lurches and nature calls. This can be traumatic at the best of times but for one unfortunate woman in the  Bristol dating scene everything that could possibly go wrong did. An amateur gymnast was taking a moment to herself while on a date with a local Bristol Uni student before disaster struck. Realising her deposit would not flush, she panicked and opted to throw the waste out of the window. Talk about love being in the air. The plan was for it to land in the garden where it could easily be blamed on a fox or wandering dog - but best-laid plans ensured there was no easy way out as the flying faeces got lodged between two windows that didnapost open. Now events really hit the fan. Eager to rescue her hurtling turd, the gymnast opted to stage a daring attempt to contort her body into the space where it lay but her athletic experience wasnapost enough, becoming lodged herself in the process.In the end, her date and resident of the house was forced to call the fire brigade to free her from the space. The window got broken forcing the resident to set up a crowdfunding page to pay for the damage.He wrote: Weaposd had a really nice evening. Weaposd had a meal at a well-known chicken restaurant, had a few beers and then gone back to mine for a bottle of wine and a film. Explaining his houseaposs strange unopenable window arrangement he added: It was into this twilight zone that my date had thrown her poo. Rumour has it a second date did in fact take place. Flexible truth  Reddit can be a gold mine for crazy stories. On a message board discussing the worst dates of peoplesapos lives, user u EVRGamer stole the show. They said: When I was in college — many years ago, before the advancement of cellphones and social media — I was chatting with a girl I met on a [bulletin board system] who lived in Long Island, New York. I was  at the time but lied and said I was  because she said she was . We spent a few weeks emailing each other as well as calling each other. We even exchanged pics. When we finally met up, things blew up. Turns out we both lied about our ages. She was really  and lied because she thought she looked younger. She admitted she sent a college photo of herself to me. We still had dinner together, but it was awkward as hell. We never spoke again. Throwing stones  Another user, u bstyledevi, went one better when their date fell apart following a medical emergency. They said: Met her for dinner. We seemed to hit it off well in the first few minutes, until I started feeling the worst pain ever in my side. Turns out I had a kidney stone. I, unfortunately, had to leave very quickly. She then blocked me via text when I abruptly left dinner, so she never got the message that I ended up in the hospital. I didnapost see her for years until we ran into each other at a bar, me with a dferent girlfriend, her with her husband. I explained what had happened she felt pretty bad, but hey, no long-lasting harm done. I bought her and her husband a drink, chatted for a few, and left them to finish their evening together. Finger-licking good In , media outlet BuzzFeed asked their readers to tell them about the worst dates theyaposd been on. While all were harrowing, one stood out in particular.The reader said: I met up with a guy to go out for wings. Before we even ate, he looked me up and down, grabbed my hand as though he was going to kiss it, and then licked it from the tip of my wrist to the tip of my finger. I simply said, aposWell, Iaposm out of here,apos and walked straight out the door to my car and sanitized my hands. Taco Ton Another tale of first date woe to make its way across the Atlantic was reported on last year by the New York Post. The story recounts an ill-fated TikTok creator who was duped into supplying an unusual feast. The woman said: “What’s the worst first date I’ve ever been on  I’m so glad you asked,” “Before I met my smoke-show of a husband, I was on dating apps. This man messages me out of the blue and goes ‘I like your face, let’s go get some food.’ ” “I drove  minutes to his house. He’s standing outside of that,” the regretful gal recounted. “He walks up to my car and he goes, ‘I’ve lost my keys. Can you drive us there ’ “Should I have just left him right there and gone home  Yes. Did I  Absolutely not. Pulling up at the Taco Bell drive-through, things got worse when the fella lent over and said: I would like  tacos, thank you. “We get to the window and he starts patting his body and I was like, ‘Did you forget your wallet ’ The meal is reported to have cost over £. “I buy the  tacos and I asked him, ‘Where do we go now ’ and he said, ‘Back to my house,’ ” “Ok, this is happening. I’m committed to this now, it’s happening.” Arriving at the house, the date reportedly piled the  tacos on the table and at the top of his voice screamed Letaposs Feast! and proceeded to eat the meal in silence. The TikToker is understood to have not set foot in Taco Bell since.

Authorities in Latvia say they are aware of more than  fake profiles featuring snaps of suave Artis Pabriks. One con artist, posing as aposMurphy Townsendapos, swindled Brit Sharon Bulmer out of thousands after he sent her a Facebook message saying he was lonelyapos in May . He spent two years telling her he was a US soldier who needed money to leave Syria and visit her, before she discovered he was not a real person. It was then that the pictures he claimed were of him were actually of Mr Pabriks - the Minister of Defence. The Latvian Defence Office said they have been facing this situation for a long time and have reported over  fake profiles using the ministeraposs images. The government is now warning against the issue. Sharon, from Manchester, is still coming to terms with being conned.  The -year-old said: He asked me to help him and I did, but over the time itaposs got me into huge debt and because I have fallen for this person. I just wanted to help him so much. I know I have been a fool but these are the things we do for love. The person behind the account claimed to be a -year-old man from Washington DC, with a -year-old daughter called Helen. aposMurphyapos told Sharon he was serving with the th Infantry Brigade Combat Team at Base  in Raqqa, Syria. But, when Sharon enquired with the US authorities, she was told there was no aposMurphy Townsendapos on their records at all. She said: He always kept things close to his chest. He doesnapost like me asking questions. Sharon had ended her relationship with her partner of  years in order to start a new le with aposMurphyapos. She then forked out nearly £, over the two-and-a-half year period for ious hospital bills and plane tickets - and is now in £, worth of debt.  Sharon, a team leader at a Covid site, sent aposMurphyapos the cash in Bitcoin. But not once did she video call him - as heaposd told her he wasnapost allowed to at his base. The mum wishes to share her story to stop other people getting tricked the way she has been. Sharon said: I wanted to take my children on holiday, I was going to take them to New York last year, but because he was constantly hammering for money I couldnapost. I want to help anyone out there to not be taken by these idiots and just try and get on with my le. aposMurphyapos first got in touch with Sharon in May  by sending her two Facebook messages. She said: He said he was lonely, heaposs serving in Syria, his we had passed away and he just wanted someone to speak to. He said heaposd been watching me on Facebook, I donapost know what that means. After exchanging a few messages, Sharon gave Murphy her email address and they continued the chat on Google Hangouts.  She said: Murphy was sweet when I first met him, nothing at all made me think anything dferent about him. He was very interesting when I kept talking to him. I felt loved in a way, I felt cared for. I think itaposs because heaposs an older person, he had an older head. At the time Sharon was in a relationship with a man whoaposd sheaposd lived with for  years, and they had two children together. She split up with him in August . In September, after talking online every day, Murphy askedhe could go and visit Sharon in Manchester. After she accepted, he asked her for £, to pay for his flight, and asked her to pay via Bitcoin. But after not hearing from Murphy for a few days, she received a message from a dferent email address, but also with the name Murphy Townsend. They asked for another £, for the plane ticket and, believing it was Murphy, Sharon paid up. At the end of the month, she received a message from someone claiming to be a doctor who said that Murphy had been taken into hospital. She said: He said, aposheaposs unconscious but heaposs okay, everything is going according to plan and weaposre keeping him in hospitalapos. Sharon didnapost ask which hospital he was in but, believing Murphy was injured, she didnapost contact him until he messaged her at the start of October. She said: He wanted to know where Iaposd been when Iaposd not been in contact with him. Thataposs when I told him Iaposd been scammed by someone  using his email address. He couldnapost believe it. Murphy claimed that heaposd been shot in the side on the way to the airport, and that he was due to stay in hospital for another six weeks. He also said he was unable toto the army base because heaposd lied and told them he was leaving to back to his family in the States, rather than his British lover. Sharon then twigged that the messages she got from the second email address was a scam. She said: I said, aposhave you lost anything apos, and he said, aposI lost my computer when I went downapos. So thataposs when I knew thataposs where the scammer came in, they would have had a look at the computer I think.Murphy then asked Sharon for £, to help with his medical bills, which she paid, before announcing that he wanted to leave the army for good and move in with her in Manchester. When he gets out heaposs going back home, sorting a few things out, bringing his daughter over here, and weaposre all setting up a new le, she said. In October , he started asking for weekly payments, between £ and £, to cover the cost of administration fees, airlting fees and to buy him out of his contract. She said: The transactions were long as my arm. Iaposve literally fallen in love with this person, I hope to God he is Murphy. The requests for cash kept coming, with Murphy asking for £, in February  for a trip to the UK, but later claiming heaposd lost the ticket. In August last year, when she asked for pictures of him, he sent her a screenshot of photos from the Facebook profile of aposMike Douglasapos, telling her he couldnapost use social media while on a mission. He also claimed that his original Facebook page had been hacked by the men who stole his computer, and that is why a dferent name of aposMofsjol Dukhanapos has appeared on a page using his photo. In November last year he asked for £, to see his daughter in Washington, and then a further £, for the medical assessment he needed to board the plane that she paid for late last month. Up until a final £ transferred last week, Sharon has paid over £, towards what she believes is getting Murphy out of Syria and to see her. aposMurphyapos also sent her a copy of a letter from aposDr Abdulrahman Alomairapos, a Paediatric Orthopaedic Surgeon. He sent a letter from Al Mouwasat University Hospital that said he was part of a a apospedestrian-vehicle traffic accidentapos in September  that he is currently in intensive care. The letter was dated th January . She said: He is supposed to be in hospital with a serious condition from his accident, but why all of a sudden is he in hospital but never complained about any pain in the year we have been together  The letter is signed by a doctor who treats children with special bones. I donapost get it. Suspecting she has been scammed, Sharon then approached the US Army to ask whether there was anyone named Murphy Townsend serving. They responded saying aposthere is not anyone by the name of Murphy Townsend currently serving in the Army Reserveapos or as a General Officer. They also said that the th Infantry Brigade Combat Team that he claims to be part of is from the Ohio National Guard and not the Army Reserve. There are no LT Generals in that team. She said: I questioned him on that and he turned round and sent to me are you dumb. She hasnapost told her family but Sharon is in thousands of pounds of debt after sending the money to Murphy. She said: My ex does slightly know of him, but he doesnapost know all the ins and outs. No one  know, I want to keep my family out of it. They are starting to be suspicious though. The Latvian Defence Office confirmed it was aware of the continuing issue of identity theft involving the Defence Minister Artis Pabriks. A spokesperson said: Unfortunately, we have been facing this situation for a long time. We receive information about the ious fake profiles that use the name and images of Mr Pabriks on Facebook and Instagram both from the users of the social networks themselves, and our partners and colleagues in other countries. We frequently receive screenshots from people who have been contacted by fraudsters and, recognising the official accounts of the Defence Minister, choose to report them. So far, we have collected and reported to Facebook more than  fake accounts, but the response has been negative. We feel that the security of everyday users both on Facebook and Instagram needs to be strengthened and supported in situations like these, and we encourage Facebook to pay more attention to these kinds of cases.

The long history of the worldaposs most romantic day is bloody and cruel and a world away from the chocolates, teddy bears and last-minute Marks  Spenceraposs flowers of today. Where red blood once dripped menacingly down a bloodied axe, now the colour symbolises love, passion and appreciation of a partner who puts up with left-up toilet seats and clumps of hair in the shower drain.Valentineaposs Day is a chance for couples to really focus an expression of their love to their partner on just one day, particularly for those who canapost be bothered to do it for the other . So what is its history and why do we choose today to mark all things love and romance   Valentineaposs Day is named after Saint Valentine, a martyr recognised by the Catholic Church. This may actually be in reference to one of three people called Valentine and it is not entirely clear how the legend of the day actually started. In Roman times - while most of us enjoy hobbies like yoga, watching football or going to the cinema - it seems Emperor Claudius II had something of a penchant for beheading people called Valentine. It is believed this may be where the legend started - one story says that Valentine was a Christian priest who went against an order by Claudius to ban troops from marrying, believing single men made better soldiers.  The dutul Valentine is said to have gone against this decree and married people in secret, earning himself a death sentence. Another Valentine, this time a bishop, was also beheaded by the bloodthirsty Claudius, while a third Valentine may have let Christians escape Roman prisons. When himself imprisoned, this Valentine is said to have fallen in love with a young girl and wrote her a letter that said from your Valentine. We imagine he also wrote the following poem: Roses are red, Iaposll soon be dead, Before my head is chopped off, You could end up in my bed  ...Or maybe not. How did Valentines Day start   Valentineaposs Day is believed to have started as a replacement for the Roman festival Lupercalia, while others have put forward the theory that it is to commemorate St Valentineaposs death. Lupercalia was a fertility festival in which priests would gather at a cave where founders of Rome Romulus and Remus were said to have been raised by a wolf.  Here, they sacriced a goat and a dog, before cutting the goat hide into strips, dipping it into blood and gently slapping Roman women with it to increase their fertility. For those wanting to celebrate the day with their partner in a more traditional sense, we still recommend chocolates. Perhaps Honey, I sacriced you a goat may not go down as well. How has Valentineaposs Day changed   Valentineaposs Day has changed an awful lot since it first came into being. Aside from the lack of beheadings, it is also unlikely the everyday Flavius and Septimus were blasting George Michael from a boombox at someoneaposs villa window.  Eventually developing into a designated saints day at the end of the fth century, it became more commonly associated with romance around the middle ages. From this time, there are examples of romantic poetry emerging and this only developed further into the festival we celebrate today.

It comes as Moscow relentlessly moved military assets towards Ukraine and conducted war games both in Belarus and around Russia. The scale of the military buildup is said to be the biggest since the Second World War. New social media videos showed tank drills in Leningrad region, and in the Pacic fleet. Military equipment was on the move in Kursk, Belgorod, and Voronezh regions, all with Ukrainian borders, as well as in Liptsek and Saratov. Russian and Belarusian Su-SMs also staged joint patrols over Belarus. Weekly TV review shows on nationwide state channels accused the West of “hysteria” in warning about an impending invasion, which the Kremlin strongly denies it is plotting.  But the same channels alleged Ukraine was poised to attack the Donbas image. Rossiya  show Vesti Nedeli cited a fighter from the separatist region saying Ukrainian nationalists had threatened to “come and kill and butcher you all, and hang your children on wires, like fascists [did]. They continued: “I won’t let this happen, just as everyone  here will not…. “We’ll lie down here, but the enemy will not pass.”  Anchorman Dmitry Kiselyov, described as Vladimir Putin’s propagandist-in-chief, warned that thousands of civilians have been tortured and savagely killed in the Donbas. He also accused the West of stubbornly ignoring the crimes of the Kyiv regime”. The sequence was ominously captioned: “They are preparing to kill.” Likening Ukrainian nationalists to fascists, he spoke of crimes of the little Nazis during their punitive operations in which the numerous victims were civilians, women and children”.  Another TV show, Channel Oneaposs Voskresnoye Vremya accused the West, and first of hyping up the myth of Russian aggression with maniacal stubbornness”. Ukrainian was being pushed towards a force scenario in Donbas by the West. Weekly show Itogi Nedeli on NTV, owned by Gazprom-Media, and Vesti Nedeli claimed the dead in the conflicted highlighted war crimes by Ukraine suggesting the perpetrators should be brought to justice. The West has repeatedly claimed that Russia is seeking a pretext to go to war.  Kiselyov also accused the US and Britain of seeking to erect a cordon sanitaire around Russia.The Russian media continued its onslaught on Foreign Secretary Liz Truss after her visit to Moscow last week.She was poorly educated and ignorant, unable to hold a conversation” and harps on about the same thing like a parrot”. Reports in Ukraine say multiple tycoons have fled the country by private jet after heeding Western warnings that an invasion is imminent.

Every pound raised will add up to help keep children safe.It is free for any school to sign up and once a school has registered, the NSPCC will send it everything it needs to make its Number Day a success.Schools will be sent tips and ideas on how to fundraise, including games and activities resources to help promote Number Day information on keeping children safe from harm and online safety quizzes that can be used with pupils of all ages. After the challenges of the past  months and the disruption that children have faced, we hope it will be a day of fun to look forward to.To sign up to take part in Number Day, all you need to do is visit the NSPCC’s website and search for Number Day and fill in your school’s details using the registration form.Head of Fundraising for NSPCC Scotland Paul CockramSirThere is a real emergency for colleges coming after years of underinvestment. Regarding the sector, the debate on funding should focus on the perilous choices some colleges will now have to make, and on the signicant challenge this Draft Budget poses for the next academic year.The total funding loss of £. million means, for example, freezing recruitment, outsourcing support activities, possible changes to temporary contracts, increasing class sizes and consolidating classes.All of these would be a last resort, however, after years of under investment this Budget leaves no more space to manoeuvre in. Unless there are improvements to the Budget, noticeable changes to colleges are inevitable.We believe this risks Scotland sliding into a skills emergency. Even in the midst of a pandemic colleges have provided world class education and training to hundreds of thousands of students.But in order to continue there has to be investment based in reality. Scotland’s recovery depends on creating year after year a workforce that is qualied and able – but with the proposed Budget settlement, colleges will be challenged in ways not seen for many years.Chair of Colleges Scotland Ken Milroy MBEThe Poverty and Inequality Commissionhas published advice to the Scottish Government on its Child Poverty Delivery Plan -SirOur advice shows that, quite simply, too many children are still experiencing poverty in Scotland. As a society we believe it’s wrong for children’s lives to be restricted by poverty. That’s why the child poverty targets were set.While we know work is ongoing, progress is not enough to meet the targets, and for some measures the position is worsening. Despite a clear commitment, the action taken by the Scottish Government so far is inadequate We need to see Holyrood using all the levers available to end the scourge of child poverty.We need to see action across all areas of Government in order to release families from the constraints of poverty. Providing parents with support to apply for a job, for example, won’t have the impact we wantthe parent can’t get suitable childcare or doesn’t have a reliable bus service to get them to work.Targets to reduce child poverty can be met, however the Scottish Government will have to utilise every opportunity and deliver action faster, coupled with a signicant increase in fundingWe are committed to working with the Scottish Government to eradicate child poverty and ensure it remains one of its top priorities. It will take a concerted joint effort from PIC, the Scottish Government and its partners to resolve these issues and ensure our children have the very best start in le.Chair of the Poverty and Inequality Commission Bill Scott "},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll youth bolsters oban rugby","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowWhile Mid Argyll under- rugby players took the field at Slockavullin on January  for their first match in two years # as reported in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser # three other Mid Argyll youngsters were playing that day, but  miles away in Oban.Murray MacDonald, Vinnie Buckley and Rhys Coffield helped Oban Lorne to a  #  victory over Loch Lomond in the West Youth under- Cup.In the match, played at Glencruitten, Murray bagged a hat-trick of tries and, not content with simply crossing the whitewash, he banged over eight conversions.The next match for Mid Argyll under-s is away to Glasgow High Kelvinsideon Sunday February , followed by a home tie versus Whitecraigs on February  at Slockavullin.PICS:Lochgilphead inside centre Murray MacDonald es over the line to score for Oban Lorne in the under- match v Loch Lomond at Glencruitten.

Amongst these is Beinn Odhar # its southern slopes lying firmly in the county of Stirling, whilst its summit stands proudly in Argyll.If approached from the west, north or south you could keep your toes in Argyll all day. Unless on a round of Corbetts # there are five here that make a fine challenge # it is easier to approach the Corbett via its gentler slopes from Tyndrum. This also gives the opportunity to explore the adit # access tunnel # and old lead mine on its higher slopes where the mineral vein continuation from Sron nan Colan is exposed. The Beinn Odhar lead mining venture appears to have been a short one but the views once the summit is reached are tremendous.Leaving the car park, cross the A and head left passing the Tyndrum Inn, the Green Welly Stop and cross the bridge.Turn right immediately after crossing the bridge to join the West Highland Waynorthwards, passing the KeyStore.You will need to stay on the WHW for the next .km as it slowly climbs out of Tyndrum with the A on your left and the Crom Allton your right until you reach the bridges over the burn and railway.Cross the bridges and go through the gate at the north end. You will be heading up on to the open hillside to your right.You now have a choice. Either head straight up in a north easterly direction picking your own route on the grassy slopes or veer slightly right back to the Crom Allt to pick up a faint path. If you use the latter, ensure you head upwards at around NN. Either way you will tend to end up on sections of the old mining path as it zigs zags upwards by default due to the natural line of the slope.Once you reach m # after approximately .km depending on how direct your route was # the ground becomes stonier. The adit and mine are higher to your left, northwest, on the crest of the ridgeline, whereas the faint path runs just under this soyou want to explore them it is worth scrabbling up the rocks to have a look. The bottom of the adit starts at around ms.Heading up from the adit and mine # or path # the route flattens out, passing a lochan and the county boundary to your left. Ahead, the final ascent is best tackled by heading northeast then northwest to follow the hill’s natural line. There are no particular dficulties.The summit views are fabulous and an excellent panorama of Beinn Dorain can be had from the steep northern slopes above Coire Luaidh.It is easiest todown the southwestern slopes you ascended, but other possibilities could include some of the neighbouring Corbetts, especially the longer days in summer.Safety in the outdoorsThe described routes and accompanying information are there to be used as a guide and do not replace the use of map and compass and the skills required to use them.Whilst every effort is made to ensure the route is accurate at the time of going to print,  please be aware track and path closures can happen at any time.

It would goodit was cut back and trimmed or a fence erected to help deter people. It is not aesthetically pleasing with graffiti along the route. The lighting looked to be sufficient but there was one broken lamp post which will be fixed by SBC. It is also a very lonely path to walk. Therefore, I would also say that some areas would require CCTV as a deterrent and to know that there are eyes watching.”The path is a busy and popular walkway which starts opposite Asda and continues to Tweedbank and beyond. Most of the path is not overlooked by houses which makes it potentially vulnerable and there have been a number of incidents over the years.Community Councillor Bill White said: “The walk we did was well worthwhile. It pointed out a few points and identied a few areas of concern to look at and hopefully we can take this forward.“I’ve already said that I think we should change the name of it from the Black Path. There needs to be some landscaping done and there are some areas where a little more lighting could help. CCTV would certainly put people off and maybe make people feel a bit safer. But there is certainly a lot of work to be done I think more down toward the Gasworks but it’s a nice walk.Sergeant Granger offered advice to people using the path. He said: : “Fortunately such incidents fairly rare in the Borders, but we can’t become complacent. My advice would be to be aware of your own surroundings, keep your phone about you and let your family knowyou’re walking along here late at night. If you are walking on the path and you are concerned about anyone you see, oryou think you’re being followed, then just contact the police straight away on .\".removeCommunity council chairperson Judith Cleghorn said: “It could be such a beautul walk. We could make it into quite an attraction, but it needs a lot of work on it.”Community Councillor John Birnie added: “I believe that street lighting is not the problem.

It was the Pupils who would concede it.In another move tinged with disappointment # the match referee failing to spot another offside in the build-up # a ball from the right flank was swung in to a player in an offside position, who held the ball up and worked it back to a central area where Finnart’s captain unleashed a strong strike high into the Pupils’ net.And while the Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils continued to work hard to claw their way back into the match they were undone with only a few minutes remaining by a smart counter-attack at the other end, which allowed Finnart’s number  to score from close range with a low, side-footed effort.On reflection, the Pupils were undone by moments of business-like quality – certainly for goals two and four from their hosts # and perhaps their own naivety against a canny and disciplined side who are challenging to win the WoSFL’s Division Four.Nevertheless, the Pupils can reflect on a decent, determined performance for much of this match.

He then spoke to me of affairs of the county.To my delight, he displayed a wide and intimate knowledge of Argyll, a county for which he said he had a deep affection.He was keenly interested in all I told him.After about  minutes# conversation, I asked permission to withdraw but His Majesty said, #Do wait a little longer, please.#I came away with the feeling that I had left a gracious King, a great gentleman and, above all, a good and sincere man. His consideration, courtesy and kindliness, combined with his deep interest in the welfare of his people in Argyll impressed me to the full and are an indelible memory.Campbeltown Town Council resolved into a special public session during the committee meetings on Monday night to offer their respectful sympathy, devotion and loyalty to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, The Queen Mother and members of the Royal Family.Provost R Wallace Greenlees, who presided, rose to remind members of the Town Council of #the sorrowful time# through which the nation was passing and to ask them to approve of the following resolution:The resolution was unanimously carried.These addresses were duly sealed with the Common Seal of the Royal Burgh of Campbeltown and signed in name and on behalf of the Provost, Magistrates and Councillors by Provost R Wallace Greenlees and by Mr A I B Stewart, Town Clerk.Among the messages of condolence sent to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth were:The Lord Lieutenant has received the following acknowledgement from Her Majesty the Queen: #Am sincerely grateful for your message.

He was protected well by right back Conner Brown, left back Burns and central defensive pairing Ross Souden and captain Keith Mitchell.With less than  minutes remaining, McCallum – who had shted into central midfield with the introduction of second sub and debutant Cameron Wylie at right midfield – intercepted a ball from a Glenvale player, his tackle putting Lang one on one with the hosts# keeper.Lang showed excellent composure for his tender years to slot the ball low into the net with his right foot, just inside the box, his teammates joining him in celebration.After seeing out the final five minutes of regulation time, four nervy minutes of added time were played as Glenvale pushed for an equaliser.In the st minute, Ferguson was called upon to make the save of the day, stopping a powerful Glenvale drive from  yards out, before a Pupils defender cleared the danger.The final whistle sounded soon after and the Pupils# squad and management could cheer a hard-earned, much-needed win, especially impressive considering the inexperience of much of the squad, who are still learning at this level, but judging by this showing, are certainly contributing.Tomorrow , the Pupils host high-flying Harmony Row from Govan, at Kintyre Park.Kick-off pm.

Avoid plantingthe ground is frozen or extremely waterlogged.Your planting hole should be no deeper than the roots, but at least three times the diameter of the root ball.It#s a good idea to soak bare-rooted trees for about  minutes before planting.Place the tree in the planting hole so the first flare of roots on the stem are level with the soil surface. If you plant the tree too deep, it can result in rot and disease.You may need to insert a stake for top heavy or larger trees. Refill the planting hole, firm gently and water in.Drought stress is common in newly-planted trees so make sure you keep watering throughout the growing season. The quantity required will y with soil type, but  to  litres per square metre – four to six watering cans – each week in dry weather will do the trick.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to sow lettuce seeds – both under cover and outside.If you start now, it will give you a continuous supply that can be harvested throughout the year.Sow in modules or fibre pots under cover to have lettuces ready to plant outside in four to six weeks. You can also sow outdoors, but use cloches or small poly tunnels until next month when the soil has warmed up. They will also provide your lettuce seedlings with protection from birds and slugs.Good ieties to start now include cut-and-come again Salad Bowl – oak leaved, high yield with green and red ieties a cos such as Lobjoits Green – dense, crisp heads with self folding leaves or the small butterhead Tom Thumb – perfect for growing in small spaces, it matures early and has a mild taste.Prepare for spring by carrying out basic maintenance.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, this month there are signs of the approaching spring, with bulbs appearing and wildle waking up as light levels and temperatures increase.There#s plenty to do indoors this month to prepare for the season ahead.Outdoors, as the garden comes to le, it#s time to prune shrubs and climbers, such as wisteria, as well as evergreen hedges.CAPTION:If one of your gardening new year resolutions was to plant a tree, now is the time to make that a reality.

held two online sessions recently to highlight the project, amid concern by Musselburgh and District Angling Clubabout the issue of mine water discharge, fearing it was having “a negative effect on the fish and invertebrate communities in the South Esk”.These concerns predate the recent pollution incident in the River Esk last month.Residents who attended the Coal Authority sessions heard more details about the plans for the treatment scheme at Dalkeith, which will remove iron and manganese from water flowing from a historical drainage tunnel adjacent to Newmills Road, known locally as Junkies Adit.The tunnel is linked tothe extensive underground coal mine workings in the Midlothian area.In recent years, the amount of mine water discharging from Junkies Adit has been increasing and the water quality has been deteriorating, the Coal Authority said.The organisation explained that the water affected was visibly orange, which was a result of naturally occurring iron dissolving in the mine water underground, which then became solid as it mixed with air and settled out of the water.In recent years, the discolouration has become more visible further downstream and could affect the river’s ecologyleft untreated, the Coal Authority added.The Coal Authority has been working with the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyand other partners to monitor the problem and develop a solution.Details for planning approval will be submitted shortly, with a view to starting the main construction later this year.More detailed design work will be done in the coming months to develop the scheme, and residents and stakeholders will have the chance to provide feedback as the designs progress.John Batty, Coal Authority project manager, said: “I think a lot of residents are keen to see this project progress as the river is so visibly orange as a result of the mine water, and the negative impact on the wildle and ecology is widely known.“The mine workings are complex so it has taken many years to get to this point.“We have been working to carry out studies and investigations, evaluate potential solutions and establish water quality by taking water samples on a regular basis through the challenges of the pandemic.“We have undertaken research using a test treatment scheme on site last spring that provided a large amount of information to feed into the designs.”Paul Butler, SEPA mining sector lead, said: “We are pleased that the progress we have made together has enabled the Coal Authority to provide information on the proposals for a new mine water treatment scheme at the site of Junkies Adit.”Colin Beattie, MSP for Midlothian North and Musselburgh, said: “I think it is important that the public are involved with the process and it is vital public engagement continues as the scheme progresses.“I look forward to seeing the next stages of the treatment scheme and working with the Coal Authority, SEPA and the local community on this project.”Steven Dalgleish, of MDAA, said: “No faulting the Coal Authority’s commitment to the cause but the association remains gravely concerned that funding may not appear for this project.“From some of our own research, it seems that this may remain an issue for over  years, leaving the South Esk between Dalkeith and its junction with the North Esk effectively dead and useless as the main salmon and sea

Council to refuse planning permission for the flats, describing the new build as “over-dominant”.The proposal by Edinburgh-based BY Developments Ltd would see the bungalow on Gullane Main Street demolished and replaced by a passivhaus building containing four three-bedroom flats.In a letter to the local authority, the community council said that while it did not object to the idea of flats on the site, the current proposals were too big and it added that the design appeared to include windows which were just one metre from neighbouring houses, adding: “It is hard to imagine this providing adequate lighting.”The proposals to replace the house, known as Glen Maree, with the flats aims to make it as sustainable as possible, with its design statement describing the residential development as “net zero”.It will include electric car charging points at a private parking area to the rear of the property, solar  and non-fossil fuel heating systems.The roof design has been created to ensure maximum solar exposure to support the flats and the design statement points out that easy access to public transport is also available to new residents of the flats.It adds: “This development makes efficient use of land, buildings and infrastructure by altering a previously developed plot of land in a town centre rather than a greenfield site on the town periphery, for example.“Industry-leading Scottish cross laminated timber is to form the superstructure, whilst Passivhaus principals of airtightness, heat recovery and solar gain are to be employed to create very efficient, low-energy dwellings.“We believe this strategy will result in a very energy-efficient use of the plot, with the four new apartments using less energy than the existing building.“We intend to create an exemplar development that demonstrates sustainability without compromising design quality.”The design statement adds that the site itself is not in the Gullane Conservation Area but “on the periphery” of it.Despite plans to position the new building eight metres back from the Main Street pavement with a large front garden area, the community council said that the design did not fit the site.It said: “We have no issue with the general principle of creating flatted accommodation on the site.“The particular choice of design, creating four substantial flats across three floors rather than the two of the neighbouring houses, does appear to be over-dominant in scale.“Eventhe building were able to be set slightly further back this effect could be diminished, but the site appears not to lend itself to this.”The application is available to view on the council planning portal."},{"url":null,"title":"get-covid-test-kits-east-lothian","story":"Mobile units are travelling all around East Lothian in

I’ve been living away from my family and that’s been really tough for me.  “So, just to get this chance, I was so grateful to be part of it. My old man was actually in the crowd with some of my other family. It meant a lot to me to be out there and to represent Scotland. “My Dad was always planning to come over for the Six Nations whether I was selected or not. He’s happy to be here and I’m happy to have him over. He’s loving it. He’ll be here for the rest of the Six Nations. He’s on a bit of a world tour.” While it was a proud day which will live long in the memory for both father and son, there is no escaping the overriding sense of regret that Scotland did not manage to build on their encouraging victory over England last weekend against a depleted Welsh team who were missing over  caps worth of experience to injury.  You can’t help but wonderSaturday wasn’t the day for Scotland to end its long losing run in Cardf which stretches back to , then when are they going to do it  “It was a tough one to take,” Tuipulotu acknowledged. “We didn’t underestimate Wales at all. A lot was said about how we hadn’t come here and won for  years so although we were confident that we could win, I don’t think there was ever a time when that became over-confidence. “To be honest, I didn’t really know how many caps they were missing. When I looked at the team, I saw a quality outfit. So, of course we’re disappointed. It’s a missed opportunity. But we’re going to bounce back. “We’ll go home now, and we’ll try to take it all with us into the next game against France in two weeks’ time.” “I think any team has an advantage when they’re playing at home, it’s similar to us when we’re at Murrayfield, but the way the game was going, they just found a way of sticking in there – especially when we had the lead,” he added. “When they had momentum offensively, they were able to build on it. Ultimately, they’ve pipped us in the end. “But Hoggy [Scotland captain Stuart Hogg] hit the nail on the head in the changing room after the game when he said there’s still a long way to go in this Six Nations and we’re looking forward to getting back out there in our next game.” Tuipulotu was Scotland’s third top carrier on Saturday – behind Hogg and centre partner Chris Harris – with  metres made, and he did okay in defence although the official match stats indicate that he missed two tackles.  He did enough to retain his place in the side, but Cam Redpath is now another week closer to full match fitness following an injury disrupted  months since his debut at the start of the  Six Nations, so there is a good chance that Tuipulotu wull lose his place in the starting XV as head coach Gregor Townsend looks to spice things up for the visit to Murrayfield of Grand Slam chasing France on Saturday th February."},{"url":null,"title":"won-super-bowl-last-night-watch-super-bowl-halftime-show","story":"The US rapper, real name Curtis Jackson, was suspended by his feet from the ceiling of the housing-style set inside the SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, Calornia.Flipping the right way up and dropping down onto a dancefloor he broke into a rendition of his hit song In Da Club.he rapper later poked fun at his strange and somewhat humorous entrance on social media.Posting a meme of a straining boy with a pronounced forehead vein he wrote: “Waiting for @SnoopDogg and @drdre like ok who’s idea was it for me to be upside down again ” Cent joined the all-star line-up of the show, which also included Eminem, Mary J Blige and Kendrick Lamar.Eminem appeared to give a nod to former NFL player Colin Kaepernick, as he took a knee during his Super Bowl halftime show performance.The rapper made the gesture following a performance of his hit song Lose Yourself, bowing his head while the show continued.Kaepernick, a former quarterback for the San Francisco ers, received worldwide attention in  for kneeling during the national anthem to protest against police brutality and racial injustice.His actions sparked an intense debate, with US President Donald Trump calling for the NFL to fire any player who did not stand for the anthem.On the pitch, Matthew Stafford and Cooper Kupp combined for a championship-winning drive to lead the Los Angeles Rams to a - victory over the Cincinnati Bengals in Super Bowl LVI.After a tight three quarters, the Rams were down - halfway through the fourth and desperately needed an offensive spark following an injury to Odell Beckham Jr, one of Stafford’s key receiving weapons.Kupp, who was named Super Bowl MVP, took it upon himself to fill that void, converting a pivotal fourth and one opportunity to keep the host side’s hopes alive.WORLD CHAMPS, BABY!!📺: #SBLVI on NBC pic LGbFugLJThe Stafford and Kupp connection proved unstoppable, with the duo marching downfield seemingly at will before claiming the lead with a one-yard touchdown.With : left on the clock, the Bengals still had an opportunity to steal the victory.

The new working schedule was phased in over eight months from April last year. Read more: Glasgow workplace parking fees could bring in £millionStaff at all levels of the business working across Vault City’s office, brewery and bar operations are already loving the change – with many hailing the increased flexibility around annual leave, appointments and childcare improved mental health and increased energy and productivity levels. Edinburgh-based Vault City team will be on a four day working week Charlotte Brooke, Vault City’s Brewing’s sales coordinator, said: “The work le balance it affords me allows me to enjoy my time to the fullest and arrange long-weekends away without needing to take time off. I feel less tired, more mentally and emotionally well rested and generally just better. I don’t think I could go back to a five-day week now.” The four-day week concept had been in Vault City co-founder Steven Smith Hay’s mind since he left a corporate career which included spells at BT and TSG to start the firm in . Despite expecting signicant challenges – particularly implementing it around the unpredictable production schedule of a fully ing commercial brewery – he knew it was important to create the right work-le balance for his team. Read more: Buchanan Galleries future: We have the opportunity to reconfigure the beating heart of Glasgow, says city urbanistHe said: “Scaling up something that started small is challenging at the best of times, but committing to a four-day work week when you’ve more than tripled in size, and opened a bar could seem like an impossible stretch. However, we believe work-le balance is a big part of our culture, and something worth striving for.“A four-day working week is completely unheard of in the brewing world, an industry which has developed a reputation for long hours and hard graft. To be honest, that was part of my motivation – to create a dferent way of working. It hasn’t come without its challenges, though.“As the first commercial brewery in the UK to offer this way of working to our team, there was no blueprint to follow. Initially it takes discipline not to fall back into old habits of a five-day working pattern, especially because many of our customers work in hospitality where weekends are often when they’re most active.”  Vendy Rychtecka, Production Supervisor, Vault City Although the office teams at Vault City adapted quickly to the new work schedule during last year’s phased introduction, the brewing arm of the business threw up more obstacles – particularly as fermentation doesn’t work to a set timetable. However, Mr Smith has maintained its commitment to the move, and the team have been creative in identying solutions. Mr Smith said: “Brewing beer can be unpredictable, especially in the world of mixed fermentation. There are certain situations when brewing and packaging releases which can change quickly and require immediate attention. In those moments we’ve had to use overtime pay to make sure we kept things under control. It’s not something you want to become habitual, but it is necessary from time to time, and crucially it’s fair.” The move to a four-day week has been made more challenging by the speed and scale of Vault City Brewing’s recent growth, with the firm almost tripling in size over the past year, including a raft of new hires, products, and the opening The Wee Vault in Edinburgh’s Haymarket.Turnover at Vault City Brewing has risen by % in the past  months, with the brewery’s output increasing to around , litres of beer each year. Vault City puts the success down to a spike in direct to consumerdemand during the pandemic, and new contracts with Tesco for ‘sessionable’ product lines including Tropical Sour, and Raspberry Sour which have proved popular with ‘craft curious’ consumers. Mr Smith, who began brewing beers in his Murrayfield kitchen in , said: “It’s been fun to watch the fanbase grow. Many of these people then followed our brewery and started trying our more adventurous, higher ABV releases. It’s all part of the sour beer revolution – and we’re delighted to be at the vanguard.” A trial of a four-day week without pay reduction is set to take place in Scotland, with  businesses already signing up to a trial in England and Wales set to begin later this year. Mr Smith added: \"It’s a big transition from a standard way of working, so we’d also recommend a phased approach. It’s daunting, and there will be stumbling blocks throughout but the resulting benefits in staff morale, work-le balance and productivity will be visible.” "},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7197700.jpg?type=article-full","title":"glasgow-council-facing-20m-black-hole-budget","story":"Glasgow City Councillors will meet later this week to set the budget for the coming financial year but trade union UNISON says it looks like yet another year of cuts to service budgets and claimed council tax rises are on the cards.Brian Smith, UNISON Branch Secretary, said: \"Glasgows councillors should use some of the citys unallocated reserves of £M to set a \"no cuts\" budget, and then lead a proper campaign to win more money for the city.

Glasgows women workers will make sure of that.”Glasgow City Council treasurer Councillor Ricky Bell, SNP, said he is in a “much happier” position than he was just weeks ago.He claimed an extra £.m from the Scottish Government had improved the financial outlook, with plans now being put in place to invest in the city, including to help tackle the cost of living crisis.Read more: Glasgow workplace parking fees could bring in £millionA document was drawn up setting out savings options suggested by council officers when the city was facing a £m spending gap.It included withdrawing a holiday scheme which provides free food to children, scrapping swimming lessons for primary aged pupils and increasing crematorium charges.Councillor Bell said the annual paper is produced to give councillors options for discussion and he has managed “to avoid most of the horrible ones” in the report. However, cuts will need to be made to cover the almost £m shortfall and a council tax rise could be on the cards. Although funding allocated by the Scottish Government was with an expectation that council tax increases will not exceed inflation.The city treasurer has a “provisional” proposal for council tax, which he believes is “reasonable”, but negotiations are ongoing with opposition parties.Glasgow’s SNP group doesn’t have enough councillors to pass a budget without support from other groups and has struck deals with the Greens in recent years.At stage two of the Scottish Government budget, finance secretary Kate Forbes announced a further £m for local government, including £.m for Glasgow, which reduced the city’s spending gap to £.m.Councillor Bell said: “That has made a huge dference for us. It’s meant we can start to look at some investment.“We’re in a much better position than we were after Kate Forbes’ first announcement, when I was really concerned.“Clearly, I don’t think there is ever going to be enough money for Glasgow, but we’ve got to work with what we’ve got.”Council tax levels will be set later this week Cllr Bell said he has listened to city residents, who have raised issues over cleansing services, potholes and the cost of living crisis.However, unions and the Glasgow Against Closures group are planning to protest outside the city chambers ahead of the meeting and want to see a “no cuts budget” announced.Mr Smith added: “We don’t know the city government’s proposals yet however most expect at least a % rise in council tax, which raises just under £m.“That would leave around £m in service cuts or higher charges for the people of Glasgow.” "},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13474096.jpg?type=article-full","title":"king-tuts-wah-wah-hut-ready-get-back-action","story":"Covid restrictions limited any opportunity to celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of one of the world’s finest live music bars. Two years later, King Tut’s have more opportunity this month to revel in their position as a showcase for the grassroots scene, a magnet for emerging groups on tour and a place for indie musical pilgrimage. The -capacity standing gig venue with a bar and kitchen was opened with the intention of booking bands all through the week. It quickly became somewhere for a performer to make a breakthrough. The tone was set during an almost mythical two-week period in  when The Verve and Radiohead played headline shows, Muse took to the stage supported by Soulwax, then Oasis were discovered while playing a support slot and signed by Alan McGee of Creation Records.Bfy Clyro, Franz Ferdinand and Travis notched up early gigs here.Promoter Chris Loomes, the venue booker at King Tut’s, continues to talk to talent from around Scotland, encouraging pitches for shows that will help build an audience.“I have a band from Gourock on tonight,” he says. “They were buzzing when they found out they had the gig. It still has that prestige.”There’s no graffiti in the dressing rooms – “we’ve had a bit of a glow up” – but you can see the names and years of some of the more famous shows written on the stairs up to the venue and there’s a complete set of signed showtime sheets from each performance in the offices of DF Concerts upstairs.Lewis Capaldi played a sold-out show in  before he had released any music. His support act was The Snuts. Both have gone on to have number one albums since that night.“I spend more time in King Tut’s than I do in my own house, but it’s not lost on me how special a place it is,” Chris says.“You look back at these hot gigs. The Strokes in . When Oasis played there was probably less than  people in the room. The great thing is that these moments in music keep happening. The Lewis Capaldi show ... he talked about that being a breakout moment for him as an artist. He’s from West Lothian like The Snuts and he just askedhis pals could support him and that became a big moment for them too. They both offer support slots to other Scottish acts now. Everybody is trying to give each other a leg up.”Guitar bands provide the core but there’s space for Scottish electronic musicians, grime artists and rappers.“We see all kinds of styles of music coming from a punky, DIY scene. There’s so much. We’re at a really good spot right now,” Chris says enthusiastically. “Tut’s is also a hub for the live industry in Glasgow. It’s not just where an artist is born. Promoters cut their teeth here or sound engineers or lighting techs. It’s where you can arrive and figure some things out.”Some of the biggest bands in the world still find their way back to King Tut’s as a cultural touchstone, a marker for the way their music started to be discovered. The Killers left the main stage at TRSNMT in  and jumped in a van to the venue, immediately playing a loud, sweaty -minute set.“They had just played to , for a televised festival gig, then immediately played to  people here.“It was a midnight show ... just hit after hit.

This falls in with ‘Candlemas’ on nd February as a Christian festival and a traditional end of the Christmas season. Candlemas commemorates the presentation of the infant Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem as described in St Luke’s Gospel and when some denominations bring candles to their church. Candlemas is also one of the so-called ‘Quarter-days’ marking the changing seasons of winter, spring, summer and autumn. It is followed by Whitsun, Lammas Day and Martinmas as the term-days with their administrative and legal implications for the payment of rents and flittings. Saint Bride or Saint Bridget has been one of the most popular of the saints of the celtic church. Of course, there were many ‘Bridgets’, but the one whose festival date is on st February was ‘Bridget of Kildare’ in Leinster whose death was dated to AD . Bridget was one of the patron saints of Ireland and is remembered in the tradition of plaiting rush crosses around st February to set over doors and windows to protect the home from fire and other danger.   or the endearing ‘Bride’s little fosterling’.’ . ‘Bride’s Day, the birthday of spring’. century, traditions of Saint Bride were collected by Alexander Carmichael among his prayers, hymns, blessings and charms from the Hebrides. He suggests that accounts of Saint Bride were not easily recovered and summarised the tradition: ‘The serpent is supposed to emerge from its hollow among the hills on St Bride’s Day, and a propitiatory hymn was sung to it. Only one verse of this hymn has been obtained, apparently the first. It dfers in dferent localities: [Early on Bride’s mornThe serpent shall come from the hole, I shall not molest the serpent, Nor will the serpent molest me.’ The snake is a powerful element in mythology and religion and a creature to be respected as the ‘hymn’ makes clear. Familiar in the snake coiled round the rod, it is a symbol of medicine and healing, and the appearance of the adder or snake on Saint Bride’s Day offers a feeling of hope and transformation, and of turning the corner with the ening of the days. . century. .!... !"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Donnie-Munro-picture-scaled.jpg","title":"special donnie munro concert to bring skye live back with a","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe island#s premier music festival is set toin style on Thursday th May # following a two-year break due to the pandemic # with an opening night extravaganza # ‘Coming Home: An Evening with Donnie Munro and friends’ and featuring special guests in the form of multi-award-winning Gaelic supergroup Mànran.The show will be Donnie’s first in his hometown since  and will see him perform with a full eight-piece band line-up on the spectacular Skye Live Festival site at Am Meall in Portree. The singer said: #This offers me a fantastic opportunity to bring this amazing line-up, featuring some of Scotland’s top musicians together, for an exclusive performance to open this year’s Skye Live Festival.He added: #It has been fantastic to watch the festival grow in strength, year on year, in what must be one of the most special and unique festival locations anywhere in the world, and to see it become internationally recognised as, ‘one of the best boutique festivals in the country’, is just fantastic for the island, and it is such a great honour for me to be invited to be a part of it all and to be bringing the music back home here to where it all began.#Joining Donnie Munro on the night will be Mànran, internationally recognised as one of the most iconic and respected Scottish bands on the road today.

The results each year help build a picture of wildle across the country which is important for conservation efforts.“Last year, more than one million people all over the UK counted over  million birds. Setting some quiet time aside to watch your local wildle and get outside does not only benefit conservation and science, but can also be beneficial to your mental and physical health as you will spend time outside, either by yourself or with your friends or family, to concentrate on nature at your doorstep.These events are part of Council’s #embRACE programme which celebrates ersity in Mid and East Antrim.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”"},{"url":null,"title":"barrys amusements could be open for business again by easter","story":"Enter your code here\" required\"\"The access code entered is not valid.

Credit: Margaret McLaughlinJohn BreslinFebruary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailBarry’s Amusement Park could be open again as early as Easter, locals in Portrush are predicting — prompting delight that the lights may be switched back on at the iconic north coast landmark.Read MoreGalway firm rides in to save Barry’s Amusements in Co Antrim’s PortrushGenerations of families made a holiday pilgrimage to the north Antrim attraction’s dodgems, ghost train and rollercoasters before its sale in .A Galway-based park operator has now signed a lease with the owner of the site to manage the park, according to reports.An official announcement that the Curry family from Salthill has signed a lease with new owner, developer Michael Herbert, is expected this week, along with opening times, according to sources.The deal was first reported by Love Ballymena, which also shared video footage of the lights on the Big Dipper and the Wurlitzer last Thursday.A Curry’s Fun Park spokesperson told the online portal dates will be announced for the reopening soon. The company, which first expressed an interest in buying the park after it first went on the market in late , later told the Belfastit was unable to confirm or deny the reports, but added that a press release will be issued soon to clary all matters.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Locals are hearing the deal is done, said Willie Gregg, a charity worker and bartender at The Harbour bar.He added: “It can only be good but you do wonder how they think they can make it workthe other peopledecided to sell. But it is terrica new generation of kids will be able to experience the place.”The well-known Portrush personality believes “there is not a family on the island who has not been to Barry’s” but it is very dficult to put a price on how much it means to the local economy.While the numbers visiting Barry’s before it closed is not known, local business people say it is on a par with other famous attractions on the north coast. It is estimated its presence in the town brings in at least £m and up to £m every season, based on approximately , visitors.“You cannot put a price on Barry’s,” said Gregg.It emerged last year the . acre plot in the heart of the seaside town had been bought by the property developer, Michael Herbert.The Trufelli family, owners since its opening in , had expressed hope it would continue as an amusement park when they placed it on the market for £.m in November . Indeed, Curry’s had expressed an early interest, with owner Owen Curry saying at the time: “We would be the perfect contenders to take over Barry’s Amusements in Portrush.“We are a family-run business now in its fourth generation with specialist knowledge of how to run an amusement park and would certainly be a frontrunner in the purchasing of this type of business.”But in May last year it was revealed the site was being marketed as a development opportunity, raising fears it would never open as a park again.Mr Gregg added: “The date has to be announced but hopefully it is going to be by Easter. I would imagine it is a lot better being open, it will add a breath of fresh air again.”The park was recently used as a filming location for the third and final series of Derry Girls. This prompted Ian McElhinney, who plays Grandad, to remark they were the “last kids in the playground”. This may prove to be very premature, much to the delight of many.Most ReadSuzanne BreenOpinionWhat a fool Ian Paisley has been… century after Carson and in midst of their Brexit betrayal, the penny finally drops over Tory infidelityGalway firm rides in to save Barry’s Amusements in Co Antrim’s PortrushPrince Andrew: Where the streets have no shame… Northern Ireland residents split over renaming places bearing his nameLoyalist caught with Belfast bookies massacre gun has Stormont-funded jobIan Paisley ‘took most freebies of all Northern Ireland MPs’… DUP veteran accepted tickets to Open and British Grand PrixTop VideosPlayVideo: Shots fired over coffin of IRA veteran Victor NotarantonioPlayVideo: Surging waves at Benone Strand engulf cars and sweep pet baskets out to sea PlayBelfast man creates positive Covid test with fruit drinkLatest Northern IrelandMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageUniversity staff begin strike action in Northern IrelandBelfast Lord Mayor Kate Nicholl dons £ second hand dress for Dublin trip in show of sustainabilityMatthew MacNabb in tribute to late friend Ryan Freeman in Dancing with the Stars performance£m spent sending ‘upwards of ,’ NHS patients to private hospitals in Northern Ireland during Covid pandemic, figures showLatestNatalie Imbruglia reveals ‘best gt’ about The Masked SingerDangerous on-the-run sex offender had been refused parole five timesMyanmar’s Aung San Suu Kyi goes on trial over ‘election fraud’Graham Potter relishing facing Cristiano Ronaldo and says quality is still thereAccused subpostmaster ‘contemplated suicide’ over system flaws,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The power-sharing Executive collapsed after Paul Givan was removed as first minister by his party in its ongoing protest against the Northern Ireland Protocol.If Article  is triggered, a Whitehall source said the DUP could renominate a first minister and go back into power-sharing before the May election.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up However, leader Jeffrey Donaldson — who warned the British government it had until February  to find a solution — said ing would depend on “the scope of the Article  action”.“It’s what triggering Article  actually leads to that is important,” said the Lagan Valley MP.It is understood discussions between DUP figures and the European Research Groupat Westminster in recent weeks also focused on unionist fears of a Sinn Féin first minister.“There is a strong view by some that to protect the Union you can’t have a nationalist first minister. They would argue it could lead to a greater chance of a Border poll,” said the Whitehall source. The ERG, which has  Conservative Euro-sceptic MPs among its membership and helped to dispose of Theresa May as prime minister in , is now piling on the pressure on the DUP’s behalf.“The ERG was mostly against the Chequers Agreement in  and the DUP was vital in going along with that. The fact is, it did not turn out as was intended,” said a Tory party source.“There is a feeling that there is a bit of a debt to the DUP to sort this out — they helped us and have ended up in a pretty bad situation.”Invoking the Brexit clause would allow the DUP to show unionists — and especially the loyalists who threatened violence over the protocol — that it had pushed the prime minister to act. “Donaldson had no option but to quit the Executive, given the haemorrhaging of support for the Assembly among unionists. Number  promised for months to act, and the cavalry never arrived,” said the source. “Something has got to happen before the Assembly election. Otherwise you are going to end up with a Sinn Féin first minister and power-sharing not ing.”Both the ERG and DUP have also warned Johnson of a perceived threat to power-sharing, saying a Michelle O’Neill-led government “would damage the union and Northern Ireland”.The Conservative source explained ERG members meet Johnson regularly, and added it “would be a mistake to think the prime minister needs persuading on triggering Article ”.He said Northern Ireland Secretary of State Brandon Lewis has spent the last few days in Washington “paving the wave for Article  and negotiation” by “stressing a dferent Good Friday Agreement interpretation”.A UK government spokesperson confirmed Mr Lewis had met with members of the US administration and Congress for discussions “including on the Northern Ireland Protocol”. “Our preference is to find a consensual solution to address the signicant issues on the ground. However, as we have said consistently, we will use the Article  safeguard mechanismsolutions cannot be found,” said the spokesperson. Read MoreBrandon Lewis says there is ‘landing ground’ for solving NI Protocol problemsKill protocol or the Union is finished, TUV chief tells rallyForeign Secretary Liz Truss will talk with Vice President Maros Sefcovic to continue these discussions.It is understood that in the past week, DUP figures have complained to Conservatives that DUP MPs turn up to take part in debates and “get nothing” — while Sinn Féin does not take its seats and “yet the government uses Westminster to give them what they want, like the Irish Language Act”.However, a bone of contention is the DUP’s regular meetings with the Loyalist Communities Council , which represents the Ulster Defence Association , Ulster Volunteer Forceand Red Hand Commando — including one meeting just hours before it decided to quit the Executive. Some loyalist paramilitaries have endorsed violence on the streets of Northern Ireland in the past two years, with a number of incidents causing disruption and harm. That’s why the DUP and ERG believe Article  is key, as it can be triggered in the event the protocol is causing “serious economic, societal or environmental dficulties.”“There is almost an incentive to create disturbances, because it was the threat of disturbances that created it in the first place,” said an ERG source.This assertion has been backed up by a member of the UVF, who believes loyalist violence has “made people realise the threats were serious”.“Everyone thought it was all a bit of a joke, and then loyalists threatened bombs going off in Limerick and burnt a few buses. No one in loyalism has forgotten the role Dublin played in talking up IRA violence. Someone recently remarked that a loud bang in Dublin is perhaps necessary to make them hear,” he said.Johnson’s premiership is hanging by a thread after he broke Covid regulations by attending several lockdown parties, but he knowshe wants to remain in office, he will have to appease those who oppose the protocol.The ERG source says it is now liaising with the DUP as a “force multiplier” at Westminster, with Tory whips indicating they would like to be able to work with its nine MPs because “you never know when they might be needed again and the prime minister knows this”.Last week in a rare move, ERG members attended debates on Northern Ireland in the House of Commons. It was an apparent move to firm up the DUP’s support, but there are claims some of its pro-Brexit Tory backbenchers are simply “weaponising” the Stormont crisis.“In Number , they are keen that the DUP has a good showing in the election. But they need to have some sort of win before the Assembly election,” the source said. “At the momentis scheduling legislation on the Irish Language Act, which is fairly innocuous and would be a win for Sinn Féin. “There has to be something to balance it out — and the protocol is the obvious thing.” Former Brexit Minister David Jones, the deputy chairman of the ERG, said he shares the DUP’s “concerns about the damage the protocol is doing to the Good Friday Agreement”.He said the protocol requires a “permanent resolution” and criticised past comments on the issue by Tánaiste Leo Varadkar and Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney.“The Irish government needs to realise the immense ongoing damage being done to Northern Ireland and UK-Irish relations by the EU’s intransigence. The EU, Ireland and the UK need to sit down and discuss alternative ways to protect the EU’s single market,” Jones said.“If an agreement is not possible, then the UK will invoke Article  and legislate to remove the Irish Sea border, uphold the GFA and restore Northern Ireland’s equal position within the UK.”However, one Whitehall source said the plot by the ERG and the DUP “beggars belief”. “At a time of international crisis and need for a focus on the economic well-being of Northern Ireland’s citizens after the worst pandemic in recent history, it beggars belief that both the ERG and the DUP have been trying to take advantage of the PM’s weakened position, to avoid working on the compromises that are necessary.”Asked to explain the DUP’s relationship with the ERG, MLA Deborah Armstrong did not respond. Instead, she said her party has been “telling London, Dublin and Washington that the protocol is not supported by a single elected unionist”.“Progress is only made when deals have the support of unionists and nationalists.  “We will continue to make our case at Westminster and where — ultimately we will take that case to the people in the election.”Related topicsSir Jeffrey DonaldsonBoris JohnsonNI ProtocolMost ReadSuzanne BreenOpinionWhat a fool Ian Paisley has been… century after Carson and in midst of their Brexit betrayal, the penny finally drops over Tory infidelityGalway firm rides in to save Barry’s Amusements in Co Antrim’s PortrushPrince Andrew: Where the streets have no shame… Northern Ireland residents split over renaming places bearing his nameLoyalist caught with Belfast bookies massacre gun has Stormont-funded jobIan Paisley ‘took most freebies of all Northern Ireland MPs’… DUP veteran accepted tickets to Open and British Grand PrixTop VideosPlayVideo: Shots fired over coffin of IRA veteran Victor NotarantonioPlayVideo: Surging waves at Benone Strand engulf cars and sweep pet baskets out to sea PlayBelfast man creates positive Covid test with fruit drinkLatest Northern IrelandMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageUniversity staff begin strike action in Northern IrelandBelfast Lord Mayor Kate Nicholl dons £ second hand dress for Dublin trip in show of sustainabilityMatthew MacNabb in tribute to late friend Ryan Freeman in Dancing with the Stars performance£m spent sending ‘upwards of ,’ NHS patients to private hospitals in Northern Ireland during Covid pandemic, figures showLatestMyanmar’s Aung San Suu Kyi goes on trial over ‘election fraud’Graham Potter relishing facing Cristiano Ronaldo and says quality is still thereAccused subpostmaster ‘contemplated suicide’ over system flawsStudents support striking lecturers with cake and biscuitsTyrone ‘not proud’ of Armagh brawl as red carded players to attend GAA disciplinary meeting tonight,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I got a diploma in counselling skills, which I really enjoyed, but coaching is more forward focused and that’s where I think people need a lot of help.”After obtaining a le coach certication, Joanne subsequently became a certied professional addiction recovery coach after taking a course at an American Institute of recovery and addiction.“I’ve invested a lot in my own learning — it cost £, to become a le coach and another £, to become a recovery coach,” she said.“I had to do both. I couldn’t become a recovery coach without being a le only.”Joanne, whose husband Davidworks in insurance, admitted that leaving her existing job is “very scary”.“Last year Fujitsu offered a voluntary exit and I thought this was my opportunity,” she said.“I want to give it a go. We have such a need for it here. It’s so popular in America. I got all my help from coaches in England because I went on the same journey. We don’t have it here.”Joanne, who has two sons — Callumand Jamie— with David, is still building her customer base.She recently launched a new group and has just finished a Dry January support group that had  people in it.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseFamily le: Joanne with husband David and sons Callum and Jamie FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueFamily le: Joanne with husband David and sons Callum and JamieAlthough her business is now primarily online, she’s moving into an office on the Rossdowney Road — called ‘Soul Cottage’ — this week to facilitate one-on-one sessions.When asked to describe what she does, she replied: “You could almost say ‘early intervention’.“The big problem in this area is that there’s still a lot of stigma and shame around alcohol dependency and attempting to get away from it,” she said.“People think you have to be really addicted and have hit a rock bottom — maybe lost your job or your family — but for a lot of the women I work with, it has become a habit they’re relying on alcohol more than they want to be.”She added: “Lockdown has a lot to answer for. People who normally drank only at weekends started to drink more often, until it became an every night thing.“The boundaries they had in place before, like having to go to the office, would have prevented them drinking — but suddenly those boundaries were gone.”Joanne said she works with people “who don’t have a physical dependency, because I’m not medically trained”.“It’s where it has become a habit and people aren’t happy with it,” she said.“A lot of my clients have mental health issues in line with their alcohol intake, where their hangovers are lasting up to four days and they’ve had enough of that. They want to make a change.”Women seek out Joannethey think they’re drinking too much and want to stop, but they don’t have the willpower to do it themselves.“When someone contacts me I set up a ‘discovery call’ — that’s a free -minute Zoom session, basically to assess the issues the person is experiencing, what they want help with and to give them an opportunity to explain what’s going on with them,” she said.“If we feel that we’re a fit for each other, I’ll send my details to the client to sign upthey want.”The minimum package is three sessions, and there’s also another ‘Break the Alcohol Habit’ package.“That’s a -week package with six fortnightly one-to-one sessions, with message access to me outside of those sessions,” she said.“It also includes access to my closed Facebook group, which is called Women Like Us. That’s a closed community and I have a Zoom call on that every week.”It costs £ per session £ for a block of three and £ for a -week programme.Even though Joanne herself has never hit “rock bottom”, her own experience of going down the wrong road has helped lead her to this new career.“I started drinking at an early age — I had my first drink at  or ,” she recalled.“Through the teen years I was drinking every weekend.“But by the time I reached  , it wasn’t for fun anymore. I got diagnosed with anxiety and depression around then, so a lot of the drinking was to numb those feelings.”She added: “My father was an alcoholic. I have always been aware of what it can lead to. He tried and tried but couldn’t get better so I think that was always in the back of my head.”Joanne’s dad Billy McDevitt passed away from emphysemain . Her mum Chris, who didn’t drink, died in . Joanne is the youngest of six — she has three sisters and two brothers. Watching her dad battle his terrying addiction was the inspiration for her wanting to help others.“He would’ve gone out drinking and coming back in a bad state,” she recalled.“There was always shouting. I remember him throwing a plate at my mammy once.“It was so sad because he was a completely dferent person when he wasn’t drinking.“I think that’s why my mum always stood by him. And then when daddy developed emphysema he couldn’t go out because he was on oxygen. But he still drank every day.”In her own situation, Joanne began to notice that “one was never enough and two was too many”.“Once I got started, I didn’t care about anything ,” she said.“I wanted to keep the party going. That was alright until I grew up and had responsibilities.“After the kids were born, when we went out I was back to thinking I was  again, drinking far too much.“It wasn’t all the time, but I didn’t like the way it was going. I only drank at weekends, unless I was away with work.“I often spent four days climbing the walls after a big night out because the hangovers – or ‘hanganxiety’ as I call it — were fierce.“My thoughts were getting darker and the drink wasn’t helping. I thought there had to be more to le.“Towards the end I had blackouts. There was no pleasure anymore. It was dangerous.”Joanne recalled how she attempted to stop.“I did Dry January and Sober October and they gave me short breaks,” she said.“I visited a website called Soberistas. I went to one AA meeting once, although I never identied with the alcoholic label.“The women I work with don’t identy with being alcoholic, but they know they’re using alcohol for the wrong reasons and they need to make a change.“AA works for many people and has done amazing things but it’s not for everyone. There’s a new way of getting sober now through community.”Joanne stopped drinking just over three years ago, after an “uneventful night” on December , , and soon realised that “connection is so important” when you decide to quit.“I realised that our only option was AA, and I thought we needed something more,” she said.“I knew I wanted to go into an area where I could have a helping role because I worked with two recovery coaches myself and they inspired me.”Joanne believes many people are in the “grey area drinking” stage“That’s where people don’t identy as alcoholics they’re not dependent, but it has become too much of a habit,” she said.‘Sober shaming’, however, where people are made to feel guilty about not taking a drink, remains a massive problem.“You feel you have to justy not drinking,” she said.“And alcohol is the only drug that you have to justy not taking.“We tell white lies such as ‘I’m on antibiotics…’“That’s why I used things like Dry January — because nobody is going to say anything to youyou say you’re doing that to raise money for charity.”Joanne recalled how dficult it was to take the first step towards abstinence.“When I came out with my own story, the hardest part was in the beginning and it’s something that holds a lot of people back they want to give it a go but they’re too afraid about what people in their le are going to say,” she said.“With sober shaming, people feel pressured into drinking by others telling them there’s nothing wrong with them... because they haven’t hit rock bottom.“But nobody knows what goes on in someone ’s head.“I tell clients thatit’s a problem for them, it’s a problem. If they’re not happy, they know best. But it is so dficult in our society.”Joanne said the “sober curious community” is growing, as is the alcohol-free drinks market.“Lots of people have written memoirs about their experiences with alcohol,” she said.“There are books and guides, and coaches — just not many here.“A record number of people did Dry January this year and there has been a generational sht in attitude towards alcohol. Younger people don’t think it’s cool to go out and get drunk.”Although Joanne is keen to expand her client base, she doesn’t expect it to make her a millionaire.“For me, it’s not about making money,” she said.“We all have to pay the bills but it’s about having an alternative here, and building that community.”Joanne’s husband and friends are very supportive of her — perhaps because she’s still a party girl at heart.“Believe me, I can still go out there and be the last one on the dance floor…”Related topicsUniversity of UlsterMore On University of Ulster PremiumNorthern Ireland’s rural property prices rise, but values in Derry slump by £kNI university staff begin -day strike action over pay and ‘brutal’ pension cuts PremiumStudent numbers drop at Magee despite countless commitments to expandUlster University and Queen’s make their Sigerson Cup exitUlster University reach Sigerson Cup quarter-finals with defeat of MTU CorkMost ReadSuzanne BreenOpinionWhat a fool Ian Paisley has been… century after Carson and in midst of their Brexit betrayal, the penny finally drops over Tory infidelityGalway firm rides in to save Barry’s Amusements in Co Antrim’s PortrushPrince Andrew: Where the streets have no shame… Northern Ireland residents split over renaming places bearing his nameLoyalist caught with Belfast bookies massacre gun has Stormont-funded jobIan Paisley ‘took most freebies of all Northern Ireland MPs’… DUP veteran accepted tickets to Open and British Grand PrixTop VideosPlayVideo: Shots fired over coffin of IRA veteran Victor NotarantonioPlayVideo: Surging waves at Benone Strand engulf cars and sweep pet baskets out to sea PlayBelfast man creates positive Covid test with fruit drinkLatest Northern IrelandMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageUniversity staff begin strike action in Northern IrelandBelfast Lord Mayor Kate Nicholl dons £ second hand dress for Dublin trip in show of sustainabilityMatthew MacNabb in tribute to late friend Ryan Freeman in Dancing with the Stars performance£m spent sending ‘upwards of ,’ NHS patients to private hospitals in Northern Ireland during Covid pandemic, figures showLatestNatalie Imbruglia reveals ‘best gt’ about The Masked SingerDangerous on-the-run sex offender had been refused parole five timesMyanmar’s Aung San Suu Kyi goes on trial over ‘election fraud’Graham Potter relishing facing Cristiano Ronaldo and says quality is still thereAccused subpostmaster ‘contemplated suicide’ over system flaws,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have to follow the example of St Patrick and bring the light to recallsothers.ldquoWe have to start again, bringing the light of Christ into our hearts, our families and into our homes. We all know these are days of darkness, we have been living through them, days of fear and anxiety. We need the joy of the gospel, the joy of Christ, joy brought to Ireland by St Patrick.Fr Alexander continued: ldquoEach of us has to ask ourselves, what am I going to do to bring the light of faith to others  Generations of our ancestors kept the faith alive. What are you going to do to keep the faith alive  Let us revive our faith and go forward with St Patrick.Archbishop Jude Thaddeus told the congregation that St Patrick was not sent by to Ireland ldquoby God by chance.ldquoHis mission in Ireland was a deliberate intention of God, he continued. ldquoWe can read this in St Patrickrsquos writings and from the example he left behind. When St Patrick wanted to come back to Ireland, there was a lot of opposition. In his time, there were many missionaries, including bishops and priests. We have hardly heard of many of these, but we all know about St Patrick. This is very striking. Why is it so ldquoSt Patrick did not speak much, he didnrsquot write much. Today there are too many words ndash words, words, words ndash written words, spoken words, words on the internet, words on the microphone, words on the streets and the market places. There are too many words, just one word is important ndash the Word of God. If we could just listen to even a single Word of God.Referring to the Gospel readings for the feast of Candlemas, the Papal Nuncio added: ldquoOur Lady did not say anything at the Presentation of Our Lord, she kept everything in her heart. In the entire Gospel. St Joseph speaks only two words. Sometimes we speak too many words and we lose orientation and get confused. Only one word is important ndash the Word of God ndash we should listen to the Word of God. St Patrick listened to the Word of God.Speaking afterwards of his visit, Archbishop Okolo said: ldquoIt was indeed nice and uplting, praying together on that holy ground, on which St Patrick trod.Next week, the All Ireland Novena journeys to Slane where St Patrick lit the Paschal fire.The Novena can be watched online at pm via the parish webcam..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9Feburary2020_Panto.jpg","title":"Children on stage for The Wizard of Oz show  ","story":"THE abundance of musical and dramatic talent at the Patrician Youth Centre in Downpatrick is back on show for the first time in almost two years.A young and enthusiastic cast presented the pantomime, The Wizard of Oz, last week.Performing Arts and live productions at the Patrician paused in March  with the onset of Covid- and ensuing pandemic.Determined to get going again, staff and members worked on Tom Whalleyrsquos new pantomime production of the very popular musical The Wizard of Oz.Despite many ongoing Covid disruptions were delighted to have a performance which was live streamed last week.Unfortunately, in the lead-up to the event some of the principal cast members were Covid isolating.On the day before the performance leading lady Shona Gardiner, who was to play Dorothy, tested positive.In true showbiz tradition, the show had to go on and a telephone call from a former Patrician member saved the day.Mairead OrsquoHare, who played Dorothy in the Patricianrsquos  production of the Wizard of Oz, volunteered to stand in to read the role and sing the ever-popular songs.

I donrsquot see any of the issues that have been highlighted as costing a signicant amount. If they can be implemented, they would make a tangible dference to harbour users. I hope that progress can be made soon for the good of all harbour users.Thanking Cllr Devlin for her work to improve safety for sea swimmers at the harbour, South Down MLA Colin McGrath said he looked forward to ldquomuch-needed changes in Newcastle.He also believes that the series of measures outlined for the harbour could be used as a template by the local authority for open water swimming and cold water therapy across the district.Mr McGrath added: ldquoWe are fortunate to be surrounded by such beautul coastline which has many locations for accessing the water, but itrsquos vital that we make the activity as safe as possible in a select number of locations that ensure an equitable offering across the council area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9February2020_CD.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  February 12th%2C 1992  ","story":"ARDGLASS ndash The fishing fleet in Ardglass is facing a potential crisis following a slump in the crucially-important prawn market.Demand for prawns has ped dramatically because of the recession, resulting in depressed prices and trawler men struggling to meet running costs.Yesterday, fishermenrsquos leader Dick James said: ldquoWe are not yet in a crisis, but one is fast developing.Mr James, who is chief executive of the Northern Ireland Fish Producersrsquo Organisation, has called on the Government to introduce a decommissioning scheme which would enable trawler owners to leave the industry.ldquoA decommissioning scheme would go a long way towards solving the problem. At present, we have too many boasts chasing too few fish, he remarked.Ironically, the situation has been partly caused by the fishermen catching too many prawns.Last monthrsquos good weather resulted in better-then-expected landing which further depressed the already-weakened market ndash prawn are currently selling at less than pound a stone, compared to pound a stone a year ago.However, the general recession in the economy has been the main stumbling block. As demand continues to drop, processors are keeping stocks in cold storage and are not in a position to buy additional supplies at the quayside.ldquoWe had good prices until last April. Then the market slumped and prices drop. Unfortunately, fishermanrsquos costs havenrsquot come down accordingly, Mr James said.Mr James said depression in other sectors of the industry has heightened the problem.He also believes the decommission scheme has the support of most trawler owners in Ardglass.ldquoWe are talking about the survival of the fleet as a whole. Decommissioning would help owners who are otherwise unable to get out of the industry.ldquoAnd because most of the boats are undermanned, it would to not lead to large scale redundancies among crewmen, he added.CROSSGAR ndash A Crossgar man who is renowned for his excellent time-keeping was honoured last week.Mr James McCormick, who has been winding the clock on the old Kilmore Parish Church Hall for over  years, has decided to hang up his key and retire from his conscientious job.James took over the job when the clock was repaired in  and has continued his labour of love ever since.Now the hall has been sold to the Ulster Wildle Trust for its new headquarters building, James has decided tocall it a day and has retired from his winding duties.In recognition of his timeless work over the years the development officer of the Wildle Trust, Mr Niall Timmins, presented Mr McCormick with a window box of herbs to remind him of his former winding le.STRANGFORD ndash The creation of a single committee to oversee the management of Strangford Lough has been widely welcomed.The Ulster Unionist MP for Strangford, Mr John Taylor, said the announcement represents a ldquomajor U-turn by the Government, while the Strangford Lough Nature Conservation Association described it as a ldquoserious attempt to ensure the future of the lough.The new committee is to be launched in the spring and will have a membership of around  drawn from special interest groups, such as agriculture, fishing, conservation and recreation.Member will also be appointed from nominations put forward by Down District and Ards Borough Councils, the National Trust and the Council for Nature Conservation and the Countryside.The announcement marks something of a turn-around by the Environment Minister, Mr Richard Needham, who less than six months ago proposed a two-tier management structure for the lough.The proposal was widely criticised by groups who argued that such a structure would be unwieldy and would prevent local people from having a proper influence over decision making.By scrapping that approach, Mr Needham appears to have bowed to local pressure. The Minister says the new initiative has been produced ldquofollowing extensive consultation with organisations and iniduals concerned with the future of Strangford Lough.SAINTFIELD ndash Work is to start next week leading to the provision of new traffic lights in Saintfield.The townrsquos Ulster Unionist councillor, Mr William Biggerstaff, said yesterday that preliminary work will begin on Monday for the provision of the lights at the main crossroads in the town.ldquoI welcome this commitment.

Fortunately for The Blues they had an able replacement in Christopher Magee.This early unsettlement, along with the travelling support, spurred the away side on and soon the league leaders were showing why they are just that.Gareth Keenan was denied a golden opportunity courtesy of a point blank save from Turley as Comber continued to apply pressure in the early stages. Kilmore responded well to this and remained calm on the ball.Following some quick passing from Matthew Stewart to team-mate Anton McGrattan, the Kilmore number ten played in strike partner Joe McKinney, who was adjudged to have been fouled in the danger area and won a penalty kick.Kilmorersquos McGrattan stepped up but his effort was fantastically saved by the outstretching Andrew Topping, who pushed the ball around the post and out for a corner to the frustration of the home fans.The resultant corner was headed over the Comber crossbar by Kilmore defender Jack Larkin as the away side relished in escaping potential punishment.The visitors went back in search of the opening goals immediately after, with Keenan again seeing his efforts thwarted by the Kilmore custodian.The game quickly developed into an end to end contest with chances coming thick and fast at both ends.Kilmorersquos McKinney saw his headed effort go wide with the goal seemingly gaping before his left footed effort blazed over the bar after he was neatly played through by McGrattan.Comberrsquos Brandon Nelson delivered an inviting corner to the head of team-mate Stuart Moore, although he failed to make the most of his chance.Despite the weather, things began heating up on the pitch with numerous crunching tackles on display.Kilmore captain, Niall McCarthy, escaped with just a warning following his high challenge on Comber winger Nelson although the visiting sidersquos Moore wasnrsquot as lucky after he was awarded a yellow for clattering substitute Magee.A new face was on show within the Kilmore ranks in the form of midfielder Barry Walsh. The former Killyleagh YC player impressed throughout his debut and controlled the middle of the park at ious stages throughout the game.With both the tempo and tensions high, the whistle sounded a full two minutes early to signal half-time.Comber kicked off after the interval but it was the hosts who would be awarded the first big chance of the half.Following a piercing run into the opposing defence, Kilmorersquos McKinney was brought down awarding team-mate McGrattan to test lsquokeeper Topping from  yards with the resultant free-kick.However, the Comber custodian wasnrsquot required to spring into action as the ball whisked past the wrong side of the upright.The visitors seemed to be pressed further back into their half and attempted to respond quickly.Dylan Wilson smartly dispatched of the ball on a quick counter-attack to team-mate and captain, Simon Hanna, although the number eight was halted in his tracks unfairly by Magee.For this, the Kilmore defender was the latest name to enter the refereersquos books. The home side had the advantage of the wind and decided to use this repeatedly through long ranged passes in hopes of manufacturing an attack.McKinney came close on a few occasions as he engaged in multiple footraces with Comberrsquos Reece Whittle, although often the home striker would stray onto the bounds of offside.Kilmore hit a purple patch in the opening quarter of the second half, with Comberrsquos first chance of the restart coming on the hour mark.Nelson was left unmarked at the back post after a ball was lofted into his path from skipper Hanna. However, he shanked his left-footed effort and allowed his Kilmore counterparts to remain unscathed.Despite this miss, Nelsonrsquos effort served as a reminder to the opposition that Comber was very much still a threat on the counter.The Kilmore support were up in arms minutes later when they thought a Comber hand was used to prevent a McGrattan strike from hitting its target, although these appeals were quickly shut down.Comber substitute, Ciaran Gillan, picked up a yellow card in his attempts to clear the ball from his half ndash much to the disagreement of his sidersquos management team.The visitors would be soon ruing more than a yellow card as the resultant free-kick proved costly on the  minute mark.A delicately placed McGrattan delivery floated into the path of captain McCarthy for the Kilmore skipper to head with conviction past Topping and finally open the scoring.Anton McGrattan picked up a rather needless yellow soon after for thumping the ball away amongst the celebrations as the atmosphere inside the park reached fever pitch.Comber defender Bradley Porter received a yellow card minutes later for his tackle on McKinney before the Kilmore striker suffered the same fate after he ended up on the ground in what the referee deemed as simulation.The trend of yellow cards continued with Comber captain Hanna, who landed his name in the book for exchanging some ill-advised words with the official ten minutes from full-time.As expected, the final minutes of the contest were a nervous affair for the home side, who werenrsquot committing as many bodies forward in hopes of securing a shutout.Naturally, this invited pressure from Comber, who desperately sought to spoil the Kilmore party.lsquoKeeper Turley kept his concentration for the full duration of the match and thwarted the last two efforts from Comber, with Wilson coming close before his team-mate Tumilson was denied dramatically in injury time.This signied the last piece of action as the referee brought his whistle to his lips to the relief of the Kilmore support.Following the conclusion goal scorer and man of the match, Niall McCarthy, gave his thoughts on his sidersquos impressive victory.ldquoIt was a battle, the pitch was very heavy and I think it just came down to who wanted it more, he said.ldquoWe knew with Comber coming down here that they are a very physical, very fit team, who are well-drilled.ldquoHowever, we firmly believe in our camp that we are the best team in the league.

However, by pm the taped route was ready, the registration was complete and the nervous but excited youngsters were warming up in anticipation.Primary Four and under lined up, first the boys and then the girls. With vests down to their knees and a few anxious glances to parents, it seemed that they were almost too young for such a task but once the whistle blew they set off like rockets round the m circuit.Harry McVeigh, for Newcastle AC, was the clear winner in the boysrsquo race and Aoe Maguireheld a five second lead to win the girlsrsquo race.Primary Five saw the girls and boys combined in the one race and the winners were John McElroyand Emily Kerr . The  metres didnrsquot seem a bother to either of these young athletes.Ryan Thorntonwent off hard for the P win and Saorlaith McAleenanwas the epitome of focus as she headed to the line to come first in the P girls.With  entrants and the distance now one kilometre, it was a challenging race.The P looked an experienced bunch as they gathered at the start.Many have been racing each other in the Flahavanrsquos XC Series for schools so there were scores to be settled. Maisie McVeighwas taking no chances and after a short tussle, she shrugged off the rest of the field and ran solo to take the P girlsrsquo victory.Fiachna McAleenanalso showed his mettle leading home the P boys. This was raced over m.It was great to see the support for the younger ones, not just from parents but from older siblings and club mates, who ran along side each race yelling at the younger ones to encourage them to work hard right to the finish line.On more than one occasion there were groups breaching the line as an inseparable unit and joint times had to be awarded. This was exciting for spectators and a learning experience for the runners.In time they will develop the ability to pace over the course to keep their position but leave a little in the tank for a sprint finishrequired.The series is about participation as well as competition and all runners get a point for their club provided they finish the race.This helps to engender club spirit and creates a charged atmosphere.The post primary runners were well warmed up from their cheerleading efforts on the sideline so they were primed for racing when it was eventually their turn.In Years Eight, Nine and Ten, the girls outnumbered the boys in each category but by Year  plus, it was the reverse.Still, it was good to see healthy numbers out to take part overall in the post primary end of things. The distance for year eight was m and Erin Easton , who won the girlsrsquo race by eight seconds, looked controlled throughout. Aaron OrsquoBoylehad an exciting sprint to the line to snatch glory in Year Eight boys.Emma Stewartcovered the m Year Nine girlsrsquo race at great speed to place first girl and Alex Robinson seemed to revel in the extra running as the gap between him and the second runner stretched out as the race proceeded.Year Ten boys and girls ran together as there were  when combined.The m race allowed spectators to get multiple glimpses as the they looped round the field.Aaron Lennonwon his race comfortably and Edana Butterfieldhad a similar outcome in the girlsrsquo category.The finale was Year  and up. This had a mix of gender as well as year groups. The athletes seemed to have doubled in height compared to the first race of the day and they looked powerful and committed as they loped past with long strides.The two kilometre race was a display of pacing and control with the speed picking up in the last lap.Ollie Robinsonmade sure he held his lead to the line and Amy McCartanran strongly to come first in the girlsrsquo section.Racing completed there was a flurry to clear up before the next shower and many hands made light work.Thanks are due to all the volunteers ndash both those who are involved on the day and those who do the admin behind the scenes. The commitment of the young runnersis highly commendable and the continued backing of McGrady Financial Services is much appreciated.These young folk are the future of our clubs and the sport in general and all those who are facilitating this, know that it is time well spent.The next race is in Tollymore Forest Park on March .

Finnerty eventually notched the next score for his Galway outfit, before the goal scorer, Conroy, would kick over from distance ndash albeit with some wind assistance.The hosts seemed to fighting an uphill battle as the wind battered around Pairc Esler in favour of the visiting side, with Conroy once again managing to point from long range.This opened up a five point winning margin with the Mourne men desperately needing scores on the board.However, the weather could not be at fault for all of their shortcomings as they struggled with the impressive Galway forward line.Walsh was once again involved when he surged past the Down defence before setting up team-mate Owen Gallagher for an easy score.Cormac McCartan attempted to get the home side back into the contest with what seemed like an easy kick over from  metres, although the wind made sure the ball hung in the air before ping comfortably into the hands of Galway lsquokeeper Conor Flaherty.Downrsquos Andrew Gilmore did convert his point three minutes later but as per the theme of the match, Galway replied quickly through Tomo Culhane, who took the mark and scored at the other end.Galway introduced the ing Damien Comer to the fray and with his first touch of the ball he also took the mark and made no mistake with his chance to secure another point for the visitors.Walsh was relishing the blustery conditions and was firing from will at all angles, with one such effort sailing over the black spot from around  metres before the half-time whistle.This signied the last score of a half that contained very few positives for McCartanrsquos side.Half-time: Down - Galway -.The Mourne men registered the opening score of the second half, courtesy of a Barry OrsquoHagan free.Two minutes later, home supporters were perhaps left a little surprised when a goal opportunity presented itself but Cormac McCartan opted instead to play it safe and fire over the bar.Nevertheless, Down had scored two points answered and soon OrsquoHagan would ensure a third after he took the mark and converted the chance.OrsquoHagan continued his impressive start to the second half when he kicked over once again following a turnover in possession.It was now Galway who was struggling with the wind, with Kieran Molloy witnessing his straightforward point from  metres halted by the breeze.Passionate ranting from Down manager, James McCartan, saw him pick up a yellow after exchanging words with the fourth official but there was no denying his side at their tails up.A wide mark from Galwayrsquos Paul Kelly encouraged the hosts further but Gallagher eventually notched his sidersquos first point after the interval following twenty minutes of action.Despite all of Downrsquos hard work, the scoreboard still favoured the visitors by five points in what was a sobering reminder of the home outfitrsquos poor first half display.It didnrsquot help the hosts when Comer notched the next score before Walsh followed suit with a trio of converted frees.Galway attempted to inflict further damage at the death as Tony Gill barrelled down on goal, although he was dragged down before he could unleash his shot.Continuing his impressive kicking form from frees, Walsh once again converted to complete his sidersquos scoring.However, it would be Downrsquos Gilmore who would register the final score of the contest with the last kick of the game, as he curled his left-footed effort over the bar in added time.Following the final whistle, Down manager James McCartan reflected on his sidersquos performance.ldquoWe are disappointed, the game was closer than the six point margin but we lost it in the first half, he said.ldquoWe let Galway play and we werenrsquot putting bodies on the line.

This is testament to our land management, meaning there is ample food resources available for them.He continued: ldquoBarn owl diet consists of mainly wood mice, pygmy shrews and young rats, which in turn are attracted to the estatersquos mature woodland and areas of grass scrubland which regularly throw out grain to encourage a good population of rodents.ldquoWe hope that these barn owls will keep coming back year after year and continue to add vital numbers to our small and vulnerable Northern Irish population.Mark is receiving support from Ulster Wildle through their barn owl conservation work.Katy Bell, Senior Conservation Officer, explains why this pair is so important.ldquo has been a dficult year for our already struggling barn owl population. The wet and extremely hot weather meant that most of our barn owl nest sites failed, so we were thrilled to hear this news.ldquoLuckily, this pair couldnrsquot have chosen a more sympathetic farm to set up home with wild bird cover, meadows and mature hedgerows providing plentul foraging habitat and food for barn owls to thrive.She continued: ldquoWith fewer than  breeding pairs of barn owls estimated to be left in Northern Ireland, farmers and landowners play a key role in securing their future.ldquoBy working together, we can help protect precious nest sites, monitor these beautul birds and provide help and advice on owl-friendly farming.The chicks were kindly ringed by David Galbraith, a licenced volunteer ringer from the British Trust for Ornithology .This will generate important information on the birdsrsquo survival, productivity and movement - and is non-invasive as the birds remain sleepy during the process.Barn owls are legally protected and can be sensitive to disturbance, soyou find a nest site, please leave it alone and get in touch with Ulster Wildle.Tell-tale signs to look for include distinctive whitewash pings, feathers and regurgitated pellets of bones and fur.

In the opening  minutes a number of early misdemeanours from the travelling team in the tackle, at the breakdown and at scrum led to Friends dominating territory and possession as the game got up and running.Within this period the home team gathered up an eight-point lead through a well struck penalty following a Down High tackle and a quick tapped free kick on the Down five metre line after the front row had been judged to have pushed early in a scrum, which led to a try for the hosts. As the game moved into its middle stages, Down began to find their way back into the game with some eye catching counter attacks from their back three.Meanwhile half backs, George Thompson at scrum half and Ben Cassidy at out half, kicked well at key moments in spite of the wind, to capitalise on space left by Friends in their back field.Just before half time it was following one of these kicks that Down earned a penalty on the Friends ten metre line.Cassidy kicked to the corner and off the resulting line out Down mauled close to Friends line before Ryan Halpin saw an opportunity to barge over the whitewash for a well worked try.Cassidy then reduced arrears to one point with an accurate conversion.Down entered the second half confident with the strong wind now very much in their favour.Things didnrsquot always go their way with some periods when the green defence was severely tested.However, around ten minutes into the half Halpin found himself back on the scoresheet to give Down High the lead for the first time as he strode clear of the covering defence off a well-timed pass from rumbling front row forward, Mark Jackson. Cassidy added the two points to give Down a six-point margin in their favour.With ten minutes to go, Halpin played a key role Downrsquos crucial third try. Captain, Brett Kelly who had an excellent day both in attack and defence, laid the foundations for this score executing a pre-planned set piece play.Following this, George Thompson spotted an overlap on the blindside with Halpin ending up on the ball in a two versus one scenario with full back Alex Watson outside him space.The pass was timed superbly and Watson ed over in the corner for an unconverted try to take the score to -.To their credit, the home side didnrsquot accept that Downrsquos  point lead was a done deal and for the closing ten minutes, applied plenty of pressure.Indeed Friends crossed the line with one minute remaining on the clock for an unconverted try leaving a nervy finish for Down High as they sought to protect their six point lead.The restart offered some territorial respite and all in the travelling squad and those supporting them leapt high with joy when a Friends knock-on gave the referee the cue to blow the final whistle with time well past the  minute mark.Down High now face Sullivan Upper at home in the semi-finals on Saturday, February . In other games at home last week, Down High third XV bowed out of their plate competition at the quarter-final stage with a narrow - loss to Campbell College fourth XV in what was an entertaining fixture, while a select U-  team defeated Wellington College -.The other plaudits of the weekend went to the U- A team, who produced a captivating performance to defeat RBAI - on Saturday morning.The U- B and Cs, also playing RBAI, lost but put in some proud performances demonstrating the impressive depth in this squad..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/12490933.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The spectre of Powellism.By Henry McDonaldSunday, th February , : pm  \"       \"  Enoch Powell with a young Jeffrey Donaldson in  when the current DUP leader was acting as Powell’s election agentAlthough Enoch Powell has been dead for just under a quarter of a century the former South Down MP it seems is disturbing the dreams of the ’ chief commentator this weekend.In his latest outburst of post-Brexit unionist-bashing O’Toole suggests that what is really animating the current leading figure in unionism, Jeffrey Donaldson, is the spirit of Powell.To be fair the Democratic Unionist leader is a le-long admirer of the man his predecessor Dr Ian Paisley once dismissed contemptuously as “the Wolverhampton Wanderer”.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.When Sir Jeffrey was still in the rival Ulster Unionist Party Enoch Powell was one of his heroes. Which was ill judged given that Powell’s old style, outdated colonialist outlook was never going to be a good advertisement for unionism in any form, and certainly not in the st century.Nonetheless, to suggest that Powell is animating the current position of the DUP and indeed all the major unionist parties is an absurd exaggeration. O’Toole caricatures their opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol as akin to being on a ghost train driven by Powell. He clearly needs to get out more especially up in Northern Ireland where he should engage with the voters that support those parties.Whether you are unionist, nationalist or neither it might be a good idea to open a dialogue with the people you are excoriating rather than telling us it was all Enoch Powell’s fault.With the noble exception of Stephen Collins’ intrinsically sensible columns, this type of commentary typies the dismissive, patronising and ill-informed analysis you tend to get about Northern Ireland these days from the Republic’s paper of record. To suggest that Enoch Powell exercises any real influence over current unionist political thinking is itself a throwback to dferent days. Powell’s dismal vision of a UK torn apart by racial isions has been by and large proved wholly wrong. The country is a far more tolerant and open society than it was when Powell made his hysterical ‘Rivers of Blood’ prophecy at the end of the s. The UK’s strength today lies pace Powell in its ethnic and racial ersity, a quality that all the advocates of the Union should be advancing and hailing.It is also outrageous that O’Toole fails to mention the impact of the IRA’s violent campaign on Jeffrey Donaldson’s background and thinking. The DUP MP’s uncle Samuel was one of the first RUC officers murdered by the Provisionals at the start of the Troubles. Throughout three decades of sectarian conflict Donaldson attended many funerals of his constituents, friends and wider family circle who were targeted in that violence. Again, you can be unionist, nationalist or neither or indeed either pro or anti EU but surely no one should ignore the immense and dark influence of those murders and trauma on the development of a politician’s career.O’Toole also references Ted Heath for sacking Powell from the Tory cabinet over his infamous speech. The irony is that Heath presided over policies in Northern Ireland that had disastrous consequences for Northern Ireland. It was Heath not Powell who pushed for the catastrophic decision to impose internment in Northern Ireland. And it was Heath’s government that sent the Parachute Regiment into Londonderry in  leading to the Bloody Sunday massacre. Heath’s legacy, not Powell’s, is the one that haunts this society to this day.As for Brexit O’Toole tries in his column to bequeath the UK leaving the EU to the legacy of Enoch Powell. He forgets that the European Union or what was then the EEC also had its critics from the left as well as the right. One of the most outspoken Eurosceptics on the British political landscape for decades was also one of the strongest advocates for a united Ireland in the House of Commons. His name was Tony Benn.There were lots of leftists too in the Republic of Ireland who protested over what the EU, the European Central Bank and the IMF were doing to Ireland when the Celtic Tiger collapsed during the global financial crash of the mid s. Thousands of them marched through the centre of Dublin to demonstrate against the austerity programme imposed on the Irish from Brussels and Frankfurt. They even included a certain newspaper columnist who denounced the Eurocrats and bankers for their perfidy from the back of a lorry in O’Connell Street.Northern IrelandJeffrey DonaldsonIan Paisley  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most Popular‘Collusive behaviour’ allegations: Orange Order Chief and ex-Special Branch detective Rev Mervyn Gibson adds his voice to chorus of support for RUCTransgenderism: Christian doctor says his legal fight will go on against ruling which slams the Book of GenesisDUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and TUV leader Jim Allister strike a deal to ‘cooperate’ at Assembly election call for UUP leader Doug Beattie to join themNegotiators had their chance: it’s now time to trigger Article Owen Polley: Time we busted some myths about Brexit and unionismMost Popular best backpacking tents UK : lightweight, one-person tents ideal for hikingBest rice cookers : how to make great rice every time, with rice cookers from Tefal, Sage, Russell HobbsMonthly flower subscriptions UK : our favourites, including Bloom and Wild, Freddie’s Flowers, ArenaBest high street wedding dresses UK :  styles of beautul, cheap wedding dress for every type of bride of the best duvets for winter UK: how to chose, synthetic, down or wool fill, and what tog to keep cosy                        This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It was a crude mechanism to show that Brexit came at a cost and the UK was no longer a member of a privileged club.

However, there is a straightforward way to gather the accurate information required to guide the secretary of state. That is to hold an ‘indicative’vote on the subject. The vote could be undertaken as part of one of our regular elections . A small change to current voting legislation might be required to facilitate the vote. Voters would be presented with a separate voting paper containing the two options — remain in the UK, or join a united Ireland. Some people believe that we should not discuss this matter because it is a ‘isive’ issue. Unfortunately, almost every political issue in Northern Ireland is isive, so this should not be a block on seeking conclusive information. The indicative vote is likely to have the side effect of increasing turnout in the election with which it is held. Higher turnouts are usually considered a good thing in a healthy democracy. It is possible that the higher turnout might disproportionately favour unionist parties in terms of seats won. It is also worth noting that British MPs at Westminster used a system of indicative votes in March  when debating the isive issue of Brexit. If the indicative vote in favour of a united Ireland was  per cent or lower, then the issue could be put to bed for seven years. If the vote for a united Ireland was  per cent or higher, then the secretary of state might wish to prepare the groundfor a full, binding referendum within two years. There would be a marginal additional cost in printing the indicative voting papers and counting the votes cast, but at least everyone would know precisely where we stood.

I did meet another one as well as Harry and his surname was the same as Harry’s, but Harry was the one.“We’d been writing to each other roughly over three years before we met.

Once we’d met it was lovely. We missed each other when we weren’t with each other.“Even when Harry was home in Portadown he wrote letters to me then because we didn’t have phones in the house. “When he went to be demobbed in England, that’s the time we really missed each other, the letters were really romantic then – ‘darling’, ‘dreamgirl’ – so dferent.“Reading over those letters, they’re lovely, anybody could read them, there’s no vulgarity, no bad language, I’ve been reminiscing looking over them before we did the programme.”Lily’s granddaughter Hayley, , said: “Whenever you consider it’s things like Tinder now, everything is so quick, the idea of waiting three years to meet someone just doesn’t happen anymore.”She added: “I’m single, but I don’t knowI’d be putting any adverts in the Belfast .”Lily and Harry were married for  years before Harry passed away in  at the age of .When Harry was ill Lily said she enjoyed looking after him.Lily said: “I would do it  times again, it was a pleasure to look after him.”She added: “We had our ups and downs, but I just think, I wouldn’t have liked to have been married to anyone  but Harry... probably nobody  would have put up with me.”She added: “Harry was from Portadown, I was from Glengormley. He travelled up  miles by train every time he came to see me.“We’d go to the pictures all the time, there were some beautul films, really romantic films, we spent most of our time going to the pictures, queuing up outside the Ritz. Sometimes we’d have a meal in the Ritz and they’d have kept a seat for you afterwards in the pictures.”After the married they couple settled in Glengormley, close to Lily’s parents. They went on to have three children – Kim, who lives with Lily, Beverley – Hayley’s mum – and Foster who lives in Australia.Lily said: “I was very fortunate to have three lovely children and three wonderful grandchildren who I am so proud of.

Harry would have loved her.”Of her grandparents story which featured in the BBC NI programme, Hayley said: “I’m so happy that people will get to see the story.“I’ve always known about the letters, but I’ve really enjoyed being able to read them. I don’t think I’d ever read them before we got involved in the programme.“My grandad always used to say, ‘ you can’t be good, be careful’. He loved to see me travel, probably because of his days in the Army.“Stories like this aren’t going to happen again. I wouldn’t get on a bus unless I’d checked on my mobile that the person who’s meeting me at the other end will be there, whereas my gran used to get the train after a letter three days before to arrange it.”Lily and Harry’s story featured in NI Love Stories alongside lots of other lovestruck people from the Province including Trevor and Margo who met as teenagers in .

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityBut, while the overall picture in regards to the potentially deadly virus is improving, a senior Welsh Government minister has issued a stark reminder that the virus remains at large in the community.Speaking at a government press conference instead of first minister Mark Drakeford – who is himself isolating having tested positive for covid - economy minister Vaughan Gething provided the nation with the latest rule changes.However, while he confirmed that the main omicron wave has passed, he also revealed that a sub iant of omicron, the BA. omicron iant, has been found in Wales.The minister revealed that as of today - Friday, February  -  cases of this iant, which is said to be an even more transmissible form of omicron, have been identied across Wales.And it is this particular sub iant which is thought to be the primary reason why Northern Ireland is currently seeing a much higher percentage of positive covid cases relative to its population size, than the other UK nations.Fortunately, while more transmissible, it is thought that omicron is a less severe strain of covid than previous waves, and as such, Wales is continuing with plans to scrap many restrictions which are currently in place – albeit not as drastically as England are slashing their measures at this time.What was said about the sub iant Mr Gething said: “Cases of this even more transmissible form of omicron have been identied in all parts of the UK, and to date, there have been  cases here in Wales.“We will of course continue to keep a very close eye on this emerging development.“The pandemic pressures on our hospitals remain constant.“There are just under , covid- related patients in hospitalat the moment.“And there are  people with covid- in intensive care.“Sickness and absence rates across the NHS have fallen from the peak last month but, workforce issues continue to have an impact on our health services, contributing to wider winter pressures.”.removeWhat are the latest rule changes coming into force From Friday, February , Covid passes will no longer be required to enter venues such as nightclubs, theatres and concert halls  in Wales – although inidual venues and events can continue to ask for themthey wish.What’s more, while face coverings will still be required for now, they will no longer be mandatory in indoor public places – apart from retail, public transport and health and care settings - from Monday, February .From there,the public health conditions continue to improve, the legal requirement to wear face coverings in all remaining settings could be lted by the end of March. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityBute Cottage Nursery is set to merge with Evenlode Primary under Vale of Glamorgan council plans opposed by hundreds.The council’s cabinet was urged to rethink the merger, with some councillors claiming not enough attention was given to a public consultation where most people opposed the plan.Cllr George Carroll, leader of the Conservative group on the Vale council, called in the merger decision to be looked at by the learning and culture scrutiny committee.He said: “That’s a clear and signicant majority of consultees who were opposed to this proposal. Insufficient consideration was made regarding those consultations responses.”The scrutiny committee, which met on Thursday, February , also heard from parents, governors and trade union representatives about their concerns over the merger.Richard Disley, chair of governors at Bute Cottage, said: “It’s been dficult to get our voices heard during this process. Our concerns have always been about the wellbeing of our staff. If the amalgamation happens, the current positions of the majority of nursery staff are only guaranteed for  months.“Long-serving permanent staff members who are in our current budget have job stability, will now only have guaranteed work for  months. Staff haven’t been offered any support from the local authority during this very stressful time.“Bute Cottage should be held up as an example of how things should be done, not merged into a primary school with the sole purpose of fitting into a – year model, for which there is no proof of improved outcomes for children. We have asked for evidence on a number of occasions but none has been forthcoming.”Kate Rees, a parent whose children went to Bute Cottage, said: “It was disappointing that there wasn’t more consideration for the issues we raised. Bute Cottage has its own headteacher, budget, governing body, and specialist staff. Those are the magic ingredients that come together to create the exceptional setting for education..remove“I have three children. All three of them were lucky enough to go to Bute Cottage, and they all attend Evenlode now, and Bute Cottage was just a really wonderful experience for them. I got to know that nursery really well. Because of that I’m absolutely passionate about the provision there.”Concerns over the merger include the possible relocation of the nursery to the Evenlode Primary School site, although this would be several years away and only a potential move and a change in the teaching style. The Vale council has said the merger would help provide continuity and stability for pupils to attend the same school from three to eleven years.Cllr Rhiannon Birch said the concerns were overblown and “disappointing”, and added high teaching standards would be kept after the merger.She said: “They will have the same staff, there will be the same guiding ethos, there will be the same standards of professionalism. To hear some of these speakers, you would think these children are going to be put in a field to poke each other with sticks, rather than having an education.“It’s very disappointing their lack of trust in teaching professionals who will continue to maintain high standards, to provide pastoral care, education and all the dferent aspects of nursery education. It seems to me incredible to believe that all of this should be going out of the window simply because we’re talking about the governing body.”Cllr Lis Burnett, cabinet member for education, said no changes to staff will be made as part of the merger, which would be restricted to how the school and nursery are governed.She said: “A consultation is not a referendum. It’s where we listen to views to see whether there’s any reason why the agreed policy … should not be applied. The nurseries would only be merged at a governance and leadership level, and there would be no change to where they’re operating. Those nurseries are not moving.“There will be no change to staffing or surroundings. There’s no reason to think that anything in terms of teaching and standards of learning in these schools will be altered in any way at all.”Asked about a potential future feasibility study into relocating the nursery next to Evenlode, she said: “Because you would want to see whether you have the best model, and whether it would be betterit were on one site. I’m on record as saying I don’t think it would be feasible.“But there were comments of people who don’t have cars, who live in the Evenlode catchment area, and actually walk from lower Penarth up to the nursery every day and back.“So you have to do a feasibility [study], to see whether or not that would work. But there is such a workload on the st Century Schools team, that unless it was prioritised, it would be a number of years before we could even look at it with the amount of other work.”If approved, the merger of the nursery and the primary school would take effect in September this year. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityCardf International Business Park would be built on farmland east of Cardf Airport in the Vale of Glamorgan.But the plans have attracted heavy criticism from campaigners and politicians fearing the impact on the environment of “concreting over” a working farm.Now Legal and General, the developer behind the scheme, has said the business park would create , jobs and attract £ million investment, boosting the local economy.Andrew McPhillips, Legal and General’s development director of strategic land and major projects, said: “This is a key project for Wales and we know it is important that we continue to communicate our plans to key stakeholders, the community and future partners.“Wales must be open for business for those who want to invest and consider investment in its future global economic development. The land has been allocated for planning within the enterprise zone for a number of years.”As well as building the -hectare business park, the plans involve giving  hectares of farmland to Vale of Glamorgan council, to massively extend the neighbouring Porthkerry Country Park. A corridor of land along Porthkerry Road would also be kept safeguarded, connecting the nearby railway line with Cardf Airport for a potential new train or tram service there.Mr McPhillips said: “We have already agreed the transfer of  hectares of land to the Vale of Glamorgan Council to form an extension to Porthkerry Country Park, for use by the community with added funding for environmental management.“This transfer will provide more public access with connection to the Wales Coastal Path, and access on foot from Porthkerry and Rhoose. From an environmental perspective, this transfer goes beyond mitigation and provides signicant bioersity net gain. There would also be . hectares of green space within the business park.”.removeThe business park would be built on Model Farm, off Port Road, which has been farmed by the Jenkins family for four generations. The family previously said they were “devastated” that they would have to leave the farm, but are hoping to continue their wildflower seed business.Legal and General bought the farm several years ago, and it was earmarked for a major building project in , as part of Vale of Glamorgan council’s local development plan. The site is also in one of eight enterprise zones in Wales, where the Welsh Government is focusing economic development and encouraging businesses to invest.Last summer the Vale council’s planning committee voted to grant permission for the business park at Model Farm. Campaigners then successfully applied for a judicial review, leading to the permission getting quashed. Now, another planning application has been sent to the council, and a public consultation on the plans is running until February .Then in the next few months, councillors on the planning committee will again be asked to vote on whether to approve permission for the business park. The last vote was split along party lines, with nine councillors voting in favour and eight against. With the upcoming local election in May, the political makeup of the committee could change, affecting the next vote.But in the meantime, Legal and General has released new estimates of how Cardf International Business Park could boost the local economy. With overall floorspace of the development covering , square metres, it’s expected the business park could provide space for , full-time employees.Gross value added, which measures local economic output, is expected to be a total of £ million, comprising £ million when the business park is operational and £ million during construction. Building the business park is expected to last a decade, creating  jobs.However, Maxine Levett, a campaigner with Vale Communities Unite, said several questions regarding the plans remain unanswered. She added the business park would be “detrimental” to the community and environment, and was unnecessary with several vacant brownfield sites nearby.She said: “This is a working farm helping feed the community and encouraging bioersity, when the Vale council has declared a climate emergency. The current land available at the Bro St Athans site shows there isn’t a requirement for this type of development, as there are thousands of square metres of brownfield sites waiting to be scooped up.“Who will finance the road works to accommodate the impact of potentially , extra vehicles from this site, on top of additional transport needs from recent residential buildings and the proposed development of Aberthaw power station “Bristol Airport has declared they are increasing their passengers to  million a year. This will greatly impact companies willing to fly out of Cardf Airport. And where is the funding coming from to provide a rail link to a planned transport hub “We will continue to fight this development as we feel it to be detrimental to the community, environment and unnecessary with Aberthaw, St Athan and other locations near to the M corridor better placed to meet employment needs, rather than a working farm.”Contrary to the views of campaigners and some local politicians, Legal and General has claimed it would preserve and enhance the environment. Plans include three kilometres of new hedgerows, and planting five acres of scrub and woodland, as well as extending Porthkerry Country Park.Mr McPhillips said: “Legal and General has been committed to Wales as a progressive investor and substantial employer for many years. This is a project which will increase economic growth and we will continue to pursue the planning viability sensitively with existing stakeholders.“Creating , jobs and investment of £ million must be seen as essential for the future of the Welsh economy, especially next to Cardf Airport. This investment in business infrastructure by Legal and General enhances the Welsh Government’s current major investment in Cardf Airport, a strategic gateway to facilitate international connectivity.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Professor Siobhan ONeill, Mental Health Champion, pictured with Listening Ear volunteers during a visit to the groups office.An emergency   helpline is available for those needing emergency support with mental health. Members of the team provide calls at frequencies set by the clients to check in on how they are. This service has expanded during the pandemic with referrals coming from the Community Mental health team.Detailing what inspired the group’s founders to establish Listening Ear, Brian Kerr, who was the main organiser behind the group’s formation, said: “Men won’t go to a doctor and people here won’t talk about mental health. So how do you address this  You equip peers in all organisations to be able to provide a non judgmental, empathetic listening ear. You train these iniduals to see changes in behaviour and to know what to say and what not to say.“This was the idea behind Listening Ear, to help those who sit around us in sports clubs, Orange Lodges, bands, church groups, voluntary organisations, work and other social settings.”Explaining the impact the organisation has had on the local community and further afield, Brian, who is the group’s treasurer, added: “Society measures deaths, not lives saved. I’m often asked how many lives have been saved by the work of Listening Ear and I can honestly say this will never be known.Listening Ear supported Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Councils Christmas appeal.“An initial conversation may cause a pause for an inidual who comes back for support and assistance.“ We do know of people that are here today that wouldn’t have been but for the support and assistance of the Listening Ear volunteers. We’ve received calls from across the country, England and USA.“The outreach work is non-stop. When we started we thought it would be a one day a week, but the need within the community has resulted in a   service. Voluntary community work does have its ups and downs, with many a time people asking why they put themselves into these roles. However, the reward is when you can see a positive change in a client’s mental health, outlook on le, circumstances, housing or finance.”Over the last two years the group’s volunteers have played a vital role in the area, providing additional services during the Covid pandemic.Brian continued: “Listening Ear has worked with Antrim and Newtownabbey Council, the Lottery, the Department for Communities, Hope for Youth, statutory bodies, businesses, churches and other voluntary groups to provide food hampers, teenage packs, toys, family packs, furniture, new white goods, gas, electricity and oil. “With the support of the NIHE, Listening Ear provides the loan of oximeters to those testing positive for Covid to allow for their oxygen levels to be monitored. At the height of the DfC hamper deliveries, over  hampers a week were being delivered by  voluntary drivers coordinated by Listening Ear.”Another interesting aspect of Listening Ear meetings pre-pandemic saw famous faces such as North Belfast DUP MLA Paula Bradley and UUP activist Julie-Anne Corr-Johnston take part in open and honest question and answer sessions with members.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_edcdddbadebaa   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_feeacffbff   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
