The state government is now considering making the stay-home advice legally enforceable.After months of lockdown, the majority of states and territories in Australia have been able to reduce their number of active cases to nearly zero, relaxing state borders and, in the case of Queensland, reopening sports stadiums. In the New South Wales capital of Sydney, life is largely back to normal, with schools and beaches open and relatively loose restrictions on social distancing. In Western Australia, crowds of 30,000 people will be allowed to attend sporting matches from Saturday and live music venues will open their doors again.On Saturday, the state’s leader Daniel Andrews said that restrictions were to be re-tightened, with large family gatherings blamed for the uptick in cases. He announced that for the next three weeks the number of guests allowed in a house would be reduced from 20 back to five, and public gatherings would once again be limited to 10.Victorian chief health officer Brett Sutton described the state as being at a “tipping point”, urging residents to take precautions.On Sunday, the Australian health protection principal committee, which is made up of each state’s chief health officer and the federal chief health minister, recommended that Victorians do not travel in or out of six heavily affected local government areas. On Monday, residents of New South Wales were advised to avoid travelling to the Victorian hotspots as school holidays loom.Andrews said further restrictions would be considered if community transmission continued to rise.“We all remember that time, it was deeply frustrating but it was very effective … we may need to go back to that setting in given geographical areas.”There were concerns that a Black Lives Matter rally that was held in the city two weeks ago could lead to a surge in cases. But Victoria’s chief health officer confirmed this was not the case.“I don’t think the Black Lives Matter protest has contributed. We are not seeing people who have clearly acquired it there,” he said on Monday.Of the around 30,000 attendees only four cases have been recorded, with no evidence that the virus was transmitted at the protest. Instead, Andrews said large family gatherings were to blame.“We’ve had cases of people gathering in large numbers at their home or another family member’s home … even though they had been told to isolate in their own home. We have even had people who have tested positive and have been told to go home and isolate and instead, they have gone to work. Instead, they have gone and visited loved ones in large numbers,” he said.“The experts tell us that, largely, the numbers are being driven by families – families having big get-togethers and not following the advice around distancing and hygiene.”Andrews said on Saturday that half of Victoria’s cases since the end of April had come from transmission inside someone’s home. “It is unacceptable that families anywhere in our state can, just because they want this to be over, pretend that it is,” he said.“You can see how this could happen. People feeling relaxed at home. Letting their guard down. Letting old habits creep back. But we are still in a pandemic – and people’s lives are still at risk.”The hotspots are caused by four or five major clusters. The two largest outbreaks are from family groups in the suburbs of Keilor Downs and Coburg, which have spread to multiple suburbs across Melbourne.So far, the outbreaks have caused multiple schools and shops to be shut for deep cleaning, and several aged care homes have been placed in lockdown after residents tested positive. More than a thousand close contacts have been asked to self-isolate.The local government area of Brimbank was also the site of a major meat works cluster in early May. The Cedar Meats outbreak was the country’s largest, ballooning to more than 100 cases.There have been 102 deaths from coronavirus in Australia, with more than 7,400 cases."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abcab3b84d24893e3b48f28fbd90b6f89f6d8e97/0_125_5172_3104/master/5172.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=d286fec5ee55ffe08eb1d1be6a68b498","title":"wellness is a seductive lie abi palmer sanatorium","story":"In desperate need of hydrotherapy, Abi Palmer went to a sanatorium – and found herself surrounded by luxury. How has health been sold as a lifestyle choice?In 2017 I received an Arts Council England grant to complete research for my book Sanatorium. Writing a book was the only way I could think of funding a much-needed\u0026nbspvisit to a water-based physiotherapy rehabilitation programme, which was necessary to help symptoms caused by psoriatic arthritis and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. So I found myself in the sanatorium of my dreams: a thermal hydrotherapy centre on an island in the middle of the River Danube.\u0026nbspIt was a cold October when I made it to the island. There were bridges to the mainland, but I am not able to walk reliably for more than a few metres, and if I use my mobility scooter in the cold, my legs seize up quickly and become incredibly painful. As a result, I was almost completely isolated at the sanatorium. I only left the strange, insulated building when my mental health was suffering so much that the risk to my body began to feel worth it.Inside, the space was all about luxury. Every day I ate at a buffet piled high with what they called “wellness foods”. I became seduced by the colour and opulence of such lush, fresh fruits, until my collagen-deficient bowels reminded me why I am not a regular consumer of “healthy” fibres. (Wellness is a relative concept.)On my first day bathing in the eggy, sulphurous water – the sanatorium’s main healing attraction – I noticed the old-world glamour exuded by many of the elderly women around me. They wore full faces of waterproof makeup, diamond earrings and elegantly twisted turbans. Being young and broke, with my self-trimmed fringe and hormonal acne, it took me a while to work out the function of their performative leisure aesthetic. But after a few days of bathing, and a draining physio regime, I began to feel like I was dissolving putting on makeup became an important practice in reminding myself that I existed.As many of us remain indoors, I’d love to sell you this as the key to staying well in isolation. Make it fun! Do things to remind yourself that you exist and that you matter. Inject glamour and vivacity into your days, play chamber music during mealtimes. In other words, make prioritising your health and wellbeing a well-curated lifestyle choice!\u0026nbspThis isn’t too far away from what the multibillion-dollar wellness industry would like us to believe. Whether we are being told by Gwyneth Paltrow or Instagram influencers, the message is: you are the master of your own health! Choose wellness, not because you need to, but because it’ll make you feel great and look better. Wellness is an aesthetic shaped by primarily young, slender, white women in stylish leggings, usually standing in front of clifftops or inside gyms. It is an unnerving abundance of recipes for pancakes that are secretly made with bananas (#NomNom #CheatDay). It is a petite woman performing a handstand above the caption “Committed to nothing but love!”, in a photo tagging a sportswear brand and the yoga-cardio class available on her new app (link in bio, #namaste).It is a seductive illusion. Unlike the grandeur of the sanatorium, wellness is supposed to look effortless: anyone can have it if they are willing to make the right choices and dream big. Wellness appears so easily attainable that actual illness doesn’t always compute for those who encourage the idea that health, joy and spiritual gain are things you can buy.And while wellness booms, vital complementary health services are becoming less and less attainable. Where many European countries use inpatient hydrotherapy to treat rheumatic patients, almost all of the NHS hydrotherapy pools in London have closed. A pool at Guy’s Hospital remains open by renting its services to private patients at £70 a pop. The Budapest facility I attended, part of a group of health hotels, has survived by straddling this complex ide – simultaneously marketing itself as a health necessity and a lifestyle choice. Its vital and more intrusive medical services, such as underwater massage baths, painful muscle treatments, ice-cold cream packs for swollen joints, are screened off in cold, utilitarian back rooms, behind the layers of opulence.\u0026nbspThe sanatorium’s wealthier guests had the means to lean into the sense of luxury, transforming medical intervention into something akin to a cruise. They travelled across the world, meeting up with friends to “take the waters” in a host of healing locations. They didn’t have to juggle working or childcare. Although their conditions were – like mine – all forms of inflammatory arthritis, through retiring early and attending regular private treatment, they had managed to completely avoid use of the immunosuppressants, opiates and mobility equipment that I require to function. As we floated on our backs in the mineral-rich water, I noticed that many of the spa’s most glamorous inhabitants were fond of repeating a particular phrase: “I deserve this.”\u0026nbspI’m lucky enough, once, to have made it to the UK’s equivalent to the sanatorium, a rare inpatient physical rehabilitation programme provided by the NHS. Very few hospitals are able to offer such a service, and the waiting list is often years-long. (Right now, of course, they are all halted.) But unlike the sanatorium, NHS rehab is not glamorous. I shared a ward with 16 women. At night, people would wake each other up with cries of pain. Where the affluent women in the sanatorium talked about deserving their health, many people in the NHS system talked about deserving the more punishing aspects of their long-term conditions. They worried about the ways that they might have contributed to their illnesses: by not asking the doctor enough questions, working in physically demanding jobs, even, in more than one case, for having become pregnant before discovering that pregnancy could make their symptoms worse.During this pandemic, I’ve been thinking a lot about wellness and the nature of deserving. As NHS hospitals struggled to find enough beds and ventilation equipment, priorities were initially made using a frailty index: a numbered scorecard that determines your ability to function based partly on how far you can walk. The people who are less physically or mentally independent were more likely to be denied a bed. People like myself were valued less, in large part because we came loaded with fewer resources to begin with.\u0026nbspYou can see this even more starkly as the pandemic has progressed. In England and Wales, ethnicity is one of the strongest risk factors for coronavirus-related deaths, with black people four times more likely to die from Covid-19 than white people, and members of Indian, Bangladeshi and Pakistani communities dying at double the rate of their white neighbours. Presenting wellness as a “lifestyle choice”, in the face of so much structural inequality, perpetuates the dehumanisation of our most marginalised communities. And this is all the more insulting when you consider how often wellness culture’s hottest commodities – yoga, fasting, acupuncture, CBD treatments – have been appropriated, whitewashed and repackaged for profit.Medical professionals can be quick to dismiss the value of lives they do not understand. In appointments, I have learned to throw down my accomplishments quickly, before the doctor can send me out of the room with no treatment. Where I am successful, it is underscored by privilege: my cisgender whiteness, my class, my weight. Many of the chronically ill don’t come with this hand. Even before the pandemic, they had been used to the medical system giving up on them before they were given a chance.The difference between those of us who are able to treat feeling well as a lifestyle, and those for whom it feels unattainable, has never felt so marked. I spend a lot of time with chronically ill friends, brainstorming ideas to enable us to reach the healing spaces in which our bodies thrive: books, creative workshops, movies, academic projects. Sometimes this makes me laugh – the hustles we have to work in order to manage our needs. But it’s frustrating to know that my health can be so directly impacted by the amount of funding I am able to access in a given year, and the lack of sustainability in this practice (there are only so many books about a sanatorium you can write).Ideally, I’d attend something like the sanatorium once a year, to check in on how my body is moving, revisit and build on my daily physiotherapy routine, and tackle the ongoing spectre of chronic pain. My body doesn’t need organic juice deliveries or raw diets, just regular maintenance: a moment’s reprieve in the battle waged against itself.\u0026nbspBut for now I am here, in my London flat, in an inflatable bathtub. I straddle the line between brief spells of pretend sanatorium glamour (a washed face, a secondhand kaftan), and days and days of the same pyjamas, battling through an unsustainable freelance workload with chronic hand pain.Wellness is a seductive idea, because it suggests that we, personally, might be able to use our positivity and focus to chase away the spectre of death. It is scary and overwhelming to remember that our fate and health outcomes could be preordained by circumstances beyond our control. But the biggest lesson I’ve taken from my time researching and writing Sanatorium is that how your body responds to a crisis can depend on any number of external variables. And, to some degree, wellness is something you can buy. You may not be able to pay your way out of an incurable ailment, but staying healthy still comes with a price tag."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14d22b25519526c56a7abd37bc453552bc7fbb6a/0_350_5175_3105/master/5175.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=870e33e34dd3feda815fee2a8a7fcfe1","title":"covid 19 britain ethnic minorities government race inequality epidemic","story":"All the evidence points to race inequality as an urgent aspect of the epidemic. Yet another review isn’t good enoughWhy is race still a risk factor in the 21st century? Whether it is the merciless killing of George Floyd by police in the US or the brutal detention and deportation of Windrush black British citizens by the Home Office in the UK, the reality for black and minority ethnic people remains the same: racism is a matter of life and death.As though we needed a reminder, these racial inequalities have been emphasised by the alarming data on Covid-19 hospital cases and death rates among minoritiesin the UK (and the US).Almost every source of data on Covid-19 cases and deaths analysed by ethnicity – the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre, the Office for National Statistics, the Institute for Fiscal Studies and Public Health England among others – has found that minorities are over-represented. The message is clear: we may all be weathering the same storm, but we are not in the same boat.There is some variation in which ethnic minority groups – Bangladeshi, Pakistani or black Britons – emerge as the most vulnerable, depending on whether the data is drawn from hospital admissions alone or community and care home coronavirus cases. Analysis based on all Covid-19 deaths in England and Wales between early March and mid-May reveals that mortality risks are highest for black women and black men (1.4 to 2 times higher compared with white groups) after taking into account region, population density, socio-economic and household characteristics.More alarmingly, a recent study in the British Medical Journal found that more than half of pregnant women hospitalised with Covid-19 across the UK between 1 March and 14 April were from an ethnic minority background. Black women are at particularly high risk as they are 8.1 times more likely than white British women to be hospitalised with Covid-19 during pregnancy. When you consider that black women are five times more likely to die in childbirth compared with white British women, the risks are terrifying.What has often been misunderstood is that it’s not the fact of being a different “race” to the ethnic majority that has put black and minority ethnic people at higher risk, it is the experience of racism and racial inequalities, which are themselves largely the consequence of political and economic policy. The experience of longstanding systemic racism and structural inequality has meant that black and ethnic minority ethnic people are more likely to be among poorer socio-economic groups, and more likely to be over-represented in areas, housing, occupations and jobs that expose them more to coronavirus, and less protected.It has also meant that they more likely to have comorbidities (such as hypertension, diabetes or coronary heart disease) that make people more vulnerable to Covid-19. There is no one gene for being Asian or black, so comorbidities are not necessarily a result of biology: they are more likely to be a result of circumstances – of where you live, of what you can afford to eat, how much green space you have, how much exercise you’re able to take, and the stresses and strains in your life.Pre-existing economic and social inequalities have also meant that some ethnic minority groups have been worse hit financially by Covid-19 than others. Child poverty rates in Britain have been worsening since 2012, but currently nearly half of black children and well over half of children from Pakistani and Bangladeshi backgrounds are living in poverty. Covid-19 has amplified these inequalities. Bangladeshi, Pakistani, black African and black Caribbean men are all much more likely to have had jobs in shut-down industries, due in large part to Bangladeshi men being concentrated in the restaurant sector and Pakistani men being concentrated in taxi driving.Furthermore, a 10-year update to the Marmot review in February 2020 highlighted that people from disadvantaged backgrounds or deprived areas, and ethnic minority backgrounds, were not only more likely to have underlying health conditions because of their disadvantaged backgrounds, but they were also more likely to have shorter life expectancies as a result of their socioeconomic status. Bangladeshi men and Pakistani women were identified as the groups with the lowest life expectancy.All of this evidence points to one of the most urgent aspects of this epidemic – yet the government appears to be lagging far behind. When it comes to addressing issues of structural inequality or racism, the government’s kneejerk reaction is to commission a review. But at some point, someone somewhere will need to address the hundreds of recommendations on how to address racial inequalities that are still awaiting action. Social change does not come through rhetoric alone.• Dr Zubaida Haque is interim director of the Runnymede Trust"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2831d73d4b3780f2bcd1a2adc99216e335c09e4b/0_321_5114_3070/master/5114.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=55c51c7177bfc252343af78ed1b8ffcb","title":"this year we need prides spirit of solidarity and inclusion more than ever","story":"The coronavirus pandemic has intensified the discrimination and prejudice against LGBTQ+ people. It’s time to actJune and the summer months have become synonymous with a rich global calendar of Pride marches and events, during which we address prejudice and issues that are topical to the LGBTQ+ community. These public gatherings challenge discrimination and inequality everywhere and bring communities together to embrace and reflect.This year, the Covid-19 pandemic has changed all that. Pride events are either happening online or not at all, but we need their spirit of solidarity, inclusion and acceptance all the same. This is exactly the time to up the ante. The pandemic has intensified previous systemic vulnerabilities, with dire, possibly long-term social and economic consequences for minorities. And beyond the pandemic, during this moment when the world is demanding change, we must fight for a future where people of all racial and ethnic origins, sexual orientations and gender identities have the opportunity to live free from discrimination, injustice and mistreatment of all forms.In recent decades, various countries have registered some progress in this area of policy.Following the decriminalisation of homosexuality, a growing number of countries introduced anti-discrimination and anti-hate laws and now recognise rainbow families and gender ersity. Despite this progress, no society has yet achieved LGBTQ+ equality. Additionally, discrepancies remain between legislative standards and the everyday realities of LGBTQ+ people. The prejudice, the stereotyping, the attitudes take much longer to address and change. Also, the risk of that progress becoming undone remains. Indeed, a backlash is underway, led by the “anti-gender” and “traditional family” movements.For some of us, home is not a safe place. Whether they are women and children in domestic violence situations or young people who must live in hostile, homotransphobic, unaccepting and abusive families.For instance, from our outreach to iniduals and NGOs who work in the LGBTQ+ field, we learn that during lockdowns, young LGBTQ+ people in unsupportive households have been subjected to violence, and even ended up homeless. Older LGBTQ+ people in care homes who are not “out” have suffered loneliness and exclusion.When confinement is experienced in these hostile environments, LGBTQ+ people may be forced to hide their true selves as a means of self-protection. This extra pressure has always exposed them to an increased risk of mental health problems.In some countries this is compounded, as access to crucial healthcare, such as HIV treatment and gender-affirming care, has been restricted or deemed “non-essential”, to the detriment of the wellbeing of those concerned.Black and ethnic minority people have always been a vibrant part of the LGBTQ+ community, with a pivotal role in the Stonewall riots. Yet, the LGBTQ+ community itself can and must do more to be fully inclusive. Pride is a great moment for reflection on how the community can address inequality gaps within, and to celebrate all colours of the rainbow in all of its shades.Community support networks active around Pride, provide a lifeline to those who experience daily isolation. When other services fail, the LGBTQ+ community steps in. Today, community centres are closed, events cancelled and organisations face existential risks as they struggle to access funding, support their communities and continue to administer their services.The EU Fundamental Rights Agency has released its second LGBTQ+ survey for EU member states 140,000 LGBTQ+ people participated. The responses reveal the heightened isolation, vulnerability and risks associated with being LGBTQ+ pre-Covid-19. The survey highlighted that, despite the wide ersity of people within LGBTQ+ communities, the experience of discrimination remains prevalent.The combination of inidual circumstances and identities will also shape the many layers of exclusion that they are exposed to. For instance, women, young people, persons with disabilities and elderly people are at a greater risk. Also, trans, non-binary and intersex people experience significantly higher levels of exclusion, harassment and violence. Our response must therefore be inclusive and intersectional.Breaking the secrecy and isolation is crucial in fostering positive affirmation of LGBTQ+ lives. Governments need to support LGBTQ+ iniduals by breaking the social stigma that still surrounds them. The adoption of equality and anti-discrimination laws, national action strategies for ersity and inclusion, and the creation of safe spaces are critical and cannot be delayed. Support programmes for parents of LGBTQ+ youth should also be introduced.Coronavirus recovery plans should therefore recognise and address the systematic prejudices and inequalities exposed by this crisis.Prompt action matters. Our collective mission should be set out to address discrimination and long-term effects in our societies with the same determination we are bringing to battle this pandemic. Breaking the secrecy and isolation surrounding LGBTQ+ communities is the key to inclusion of LGBTQ+ people who during this crisis are being pushed to the margins of society.To all those commemorating Global Pride this 27 June, we stand with you. To everyone else, we say: we can all do our part simply by keeping in mind that we are who we are.Nobody chooses how and where they are born, and nobody has the right to prejudge and to discriminate.• Elton John is a singer-songwriter, David Furnish is a Canadian film-maker, Billie Jean King is a former professional tennis player, Ilana Kloss is a former professional tennis player, Ian McKellen is an English actor, Skin is a singer and songwriter, Edward Enninful is editor-in-chief of British Vogue, Frank Ocean is a singer-songwriter and Helena Dalli is European commissioner for equality"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b94fb8ef604a139c8986f7b980c320936f34162/0_318_4768_2861/master/4768.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=671526fc8832393118288bb1df520855","title":"drive in cinema music festivals pop opera lockdown","story":"With venues locked down, entertainment-starved audiences are getting in gear for a season of opera, comedy shows and movies experienced from your own car seat – but is it an artistic cul de sac? Britain has never been good at drive-ins. Historically our cars have been too small for comfort and unsuitable for making out. At British drive-ins the answer to the question, “Is that a gear stick, or are you just pleased to see me?” has always been, “It’s the gear stick.”This summer things are going to change. Now you’ve watched everything on Netflix, written a terrible novel and made a matchstick replica of the Hagia Sophia, you’re looking for a cultural fix beyond the front door. The answer? Follow Boris Johnson’s injunction to support the economy by driving to Newark show ground next month for what’s billed as the UK’s first drive-in music festival. It could be like Glastonbury with air-con.True, you’ll be despoiling the planet just to get there, and, yes, the 10-day festival involves tribute acts impersonating Take That, Elton John, Billy Joel, Abba, the Killers and Elvis from a giant stage whose audio is pumped through your vehicle’s speakers, while you take receipt of street food from staff in PPE. Is hand jiving to Dancing Queen from inside a stationary Ford Focus on your bucket list? Mine neither. Yet Steve Marson from organisers Nightflix (see what they did there?) looks forward to proving me wrong: “We are delighted to be in a position where we can offer a safe form of entertainment to the public while practising social distancing.”Up and down the country, drive-ins are opening as canny entrepreneurs see a business opportunity. It’s going out but staying in at the same time, and only a cynic (that’ll be me) would suggest it combines the worst of both. Cinemas, concert halls, theatres, galleries and standup gigs are closed, festivals abandoned. And yet we yearn for live art and entertainment. Hence recent drive-in gigs at an airport in Colombo, Sri Lanka, and at a car park in Bratislava, Slovakia. Across the world, people are leaving lockdown, getting into their cars and chasing down what passes for live culture at this difficult time while still socially distancing.This would have looked like a world gone nuts to 17th-century philosopher Blaise Pascal, who wrote: “All of humanity’s problems stem from man’s inability to sit quietly in a room alone.” But what did Pascal know? He never parked his Vauxhall Tigra at a race track outside Bratislava repurposed as a hip-hop drive-in and wigged out (while responsibly upholding social distancing parameters), as young Slovakians did earlier this month.Hence, too, what is billed as the world’s first drive-in comedy gig in Glasgow. “Buy a ticket for Rotunda Drive-In,” goes the blurb, “and we will give you a parking space, a pizza, and access to our show feed, which you will hear via your smartphone Bluetoothed to your car stereo. You will also be able to see the comics on our stage or on your phone.” A ticket for a standard car containing two people is £30 and £10 more for each extra passenger, while if you want to park your car at the VIP front section, it’ll set you back £80. How do you heckle? Flash headlights or horn honks in morse code? From late July to September, Live Nation and energy company Utilita will be hosting a drive-in concert series at 12 venues, including racecourses, airports and Bolton Wanderers football ground. Talent includes Ash, Lightning Seeds, the Streets, Tony Hadley and Ealing’s leading contribution to acid funk, the Brand New Heavies. “We we believe the drive-in format is a thoughtful and fun way to safely bring one million Brits out of entertainment lockdown,” says promoter Peter Taylor. Bring folding chairs if you want to sit in the designated area around your car and enjoy images from hi-definition LED screens and what is billed as concert-quality sound from the live stage.The first drive-in opened in New Jersey in 1933 and by 1958, the peak year for the phenomenon, there were 4,063 across America. Today, according to the United Drive-In Theatre Association, there are only 305 drive-ins and 549 screens in the US. By contrast, Britain’s first outdoor cinema company, Luna, only opened in 2007, and what is thought to be Britain’s only permanent drive-in, Route 66, opened in Manchester in 2012. As that name suggests, the business model of the British drive-in has mostly involved plundering 50s Americana. This summer, for instance, an outfit called @thedrivein will, the blurb says, offer “a retro experience with a modern touch”. Waiters on roller skates will bring snacks ordered online through a mobile app to “a drop-off point by your car”.In that retro context it’s hardly surprising that Grease – one of the movies @thedrivein will show – is a staple of the British drive-in. In one scene in that movie, lubricious bad boy Danny (John Travolta) puts the moves on prissy good girl Sandy (Olivia Newton-John) at a drive-in as they recline in a superb convertible fitted with an automatic transmission the better to facilitate, you’d think, in-movie legovers. Outraged, Sandy climbs out, denounces Danny’s “sin wagon” and slams the door on his genitals. Thus was American drive-in culture pastiched in 1978. And thus, reheated, it is served up again to us in 2020.The premiere is organised by the Drive-in Club, which is also putting on other film screenings and comedy gigs both in Brent Cross and in Dagenham, east London, during the summer. Shappi Khorsandi, Reginald D Hunter, Adam Kay, Bill Bailey and Rachel Parris are confirmed to perform, while socially distanced children will be entertained by Rastamouse and Basil Brush. Whether comedy can work with the audiences in their cars remains to be seen. The risk is it will be, like the premiership without fans, a spooky experience for all involved – and not in a good way.A few miles round the north circular, London’s Alexandra Palace will host the world’s first drive-in opera in September, meeting a demand that had occurred to literally no one before lockdown. “I miss seeing my mates close up, and I miss seeing something live,” Stuart Murphy, chief executive of English National Opera told the . “Hopefully, we can offer that universal, collective experience in a safe environment.” Shortened versions of the Mozart’s Magic Flute and Puccini’s La Bohème have been programmed. Fingers crossed it will change stuffy opera etiquette: at a drive-in, if you want to sing along to Your Tiny Hand is Frozen as the pasty maiden on stage pegs out to consumption, who is going to stop you?Happily, too, the Ally Pally drive-in opera will admit audience members on motorbikes and bicycles rather than, as some other drive-ins do, excluding them, in a sickening new form of cultural apartheid. Given that bicycle sales have soared during lockdown while demand for cars has plummeted, surely the two-wheel demographic could be much more lucratively exploited. A push-bike-only festival of Ida Lupino movies and German expressionist classics is what we need, ideally with customers allowed to be accompanied by one well-behaved dog in a wicker basket.For the terrible truth behind Britain’s looming lockdown drive-in summer is that it will meet demand only by adding to traffic congestion and pollution levels that have been predicted to soar as lockdown restrictions are eased. Several cities, including Wuhan and Stockholm, have seen truck and car use rise above their pre-coronavirus levels. But let’s park, not just our cars, but our cynicism. Drive-ins, creatively reimagined, can be culturally nourishing. In Toronto, for instance, there is something called Gogh By Car. Visitors drive into the industrial space that once held the Toronto Star’s printing presses, turn off their engines and experience huge light projections of Van Gogh artworks, including Starry Night and Sunflowers.I suspect this idea could be further developed. Put your car into first gear and move through a digitised projection of – I’m spitballing here – exhibits from the British Museum’s recent Troy exhibition with audio supplied by Stephen Fry. At the end of the drive-through you’d pull up at the counter that doubles as gift shop and fast-food counter, pick up your pre-ordered mocha latte along with a Sulking Achilles terracotta plate (£115) and drive home, tired but happy.Clearly, there is scope for the drive-in experience to adapt further to our summer of strange. Bingo and silent discos are, for instance, being retrofitted even as I write by drive-in entrepreneurs such as @thedrivein as part of entertainment packages. It’s not clear yet whether this drive-in phenomenon is a cul de sac from which we will reverse later this year or a permanent change in the way we consume culture. But certainly the idea that Britain is belatedly becoming a drive-in nation is one of the more bizarre results of global pandemic.No, I don’t know what Garth’s on about either. His gig is to be relayed to 300 drive-ins across the US and Canada on 27 June. “This drive-in concert allows us all to get back to playing live music without the uncertainty of what would be the result to us as a community,” he says. “This is old school, new school, and perfect for the time we are in.”No doubt, but the fact that the gig will be accessible only in North American theatres points up the disappointing truth about globalisation in 2020.

I’m happy with this and the change of step in the kitchen that accompanies it. Working at this new slower pace this week, I spooned a basil-leaf and green-pea dressing over a tender egg of burrata, and stirred coriander leaves into a crushed melon and raw tomato soup. The soup was taken outside and eaten in the shade. We poured a ribbon of olive oil into its chilled orange and scarlet depths. The little cooking I did was brief: asparagus cut into short lengths and fried with spring onions to make spidery, tangled fritters, and grilled chicken with a quickly made tahini dressing.What links everything I have put on the table in the last few weeks is that it feels more at home outdoors than in. Even the cake I made felt like one for the garden. Its crumb freckled green with pistachios, the filling a barely set ricotta and orange cream. It was my favourite apricot sponge recipe, the fruit swapped for nuts, and we ate it as intended, before the filling had frozen, and then kept the rest in the freezer to scoff with our fingers like ice-cream wafers.\u0026nbspBurrata and peas is one those quiet marriages of ingredients I could eat all summer long. On a warm afternoon I will often tear off pieces of cool, milky burrata and toss them with peas and ruffled leaves of pale green lettuce. Other times I make a dressing with olive oil, peas and basil\u0026nbspthen watch it trickle, green and verdant, over the burrata. I think the dish is at its most beautiful when you tear open the cheese and spoon the dressing inside, letting it form brilliant green pools among the snow-white curds.Serves 4peas 200g, shelled weightbasil leaves 15golive oil 150mlwhite wine vinegar 1 tbspburrata 4 x 150g ballssmall basil leaves a few, to finish\u0026nbspBring a pan of water to the boil and salt it lightly. Tip in the peas and let them cook at a rolling boil for 3 or 4 minutes till bright and tender, then drain them. Put the basil into a blender with the olive oil and vinegar, and reduce to a bright green dressing. Transfer to a bowl and add most of the warm, freshly drained peas. Set the others aside.Put the burrata on a serving dish and squeeze them until they split open. Spoon the pea and basil dressing over them. Scatter over the reserved peas and small basil leaves and serve.I would normally make these little bundles of green vegetables when there are just a couple of us. Making the fritters as we sit and chat, eating them hot, crisp and salty, straight from the pan. When you lower the spoonfuls of batter-coated vegetables into the bubbling oil, they may try to separate. Worry not, just quickly pull them together with the spoon and hold them briefly under the oil. They will form a spiky knot of green vegetables and light batter. I am tempted to serve these with a dip of some sort. The most successful to date has been mayonnaise that I lightened with a squeeze or two of lemon juice and a few spoonfuls of kefir.\u0026nbspMakes 8, serves 4For the battereggs 3feta cheese 100gplain flour 4-5 tbspgroundnut or vegetable oil for shallow fryingspring onions 8, thinasparagus 12 spearsparsley 3 heaped tbsplemon 1, to serveMake the batter: separate the eggs, putting the whites in a bowl large enough in which to whip them. Put the egg yolks in a mixing bowl and crumble the feta over them in small pieces. Grind in a few twists of pepper (no salt), then add the flour. The batter will appear very stiff at this stage. Set aside.Trim the spring onions, discarding any tough ends, then cut the stems in half lengthways and then into short pieces about 3cm long. Do the same with the asparagus.\u0026nbspWhen you are ready to eat, beat the egg whites till stiff and fold them into the batter. It will seem stiff but is actually just what you need. Fold the asparagus and spring onions into the batter.\u0026nbspHeat the oil to 180C in a deep pan with plenty of room for the oil to bubble safely. Take about an eighth of the mixture on a large spoon and lower into the hot oil. Repeat with a couple more, letting them fry for 4 or 5 minutes till pale gold and crisp. Lift out and drain on kitchen paper and repeat with the remaining mixture. You should end up with about 8 spiky golden fritters.\u0026nbspServe as soon as you can.\u0026nbspA recipe for a day when the sun is high in the sky. A glowing bowl of bright summer flavours, and so refreshing, this iced soup is what I want to eat in the garden, sitting on a balcony or even perched on the back steps. A word of advice, though. A chilled soup must be exactly that. Thoroughly and completely chilled. In addition to a few hours in the fridge, I find adding ice cubes to the soup before I serve it pretty much essential.\u0026nbspServes 4tomatoes 500gcantaloupe or other orange fleshed melon 1kgcoriander a handfulmineral water 100ml, chilledlime 1olive oil 1 tbspice cubes 100gHalve the tomatoes and grate into a mixing bowl. The coarse side of a box grater will produce a pleasingly rough texture somewhere between finely chopped and smooth puree. It is preferable to using a blender or food processor. Cut the melon in half, discard the seeds, then cut away the skin with a knife.Put the melon flesh into a blender jug and reduce to a coarse puree. Stir the melon into the grated tomato, then stir in a little ice-cold mineral water to bring it to a pleasing consistency. I suggest starting with 100ml.\u0026nbspFinely chop the coriander leaves and fold them through the tomato and melon, then season lightly with salt (so good with the melon), a squeeze of lime juice and a very little black pepper. Chill thoroughly.\u0026nbspJust before serving, stir in a tablespoon of olive oil and a handful of crushed ice. Ladle into bowls and serve.\u0026nbspSome wonderful flavours going on here with the smoky chicken and its slightly charred skin deep nutty notes of the tahini and the underlying hit of sourness from the lemons and yogurt. I can’t tell you how many times we’ve eaten this over the past few weeks. It isn’t difficult to tease the bones from the meat with the point of a sharp knife, but you could always ask the butcher to do it for you if you prefer.\u0026nbspServes 4chicken thighs 4 largelemons 2, for griddlingFor the marinadeolive oil 50mllemon\u0026nbspjuice of 1 medium garlic 2 large clovesza’atar 1 tbspFor the tahini dressingthick yogurt 200mltahini 4 tbspRemove the two bones from the chicken thighs and flatten the meat out. Place on a piece of clingfilm or even in a plastic freezer bag, then bat the meat a little with a rolling pin or cutlet bat. There is no need to go the full escalope, just flatten out the thicker parts of the thigh. It is not essential, so don’t worry if you don’t have anything suitable, it just helps to cook the meat more evenly.\u0026nbspFor the marinade, mix together the olive oil and the lemon juice. Crush the garlic cloves then stir into the liquid with the za’atar. Place the chicken thighs in the marinade and leave for at least 40 minutes. They will come to no harm if left overnight.When you are ready to eat, get a cast-iron griddle hot, then place the chicken pieces, shaken of excess marinade, onto the bars of the griddle and let them cook till the skin is golden. Turn and cook the other side. They are ready when the juices run clear when pierced at their thickest place with a metal skewer.\u0026nbspWhile the chicken is cooking, put the yogurt in a bowl and stir in the tahini. I prefer to do this lightly, leaving ribbons of the sesame paste marbling the snow-white yogurt.\u0026nbspSlice the 2 lemons in half and place them cut side down on the griddle for a few minutes till they are warm. You will get more juice from them that way.\u0026nbspLet the chicken rest for five minutes, then serve with the tahini dressing and the griddled lemons.\u0026nbspA light pistachio sponge filled with soft, chilled ricotta cream, this cake is best eaten within four hours of freezing. If I make it in advance then I bring it out of the freezer a good half hour before we intend to eat, to give the filling a chance to soften. If I am going to store it in the freezer for any length of time, then I cut it into slices first, which allows you to take out just as much as you need. Wrap the cake tightly in clingfilm or, better still, put it in a plastic box before freezing.\u0026nbspServes 10-12For the spongebutter 125gunrefined caster sugar 125geggs 2 largepistachios 50g, shelled weightself-raising flour 75gFor the ricotta fillingricotta 750gcaster sugar 125gorange grated zest of 1finest vanilla extract a few dropspistachios 60g, shelled weightdouble cream 250mlFor the sponge, cream the butter and sugar in a food mixer until light and fluffy, regularly scraping the sides down with a rubber spatula. Set the oven at 160C fangas mark 4. Line the bottom of a 20cm spring-form cake tin with a sheet of baking parchment.Beat the eggs lightly and add them, a little at time to the butter and sugar, making sure each batch is well combined before adding the next. Grind the pistachios to a coarse powder in a food processor or spice mill (I use an old coffee grinder), add to the flour, then mix into the batter in three or four small batches.\u0026nbspSmooth the mixture into the lined cake tin and bake for 25 minutes. Remove, leave to settle for 10 minutes then open the spring clip and leave on a cake rack till cool.\u0026nbspTo make the filling, put the ricotta in the bowl of a food mixer with the sugar. Beat thoroughly to a thick and relatively smooth cream. Beat in the orange zest and the vanilla extract. Grind the pistachios to a fine powder. In a separate bowl, softly whip the cream. Stop when the cream is still in soft folds, before it gets thick enough to stand in peaks, then fold it gently into the ricotta mixture with the pistachios.Using a long, thin and very sharp knife, slice the cake in half horizontally to give two thin discs of cake. Place the bottom half back in the cake tin, cut side up.\u0026nbspSpoon the ricotta mixture into the cake tin and smooth flat with the back of a spoon. Place the top half of the sponge, cut side down, on top and press lightly. Cover and place in the freezer for an hour to an hour and a half, by which time the filling should be firm, but still soft in the middle.To serve, grind the pistachios to a fine powder then scatter over the surface of the cake. Run a palette knife around the cake, then remove from the tin and transfer carefully to a serving plate. Serve with a bowl of strawberries.\u0026nbsp@NigelSlater"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7011535c98f89df124785a2a24e8ea9939b73416/0_341_8000_4801/master/8000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=01bf9036246006156729f7b1c0285347","title":"thomasina miers recipe for cornflake crumbed fish tacos with pineapple ketchup","story":"Crunchy-crumbed white fish + tangy, tropical ketchup + corn tacos  fun for all the familyMy children are craving Wahaca’s fish tacos – a firm favourite – so during lockdown we have been making them at home instead.\u0026nbspSometimes I wean them on to grilled fish (and have been making them try some great veggie tacos) but on Friday afternoons, after a long week of home-schooling, a cornflake crumb makes everybody happy.\u0026nbspI season the pineapple ketchup with a touch of cayenne for the children, but it is much better with a fiery hot chilli if you are with friends.For the ketchup, use tinned pineapple if you can’t find fresh.600g firm white fish, such as cod or haddock75g plain flourSalt and black pepper1 tsp smoked paprika1 egg, beaten120g cornflakes4 tbsp rapeseed oilFor the pineapple ketchup400g pineapple flesh (about half a fresh pineapple)100g caster sugar150ml cider vinegar1 star aniseA few pinches cayenne pepper2 fat limes, 1 cut into wedgesTo serve¼ white cabbage, finely shredded½ red onion, very finely sliced1 handful coriander leaves16 small corn tortillasCut the fish into chunks of a uniform size – about the size of two mouthfuls.\u0026nbspAdd the flour to a bowl and season generously with salt, pepper and the paprika.\u0026nbspBeat the egg on a plate.\u0026nbspIn a blender, blitz the cornflakes to crumbs, then pour on to another plate.

And his first thought was to honour the memory of George Floyd. After beating Parma’s goalkeeper, Luigi Sepe, with a near-post header, the Torino defender wheeled away with a finger pointed at the sky. His teammates engulfed him, but Nkoulou quickly disengaged, sank to one knee and raised a clenched fist.“When I scored, I immediately thought of my brother Floyd, who is important to me,” Nkoulou said at full-time. A day later, Romelu Lukaku would repeat the kneeling gesture after scoring the opening goal in Inter’s win over Sampdoria.The world has changed in the 103 days that Serie A was away. Anti-racism protests have sprung up across Italy just as they have all over the globe. Whether they can have a lasting impact on a nation’s football culture is impossible to know, at a time when stadiums are still closed to supporters. It was only last September that a group of Inter’s own ultras penned an open letter to Lukaku, insisting he should not interpret monkey chants from rival fans as racist.Regardless, it was striking to see Serie A recommence with tributes to Floyd, as well as to the tens of thousands of Italians who have lost their lives to Covid-19. Moments of silence were held to remember the latter before kick-off in Turin, Verona and Milan.In Bergamo, the city worst hit by the pandemic, players from Atalanta and Sassuolo were invited to stand and reflect while “Rinascerò, Rinascerai” (I will be reborn, you will be reborn) was played over the PA system. Penned by the Roby Facchinetti, a renowned local musician and composer, in March, the song became an instant hit, with proceeds going to the city’s Papa Giovanni XXIII hospital.Not everyone supported this weekend’s return to action. As Facchinetti’s song ended, chanting could be heard from a group of Atalanta Ultras who had gathered outside the Gewiss Stadium to protest. “Football without fans is not football,” read a banner hung nearby.Watching the games certainly feels different. With no crowd noise to drown them out, the exhortations of managers are now picked up loud and clear on the pitch-side microphones. Some TV executives may be regretting that fact after an evening with Antonio Conte. “Porca troia!” bellowed the Inter manager late on Sunday – a phrase that literally translates to “pig whore!”, but serves as an Italian equivalent to “fucking hell!” “This is life!” he continued. “This is life!”At least the footballing narratives were reassuringly familiar. Torino, despite taking the lead through Nkoulou, only wound up drawing at home to Parma. You could call that a step forward for a team that lost six straight before the season was interrupted, yet old frustrations came rushing back as Andrea Belotti missed a penalty that would have put them back in front. Torino’s top scorer has not found the net in 10 appearances.Verona were next up on Saturday evening, beating Cagliari to continue their improbable push for a European place. On Sunday, Atalanta took us right back where we were with a 4-1 rout of Sassuolo. Four goals, just like they had scored in each leg of their Champions League last-16 defeat of Valencia. The same number they put past Sassuolo when they met for the first time this season, all the way back in September.Any question of whether the break could disrupt Atalanta’s free-flowing football had been dispelled by the 37th minute, by which point they were 3-0 up, having also hit the crossbar and had two goals disallowed. This without top scorer, Josip Ilicic, who injured an ankle in training.They have now scored four or more goals in eight matches across all competitions. Their average of 2.85 per game is the highest across Europe’s top five leagues and, if maintained to the end of the season, would represent Serie A’s best return in 70 years.Victory restored Atalanta’s six-point advantage over Roma in fourth. This weekend’s four games were catching up Serie A’s 25th round, interrupted by the coronavirus outbreak (confusingly, the 26th round did subsequently get completed), meaning all teams have now played the same.No team was under more pressure to win than Inter, beaten by Lazio and Juventus in consecutive league games before the pause. They began the weekend trailing the first-placed Bianconeri by nine points. Victory over Sampdoria was imperative to bring them back into the title race.They started beautifully. Christian Eriksen had the ball in the net after two minutes and though that was disallowed, Inter only had to wait another eight to make their breakthrough. A truly sumptuous team move concluded with Lautaro Martínez playing a backheel for Lukaku, who exchanged a one-two with Eriksen before slipping the ball under the goalkeeper Emil Audero.Lautaro made it 2-0 in the 33rd minute. Inter ought to have been home and dry. But then early in the second half, Eriksen ran on to a through-pass on the corner of the six-yard box and played the ball back for Lukaku to finish into an empty goal. The Belgian screwed his finish horribly wide. Moments later, Morten Thorsby scored for Samp from a corner.Inter’s performance became a synopsis of their season. Scintillating in the first half, a combination of tiredness and nerves seemed now to take hold, leaving them vulnerable to the counter-punch. The visitors were granted more than one opportunity to equalise in a game that should have long been over.In the end, the Nerazzurri did cling on. There was still plenty to encourage the belief that they can challenge for the title. Conte has used the break to integrate Eriksen fully into his side, reshaping Inter’s formation to a 3-4-1-2 with the Dane behind the attack – a role in which he appears to be thriving. As the team that covered the most distance per game in Serie A before the break, no one may benefit more than Inter from a midseason rest.With a six-point gap still to bridge, however, they cannot afford to repeat the second-half slumps that have cost them crucial points already against Lazio, Atalanta and Cagliari (not to mention in the Champions League against Barcelona and Dortmund). Lukaku’s characterisation of every game as a matter of “life and death” in a post-match interview was a little clumsy, in the wider context, but his meaning was well understood.“Those who are ahead of us have more margin for error,” added Conte. “But we want to get in there and bust their balls, all the way to the end.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/160ba6170c379e206108f43a7cad4b3cad75615c/0_242_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=001959554c0a50d81968a207c2cc772d","title":"share your reviews of the last of us part ii","story":"The sequel to Naughty Dog’s hit video game is finally here, but what did you make of it?

You’re allowed into other peoples’ gardens (for now). This can only mean one thing: barbecue season is upon us again. Usually that can mean joylessly navigating a minefield of potential food poisoning while drunk and surrounded by wasps. But is there a better way? We asked the experts for 10 tips.The biggest mistake home barbecuers make, by common consent, is cooking their food at too high a temperature. The best way around this is to set up your barbecue for two-zone cooking. Helen Graves, editor of the indispensable Pit magazine, explains: “It just involves stacking the lit coals to one side, creating a hot zone and a cooler or ‘indirect’ zone. It’s perfect for cooking fattier pieces of meat like chicken wings or lamb kebabs that will otherwise cause flare-ups when the hot fat drips onto the coals. You can cook safely and for longer without having to worry about a raging inferno setting fire to next door’s topiary. If you’ve got a barbecue with a lid, two zones also means you can use the barbecue like an oven, searing a larger cut on the hot side before moving it over to the cooler side and putting the lid on.”\u0026nbspShe recommends cooking parsnips on your grill. Put a kilo of peeled and quartered parsnips into a fireproof roasting tin with some oil, salt and pepper. Throw some smoking wood chips into the barbecue, place the tin on the barbecue and shut the lid for 45 minutes, tossing the veg once or twice. When they’re tender, sprinkle over parmesan and cook directly on the grill bars for 7-10 minutes, turning regularly. Taylor serves hers with hazelnuts and fennel butter.It’s hard to replicate Smokestak’s incredible slow-cooked slabs of meat with a home barbecue, but not impossible. They pick tougher cuts and smoke them under indirect heat for 16 hours, until it takes on the texture of braised meat. If you’re determined to try, Carter advises using the Minion method. This is where you put a few hot coals on a bed of unlit briquettes, then carefully control the air vents to prevent the whole thing going up in flames at once. Master the Minion method and you can keep a fire going for up to 18 hours.Charcoal barbecues are, in general, a slightly cheaper and more versatile choice. But they’re not perfect. If you’ve ever bitten through a crust of blackened chicken skin and ended up with a mouthful of blood, chances are it was cooked on charcoal. If you want to improve the consistency of your charcoal, David Wade from BBQ Barn in Sidcup, Kent, suggests investing in a chimney starter. It’s a cylindrical device that looks like a giant metal tankard you fill it with charcoal and place it over lit firelighters on your rack. “The chimney effect pushes the flames through the charcoal and in around 15-20 minutes you have a starter full of even-temperature charcoal that you can carefully pour on to your rack. It’s a life saver!”As quick and easy as gas barbecues are, it’s often difficult to escape the sensation that you might as well have cooked in your kitchen. If you want to inject any sort of authentic barbecue taste to gas-cooked dishes, Wade suggests buying a smokebox. “These are normally stainless steel boxes with holes or slots in the lid,” he explains. You sit them on top of the flavouriser bars – the metal zig-zags found on many gas barbecues designed to keep burners clean and vaporise fats back into your food. “Fill them with wet flavour wood chips and, with the BBQ hood down, the resulting smoke and aroma will permeate your food and add to the overall cooking.”James Palmer-Rosser is the head chef and owner of the Kent Cookery School, and runs regular barbecue masterclasses. “For as long as I’ve been a chef, I’ve never been without a trusty digital probe thermometer,” he says. “It allows for accurate and, more importantly, safe cooking by allowing you to see instantly the internal temperature of food. This is great for getting the right doneness on your steaks but also for ensuring that foods that need to be cooked through – like chicken thighs – have reached the correct temperature.” Chicken should reach an internal temperature of 73C (163F), burgers 71C (160F), sausages 65C (149F) and steak between 60C (140F, rare) and 71C (well done).\u0026nbspFish is probably the trickiest barbecued food to pull off its window of doneness is so tiny that even a momentary lapse in concentration can result in its being raw or overcooked. Plus, anyone who has tried to barbecue fish has ruined one by accidentally searing it to the grill then tearing it to pieces trying to remove it. The trick is to pick a fish with a tougher skin, such as salmon or monkfish, and oiling it before cooking. Alternatively, wrap it in foil with a glug of liquid.Don’t insult your guests by serving them thick burgers. Christian Stevenson, author of The Burger Book, has seen a huge uptick of people cooking his smashburgers: thin patties squashed down on to the heat with a spatula. “I’m so over thick burgers”, he says. “I tried to make thick burgers for my kids, and they’re like: ‘I want McDonald’s, dad.’ So I thought: ‘Why don’t I do thin patties but double, triple, quadruple them up like at McDonald’s, so my kids eat them?’.” Smashburgers require cooking fast and on the hottest surface possible. Stevenson recommends brushing a little American yellow mustard on one side of the burger, then flipping it over and cooking it in. “The yellow mustard hack will take your burger to the upper echelons of tasty town”, says Stevenson. If you’re planning to push the boat out and barbecue steak, Stevenson has some choice words for you. “Everybody pulls their steak out of the fridge and puts it straight on the grill. Don’t. Steak’s a muscle. You want it to relax. Take it out of the fridge to rest 30 minutes to an hour before you cook it. And then you only salt the steak. Don’t put pepper on it. You put a steak on a hot grill, that pepper’s going to burn and taste bitter. You pepper at the end. What I normally do is, right near the end of my cook, I hit the steak with pepper and a tiny bit more salt, and then I rest it for half the amount of time that I cooked it. The juices go back into the muscle and you’ll end up with a juicy, juicy steak”.

This week: a yew in WalesWhen Ieuan Morris, a film history lecturer, wandered through St Peter’s churchyard in Llanbedr-Ystrad-Yw, Powys, he stumbled across something that stopped him in his tracks – a chair placed inside a yew tree. “A lot of these old yew trees are hollow,” he says. “I did laugh out loud when I saw it because I just didn’t expect to see a chair inside. I wanted to sit inside immediately.”\u0026nbspMorris, 64, who is semi-retired and lives in Cardiff, has long been intrigued by yew trees and travelled to Llanbedr-Ystrad-Yw for his photo series dedicated to them. “They are some of the oldest trees in Britain,” he says. “Some are thought to be 3,000 years old. It’s very difficult to ascertain the true age because many are hollow so there are no growth rings.”There was no one else in the churchyard that day as Morris sat in the tree. He spent some time enjoying the warmth and admiring the yew’s colours. “The inside felt so different to the outside – much smoother,” he says.The only other object inside the tree was a simple jar of flowers. Morris felt peaceful as he sat there. “It was a surprisingly affecting experience. It was like sitting inside the belly of a large creature which, in a sense, is what I was doing.” Morris was just as impressed by the outside of the tree. “You feel like you’re walking under a canopy and into a closed space because the branches extend so far before drooping towards the ground. An elephant comes to mind.” The pictures he took highlight the texture of its bark. “It’s difficult to believe that it is alive because it looks so old. It’s almost like touching a rock.”As part of his research for the photo series, Morris discovered many yew trees were planted by the ancient Celts, who considered them sacred. Christians later built churches next to the yews. “It’s thought that Celts held yew trees in high esteem because of their powers of regeneration,” he says.\u0026nbspMorris went to the village again, to take more photographs and sit inside the quirky yew. It’s a tree he thinks of fondly. “The tree has opened itself up, allowing humans to interact with it in a very intimate way, and it will be here for many years to come.”• Tell us about your favourite tree by filling in this form."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db3d57665dbb32f37b795ae6b1e7fbbb29bacc16/0_0_5500_3550/master/5500.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a557242677c7ba748796b34d71548d52 1400w","title":"the solar eclipse in asia africa and the middle east in pictures","story":"Adults, children and even pets marvelled at the momentary disappearance of the sun as the rare ‘ring of fire’ annular solar eclipse cast its shadow over Africa and Asia"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2ddc0da57494d609f9e83117d7c4ef18382e6e5/0_399_6014_3610/master/6014.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06f888e3405250635c682f7271a697c9","title":"picture a pandemic how guardian photographers adapted to lockdown life","story":"Our photojournalists explain how the pandemic has changed their practice – and why physical distancing is no barrier to producing intimate portraits by  Fiona Shields,  David Levene,  Sarah Lee,  Suki Dhanda and  Jonny WeeksThroughout the pandemic it has been important to show our readers and viewers what’s happening in the world outside, to make a historical document and to chart the progress of those on the frontline. During the first weeks, it was difficult to gain access to hospitals to see how they were coping – until photojournalist Jonny Weeks was invited on to the Covid-19 wards at University hospital in Coventry. We made a full risk assessment, considering his safety and the risk to those around him, and with the guidance of the staff there he produced a brilliant photo essay. He was one of the very first photojournalists to have this kind of access in the UK and it was a key story for the .Photographing people through windows, in outside\u0026nbspspaces or from the end of their front path has become an accepted feature of this time, like physically distanced queuing\u0026nbspat the supermarket.\u0026nbspIt’s remarkable how inappropriate photo-stories made before the pandemic\u0026nbspnow feel. Seeing people in crowded places such as music festivals, or people going to work – a time before face masks – has quickly become dated.\u0026nbspLike our vocabulary, our visual language and practice has changed, for now.\u0026nbspWe’d all seen images of lockdowns in Italy and Spain and so had a good sense of what was to come. It was clear that the streets of London would fall empty and silent that first morning of lockdown on 24 March. In normal times I would have tried to find high positions to shoot down from but I knew that would be impossible. So I bought a giant monopod online, which thankfully arrived on the 23rd. The thing goes as high as a house with the camera popped on top, which I control using a smartphone down below. So I spent the first few days of lockdown wandering around with it flung over my shoulder, able to shoot desolate London scenes from above within moments from any position. The light was incredible during those first days and weeks, which only increased the sense of urgency to be out there shooting as much as possible. It felt like we were witnessing something unique in our history, which demanded thorough documentation. The days were long and I found it impossible to relax. Even when I got home I felt like I should be back out there photographing. I’d watch the skies from my garden and felt pangs of regret if I saw dramatic clouds developing, sure in the knowledge that I was missing some momentous, empty London streetscape.I went into an early lockdown because my partner is shielding. But you can’t “work from home” as a photographer, so I started taking long walks around my home district, Camden. I’ve lived in this part of London for over 15 years, but having all this sudden time to walk and think and really look in a way I’ve never done before gave me a new perspective. I noticed light, details, and stark beauty in places I’d never seen carefully before. It was strange to do this work and to feel people were only distant, fleeting presences on the periphery of my attention. But that’s how the early weeks of lockdown felt.I’ve worked for the  and Observer for 20 years now, but I also do commercial work – one of my last big jobs before locking down was a Transport for London campaign that is currently decorating a transport network I can’t use – and personal work. I’m the sort of photographer who always carried my Leica with me and usually I don’t see the distinction between paid commissions and my own work. Photography feels like a vocation as well as a career.Fears about the virus meant that for those first two months I didn’t take my camera with me when I went on my rather limited walks. It felt like a possible mode of infection an object I constantly touch and then bring to my face. It’s the longest I’ve gone in my adult life without my camera and without photography. It’s been very painful and difficult.Also I desperately missed, and continue to miss, the human side of my job. I enjoy the huge privilege of meeting so many disparate people and having the unique, brief insights into their worlds that being a photographer usually brings on a daily basis. I realise now more than I ever have before how these daily encounters give meaning to my life and also provide all the sparks that fire both my creative energy and my personal energy. Without that, life is flatter.I did quite quickly realise that I had to continue taking photographs even if I wasn’t working and wasn’t able to use my “proper” camera. I did a series taken on my long walks round Camden.As the rules have loosened a little and I’ve grown braver on my bike, I’ve visited friends outside their homes or in their gardens, and for the past few weeks I’ve returned to my proper Leica. My work is always about intimacy and connection, and as I’ve gradually started to take photos with people in them again, I’m glad to see that side of my creative personality coming back.Going forward, though, I am extremely apprehensive. Photography is a competitive, anxious profession to be in at the best of times. But at the moment I feel I’m trapped inside an airless glass box, where on the outside there are signs of the world coming back to life tentatively and old connections being renewed. I worry I’ll have my nose pressed to the glass till we are safe with a vaccine.My biggest challenge, apart from keeping my four-year-old entertained, was getting my parents repatriated from India, which we eventually managed to do. Both are thankfully safe and well.After a couple of weeks of lockdown work was very quiet, I was getting itchy feet and was desperate to take pictures. We were encouraged to think of stories to photograph safely that we could contribute to the paper. I decided to go to Slough, where I grew up, and photograph the local Asian volunteers who were helping the wider community. I would follow the volunteers in my own car and take pictures of the vulnerable people receiving the donations – all photographed at a safe distance. The volunteers felt very valued when they appeared in the national newspaper and even more so online, viewed by an international audience.Before the lockdown I would mostly shoot in studios with lights and a crew of assistants – makeup artists, PRs and so on. Since lockdown, I have been working solo and most of the portraits have been shot outside. I have sometimes set up a mini-studio with a background in people’s gardens: luckily we had pretty good weather. I must say I have actually enjoyed working this way, keeping things as simple as possible, just me and the subject.In the early days of lockdown, I was frustrated by the lack of coverage from within UK hospitals. Compared with what we were seeing and reading from Italy and the US, we knew very little of our own NHS. For me at least, this meant I had very little concept of the everyday acts of heroism being performed by NHS staff and I really didn’t have much of a clue what I was clapping for during “clap for carers” on Thursday evenings. I felt detached. I approached University hospital in Coventry, where I was born, and was lucky to be granted exclusive access to cover every\u0026nbspaspect of their amazing work.In doing so I was able to document many members of staff and their personal contributions – nurses and doctors in ITU, cleaners and charity workers on the wards. It was a huge undertaking and, given the number\u0026nbspof deaths and the lack of access for family members, a story that had to be handled very sensitively. It was also a challenging assignment because I felt a weight of responsibility to my subjects and I was shooting in conditions that were frankly alien to me (trying to take documentary photographs while wearing PPE is not easy). Fortunately, the feedback was overwhelmingly positive: people valued the unique insight the story provided, they were comforted by the many positive stories that emerged from the tragedy of the pandemic, and they recognised that we had fulfilled our duty to our readers as a newspaper. It showed me that honest, respectful journalism can be immensely powerful. And I was quite chuffed at getting five pages of my work in the paper, too!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d4ab823e88f7bbea570ad95d93880494c48fe0a/0_132_3015_1808/master/3015.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c13e67dbeb5a8829c56775bcab0f1b65","title":"rock against racism metals varied response to black lives matter","story":"Black Sabbath and Axl Rose are among those in the metal world supporting protests, but there’s no denying the opinions of others in the genreThere’s no point denying metal has a more complicated relationship with race than many of its adherents would like to admit, or confront. At its most stark, this is evident in the overt racism that has insinuated itself into black metal over the past 30 years, following the example of the openly racist Varg Vikernes of Mayhem and Burzum. There’s now even a genre identified as “national socialist black metal”.And there’s the fact of how metal came to be. The founding fathers of metal in the late 60s and early 70s were still playing music derived from the blues (even Black Sabbath began as a blues rock band, and their drummer, Bill Ward, filled their records with jazz-inspired flourishes).While researching a book about vintage metal, sociologist Keith Kahn-Harris and I discussed how the codification of metal a decade or so after Sabbath’s first record was in part a process of removing the blues, and thus the black musical origins of the genre, from its sound. That’s not a malign thing – as he pointed out, punk did much the same in its evolution out of the R\u0026ampB-based pub rock – but it happened.So it has been heartening to see so much of the metal world react to the Black Lives Matter protests not with a shrug, but with a recognition that sometimes the right thing to do is to speak. Kudos to Black Sabbath for printing T-shirts altering the logo from their Master of Reality album to read Black Lives Matter. Respect to Serj Tankian of System of a Down for taking a very clear stand: “Coordinate online and block every street everywhere and force the regime to resign. The time has come. Your time has come @realdonaldtrump.” Credit to all the metal bands coming together on Bandcamp to raise money for BLM with a benefit compilation.Astonished appreciation, as well, to Axl Rose – whose lyrics for One in a Million are nakedly racist and offensive – for both the fact of Guns N’ Roses giving support to BLM on Instagram and for Rose’s unequivocal taking of sides against Donald Trump: “Lamestream media ISN’T doing everything within their power 2 foment hatred n’ anarchy, that’s U!” he tweeted. “As long as we get what Ur doing, that Ur FAKE NEWS n’ a truly bad, repulsive excuse 4 a person wa sick agenda, we can work past U wwhatever it takes 2 a better, stronger future!!”While it would be nice to report these responses were universal, they’re not – even within the same band. John Dolmayan, System of a Down’s drummer, used Instagram to offer his support for Trump’s claim to be the greatest friend to minorities America has ever had, and has continued to continue on that tack, suggesting Democrats are “the true fascist, the true bigots hidden in plain sight from the same party who fought to maintain slavery, Jim Crow, non voting rights for women, and who are directly responsible for 70-plus million abortions, a large majority of whom were black. You don’t want free speech, you can’t handle free speech because you are cowards and need to be herded along with the rest of the sheep.” Sandra Araya, the wife of Slayer’s Tom Araya, has been posting racist memes to Instagram, and while the views of one person in a marriage should not be ascribed to another, Slayer’s own record on racial politics isn’t watertight given the controversy surrounding Angel of Death, their song about Josef Mengele.Are the metal bands speaking out against racism risking alienating their fans? No, not really. Any artist has racist fans, sadly. It is true that if you look on social media, those posts will have some fans disagreeing with them, angrily. It’s true, too, that some people are just stupid, whether or not they’re racist – like the fan who tweeted to Tom Morello that he was a fan of Rage Against the Machine “until your political opinions come out. Music is my sanctuary and the last thing I want to hear is political bs when I’m listening to music. As far as I’m concerned you and Pink are completely done. Keep running your mouth and ruining your fan base.” That fan was roundly mocked, by Morello, and more or less everyone else who had ever actually listened to Rage.It’s possible assumptions get made about metal because in the west its fanbase is – and let’s not deny it – overwhelmingly white and male, and history tells us no one looks out for the interests of white men quite as thoroughly as white men. But metal is behind only hip-hop as a truly global music, with no colour bars in the rest of the world. I’ve been to Nepal and to India to talk to metal bands and fans, talking about what the music means, and to those people it means liberation, and justice (metal musicians in Nepal are currently raising money for those starving to death in the country, because Covid-19 has deprived them of their subsistence livelihoods).Sabbath, Axl Rose and Serj Tankian are fulfilling the promise that those fans I met in Asia thought metal had made. They are supporting liberation. Any fan who has a problem with that has misunderstood metal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/619c64cd2342677e33921e9f62a2e9d56745d530/0_105_3210_1926/master/3210.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e41760355740241b7e9fbee45251289","title":"glastonbury tell us how you feel about the festivals cancellation","story":"Share your reaction to the announcement that there won’t be a Glastonbury this year, thanks to Covid-19 • Coronavirus and culture – a list of major cancellations• Coronavirus – latest updates• See all our coronavirus coverageNews that the Glastonbury festival 2020 has been cancelled to prevent the spread of coronavirus will have come as a shock to many.The festival’s 50th anniversary was set to take place this June, but organisers have decided to implement a fallow year and postpone until 2021.The festival organisers Michael and Emily Eavis wrote on social media that a cancellation was the “only viable option” in light of the pandemic.We’d like to hear from readers who are affected by the cancellation.Were you planning to attend, perhaps for the first time, or the last time?

The structure appears to have been a boundary guiding people to a sacred area because Durrington Walls, one of Britain’s largest henge monuments, is located precisely at its centre. The site is 1.9 miles north-east of Stonehenge on Salisbury Plain, near Amesbury, Wiltshire.Prof Vincent Gaffney, a leading archaeologist on the project, said: “This is an unprecedented find of major significance within the UK. Key researchers on Stonehenge and its landscape have been taken aback by the scale of the structure and the fact that it hadn’t been discovered until now so close to Stonehenge.”The Durrington Shafts discovery, announced on Monday, is all the more extraordinary because it offers the first evidence that the early inhabitants of Britain, mainly farming communities, had developed a way to count. Constructing something of this size with such careful positioning of its features could only have been done by tracking hundreds of paces.Gaffney said: “The size of the shafts and circuit surrounding Durrington Walls is currently unique. It demonstrates the significance of Durrington Walls Henge, the complexity of the monumental structures within the Stonehenge landscape, and the capacity and desire of Neolithic communities to record their cosmological belief systems in ways, and at a scale, that we had never previously anticipated.”He added: “I can’t emphasise enough the effort that would have gone in to digging such large shafts with tools of stone, wood and bone.”But then these are the same people who also built Stonehenge, dragging bluestones to the site from south-west Wales about 150 miles away.While Stonehenge was positioned in relation to the solstices, or the extreme limits of the sun’s movement, Gaffney said the newly discovered circular shape suggests a “huge cosmological statement and the need to inscribe it into the earth itself”.He added: “Stonehenge has a clear link to the seasons and the passage of time, through the summer solstice. But with the Durrington Shafts, it’s not the passing of time, but the bounding by a circle of shafts which has cosmological significance.”The boundary may have guided people towards a sacred site within its centre or warned against entering it.As the area around Stonehenge is among the world’s most-studied archaeological landscapes, the discovery is all the more unexpected. Having filled naturally over millennia, the shafts – although enormous – had been dismissed as natural sinkholes and dew ponds. The latest technology – including geophysical prospection, ground-penetrating radar and magnetometry – showed them as geophysical anomalies and revealed their true significance.Gaffney said: “We are starting to see things we could never see through standard archaeology, things we could not imagine.”Based at the University of Bradford, he is the co-principal investigator of the Stonehenge Hidden Landscape project, which has been surveying tens of kilometres of landscape across Salisbury Plain. Archaeologists are now joining the dots and seeing this massive pattern, he said.Coring of the shafts has provided crucial radiocarbon dates to more than 4,500 years ago, making the boundary contemporary with both Stonehenge and Durrington Walls. The boundary also appears to have been laid out to include an earlier prehistoric monument, the Larkhill causewayed enclosure, built more than 1,500 years before the henge at Durrington.Struck flint and unidentified bone fragments were recovered from the shafts, but archaeologists can only speculate how those features were once used.Gaffney said: “What we’re seeing is two massive monuments with their territories. Other archaeologists, including Michael Parker Pearson at University College London, have suggested that, while Stonehenge, with its standing stones, was an area for the dead, Durrington, with its wooden structures, was for the living.”He added that, while numerous ancient civilisations had counting systems, the evidence lies primarily in texts in various forms that they left behind. The planning involved in contracting a prehistoric structure of this size must have involved a tally or counting system, he believes. Positioning each shaft would have involved pacing more than 800 metres from the henge outwards.The research has involved a consortium of archaeologists, led by the University of Bradford and including the universities of Birmingham and St Andrews, in an international collaboration with the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Archaeological Prospection and Virtual Archaeology at the University of Vienna.Henry Chapman, professor of archaeology at Birmingham University, described it as “an incredible new monument”, and Richard Bates, a geoscientist at St Andrews University, said it offered “an insight to the past that shows an even more complex society than we could ever imagine”.The consortium is publishing a scientific open-access paper in Internet Archaeology.The discovery makes up for the cancellation of this year’s summer solstice celebrations at Stonehenge – on 20 June – due to the ban on mass gatherings prompted by Covid-19. Archaeologists have another reason to rejoice after the discovery nearby of a giant Neolithic structure."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2908be29f02f8bd5e839bbf6ecea690c41e66aa4/2_0_2595_1558/master/2595.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3df43c3196a94b903fe78d8b6a21ff73","title":"from bricks to clicks how local high street shops have turned digital during coronavirus","story":"Across the country, many independent retailers have had to switch to digital almost overnight in order to continue trading through the coronavirus lockdown. But as stores begin to reopen, will consumers now be as likely to shop online as in person?The coronavirus lockdown turned the lives of many high street merchants upside down overnight. For those who had little experience of online trading, or had business models that relied entirely on face-to-face sales, the challenge was sudden and daunting. But it was a challenge they knew they had to face.Before the pandemic, Georgina Black, who runs Pretty Shiny Shop, a small independent gift store in Finsbury Park, north London, did very little trade online. “I got maybe three sales a month through my website,” she says. “I didn’t regularly update it and I didn’t even list all my products. I can tell you that had to change fast when the lockdown started.”Since March, she has been painstakingly adding all her products, taking images of them, writing descriptions and listing measurements. “It’s time-consuming because I have no team, but I am starting to see the results. From an average of three sales per month I am now getting on average four or five a day.”After problems with couriers – one package she sent took 10 days to arrive – Black has experimented with different delivery options. She even bought an electric scooter so she could deliver local orders herself. “I’ve enjoyed zipping around the streets,” she says.While it is not clear exactly when trading will go back to normal, Black says that she will continue to push the online side of her business alongside reopening her doors. “It was never a priority before but now I need it to survive because, realistically, footfall is going to drop – people just aren’t going to be as comfortable going into shops. So shop owners need to adapt.”Once lockdown hit, owners of small businesses had to become digitally savvy – and fast. With high street stores having to turn bricks into clicks, Visa has teamed up with industry partners to offer support to them. It hopes to help small businesses across the UK find new and different ways to serve the local people and communities that rely on them.One of Visa’s partners is Shopify, a leading e-commerce platform that powers more than 1m businesses worldwide. With the backing of Visa, Shopify has offered a 14-day free trial for all new small businesses and provided support from experts who can guide, advise, and get small businesses online.Black, who built her website using Shopify, is very much a fan of the platform. “I love Shopify,” she says. “I find it incredibly easy to deal with at the back end. I’m not a very technical person but making changes and adding products really is a breeze.”Visa has also joined forces with Deliveroo. The delivery service has waived the £50 sign-up fee for up to 1,000 small and medium-sized restaurants until 30 June – or on whichever date before then all 1,000 waivers have been taken up – it has also provided a cash payment of £500 to 200 existing small and medium-sized restaurant partners so they could continue operating during coronavirus.More than ever, the platform is helping businesses continue to reconnect with their local communities. The social psychologist and founder of ShopAppy, Jackie Mulligan, says the “resilience and determination” of local businesses during the crisis has been “inspiring”.Independent businesses are the heartbeat of our high streets and local communities, and the backbone of the UK economy. “We keep the local high street looking good and lively,” says Black. “I’ve been so impressed by how the local community has supported local shops. It’s so heartening.”When small, local businesses succeed, everyone in the community reaps the rewards. Recent months have been enormously challenging for them, but with the right support from local customers, online platforms and Visa alike, they can survive and thrive.Shop local.

Many have opted to support local retailers, but can that trend last?Like other shops throughout the UK, the Edward Street Bakery in the West Yorkshire village of Saltaire has been closed throughout lockdown. But as it told its followers on social media “bakers gotta bake (and cook)”, so it has been running bake-a-longs via its Instagram account. From brownies to a peanut butter cornflake tart, fans have been able to join bakery staff in creating their own goodies at home. And as well as keeping customers happy it’s also inadvertently supporting other local businesses as the ingredients for the bake-a-longs can be bought from Mr Whetstone – a local refill shop.Although this might stand out for sounding particularly delicious, it’s far from an isolated instance of an independent retailer finding innovative ways to connect with customers while its doors are closed. Across the country, store owners have shown ingenuity – and the public has been falling back in love with their local high streets as a result.For many years, the fate of the British high street has been a staple of magazine features and newspaper business page reports alike. Yet, in what is perhaps one of the biggest surprises of 2020 – and there have been many – rather than being the death knell for the local shopping scene, coronavirus appears to have sparked a renaissance. Although some stores will not be lifting their shutters when regular trading resumes, others have seen a spike in business.A witness to this shift in shopping habits is Jackie Mulligan, founder of the digital platform ShopAppy, which allows consumers to connect with their local high street online. She says this shift towards shopping locally was initially driven by practicalities.“The sea change that we saw at the beginning of lockdown was a result of the big superstores being unable to give people delivery slots and people didn’t feel safe going into those stores,” says Mulligan. As a result, there was a sudden discovery of local shops, she says.ShopAppy itself experienced a huge growth in customer registrations as people looked for new ways to shop for groceries and essential goods. Over time, these same customers have begun to look for other products too, with gifts and even art becoming more popular. Mulligan says that two-thirds of artists who participated in this year’s online version of a local Makers’ Fair made sales.Furthermore, these new customers are discovering that the local stores have a lot to offer. “They’re reporting that they couldn’t believe how good the fruit and veg was,” says Mulligan, adding that customers have also been wowed by the prices and lack of packaging.Ensuring new habits stickThe challenge for local shop owners is to ensure that this shift in consumer spending habits continues longer term. How can they capitalise on this current upsurge?Retailers need to act now, says Mulligan. “You can close your shop but still trade. You can close your cafe but still offer something. The key is to make it easy for customers to support local.”The Edward Street Bakery offers one example of how to do this other examples include allowing customers to ring up with orders or book appointments to visit the store.Another option is to take advantage of the special offer to join ShopAppy for free until the end of July and connect with local consumers through that platform. “However ambitious you are, it’s difficult to save the high street on your own,” says Mulligan.“People have turned to corner shops and local shops and we don’t want them to go back to old habits. We want them to have a bit more of a local choice when doing their shopping – supporting local is for life, not just for lockdown.”Shop local.

In the wake of the financial crash, it was time, Osborne said, for “early, determined action”, the majority of which was focused on spending cuts.The results are plain to see in hugely reduced local services. Thousands of local lives have also been changed by cuts to the national benefits system put at £39bn. Hacked-down public transport makes things more difficult, and people’s environment can feel neglected and unkempt. It is difficult to talk about concepts such as aspiration when things feel so fragile and contingent.But there is also a story about strong community spirit. Volunteers muck in with street cleaning, grass cutting and the maintenance of local parks. The council talks about how much of what it does is now localised, and based more on partnership with people than the idea of services being provided from high. None of this detracts from the gravity of austerity – any mention of David Cameron’s notion of the “big society” is met with derision – but it highlights the fact that the places that have suffered the worst effects of dire cuts are not the hopeless social wastelands of some people’s imagination.A good example of renewed local endeavour in Thurnscoe is the Station House Community Association. Before the Covid-19 outbreak, it ran playgroups, after-school childcare and holiday provision from 9am until 6pm. At the moment, seven of its eight employees have been furloughed. The only member of staff still at work is its chief executive, Charlotte Williams, a borough resident for 27 years, who makes sure she speaks to the dozens of families on her books at least once a week.The first thing she talks about is cuts to local bus services and how difficult they make life for shift workers, before she turns to Thurnscoe’s former Sure Start children’s centre. “It used to be open long hours, and you could access a whole range of services,” she says. “But it’s no longer a place where you can get childcare that would allow you to go to work. They used to have a load of outreach programmes, stay-and-play sessions and baby massage and all that. Some of that still exists, but there’s far less of it, and it tends to be much more targeted now.“Before the cuts, anyone could go in and access those things. Now it’s more like if you tick a certain amount of boxes, you’ll start getting some input. It’s almost like ‘We’re waiting for you to fail, and then we’ll try and build you back up.’ Before, you could get the help you needed when you needed it. Everything feels very wobbly. That causes a nervousness in communities.”There is a bitter irony to Barnsley’s recent political history. At the 2019 election, the Conservatives won Penistone and Stocksbridge, a seat partly inside the borough, from Labour. In the constituency of Barnsley Central, Labour’s Dan Jarvis, who is now also the mayor of the Sheffield city region, watched as his share of the vote fell by 23 percentage points, largely thanks to Nigel Farage’s Brexit party. Barnsley nonetheless remains a place with a strong historical connection to the Labour, and the party has run the borough council since its creation in 1973.The leader of Barnsley council for 24 years has been Stephen Houghton. He places what has happened to Barnsley in the context of other historical events, not least the miners’ strike of 1984-5. The headquarters of what remains of the National Union of Mineworkers is in Barnsley. The home of Arthur Scargill, who led the strike to defeat, is just down the road. When the NUM was beaten, it opened the way for deep changes to society and the state. These arguably reached their peak in the coalition years when, Houghton says, austerity “wasn’t just about numbers. It was philosophical. ‘The state is too big.’”He and his colleagues began planning for cuts in 2008. “We could see the writing on the wall because of the scale of the crash, and the government bailout. I think everybody thought we were likely to get a Tory government, which would be even harder. It didn’t become just about making cuts to balance the books. We said, ‘The way we do things has got to have a complete rethink.’”The council now does a lot of its work through six “area councils” that administer services with a more local focus, and 21 “ward alliances” that coordinate such services as the cleaning of parks and streets with the aid of local volunteers. “In the past we’d been like most Labour councils,” Houghton says. “Very paternalistic, ‘We’re here to look after you.’ Suddenly our job became about helping you to look after yourselves.”Council-run children’s centres have, to use the official vernacular, been “reconfigured”. Nineteen once offered a full range of services, but now only six do. “We still provide a service, but it isn’t what it used to be. And these are deprived communities that really need that early years help. It’s the poorest kids who lose out, isn’t it?”Youth work goes on partly via voluntary groups, but all the borough’s council-owned centres have closed. Street cleaning, highway maintenance and parks budgets have all been substantially reduced.All but two of Barnsley’s libraries have stayed open, but many run on reduced hours and the mobile service has been axed. Council tax has been repeatedly put up, and the council’s workforce has been reduced from around 4,500 to 2,300.“Just a general lowering of service provision is hard,” says Houghton. “The place starts to look tired and decayed. Psychologically, the general population gets into a place where it’s like, ‘Nothing good ever happens and there isn’t much future.’ That isn’t how you’re going to change the nature of communities and move them on.”Just before the Covid-19 outbreak, the council was developing new spending plans. “For example, there are some areas in children’s services we were going to improve, around early years. That’ll probably have to stop,” says Houghton. “What Covid means is, we’re back to austerity again.”He and his colleagues now face an in-year financial gap of £23m. “But we worry more about 2021-22 than we do about this year. You’ve got to plug that gap, or we’re going to start cutting again. I think the government will come up with some money, but I don’t think they’ll fully cover it.”“How do you get people into jobs?” Houghton asks. “You can pay them more and encourage them. Or you can cut their benefits and drive them into work, but they’ll still be in poverty.”In Royston, just to the north of the town centre, Nichola Smith is the headteacher of Meadstead primary school, one of nearly 60 schools across England run by the Academies Enterprise Trust. Her school seems to have avoided the financial squeeze that has recently affected swathes of education, but she says money remains very tight. “Sometimes we can only do what we can do with what we’ve got, and I’ve got quite unique staff who are good at making something out of nothing.”The school has an across-the-board breakfast programme funded by outside donors, who are also involved in providing other help for families in precarious circumstances: grants for those unable to afford fridges or washing machines, assistance with buying school uniforms and food parcels.“The parents who were just about managing are now not managing, because universal credit’s not the same as the benefits they were getting before. That’s the biggest thing that’s hit my families,” Smith says.Such stories seem impossibly bleak, but conversations about Barnsley also include descriptions of a place that has started to recover some of its confidence, even in the hardest of times. A new town centre “community hub” and library called the Lightbox opened last year. A lot of people also talk about Experience Barnsley, a new museum and “discovery centre” that opened in 2013 just as the cuts were reaching their nadir.Run by the council and housed in the town hall, its collection is based on objects and stories supplied by the people of Barnsley themselves. Most of its £4m starting costs came from the heritage lottery fund and the EU.The poet and broadcaster Ian McMillan, who was born in Barnsley and lives four miles from the town centre, currently serves as the museum’s “poet in lockdown”. This entails writing a sonnet every Thursday, which is then posted on social media. “At the time, you thought, ‘Here’s a place where things are shutting down everywhere, and a museum is actually opening,’” he says. “It felt counterintuitive, like swimming against some kind of tide.”Nonetheless, his experience of his home town over the last decade has been coloured by the sadness that austerity brought. “You notice things kind of vanishing off the edge,” he says. ‘Where did that go, that community centre?’ Things disappear, and that becomes the norm. You notice weeds, and grass not being cut so often. It’s like mood music, but all in a minor key.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f382a44b38e8c6c0085a0d90ede06da7f7c8a65/23_324_5546_3328/master/5546.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=183b9353f35361a7a5765ce88264d42b","title":"i wept after hearing womens stories a decade of austerity has wrecked lives coronavirus","story":"Ten years of suffering has normalised hardship. As millions more are impoverished by coronavirus, we need an exit strategy My austerity journey, which took me to all four UK nations and numerous towns, cities and villages, to write a book, began in the months following George Osborne’s infamous budget statement 10 years ago today which let loose the beast of austerity. Unveiling £40bn worth of cuts from welfare to Whitehall, the then chancellor declared that austerity was “unavoidable” (it wasn’t) and ushered in a decade of unnecessary suffering by slashing public expenditure, even though the country was in recession following the 2008 financial crisis.While ministers and pundits vilified people in need, framing them as “scroungers” and “skivers” to justify austerity in the minds of the wider public, real lives were being wrecked and parents were grappling with the unthinkable choice between eating or heating.Even in those early days of austerity it was abundantly clear that the government was unleashing something unprecedented. It seemed beyond question to me that those who were most marginalised, including people with disabilities, lone parents, women, and vulnerable children were hardest hit.On a rainy afternoon in the late winter of 2013, I was interviewing victims of domestic abuse. One by one, a group of women, all of whom had feared for their lives and the wellbeing of their children at some point, spoke of a whole new set of fears: cuts to legal aid and difficulties accessing places in a refuge as services became ever-more stretched.After hearing the women’s concerns I wept. I felt the full weight from more than a year of interviewing people all around the UK about what the Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition government’s swingeing cuts meant on the ground.Ministers had lined up to repeat the patently inaccurate claim that the previous Labour government’s supposed excess spending had rendered austerity necessary. David Cameron’s 2009 statement, “The age of irresponsibility is giving way to the age of austerity”, foreshadowed what was to come.The equally mendacious fiction that a country’s economy was equivalent to running a household and that the national credit card had been “maxed out” meaning everyone had to “tighten their belts” had also been deployed. We were “all in this together”, the champions of austerity bleated. Except we weren’t. Well before the impact of Covid-19, one in 50 households were resorting to food banks, homelessness had skyrocketed, and child poverty was a national scandal: 600,000 more children are now living in relative poverty compared with 2012 and this is projected to rise even further, to 5.2 million by 2022.The age of austerity has been a prolonged episode of cumulative, bruising pain hitting the least able to carry the load hardest. Despite numerous overtures from subsequent Conservative governments about austerity being over, as the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has astutely pointed out, it is now “baked in”.The chancellor, Rishi Sunak’s ability to locate the “magic money tree” that the Tories previously insisted didn’t exist, in order to fund measures to mitigate the effects of lockdown – most recently the U-turn on meal vouchers during the summer holidays – are mere sticking plasters. However, sticking plasters eventually fall off and don’t mean the wounds are healed. The fact remains that millions of children continue to go hungry every day in one of the richest countries in the world.Even with measures to shore up the economy in the wake of the pandemic, unemployment is at record levels while large chunks of the population have seen for themselves the harsh reality of trying to claim universal credit – and just how measly it is.One of the most common worries people voiced when I was tracking the impact of austerity between 2010 and 2014 was that it would become “normalised”, that food banks and sofa surfing and entrenched poverty among millions of people would come to be just how things were. Those concerns were well-founded. We know how we got here. With the new threats of a pandemic and economic crisis, we need to make sure we have a way out.• Mary O’Hara is a social affairs writer and author of Austerity Bites: A journey to the sharp end of cuts in the UK.

Lockdown, followed by an economic crash, has propelled more than 3 million new claimants on to universal credit, in three months, exposing the system’s strengths – and its limitations – on a scale that has not been seen before.Whether the system is comprehensive enough, and sufficiently flexible and generous enough to cope with that scrutiny and responsibility, is the subject of the first report of the new parliament published this week by the Commons work and pensions’ select committee under its new chair, the Labour MP Stephen Timms.The cross-party MPs’ report is unanimous: for all the sterling efforts of the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) staff to keep universal credit up and running, millions of people have still struggled to get the support they needed to pay for essential living costs during the pandemic. “It’s done a decent job,” Timms says, “but universal credit is a very basic safety net.”Timms, the MP for East Ham, and a former social security minister in the Blair years, is no fan of either universal credit or the government’s welfare policies, but he praises the DWP for its handling of the crisis so far, not least its “fleetness of foot” in rapidly reorganising itself to ensure money got to a large number of people in such a short period of time.He salutes the government for uprating the value of universal credit by £20 a week and notes that the much-maligned computer system did not collapse. There was much that was impressive, he says. “It may well begin to rebuild public confidence in social security and a better understanding of why we need a social security system.”But not everyone has been able to get support during the crisis, notably migrant workers with leave to remain who are ineligible to claim benefits because they have no recourse to public funds (NRPF). Timms asked Boris Johnson about this in a memorable recent exchange at the commons liaison committee, when the PM appeared not to understand his own government’s policy, blithely wondering why they could not apply for universal credit.“I rather agree with the prime minister when he said hardworking families with no income should be entitled to support of one kind or another,” says Timms. “What I want to see is the government following through on that view and delivering support by suspending NRPF at least to families with children for the duration of this crisis.”The report calls for immediate suspension of the NRPF rules for the duration of the pandemic. How can it be in the public interest for people – some of them health workers and retail staff – to be expected to comply with physical distancing and quarantine rules while denying them access to benefits, it asks.Timms notes that other groups can feel ignored: people who have been refused universal credit on the basis that they had more than £16,000 of financial savings, for example. Some people on tax credits were wrongly advised to claim universal credit, were refused it because they had too much in savings, and then found they had been automatically – and irreversibly – cut off from tax credits, leaving them hundreds of pounds a month worse off.Universal credit, he says, is plagued by “very, very serious flaws”. Foremost among these is the “indefensible” five-week wait for payment. New claimants do not have the savings to wait that long without income, often running up rent arrears, debt, and becoming reliant on food banks.The irony, says Timms, is that despite hundreds of millions of pounds of investment in digital technology, an initial benefit payment is now slower than at any point in the history of the welfare state. “Ever since the 1940s we have had a social security system that has been capable of delivering the first regular benefit payment to people within a few days … It seems to me this is not a system that is fit for purpose if it cannot do what the system has done ever since the 1940s.”The government’s favoured solution to this has been to offer new claimants advance loans to tide them over the five weeks, repayable over 12 months. Timms says this simply stretches the financial shock of universal credit over a longer period. The committee has launched an inquiry looking at “technically feasible and financially affordable” alternatives to the five-week wait, including the idea that new claimants are given a non-repayable grant to smooth the transition.No change is not an option, believes Timms. “When I was standing for chair of the select committee I made a lot of this problem with the five-week delay in universal credit and it was very striking how widely this was agreed on the Conservative benches as well on the Labour benches that this was a serious problems that need to be fixed.”One of the lessons DWP ministers might learn from the pandemic is how much of the architecture of the benefits system temporarily suspended during the pandemic might be permanently jettisoned, he says. He would not scrap conditionality, but the “needlessly punitive” sanctions regime – which penalises claimants for failing to carry out agreed tasks, such as job searches, by witholding their benefits for between four weeks and six months – should be looked at. One of the problems is that claimants feel the system is there to catch them out, rather than support them.“That’s a very poisonous relationship that people have sometimes got into with jobcentres. That not how it ought to be. The system should treat people a lot better than that. Sanctions are a reason why too many people have found it such an unpleasant experience.”Pre-pandemic concerns will not be forgotten by the committee as it starts its programme of inquiries. It will examine disability benefits, and the future of work. And while it is not a full inquiry – at least not yet – Timms says the committee will hold the DWP to account over the tragic death of Errol Graham, a mentally ill man who starved to death after his benefits were cut off.Timms was shocked that the DWP has seemingly done so little to learn and change its policies despite the avoidable deaths by suicide of a number of vulnerable claimants like Graham over the years. “The committee will certainly not let this go,” says Timms. “Everybody can see that the system failed terribly in this instance and other cases, and it needs to be put right.”Cases such as Graham’s, and other well-publicised failures, have led some critics to attack the DWP as unfit for purpose. Timms is an optimist. The DWP may not be the “listening and learning” organisation of ministerial imagination (“I applaud the aspiration,” he notes drily) but it has a vital role to play nonetheless. “I think social security is a very good thing and I am a firm believer in the potential of the department to change people’s lives for the better. I want to see more of that potential realised.”Career: 1994-present: Labour MP for East Ham (previously Newham north-east) January 2020-present, chair, work and pensions select committee 2012–present: chair, all party parliamentary group on faith and society 2010-15: shadow employment minister 2008–10: financial secretary, HM Treasury 2007–08: competitiveness minister 2005–06: pensions minister 2006–07: chief secretary to HM Treasury 2004–05: financial secretary, HM Treasury 2002–04: minister for e-commerce and competitiveness, then for energy, e-commerce and postal services 2001–02: school standards minister 1999–2000: financial secretary, HM Treasury 1999: pensions minister 1990–94: leader, Newham borough council 1984–94: Labour councillor, Newham borough council 1994: manager, telecommunications reports, Ovum 1986–94: principal consultant, Ovum 1981–84: secretary, Newham NE Labour party 1978–86: consultant, Logica."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc2fdc6a1fe9dc32cf47e1ff26d271e48f743965/264_489_4038_2423/master/4038.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b27d045eb7114e4d066535bcbc125323","title":"windrush lawyer jacqueline mckenzie the home office is treating people with contempt","story":"The lawyer representing 200 victims of the Windrush scandal says systemic racism is at the root of the problemFor the past three months, Jacqueline McKenzie says her front room has been covered with Windrush compensation files. Since lockdown, she has stopped going to the offices of the law firm she co-founded in 2010 and has been working from home. But her study is too small to accommodate the huge amount of paperwork that goes with the 200 separate claims she is filing on behalf of people affected by the Home Office citizenship scandal, during which thousands of people were wrongly classified as illegal immigrants because they could not prove they were British citizens. “I think they are treating people with contempt,” she says. She is frustrated at the slow progress towards paying compensation to people who lost their jobs or their homes, were denied healthcare or the right to travel, or who were, in extreme cases, detained and deported. Part of the problem, she says, lies with the structure of the scheme, which requires claimants to gather large amounts of documentary proof of the losses they have incurred as a result of being miscategorised as unlawful residents (a problem that often arose because those affected were unable to gather the large amounts of documentary proof required to show that they had been living legally in the UK since the 1960s).She is also uneasy at the prolonged periods people have to wait between submitting a claim and getting a response. The Home Office’s latest figures state just 60 people have received a total of £360,000 worth of compensation – from a pot that was initially expected to pay out between £200m and £570m. “The terrible thing is the fact that they’re just sitting on these claims, not processing them fast enough, and then treating people to such grillings. They said that they weren’t going to do that.”McKenzie hopes potential claimants will not be discouraged by the delays and difficulties. She wants to help people complete their claims but she finds it hard to suppress her dismay at what she sees as the continuing mistreatment of a group already very badly served by British government. In the past two years, McKenzie has become one of the most high-profile, vocal campaigners on behalf of Windrush victims. She was aware of the looming Windrush scandal long before it got its name, and her frustration over the continued delays to justice is fuelled by a memory of the years she spent trying and failing to get officials to pay attention.Partly educated in Grenada and with family in the Caribbean, the 57-year-old lawyer built her legal practice on immigration and citizenship cases. For years before the scandal broke in 2018, she had been helping lots of Caribbean-born clients with citizenship claims and was dismayed that they were having to pay fees of more than £1,000 to regularise their status, when they had arrived in the UK legally as children. She realised that the documentation difficulties were causing life-shattering problems in early 2018, when a client she was assisting died as he tried to resolve his citizenship issues, a death she believed may have been connected to the stress he was under as he tried to persuade authorities that he was not an illegal immigrant.Does she think the government has learned the lessons of Windrush? McKenzie says she has no doubt that the Windrush scandal is the product of systemic racism within the Home Office, driven by the desire of successive governments to be seen to be controlling immigration. “I think the politicians believe that the majority of people in Britain are racist and don’t want migrants here, and so they all play to the gallery. That’s why protecting the rights of migrants isn’t ever an important enough issue, because everybody wants to be seen to be tough on immigration.”Today, a cross-government working group has been launched to tackle the challenges faced by the Windrush generation.  “We really do not need any further reviews to address inequality,” says McKenzie. “The real issue is finding solutions that will eradicate the factors which cause inequalities, the key one being racism, and implementing quite focused and far-reaching plans of action. Today’s announcement is only welcome if the team has power to effect real change and has real expertise.”She is faintly optimistic that things may change as a result of the renewed discussion of the debt owed to immigrants as a result of Covid-19, (“people have suddenly realised again that if we pull these people out the NHS will collapse,” she says), and also with the pressures of the Black Lives Matter movement. McKenzie started her career as a race equality officer in Hackney council in 1987, before getting a law degree at night school, so she has had a long time to reflect on these questions. “The two things are intertwined – the racism and the treatment of migrants.” If the Windrush generation had been “another group of people, a different race, they would probably have been treated better”.Many of those hoping for compensation find the forms complicated – despite the best efforts of Martin Forde, the barrister who devised the scheme, and who hoped it would be simple enough for claimants to process without the involvement of lawyers. But that has not proved to be the case. About half McKenzie’s time is spent on Windrush-related work, most of which is done pro bono. It is not sustainable long-term from a business perspective, but she is driven by anger at how much still has to be done to untangle the problems of those trapped by hostile environment measures, which are designed to make life hard for anyone without documentation. She is also worried that there is a group of people affected by the Windrush scandal who are still reluctant to come forward to regularise their status, because of their deep-rooted fear of the Home Office. Census research suggests there are at least 20,000 people who migrated from Commonwealth countries before immigration laws changed in 1973, who remain undocumented, and only 12,000 have come forward since the government set up the Windrush taskforce to sort out their papers.In the past two years she has become familiar with a number of people who live near the offices of her law firm McKenzie Beute and Pope, in Streatham, south London, who arrived in the UK in the 1950s and 60s but who have never applied for citizenship – initially because there was no need to, and latterly because they have become apprehensive that the process may trigger negative consequences.“I met a few in the local betting shop near my office, who said they still have no documents. I’m also quite near to a nightclub where a lot of the older ones hang out. I know a few of them in there haven’t got papers.” They are so familiar with her efforts to get them to apply for the paperwork that they wave in her direction, when she she walks past. “They call me Miss Windrush, and they say, ‘I’m coming to see you’. They never do.”Family: Partner, two daughters, one son.Education: St Joseph’s Convent and Institute for Further Education, Grenada University College of the Arts London (journalism and media) West London University ( LLB Law) College of Law (Law Practice Diploma) Instituto de Cervantes, Venezuela (Spanish Diploma) Kent University (MA international relations) University College of the Arts London (MA documentary research).Career 2010–present: solicitor, immigration adviser (England \u0026amp Wales) and barrister (Grenada), McKenzie Beute and Pope 2012-14: sabbatical as chief executive, Female Prisoners Welfare Association, Hibiscus 2005 -10: trainee solicitor, then solicitor, Birnberg Peirce and Partners 1986-2005: various roles including race and equalities officer, community development manager and director of community and communications, London borough of Hackney’s regeneration agency 1983-85: civil servant, Department of Health and Social Security 1981: Treasury clerk, Ministry of Finance, Grenada.Interests: Creative writing, yoga, patisserie and wedding-cake making, travel."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e3f66b3b1e1cd5cf2fadea2ce74e86c57c93443/0_117_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=039ff3feb565624d04890435be9cc646","title":"borna coric the latest to test positive for covid 19 at djokovic tournament","story":"Andy Murray wants to play in the rescheduled US Open at the end of August, but he shares the concern spreading rapidly through tennis since Grigor Dimitrov, Borna Coric and two trainers tested positive for coronavirus in Croatia at the weekend.Murray drew back from outright criticism of his long-time rival and friend, Novak Djokovic, after the world No 1 was forced to abandon his troubled Adria tournament moments before Sunday’s final in Zadar because of the shock withdrawal of world No 14 Dimitrov. But Murray could yet decide not to fly to New York if there are further outbreaks of Covid-19 – or complacency among other players.Having seen clips of players partying in a Belgrade nightclub last weekend, and more mingling in Zadar, Murray said he wonders how the USTA will police player movement at Flushing Meadows, where players will have to keep to themselves and resist the bright lights of New York.When news broke on Monday that world No 33 Coric, Dimitrov’s coach – Chris Gro – and Djokovic’s fitness coach – Marko Paniki – had also tested positive, while Djokovic had returned to Belgrade without having a test or making a formal statement, concern among many players and fans switched to anger.The British No 1, Dan Evans, speaking in London before the Battle of the Brits, which starts at the National Tennis Centre in Roehampton on Tuesday, slated Djokovic, who is chairman of the ATP players council. “I don’t think you should be having a players’ party and dancing all over each other and then two very good players test positive. He should feel some responsibility for his event and how it has transpired.Murray acknowledged that the virus had eased in Serbia and Croatia but pointed out tennis is a global activity. “Once you start to bring international travel into it,” Murray said, “with players and team members from all different parts of the world coming in, you need to make sure you’re taking all the correct measures, safety measures, all the precautions that you can, to try avoid a situation like they got into over there.”Murray is keen to resume at the highest level, having not played since the Davis Cup finals in November. “The grand slams will be my priority,” he said. “The proposals that the USTA have made, I don’t know if all of them are set in stone. They seemed to have changed quite a bit over the last couple of weeks.“I don’t mind what the situation is, providing it’s safe. If I was told I could take one person with me, for example, you can make that work. I would probably go with a physio in that situation, with some coaching done remotely. That’s not a perfect situation, obviously. From a performance perspective, that’s tricky. But I also appreciate that these are unprecedented times, so you have to make do with what’s possible. That sort of thing wouldn’t bother me much. For me it’s more about safety.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6356c624f2946d2763d5fef71b2b336cddfa27e/0_60_1024_614/master/1024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67d8061c3dcfd2cd48a434f528b2e33b","title":"declan review alistair hall monologue","story":"Available onlineThe absence of an audience increases the sense of desolation in writer-performer Alistair Hall’s compelling monologueWhen Jimbo first meets Declan at his Nan’s birthday party, the sausage rolls go flying. Declan wants to dance with him but Jimbo’s dad would never allow that. After a year of intense friendship, Declan disappears. Was it murder, suicide or kidnap, asks Jimbo. And how might it be related to the stranger he brings home who bites his bum and drinks his blood?This monologue, written and performed by Alistair Hall, is scheduled for a run at the Actors Centre’s John Thaw Studio in London later this year. Alexis Gregory’s digital production, with videography by Layke Anderson, is being streamed as a fundraiser for the centre. It is filmed on a stage littered with bin bags, a microwave and a stereo the absence of an audience increases that sense of desolation.Wearing checked pyjamas, Hall – who graduated from Rada last year – flickers between despair and defiance as Jimbo, continuously blurring the distinctions between childhood and adulthood. In a characteristic line, Jimbo likens his first ejaculate, as a 12-year-old boy, to strawberry jam. Later, the people in his life will grunt like pigs and bark like dogs. Hall’s pungent script evokes the Wiltshire countryside, deserted canals and the perfume worn by Jimbo’s mother, who has done a “vanishing act”.It is vividly performed to a static camera, with sparing use of extreme close-ups, and is most successful at evoking a sleep-deprived state of mind: the disorientation, strange silence and gnawing ache particular to a 3am wake-up.This compelling account of loss and sexual discovery ends rather too abruptly and, at 25 minutes, begs to be expanded. There is a troubling power in its imagery and in several of the elliptical episodes, but their accumulative effect cloaks the story in a mist. Teasing out Declan’s history and giving greater depth to the year he and Jimbo spend together – as well as shading in the characters of the parents – would make us feel the disappearance of both Declan and Jimbo’s mother more deeply and could result in a powerful fringe hour. But as both writer and performer, Hall is clearly a name to remember."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1a934e03b26291989f75b54656025090346c0c3/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=640969dcb16bf7d967287b794bdebed9","title":"show me a good time review hau berlin gob squad","story":"HAU, BerlinAnglo-German group Gob Squad take to the streets of Berlin, London and Sheffield with a livestreamed feat of connectionAt 1.12am, Bastian Trost invites anyone watching from Berlin to leave their beds and join him for a swig of kombucha. At 2.19am, Sharon Smith finds a horse in a field, its face glowing white in the light of her phone. At 5.23am, Laura Tonke lies down on the street, half asleep, and listens to the birds.In an extraordinary feat of endurance, Anglo-German theatre group Gob Squad mark the summer solstice with a 12-hour live-streamed performance. Blending the banal and the absurd, this largely improvised, time-stretching show runs from 6pm to 6am Berlin time. Audiences are invited to drop in whenever they like, but for those who join for the full 12 hours, it’s a feverish experience.A host (they rotate through the night) stands on the stage of the Hebbel Am Ufer theatre in Berlin, accompanied by a tech team, a tracking camera, and rows of empty seats. The other seven performers livestream from their homes or the streets of Berlin, London and Sheffield. A timer is ever-present below the stream, and they refer to the passing minutes obsessively. Separately, they chat, cook, and show us the sights of their cities. Every 15 minutes, the host brings them together for a moment of unity – generally through the medium of dance, laughter or snack. On the hour, every hour, one of the team finds a stranger roaming the streets of Berlin and persuades them to watch a few minutes of the performance.This audacious midsummer marathon searches for connection in this moment of extreme isolation, but at times it misses the mark, feeling both insular and inaccessible. It is in rapid turn moving, soothing, baffling, illuminating, riveting, eye-scratchingly dull and full of joy at 12 hours it’s hardly one-note. No question, the best bits happen in the early hours, when exploring their streets feels like being let in on a secret.Gob Squad have used lockdown to create a fever-dream time capsule. Both seriously and playfully, the show asks what theatre will look like post-pandemic.

Twelve episodes were made of Bennett’s matchless original, in 1988 and 1998, with an array of Bennett-friendly performers from Patricia Routledge to Julie Walters to Thora Hird, who notched up two episodes apiece over its two seasons.One Foot in the Grave often broke with formula, but this solo turn from Richard Wilson remains one of the sitcom’s standout episodes. Home alone while waiting for his jury service call, Victor Meldrew spends the episode going out of his mind with boredom, self-diagnosing with a medical encyclopedia, trying to crack an impossibly difficult crossword, booking an appointment with his doctor and blowing his top after a delivery man leaves a yucca plant in his toilet. The episode was so beloved by Wilson that he planned to perform it at the Edinburgh fringe in 2016, until a heart attack forced the show’s cancellation.It was a bold experiment for EastEnders to eschew its usual multi-character format to zero in on just one person. Thankfully, it wasn’t Ian Beale in the spotlight, but Dot Cotton, who, in this single-hander by Tony Jordan, records a message for her husband, Jim, as he recovers from a stroke. Breathtakingly bleak (“All that I ever ’ad, I lost,” she says at one point), it’s a tour de force for the then-80-year-old June Brown, who on the strength of this episode, earned herself a best actress nod at the 2009 Baftas.When Tony Hancock told his writers Ray Galton and Alan Simpson he wanted to go it alone sans long-time co-star Sid James, they gave him absolutely what he wanted – a full 25 minutes of unsullied solo Hancock. Now living in a shabby bedsit in Earl’s Court, this opening episode of the comedian’s final BBC series is Hancock at his pretentious, deluded best, wrestling with an impenetrable Bertrand Russell doorstopper while readying himself for a date that never happens. Paul Merton’s ill-considered 1996 remake should be avoided at all costs.Cheap-as-chips video-diary shows were all over TV in the late 90s, so when Marion and Geoff appeared on BBC Two in 2000 it was riding quite the cultural wave. Written by Rob Brydon and Hugo Blick, it starred the then little-known Brydon as Keith Barret, a sweet-natured but fatally naive taxi driver going through a messy orce from his wife, Marion (Geoff is “the other man”). Despite its visual simplicity, the series managed over three season to paint a heartbreakingly detailed picture of an unsalvageable marriage.Blick followed Marion and Geoff with this scandalously overlooked series of 10-minute monologues for BBC Two in which Joanna Lumley headlined as ageing orcee Madison Blakelock. Living in genteel poverty in a one-room flat, each episode has the 18-years-single Blakelock wistfully recalling her jet-setting, high-living past. Gradually, through the six episodes, her carefully cultivated veneer of happiness begins to crumble, exposing the desperate bleakness at the heart of the series.Screened in 2017 to mark 50 years since the Sexual Offences Act of 1967, these eight 20-minute pieces told a variety of stories based around the gay experience, from Mark Gatiss’s impossibly touching first-world-war-set The Man on the Platform – with Ben Whishaw as a returning soldier who had a brief and unconsummated dalliance with his superior – to Brian Fillis’s More Anger starring Russell Tovey as an 80s thesp railing against the media’s stereotyping of gay men.Mickey Rooney was once the go-to guy for breezy, sunshine-hearted goofballs, which is why it’s such a shock to see him as a splenetic, embittered ex-jockey in this typically twisty Twilight Zone from 1963. Furious not just at losing his job, but at his 5ft frame (“a short man with a short memory who’s forgotten that he’s worked for the sport of kings,” the narrator, Rod Serling, tells us), he’s visited in his drunken stupor by his more sober alter ego (also played by Rooney), who soon grants him his greatest wish ...There are few TV characters more prone to grandstanding as the Doctor, but never before in Doctor Who’s (then) 52 years had the show given its topline actor such a daunting, impossible-to-resist challenge, to carry an entire 55-minute episode by himself. Imprisoned in a gigantic, shifting clockwork castle, Heaven Sent finds Peter Capaldi’s Doctor trapped in his own personal hell, pursued by a terrifying and silent veiled figure. Loved and loathed in equal measure for its tricksy, bordering on avant-garde storytelling, it’s a virtual showreel for one of Doctor Who’s most underappreciated Doctors.A critically adored, but chronically underwatched slavery drama that ran from 2016 to 2017, Underground hit its creative peak with the season two episode Minty. The real-life American abolitionist hero Harriet Tubman (played here by the mesmerising Aisha Hinds) delivers a titanic speech to a group of white activists. “Ain’t nobody gets to sit this one out, you hear me?” she tells them. Sadly, as sky-scrapingly brilliant as that episode was, it wasn’t enough to save the series, and Underground was canned shortly after."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20f274ecb4eb82167084fa1f8b291059d91b9dd2/0_215_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71bac05d1d98a1f59aadfe1d9b27ae9d","title":"coronavirus global report new covid 19 cases surge south korea israel","story":"New infections in and around Seoul Spain reports 36 new outbreaks New Zealand strengthens bordersAuthorities in South Korea have said the country is experiencing a second wave of the coronavirus in and around Seoul, and warned that stronger physical-distancing measures will be reimposed if the daily increase in infections does not come down.Confirmation of the new wave came as the Israeli government said a lockdown could be reintroduced amid a sharp rise in cases, and a team of contact tracing experts prepared to deploy to the Australian state of Victoria to tackle a new outbreak in Melbourne.The new outbreaks once again highlight the difficulties of fully eradicating the virus, even in countries considered role models in their initial response to the pandemic.They came as the pandemic continued its spread worldwide. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of the World Health Organization, on Monday warned it was still accelerating and while it had taken three months to reach the first one million cases, the last one million had come in just eight days. Known infections are now at more than 8.9m.The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) on Monday said it had become clear that a holiday weekend in early May marked the beginning of a new wave of infections focused in the densely populated Seoul area.“In the metropolitan area, we believe that the first wave was from March to April as well as February to March,” the KCDC director, Jeong Eun-kyeong, told reporters.“Then we see that the second wave, which was triggered by the May holiday, has been going on.”As of midnight on Sunday, South Korea had reported 17 new coronavirus cases – the first time in nearly a month that daily new cases had dropped below 20.It was a drop from the 48 and 67 cases reported in the previous two days. South Korea has reported a total of 12,438 cases, with 280 deaths.At the end of February, South Korea reported a peak of more than 900 cases in a day, in the first large outbreak of the coronavirus outside of China.An intensive tracking and testing campaign reduced the numbers to single digits by late April.But just as the country announced it would be easing physical-distancing guidelines in early May, new cases spiked, driven in part by infections among young people who visited nightclubs and bars in Seoul over the holiday weekend.“We originally predicted that the second wave would emerge in fall or winter,” Jeong said. “Our forecast turned out to be wrong. As long as people have close contact with others, we believe that infections will continue.”The mayor of Seoul, Park Won-soon, said stronger physical-distancing measures would be reintroduced if the daily jump in infections did not dip below an average of 30 over the next three days.Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said his government was weighing up its options amid a significant rise in Covid-19 cases.The country has more than 20,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, with new infections jumping by more than 300 in recent days. At least 305 people have died with the virus since the country’s outbreak began in March.“If we don’t immediately change our behaviour regarding wearing masks and keeping distance, we will bring upon ourselves, against our will, a return to lockdowns,” Netanyahu said on Sunday, adding: “None of us wants this.”The government of South Australia said three contact-tracing experts were being dispatched to Melbourne in neighbouring Victoria, and would spend three weeks helping local health workers there following a new outbreak.In Spain, three areas in the north-eastern region of Aragón were ordered back into the penultimate phase of the lockdown de-escalation process on Monday after 33 new coronavirus cases were reported on Sunday.“We tackled the outbreak very early and managed to identify cases because we were looking for them,” said the region’s director general of public health, Francisco Javier Falo.Spain’s health minister, Salvador Illa, said the outbreak – concentrated in the Aragonese areas of La Litera, Cinca Medio and Bajo Cinca – was “being brought under control” on Monday morning.Illa said that 36 Covid-19 outbreaks had been detected in Spain in recent days, adding that all were under control.Spain emerged from its three-month state of emergency on Sunday, meaning that people can once again travel between different regions. The country also opened its borders to visitors from the EU and the Schengen area on Sunday.On Monday, New Zealand announced stricter measures to strengthen its border as an increase in flight numbers begins to bring more people home.“While the world enters this dangerous new phase, we remain in a phase of border containment,” said the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern.The government renewed its health order, mandating 14 days of quarantine, including a new measure to ensure that people arriving in New Zealand must have a negative Covid-19 test before leaving quarantine, and may be required to take multiple tests.France, which fully reopened its schools for children under 15 on Monday, on Sunday saw clashes between police and people attending music festivals in Paris and the western city of Nantes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36ca67a9029f2db34502a713e9c0ea44c7cc673d/0_160_4425_2656/master/4425.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7db5c3f1a300a6b9e8045e6fd80d6914","title":"why doctors say uk better prepared for second wave coronavirus","story":"Drug research, well-practised NHS staff and greater awareness of dangers give reasons for hope When a deluge of coronavirus cases threatened to overwhelm the NHS in March, Covid-19 was a brand new and little-understood disease, causing panic as well as deaths. Hospitals under huge pressure did all they could.Next time round, if, as everyone supposes, there is a next time, it will be different. In a second wave, or even localised spikes across the nation, the health service will know more about what it is dealing with – and will be better able to help people recover and send them home, say doctors.First, two drugs have been shown to work to some extent, even though neither is a cure. Most exciting is the revelation that a 60-year-old steroid, dexamethasone, reduces deaths among those who are most sick – saving one in eight lives among those on ventilators and one in 25 of those on other oxygen support. Remdesivir is also useful, reducing the length of the illness.Mervyn Singer, a professor of intensive care medicine at University College London, is delighted with the dexamethasone result. Covid-19 causes inflammation in the lungs and steroids are already used to reduce inflammation, but he said “medicine is conservative with a small ‘c’”, and some clinicians worried that they suppress the immune system, “so they have generally been used later rather than earlier”. However, the Recovery trial, a global trial into possible treatments, showed how well low-dose dexamethasone works in Covid-19 and it will now become standard of care.He thinks medical staff will next time feel less anxious carrying out procedures such as intubation, which carries the risk of viral particles shooting into the air. They will also be happier about chest compression and humidification – ventilating patients in a way that allows water vapour to emerge when they breathe.“We have become more confident in dealing with it. I think we’d be much less paranoid about the risk of infection. Obviously we wear PPE but the people looking after the patients in intensive care have had a low level of infection – no different from the man in the street – which I think is important because there was a lot of fear,” said Singer.What helps now is the reduced numbers of patients in intensive care with breathing problems. Even in bad flu outbreaks, it was never like the peak numbers for Covid-19. “Normally we’d have two to three of these patients in an intensive care unit. We got up to 62 at one time,” Singer said.“When you have got one nurse to one patient doing everything we normally do, it’s a very different kettle of fish from one nurse to four patients.”Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u0026nbsp1918 influenza pandemic\u0026nbspthat killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics.How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u0026nbspresurgence in infections\u0026nbspdespite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u0026nbspcramped dormitory accommodation\u0026nbspused by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.In June 2020, Beijing suffered from a new cluster of coronavirus cases which caused authorities to re-implement restrictions that CHina had previously been able to lift.Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune iniduals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry right now is that with\u0026nbspa vaccine still many months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.Early on, he and colleagues at UCL realised fewer patients needed ventilation than had been forecast. The assumption that the UK would need 18,000 ventilators when it had 8,000 was one of the reasons it was thought the NHS would be unable to cope with the epidemic – and that led to the lockdown.But only half of the sickest patients were intubated and put on a machine, while just as many have been given other help with their breathing, such as with the use of a Cpap (continuous positive airway pressure) mask. The long-term outcomes are better.Clinicians also now have more idea of which patients are likely to become sickest. There was a lot of talk earlier on about the “cytokine storm” triggered by the patients’ immune system going into overdrive and attacking its own cells. “If you look at the data, it isn’t particularly high,” Singer said.There is a hyper-inflammatory reaction from the body, but it manifests in a different way and can be measured by a standard inflammatory marker called C-reactive protein, or CRP. “It’s part of the body’s host response. It goes up hugely in Covid, whereas cytokine levels don’t go up very much,” he said.It means a patient’s CRP level can be checked on arrival in hospital. It is the patients who are more hyper-inflamed who are more likely to die. “We can target those patients more or less as they come through the door,” said Singer.One of the big and alarming surprises has been the damage Covid-19 does to the heart and circulatory system. “There is a really increased risk of clotting, probably due to damage to the blood vessels,” said Prof Sir Nilesh Samani, the medical director of the British Heart Foundation. “The virus attacks the lining of the blood vessels and makes them more likely to clot.”People who have had heart attacks or strokes are more vulnerable to the virus, which can also cause them in sick patients. “The heart attacks are peculiar,” said Samani. “It is the smaller arteries downstream that are affected, where the inflammation is more acute.”One small study looking at the lungs of people who died, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found they had nine times as many blood clots as people who died from swine flu (H1N1).Knowing the danger, many hospitals are now giving those at risk anticoagulants and antiplatelet therapy soon after admission. These are drugs that thin the blood, making clotting less likely.“The lesson we have learned is that we should treat these people before they have the clot,” said Samani. The risk can be measured by looking at the levels of D-dimers in the blood. These are proteins – the leftovers from the normal clotting of blood when people have a wound that heals, for instance. But high levels can indicate a clot is forming.The British Heart Foundation, together with the government’s National Institute for Health Research, is supporting six major research programmes to discover more about the effects of the virus. These will combine data from hospitals, information about our health and lifestyle, genetic studies, and imaging and artificial intelligence techniques.That research, and much more in other fields, will help find the optimal way to treat Covid-19 patients and reduce the death rate when – and if – it returns."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c6b8d80e5c5165ddee40360926daeb942c75c92/0_27_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9770a3bb3aed7ae0390aa10da5b1e805","title":"coronavirus live news covid 19 update china us uk brazil latest updates","story":"China halts imports from US food plant where 481 test positive for Covid-19 UK PM to unveil lockdown easing on Tuesday Brazil deaths pass 50,000While the pandemic is now accelerating in Africa, aid organisations are warning that it poses a particularly severe threat in South Sudan, where nearly half of the population was hungry before the pandemic and where years of civil war and corruption have shattered infrastructure.“It can be out of control at any time,” said David Gai Zakayo, a doctor with the aid group Action Against Hunger told the Associated Press news agency.“The groups we are treating are malnourished. My big worry is if the virus begins spreading to those groups we are treating, it will be a disaster.”At South Sudan’s only laboratory that tests for the virus, supervisor Simon Deng Nyichar said the team of 16 works up to 16-hour days slogging through a backlog of more than 5,000 tests.Around 9,000 samples have been tested since early April, when the country became one of the last in Africa to confirm a coronavirus case.With materials in short supply, testing is largely limited to people with symptoms of COVID-19. It can take weeks to receive results, creating mistrust in communities and resentment toward contact tracers, the Health Ministry said last week.Craig Spencer, a doctor who in 2014 became the first person in New York to be diagnosed with Ebola and who has been regularly commenting on Covid-19, tweets his hope that the rest of the US will learn from the city’s “missteps”.Amanda Holpuch, reporting for the , has more on the reopening in New York, where she notes that the crisis has underlined inequalities, with black and brown communities experiencing higher death rates than the white population. Economic effects have also hit these communities the hardest, leaving many to decide whether to risk access to health insurance and income, or their personal health, on Monday.Infections are down in New York City, but between 200 and 400 people have still been testing positive for the virus each day over the past two weeks, according to city data.At landmark department stores, safety measures will be in place such as giving workers temperature checks and putting plastic iders at cash registers. Saks Fifth Avenue plans to reopen on Wednesday with 100 new hand-sanitizer stations and escalator handrails outfitted with ultraviolet-light disinfection, among other changesAfter more than 100 days of lockdown, New York City residents have been celebrating their progress in curbing the coronavirus pandemic by getting their first haircuts in months, shopping at long-closed stores, and dining at outdoor cafes.Once the centre of the global outbreak, New York City was the last region in the state to move into Phase 2 of reopening with restaurants and bars offering outdoor service and many shops reopening. Barber shops and hair salons welcomed customers for the first time since mid-March on Monday, Reuters reports.Playgrounds were also due to reopen in the most populous US city. The pandemic has killed nearly 120,000 Americans.At the same time, a dozen states in the south and south-west reported record increases in new coronavirus cases, and often record increases in hospitalisations as well, a metric not affected by more testing.The number of new cases rose by a record last week in Arizona, California, Florida and Texas, together home to about a third of the US population. Alabama, Georgia, Nevada, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, Utah and Wyoming also experienced record spikes in cases.As Sweden debates the rights and wrongs of its much scrutinised “light touch” approach to the pandemic, locals are somewhat bewildered by the international attention, reports the FT’s Nordic correspondent, Richard Milne.Speaking to locals on the streets of Sweden’s second largest city, Gothenburg, he reports that there is a widespread feeling that Sweden’s decision to keep schools open for children up to the age of 16 was still wise, but also that the country has failed to protect its most vulnerable in care homes.But a “stubbornly high” death toll – 102 new deaths were announced on Wednesday – is an important factor in why all strands of the Swedish approach is up for discussion. A debate about whether the strategy has been right or wrong is just starting inside the country.Walt Disney Co will reopen its Disneyland Paris theme park in phases from 15 July, days after it plans to open its parks in the US, the company said on Monday.It expects to reopen Disneyland Park, Walt Disney Studios Park, Disney’s Newport Bay Club hotel and Disney Village, according to Natacha Rafalski, the president of Disneyland Paris.A paper on Vietnam’s success in suppressing Covid-19 using strict quarantining and widespread testing has been penned by experts including Vietnamese officials and staff from Oxford University’s clinical research unit in Ho Chi Minh City.They list lessons which are applicable to other states, including:French movie fans ventured back into cinemas today for the first time since the Covid-19 lockdown, helped by a new safety feature: Minions placed at intervals in the seats to ensure social distancing is observed.Stuffed toy versions of the yellow, pill-shaped characters were deployed at the MK2 cinema in the south of Paris for a showing of the 2015 movie “Minions”, a spinoff from the Despicable Me franchise that made them famous.The Minions, dressed in their trademark goggles and dungarees, were placed strategically around the auditorium to enforce a rule that viewers leave at least one place free between them and their neighbours.The reopening of cinemas across France on Monday was part of a phased relaxation of the lockdown measures that were imposed in March to curb the spread of COVID-19.Nathanael Karmitz, chairman of the MK2 cinema chain, said the numbers showing up for matinee screenings on Monday showed how much the French public had missed going to the movies.They love cinema. It’s much less risky spending two hours in a cinema than travelling on public transport or taking a train.Netflix is to resume filming in the UK with fantasy epic The Witcher set to restart shooting on 17 August.Netflix, which plans to spend in excess of £400m this year making more than 50 TV shows and films in the UK, shut down all filming in March as the coronavirus pandemic struck.The owners of Europe’s largest meat-processing plant must be held to account for a mass coronavirus outbreak that has infected more than 1,500 of its workers, Germany’s labour minister has said.Hubertus Heil said an entire region had been “taken hostage” by the factory’s failure to protect its workers, most of whom come from Romania and Bulgaria.Germany’s coronavirus reproduction or R rate leapt to 2.88 over the weekend largely as a result of the outbreak at the plant at Gütersloh in North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW). About 7,000 people have been sent into quarantine as a result of the outbreak, and schools and kindergartens in the region that had been gradually reopened have been forced to close until at least after the summer holidays.Health authorities have accused Tönnies, the family-run business that owns the plant, of breaking regulations around physical distancing that were introduced to dampen the spread of coronavirus. Authorities say Tönnies has also been reluctant to give them access to workers’ contact details, allegedly hampering the tracking and tracing of the workers and their contacts. Tönnies said delays in handing over personnel data had been due to Germany’s strict data protection laws.Clemens Tönnies, the company’s billionaire CEO, held a press briefing at the weekend at which he apologised for his company’s management of the crisis, and said it would take “full responsibility” for what had to be done to combat it. Within his own family there have also reportedly been attempts to oust him from his role. He has ruled out resigning.India has reported a record number of new coronavirus cases and a death toll of more than 400 people in the past 24 hours, Reuters reports.The 15,000 new cases brought India’s total to more than 425,000, behind only the United States, Brazil and Russia, according to data from the federal health ministry.Nearly 14,000 people have now died from the disease caused by the virus since the first case in India in January.The death toll in India remains low when compared to countries with similar numbers of cases but public health experts fear its hospitals will be unable to cope with a rise in cases.The German embassy has sent messages to its citizens living in New Delhi warning them that there was “little to no chance” of admission to hospital for treatment for coronavirus as well as other intensive care needs.The message was not an order to evacuate the country but to consider whether India remained safe depending on inidual circumstances, a diplomat said.The German advisory follows Ireland in suggesting that its citizens leave India due to the availability of hospital beds.A dashboard run by the Delhi state government showed more than 7,000 hospital beds available for coronavirus patients today, although most of those were in a handful of government hospitals. Patients looking for beds have questioned the accuracy of the data.Despite the peak of infections projected to be weeks if not months away Prime Minister Narendra Modi relaxed most curbs of a near three-month lockdown on 8 June in order to ease economic pain. RIVM, the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment in the Netherlands, has reported zero Covid-19 deaths for the first time since early March. It reported 69 new infections and two hospital admissions. The total number of deaths in the country remains at 6,090 and the total number of people who have tested positive has risen to 49,658.The effects of the coronavirus pandemic will be felt for decades, the World Health Organization’s director general warned an online conference today, after the WHO reported a record increase in global cases on Sunday.Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a virtual health forum organised by Dubai authorities that the greatest threat facing the world was “the lack of global solidarity and global leadership”. He said: We cannot defeat this pandemic with a ided world. The politicisation of the pandemic has exacerbated it. None of us is safe until all of us are safe.The total number of cases rose by 183,020 on Sunday. While Europe is easing lockdowns, Covid-19, which has killed more than 465,000 people and infected almost 9 million worldwide, is surging in the Americas and parts of Asia.The pandemic is still accelerating. We know that the pandemic is much more than a health crisis, it is an economic crisis, a social crisis, and in many countries a political crisis. Its effects will be felt for decades to come.Concerns that Donald Trump’s inner circle might pressure the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to rush a coronavirus vaccine to market in time for the presidential election have risen after the White House attacked the agency for reversing itself on an experimental drug treatment.Critics say the FDA’s decision in April to approve hydroxychloroquine for emergency use – an approval that the agency revoked last Monday – demonstrated that the regulator is vulnerable to political pressure from the White House.But other outside experts said regulatory approval for any vaccine would require a degree of data transparency that would prevent the process from being unduly rushed.Experts have been underlining important nuances to do with the ‘R’ rate in relation to the current spike in cases in Germany, where authorities in the Göttingen and North Rhine Westphalia regions called on police at the weekend to enforce quarantine measures after struggling to get people to adhere to isolation rules.While Germany has been widely regarded as a success story in Europe, the country’s reproduction rate of virus infections jumped to 2.88, based on a four-day average, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for public health said on Sunday.Prof KK Cheng, the director of the Institute of Applied Health Research at the UK’s University of Birmingham, tweets:The coronavirus outbreaks that have struck workers in meat plants around the world are due to poor working conditions and living quarters in a sector that is in a “disastrous race to the bottom” in the quest for cheap meat, trade union representatives have said.Meat plants have persistently been centres for outbreaks, with some of the biggest clusters in the US and Canada focused on slaughterhouses. According to the Food and Environment Reporting Network (Fern), which has been tracking the outbreaks, nearly 30,000 meat plant workers across the US and Europe have been infected with the virus and more than 100 have died.“The entire sector is in a disastrous race to the bottom, driven by the market and by consumer demand for cheap meat,” said Peter Schmidt, the head of international affairs at the German food workers union NGG. Schmidt claimed modern plants in Germany brought in contract workers from eastern Europe who were prepared to put up with low wages.A two-day lockdown in which residents will be barred from leaving their homes, except for work or urgent necessities, is to be imposed in a northern city of Kazakhstan after a rise in Covid-19 cases.The move continues a trend towards weekend restrictions in the oil-rich nation of 19 million, where the number of coronavirus cases has more than quintupled to about 28,000 since a nationwide lockdown was lifted in mid-May.Residents of Kostanay and four towns, including the mining hubs Rudny and Lisakovsk, will be subject to the restrictions, the local newspaper Kostanayskiye Novosti reported.Three areas in the north-eastern Spanish region of Aragón have been ordered back into the penultimate phase of the lockdown de-escalation process after 33 new coronavirus cases were reported on Sunday.“We tackled the outbreak very early and managed to identify cases because we were looking for them,” said the region’s director general of public health, Francisco Javier Falo.Spain’s health minister, Salvador Illa, said the outbreak – concentrated in the Aragonese areas of La Litera, Cinca Medio and Bajo Cinca – was “being brought under control” on Monday morning.Illa said 36 Covid-19 outbreaks had been detected in Spain in recent days, adding that all were under control.Spain emerged from its three-month state of emergency on Sunday, meaning people can once again travel between different regions. The country also opened its borders to visitors from the EU and the Schengen area on Sunday."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Minister for Climate Action and Environment says funds would go to just transitionFund will use levy on oil companies to invest in green projects over the next decadeClimate change remains an abstraction for many in Ireland, but not for those suffering in Africa"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4285353.1592832482!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"do not swim notices lifted from three dublin beaches","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPortmarnock beach in May.

The precautionary “do not swim” notices had been put in place at Dollymount, Sandymount and Portmarnock beaches, following heavy rainfall last week. The incidents arose due to storm water tank overflows at Ringsend wastewater treatment plant resulting in discharges into Dublin bay. The temporary ban was implemented by local authorities in consultation with the Health Service Executive. The Ringsend plant treats approximately 40 per cent of Ireland’s public wastewater but has been operating over capacity for many years, and comes under acute pressure during periods of unusually heavy rainfall. On Sunday Fingal County Council announced it was lifting the swimming ban on Portmarnock beach. The temporary notice had been put in place last Wednesday “due to possible effect on water quality due to the storm water overflow at the pumping station, likely to be as a result of the heavy rain event locally,” a spokeswoman said. Lab results of water quality from testing on Thursday came back “excellent,” the council spokeswoman said. On Monday Dublin City Council announced it would be lifting the “do not swim” notices placed at Dollymount and Sandymount, after results from lab testing came back clear.

Photograph: Julien BehalPA WireThe vast majority of the Irish economy and society will reopen at the end of month as the country prepares to almost fully exit the lockdown imposed following the spread of the coronavirus.The Cabinet met on Friday to sign off on a new roadmap which will see the majority of businesses reopen on June 29th.From then places of worship, gyms, cinemas, restaurants, hotels, leisure facilities and hairdressers can reopen their doors alongside museums, galleries, theatres and concert halls.All sporting activity, including close-contact sport, will resume, including team leagues for adults and children. Funding of €70 million to help the sports sector reopen was also approved by Ministers.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar stressed the public must now take “personal responsibility” as the State-imposed restrictions were lifted. “This means not entering a place if you see it is packed. It means leaving somewhere, even if you are having a good time, if you have been there for too long. It means exercising judgment and self-control for your own sake, but also for the collective good”.Most music venues can open their doors, as well as bingo halls, arcades and amusement parks. Choirs and music practice can also resume, but with strict social distancing and ideally outdoors.Gatherings will be limited to 50 people indoors and 200 people outdoors until July 20th.This is later due to rise to 100 people indoors and 500 people outdoors, although a further review will be carried out by the public-health team in the coming weeks.PreschoolsCreches, childminders and preschools will be opened only for children of essential workers, however this will expand to include all workers on a phased basis from late July. All other children’s activities and venues will be reopened from the end of the month.People will also be permitted to travel throughout the country, and travel to offshore islands can also resume. Those planning to travel to different counties will be asked to “acquaint themselves with the level of transmission of the virus in the relevant area”.There will be no specific number for gatherings in private homes but the public-health team has asked that physical distancing be maintained.Cocooning for those over 70 will continue to be recommended, the roadmap states.In its advice to Government, the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) said “the risk of a large surge of infection remains ever present and Covid-19 will continue to be a threat to the world for the foreseeable future”.“As the public-health restrictions are lifted and there are no longer detailed rules in place imposed by the State, everybody in society will now exercise their own judgment and take personal responsibility for decisions that they make about the risk of infection to themselves and others in different situations.”The existing ban on rent increases and evictions has also been extended until July 20th following Cabinet approval.Minister for Health Simon Harris said that it was “unlikely” that there would be a return to the kind of restrictions previously put in place in March, while chief medical officer Tony Holohan said the NPHET would now begin to consider measures “at a national level, or below national level” should there be a spike in cases.“It won’t be the same set of measures that we introduced in March,” he said.Mr Holohan said he did not believe the measures were being lifted too quickly. “We think it is appropriate for where we think we are in terms of the transmission of the disease,” he said.Mr Harris also said the National Screening Service would outline its plans for the resumption of routine cancer screening by the end of the month but that programmes would likely reopen on a phased basis over the summer.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Ross Maher (22) topless and covered in blood when he swung kitchen knife several timesMinister for Climate Action and Environment says funds would go to just transitionJackpot not yet claimed, residents of area being urged to check their tickets carefullyJudge says fortunate at least two of attacks by Pavel Kratochvil did not end up as fatalitiesActor will participate in a web livestream on Monday evening to discuss fracking and the programme for governmentFSAI says plant-based \u0026lsquomilks\u0026rsquo and sugary cereals should be avoidedWarnings had been put in place at Dollymount, Sandymount and PortmarnockPSNI appeals for information on Thomas McCabe who has been at large for more than two yearsDeadline extended last week to facilitate small number of schools who had not completed processSecond group of Defence Forces personnel due to return to Ireland on July 2ndDaily briefing reveals 32,800 less unemployment payments issued than last weekNew online survey provides \u0026lsquostark depiction\u0026rsquo of experiences of many students in IrelandRaids have taken place in Limerick, Clare and Tipperary under Operation CoronationOn Saturday Northern Ireland reported no new confirmed cases of coronavirusDiarmuid Martin says some churches cannot hold 50 people while others could fit 1,500Car driver fatally injured at scene lorry driver arrested after crash on M1 southboundFriends of the Irish Environment brings challenge to National Mitigation PlanBill to allow all third level graduates vote in Seanad election may be among first Bills debatedFund will use levy on oil companies to invest in green projects over the next decadeJosepha Madigan says Dublin nightlife rates \u0026lsquovery poorly\u0026rsquo compared to European rivalsStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4284936.1592773506!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord blinking back tears charlestown bids farewell to its much loved garda colm","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t“It seems when God takes the young he takes only the best.” The coffin of  Det  Garda Colm Horkan is carried in Charlestown, Co Mayo. Photograph: Colin Keegan, Collins DublinDet Garda Colm Horkan was at home watching The Late Late Show when Hozier came on and performed a stunning version of The Parting Glass.“I want that song played at my funeral,” he told his friends.Ten weeks later, on an achingly sad Sunday in Mayo, a fellow officer sings it at his graveside. And Colm’s father holds the flag which draped his son’s coffin minutes earlier in the little church beside it.People in Charlestown still can’t believe it. Can’t believe he’s gone. Before Mass, they stand silently around Market Square and across the bridge and up Chapel Street to the Church of St James.The funeral will be at midday in the place where he was baptised and where he received his First Communion and made his Confirmation. For a time, he was a Minister of the Word.“Now he is here for the final farewell,” said parish priest Tommy Johnson, welcoming him in for the last time.Their Garda Colm was killed at midnight last Wednesday while going about his duty in the nearby town of Castlerea. He was 49.Nobody in Charlestown could quite believe it.They spoke in hushed tones as they waited for the cortege to arrive, standing at the edge of the footpaths. Between them, on both sides of the road, were Colm Horkan’s isional colleagues.They held out their arms to space themselves and then stood in line for over an hour, hands by their sides, as rain poured and sun shone in fitful bursts.On the bridge over the river Mullaghanoe – or the Blackwater, as the locals call it – the Casey family had taken up position. Grandmother Angela, her daughter Sinéad and children.They point across the road to The Dew Drop Inn, the pub once owned by Colm’s parents and where he was born. Further up, if you take a right at the chemist, is Colm’s house.A single rose“We’re all absolutely in bits. We were the closest all our lives,” says Angela of the Casey and Horkan families.Sineád is holding a single rose from her garden.“My brother Declan is his best friend. We all grew up together, across the road from each other.”Declan is also a garda.“He led the escort on his motorbike when Colm was brought home on Friday night,” she says. “The Caseys and Horkans – we were joined at the hip.”She shakes her head.Caimin (8) says he was like an uncle to them. And the presents he used to bring – they were great.A few yards away, the green and white jerseys of Charlestown Sarsfields GAA club are out in force. It’s the lads from the under-21s. Colm used to coach them.An older woman, who doesn’t want to give her name, tells of her son in Boston. “He’s gone there now 20, maybe 25 years. And he was on the phone the other night telling me that Colm was the special one in the town. He was the one that he always remembers.”It’s nearly time. “Fall-in!” The gardaí straighten up and snap to attention. So too do the eight representatives from the Mayo branch of the Organisation of National Ex-Servicemen, rows of medals on their green blazers.This is going to be a State funeral like no other. A virtual State funeral, as one senior garda puts it. It must be conducted with due observance of Covid-19 social distancing restrictions. Close marching ranks of uniformed gardaí from all over the country will not fill the streets this time. The Garda Band will not be at the head of the cortege.Slowly, slowly, the procession makes its way up Chapel Street flanked by officers from the Divisional Ceremonial Unit in slow march. Their stoic colleagues blink back tears, standing with heads high and arms tightly by their sides, fists clenched.Colm’s father Marty, his brothers Brendan, Aidan, Padraig and Dermot and sister Deirdre follow.Tarmac crunchThere is silence, save for the sound of clicking cameras. The cortege stops at the church railings and the officers remove the coffin from the hearse and shoulder it the rest of the way, boots crunching loudly on the tarmac.Colm Horkan’s colleagues from Sarsfields, wearing black trousers, white shirts and club ties, march too. Behind them, Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan and Garda Commissioner Drew Harris.The Casey family watch from outside the gates.As the small funeral party goes inside, nearly a thousand people continue walking up the road towards the GAA club as Panis Angelicus rings out over the town on the public address system. They watch the Mass on a big screen from the stand in Fr O’Hara Park.“Scene of some of his greatest performances,” said his brother Brendan during his eulogy.“He never let the jersey down.”It’s the strangest thing inside the church – a big funeral, no, the State funeral, of a highly respected and hugely popular garda and a community stalwart. But the casket is borne to the altar past row after row of unoccupied pews. The sound of footsteps echoes loudly in the empty space.Before the obsequies begin, a minute’s silence is observed for the fallen officer by his colleagues – serving and retired – at stations around the country. In the grounds of Áras an Uachtaráin, President Michael D Higgins and his wife stand by the Peace Bell. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar is with Garda officers outside headquarters in the Phoenix Park.The television pictures cut from venue to venue. It’s a moving scene, with members of all the emergency services in every corner of the country paying their respects. When this is counted up, perhaps we will find that Colm Horkan’s funeral was, in fact, the biggest of all.It was no more than he deserved. “A man cut down in his prime doing the job he loved,” said his brother Brendan. of the peaceFor 21 years of his 26 years of service, Det Garda Horkan worked for the people he loved, with the people he loved. “Long may we be blessed by men and women of true dedication and service, true s of the peace. Men like Colm Horkan” said Msgr Tommy.The hundred of officers listening in the rain-soaked church grounds bowed their heads as the Garda Commissioner spoke of their comrade. “He epitomises what all of us as members should strive to be.”In the church, Padraig Horkan read familiar words from the Book of Ecclesiastes. “There is a season for everything, a time for every occupation under the heaven.A time for giving birth, a time for dying . . .”And further in that verse is the line: “A time for embracing, a time to refrain from embracing.”Unusually for an Irish funeral, because of the pandemic, this was a time to refrain from embracing. Or at least, it was supposed to be. In truth, in the streets and around the side of the church and up at the GAA grounds, all notion of social distancing went out the window.People couldn’t help but hug and embrace at this awful tragedy. “The gunshots that rang out in the early hours of Wednesday morning echoed not just in the town of Castlerea but right across the country,” Msgr Johnson told his scattered congregation.People will wonder why Colm had to die in such a random, horrific way.“I cannot answer those questions, but it seems when God takes the young he takes only the best,” said the priest.But the manner of his death should not eclipse Colm’s life, he added. He was good man, a decent man, doing his duty. And he was loved.The Last Post is sounded and for many officers, it is too much.Then Garda Alan McGinty, a Mayoman based in Ballyfermot, sings him his song as swifts darted in the afternoon air and sunlight pierced the stained glass windows of the old church where his club jersey lay on the altar beside a cherished family photograph.But since it fell into my lotThat I should rise and you should notI’ll gently rise and softly callGood night and joy be to you all . . .Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4285312.1592827992!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"more than 100 irish troops return from lebanon after coronavirus delay","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIrish troops serving in Lebanon returned to Ireland on Monday. File photograph: Colin KeeganCollins DublinSome 115 Irish troops serving in Lebanon returned to Ireland on Monday morning, after their planned rotation home had been delayed by several weeks due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Defence Forces personnel were the first of two groups or “chalks” returning home on rotation, with a second group of 170 troops to return on July 2nd. The troops were originally due home in the middle of May but that was delayed when UN secretary general Antonio Guterres banned rotations of all UN peacekeepers until June 30th, to prevent the spread of the illness, also known as Covid-19. The Government had attempted to secure an exemption for the Irish troops on the Unifil mission in Lebanon from UN headquarters in New York. The Irish troops had been stationed in the middle eastern country for more than six months, and will now be required to quarantine for 14 days under public health guidelines. The first chalk of troops rotated in to replace the returning personnel left Ireland at the weekend, having been self-isolating for two weeks in Coolmoney camp in Co Wicklow. The second chalk to be deployed to Lebanon will depart before July 2nd. In April Irish special forces troops were rotated home from Mali on time, despite the UN’s request for a delay. Fourteen Army Ranger Wing personnel were flown home with the help of the German air force, while the Spanish air force assisted another seven Irish troops return from a separate mission in Mali. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar previously told the Dáil the moratorium on rotating troops was to prevent the spread of coronavirus “by limiting movement of personnel into mission areas”.The Defence Forces has a long-established peacekeeping role in Lebanon as part of the UN mission, dating back more than 40 years. The peacekeeping force had been established following the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1978, and some 47 Defence Forces personnel died in the service of peace over a 23-year period.

Photo:Gareth ChaneyCollins PhotosThe pro-coalition wing of the Green Party has enlisted Hollywood actor Mark Ruffalo for a live seminar on Monday night, as part of its final push to win over the support of the membership for the programme for government.Party leader Eamon Ryan and deputy leader Catherine Martin announced that Mr Ruffalo - who received Oscar nominations for his roles in The Kids are Alright and Foxcather and also played the Incredible Hulk in the Marvel movie of the same name - will participate in a web livestream on Monday evening to discuss fracking and the programme for government.Mr Ruffalo has also been a prominent environmental campaigner for many years and has been particularly active in the anti-fracking movement in the United States.The event called “Ireland’s Green Future” will highlight the programme for government’s undertaking to stop US fracked gas imports.In a statement issued on Monday Mr Ryan said: “That would make Ireland the first nation in the world to do so. Instead of powering Ireland from increased fracked gas imports, the PFG also states that Ireland will lead the world on renewable energy procuring at least 70 per cent renewable electricity by 2030.”Ahead of the event Mr Ruffalo said: “For years, US and Irish campaigners have worked together to achieve a ban on fracking in Ireland. Now the PFG is an opportunity for a monumental achievement for Ireland to become the first country in the world to ban fracked gas imports. This is crucial for our shared climate, as well as for the public health of Americans.”With both camps in the party accepting the decision will be very tight, the respective campaigns have ramped up considerably on Monday in the final hours of canvassing.While the vote is not being counted until Friday, it is a postal vote so the last votes are expected to be cast tomorrow to allow delivery to party headquarters. Some 2,000 members of the party are expected to participate in the internal ballot with a two-thirds majority required if the party is to enter coalition.The 7:00PM livestream event will be available at: https:us02web.zoom.usj84198289424‘On a knife edge’Earlier on Monday Mr Ryan says if his party’s members reject the programme for government “it would be very hard for us to go back to the negotiating table.”Mr Ryan has described the programme for government as a “left wing document” and the best approach to repair the economy.He said he did not know what would happen if party members rejected it.Opponents of the deal were also lobbying fiercely, with Green party sources on both sides predicting a tight result when the votes are counted on Friday.One Green TD said the vote was “on a knife edge” with a two-thirds majority needed if it is to be ratified.Mr Ryan agreed that the vote by Green Party members on the programme could be very close, but he was hopeful that members would sign off on the document.The outcome of the membership votes among the three parties will be announced on Friday.Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil members are expected to ratify it but all three must back the deal in order for Fianna Fail leader Micheál Martin to be elected taoiseach when the Dáil sits this Saturday.The Green Party has the highest threshold of the three parties to secure the approval of its membership.Two thirds of members registered to vote on the proposals must back the deal.ConcernHowever, one of the TDs who negotiated the deal, Neasa Hourigan, has said she will vote against the deal, while a number of Green members have voiced their concern about it.The leader of the Green Party in Northern Ireland, Clare Bailey, has also called for a no vote.Speaking on Newstalk Breakfast, Mr Ryan acknowledged that the Green Party would be going into government at one of the most challenging times possible and that there would be risks and uncertainties.The new coalition government will need to invest in public housing, public health, public transport and climate action which will require the State to be “bigger,” he said.“In the particular crisis at the moment, the best approach to get the country back working again is actually to borrow and invest in stimulus and employment. The programme for government says we’re going to do that for the next two or three years.”Following that there would need to be a review and the books would have to be balanced again in the long run. “But even then there’s an agreement that we would try to balance the current account, we would continue to borrow for capital investment,” Mr Ryan said.‘Difficult week’Speaking on Monday morning, Tánaiste Simon Coveney said he believes the deal can be approved. However, he said nothing can be ruled out, including a second general election this year, if parties do not vote to pass the draft government deal.“I think we will have to have that debate when it happens. I’m a positive person and I believe we can get this done this week and that is what the country wants us to do,” Mr Coveney said on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland.Asked if another election could be on the cards if the deal does not pass, he said: “Well I mean we can’t rule out anything. Our focus will be on getting this deal passed and putting in place a government that can work for people when the country needs it.”He said this is a difficult week for Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the Green Party because there is ision among members and politicians about the deal.He said: “In many ways, within Fine Gael there are lots of people who still find it difficult to contemplate going into government with Fianna Fáil in particular.“Politics has changed and if Fine Gael defines itself by its past and its past relationship with Fianna Fáil then I believe the electorate will move away from us. We have got to define ourselves by what we want for the future.”When asked about opposition to the deal, voiced by Ms Hourigan, he said she was part of the negotiating team that signed off on the deal.He said: “She did not get everything she wanted in the deal... nor did I”.DivisionFine Gael and Fianna Fáil are sharply ided on what to do if Green Party members reject the proposed coalition government deal between the three parties this week.Sources in the parties expect a political crisis to arise if the programme for government is not endorsed by Green members this week, with a deadline for renewing the Offences Against the State Act on Tuesday, June 30th, looming.Several senior Fine Gael figures, including a number of Cabinet Ministers, told The  on Sunday they would not form a government with Fianna Fáil and Independent TDs if the Green Party rejected the programme. Fianna Fáil sources say the party can form a government supported by or including Independents if the Greens do not endorse the deal, while some party sources also believe Labour can be persuaded to join the process if the Greens reject the proposal.-Additional reporting PA"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Officials prepare \u0026lsquoretaliatory punishment\u0026rsquo after anti-North balloons arrived from SouthBan on cruise ships extended beyond June 30th cases increase as more citizens return homeCovid-19 outbreak in staff at Tyson foods in Arkansas sparks Beijing U-turn on policyChina says draft law is aimed at separatist activity, subversion, terrorism and collusion abroadChina may have shut down its controversial re-education camps, but minorities are still persecutedSamira Imin\u0026rsquos father was incarcerated for three years in XinjiangDelhi says Chinese dammed a river and lay in wait for clash in which 20 Indians diedCases widely seen as Chinese \u0026lsquohostage diplomacy\u0026rsquo following arrest of Huawei\u0026rsquos chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou in VancouverInvestigators say they have found gun and are talking to two \u0026lsquopeople of interest\u0026rsquoTensions remain high despite two governments agreeing to de-escalate confrontationAustralia says it will not name country responsibleKim Yo-jong\u0026rsquos criticism of Seoul illustrates her seniority and potential to become rulerBatons wrapped in barbed wire used in high-altitude brawl in which 20 Indian soldiers diedNZ officials tracing 320 people regarded as \u0026lsquoclose contacts\u0026rsquo of pair who returned from UKClash on Himalayan border is the most serious since 1967, why now and what next?Any moves to invalidate peace deals posemajor setback to Moon\u0026rsquos efforts for more lasting reconciliation with NorthFirst loss of life in area for decades as \u0026lsquoviolent face-off\u0026rsquo between troops elevates disputeLatest in a series of threats from the Kim regime since diplomacy with US broke downFierce criticism as editor of influential Rappler website faces up to six years in jailChile replaces health minister as deaths spiral while global cases exceed 7.6 millionStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4285289.1592825464!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus sweden starts debating rights and wrongs of approach","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeople walk in Drottninggatan during rush hour in Stockholm Photograph: Jonathan NackstrandAFP via Getty ImagesThe two sides of Sweden’s against-the-grain coronavirus strategy are visible from a small square in northeastern Gothenburg.On one side lies Gerashus care home, where more than a quarter of residents have died in the past three months, most of them from Covid-19. At the peak of the outbreak, two-thirds of its staff were absent.On the other side of the square is a bustling tram stop where dozens of people wait to head into the centre of Sweden’s second city and children come from a primary school. A steady stream of customers head into a convenience store to collect online shopping parcels or buy lottery tickets. Nobody wears a mask but most keep a metre’s distance from each other.“Life is the same really. There are people coming in all the time. You don’t think too much about corona. Everybody is going about their normal lives,” says 58-year-old Adrian, working in the store from behind a Plexiglas counter.As the only EU country not to adopt a harsh lockdown, this light-touch coronavirus strategy has sparked enormous international attention – especially from right-wing populists who believe the virus has been over-hyped.Sweden has chosen to focus on public health in the broadest sense, aiming to keep as much of society open as possible, including restaurants, schools and fitness centres as well as its borders. The Scandinavian country of 10m people has relied on voluntary recommendations for social distancing and homeworking in their effort to flatten the curve enough to allow its healthcare system to keep functioning.But a far higher death toll per capita than its Nordic neighbours has led Norway, Denmark and Finland – all of whom locked down – to open their borders to each other but keep them closed to Sweden.Swedes appear bewildered by the sudden scrutiny they are under. There is a widespread feeling that their decision to keep schools open for children up to the age of 16 was a wise one, but also that they have failed to protect their most vulnerable in care homes such as Gerashus.Acting rationallyMany Swedes were initially reassured that its response to the crisis has been led by healthcare experts, not politicians, fuelling a belief that it acted rationally as other countries responded emotionally. But the stubbornly high death toll – 102 new deaths were announced last Wednesday, more than Norway has had in the past two months cumulatively – has led to sharper domestic criticism of officials, including Anders Tegnell, the state epidemiologist who crafted Sweden’s approach.The result is that everything is now up for discussion and the debate about whether Sweden’s approach has been right or wrong is just starting inside the country.Leif Dotevall, communicable disease control officer in the region around Gothenburg, argues many people may be viewing Sweden’s strategy through the prism of whether they believe in lockdowns or not, rather than the overall health impact. “It makes the analysis right now skewed: you are so obsessed by your idea of the strategy and that emotional analysis makes you blind to the whole picture,” he adds.But Elisabet Lann, the Gothenburg city councillor responsible for elderly care and a member of the opposition Christian Democrats who is sceptical about the government strategy, says 200 years of peace and neutrality have left Sweden slow to react. The response has been cloaked in a self-image of a country that believes it behaves calmly while others are impetuous.“We don’t like to be irrational because of feelings, or be frightened to make irrational moves,” she says. “We look at other countries as more impulsive.”‘We are open’Situated on Sweden’s west coast, Gothenburg is home to some of the country’s biggest company from Volvo Cars and truckmaker Volvo AB to ball bearings manufacturer SKF and healthcare group Molnlycke. It is also home to some of the country’s most deprived areas such as Bergsjon, the northeastern suburb where Gerashus is situated and where unemployment before the coronavirus crisis was almost three times that for the city as a whole.Vastra Gotland, the region of 1.6m people that includes Gothenburg, has had 649 Covid-19 deaths so far, more than the 598 in Denmark, 326 in Finland or 242 in Norway, all of whom have more than triple the population. Sweden as a whole has suffered 5,053 deaths.Henrik Tornqvist, a priest in Bergsjon, is one of those who has marked the change since March: he used to perform three or four funerals a month, now he does the same number each week. Up to 1,000 people a week used to attend homework groups, lunches and services at the church. “We are open but we don’t have a normal life,” he adds.He restarted services for the Midsummer holiday last weekend but with a congregation reduced from the usual 120 to 30.Maria Ottensten, the head priest for northeastern Gothenburg, says of Sweden’s strategy: “We can keep going this way. It’s boring but we can keep it going. Closing everything down, you can’t do it for very long.”SchoolsClose by is one of the symbols of the Swedish strategy’s success: the primary school. Children up to 16 have gone to school throughout the crisis. Locals hail the policy for helping with children’s mental health as well as allowing parents to keep on working. “I like playing with my friends, and not being inside all day,” says one teenager playing basketball outside the school.In the centre of Gothenburg, a class of nine and 10-year-olds from the French school has stopped in front of a statue of King Charles IX. Stefan, one of the teachers, says of the decision to keep schools open: “I think it’s been good. I’m not afraid of getting corona from them. If we close down the school, society will collapse because you need to have someone home.”Gitte Caous is the director for the district of Eastern Gothenburg, which includes Bergsjon, and she emphasises that health is about more than purely preventing deaths. “A country doesn’t just consist of elderly people. It also consists of children, companies that could go bankrupt etc. Take suicides – people take their lives because they have been socially isolated,” she says.Not all schools in Sweden have been open. It closed down those for over-16s as well as universities, judging that they could cope better with distance-learning and reduce the pressure on public transport from older students who often have to travel further.Camilla Alenas, headteacher at SKF’s Technical College which has 96 students, says the past three months have been challenging. “We have seen we need to work on mental health. The students haven’t said, ‘Oh, I need help’ like they used to”, she says, adding that the school has had to help some poorer pupils get access to the internet. She is worried about those graduating: “It’s a bad time to go into the job market.”‘This is a bit too normal’Truckmaker Volvo underscored this by announcing more than 4,000 job cuts last week. The hit to Sweden’s economy from coronavirus will be sizeable, raising the question over whether it is more influenced by the lack of a lockdown or by the spread of the virus.SEB, one of Sweden’s biggest banks, now forecasts gross domestic product will decline 5 per cent this year, similar to its estimate for Norway and worse than Denmark’s latest guidance of a 4 per cent contraction. Unemployment in Sweden could hit 12 per cent, according to SEB, well above its financial crisis peak and almost double its pre-Covid rate.But Sweden’s economy is expected to do far better than the European countries most affected by coronavirus, such as the UK, France, Italy and Spain.Hakan Samuelsson, chief executive of Volvo Cars based in western Gothenburg, says its Europe sales fell 50 per cent in May but June is likely to be “much better”. He now expects a V-shaped recovery. “It will hurt the economy. But we can’t isolate this. We can’t close down our economy or our company and wait for a vaccine to come,” he says.He adds that many talk about Covid-19 deaths but few discuss how many die each day from alcohol abuse or suicide. “A bad economy where people lose their income will cause social problems. Politicians need to recognise that closing down the economy will have negative effects,” he says.The evidence from shops and cafes in Gothenburg that have stayed open throughout the pandemic is more mixed. A waiter at Cappuccino, a cafe in the city centre, says: “It’s generally been quieter but now the days are warmer it’s the same. It’s back to usual – it’s kind of strange.”In the evening, bars close by are packed and young men are drinking beer while playing crazy golf. “I’m scared this is a bit too normal,” says one woman, trying to get her newborn baby to sleep in a pram.In Bergsjon, where wages are lower and unemployment higher, shops are suffering more, a sign that a lack of a lockdown is not enough to keep the economy going when people are afraid of the virus. At Tintin’s hair saloon, one of the hairdressers says business has more than halved.“We hope it comes back but people are scared. There’s a lot of infection here. We are afraid soon it could be like Italy,” he says. The woman behind the counter at Horsed Beauty, a local clothes shop, adds: “It’s slow. There are not so many people because of corona.”‘We have failed the elderly’Like most countries with high per capita death rates, Sweden has suffered a large number of deaths in care homes, in its case about half of total deaths. At Gerashus in Bergsjon, 28 of its 102 residents have died since March. The ward for dementia sufferers was particularly badly hit.One day, says Inger Bomark, head of elderly care in eastern Gothenburg, 66 per cent of staff were off so temporary workers – often with few qualifications and bad language skills – were pressed into action, often working in several different wards or care homes.“We have completely failed with old people,” says Anna Skarsjo, a care home nurse who is also head of the Kommunal trade union in western Sweden. She says the country has paid the price for decades of neglect, and that there were little-to-no plans on how to deal with Covid-19 in inidual care homes and a lack of protective equipment.When she started working as a nurse 26 years ago, five staff would look after 10 residents now there are three or four workers for 16 residents, she says.“One can’t expect a three-course meal when you pay for a hot dog,” she adds.The bigger question for Sweden is whether the problems in its care homes invalidate its entire strategy. Given that many countries have suffered about half their deaths in care homes, some in Sweden argue its elevated death rate is merely a function of the high infection level in society.Lann says: “I’m not sure if the strategy is right. If you choose a total lockdown it comes with a huge cost for schools, mental health. But a more common sense strategy requires more strict guidelines for elderly care. You can’t combine a common sense strategy with some kind of common sense in care homes.”Dotevall argues that Sweden has a larger number of elderly people than other European countries and problems with its care homes for years, meaning the focus on the lack of a lockdown may be a red herring.“I’m not sure that the lockdown problem is the main thing, I think the problem lies more with the structure of care homes,” he says, adding that many Swedish care homes are too large and disconnected from the rest of the healthcare system while workers are often badly paid, poorly qualified and on hourly contracts.“The situation for care home workers has to be improved. We have degraded the value of looking after old people,” he says. Ottensten, the priest, says it reflects the political choices of recent decades: “We have done nothing for care homes and lots for children.”Another aspect of Sweden’s focus on broader public health rather than narrowly trying to reduce deaths from coronavirus is that there is more talk about the invisible issues related to the pandemic such as mental health and domestic violence, even though the long-term impact – as for all countries – is impossible to discern yet.Ing-Marie Larsson, head of social services in eastern Gothenburg, says: “The most vulnerable in our district, who have poor mental health, have had it very tough.” She adds that all crime has gone down except that related to drugs.Domestic violenceDotevall says domestic violence appears to have risen significantly despite no formal lockdown while many 16- to 19-year-olds with an immigrant background only got warm meals at school, which is now closed. “If you see society in the broader sense with restaurants and cafés and businesses, what happens in a total close-down? I don’t know. But when you analyse coronavirus, you have to see what has happened in all these areas – the economy, mental health and not just in the old people’s sector.”In Gothenburg, as in Sweden as a whole, there is a sense that many of these questions could take years to decide. There are worries about the high death rate and the level of new coronavirus infections. Its excess deaths this year are proportionately higher than Norway and Denmark, which have similar population density and cultures, but less than the UK, Belgium or Italy.But for every Bergsjon with a high death and infection rate, there is another deprived area such as the neighbouring district of Angered that has been far less affected by coronavirus.“All of us who work with this, every day and night, we think, ‘Was this right or wrong?’” says Dotevall. “Some days we think we were right and other days not at all. Finally, we may be surprised to see the whole picture.” – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"World community urged to reject move to intensify \u0026lsquoprofound human rights violations\u0026rsquoAmple evidence uncovered of movement\u0026rsquos widespread persecution of Yazidi minority and other ethnic minoritiesSarah Hegazi\u0026rsquos simple gesture at a concert led to outrage, persecution and heartbreakDemonstrations against prices and wages erupt in Sweida and spread to DeraaAnnexation would be incompatible with international law, Maas warnsTerror group ramps up attacks as crises including coronavirus provide opportunityGovernment pressed to speed up talks with IMF and donors to secure funds and halt slideBritish-Iranian woman seeking release after first furlough from jail in Iran since 2016Police and security force officers killed in roadside bomb and gun battleHealth authorities confirm more than 3,000 new cases on two consecutive daysOpponents warn that US-backed plan would lead to independent Palestinian stateWar and coronavirus-ravaged country to get $1.35bn from UN and Saudi ArabiaTension rises in region with Israel planning to extend sovereignty to Jewish settlementsGiven lack of other options, authorities used restrictions as main tool to fight pandemicFormer cabinet minister Saad al-Jabri was strategic architect of Saudi counter-terrorism effortsPrime minister claims allegations are a \u0026lsquodeep-state\u0026rsquo, left-wing political witch-huntLong-serving politician will become first sitting prime minister in Israel\u0026rsquos history to stand trialPA president cites imminent threat of Israeli annexation of parts of the West BankFirebomb attack on home claimed the lives of a couple and their 18-month-old sonWHO forecasts coronavirus will kill 42,000 and infect most of 28 million populationStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus.

A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states.

The fire sales are a result of expats left jobless by the UAE’s coronavirus lock-down. Among them, thousands of British expats are trying to scrape back the pennies before they are forced to leave a place many call home.The coronavirus lockdown has upended the lives of thousands of expats, turning their dream of a life abroad into a nightmare of uncertainty. Thousands have been made redundant, with strict visa regulations forcing them to return to the UK, with little time to catch their breath.  It’s almost 11 years since Selina Dixon traded her claustrophobic commute from Surrey into Central London for her expat dreams of Dubai.“I was spending four hours a day on the train,” she tells The .The fashion marketer left behind the early morning drizzle and commuter grind, for a new life in the UAE. One which promised year-round sun, tax-free salaries, and the opportunity of adventure.“It’s not about the glitz and glamour, whoever has been fortunate enough to live here know there is much more behind the façade,” she says.An estimated 240,000 Britons call the UAE home, working as everything from air hostesses to teachers.Dixon was made redundant a few weeks ago, now she is living off her meagre savings. In weeks her visa will expire, and she wont be able to renew it unless she finds a new job.“Every day you wake up, you’re looking on LinkedIn. Speaking to contacts and your network, but then you have to be mindful there are so many people going through this.”With thousands of people flying in and out of the UAE every day in normal times, the country was always vulnerable to Covid-19. A  stringent lockdown saw swathes of the economy shut. Though some 40,000 cases of the virus have been registered, Dubai is slowly beginning to open up, yet the economic recovery will likely take many years.Ninety per cent of the UAE’s population are expats, and a study out this month by Oxford Economics, a quantitative analysis firm, estimates that the country of nine million could lose up to 900,000 jobs, and some 10 per cent of its population – British expats are likely to be among the worst affected.At least part of the difficulty lies in the UAE’s Kafala – or sponsorship - system. A visa scheme wherein residency is tied to your job. Companies may sponsor a foreigner for residency as long as they employ them, but the moment someone becomes unemployed, a count-down begins on the expiry of their visa.As Dixon says, “Dubai is a place that without a visa - it’s difficult.”Though the government has announced some visa waivers, those who have lost their jobs since March 1st have thirty days to find a new job, or their visas become invalid, and they will be hit with daily fines.It means that those like Dixon may be forced to return to the UK for the first time in years. “It was not a choice that I was ready to make, but one that I may have to make.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ancient cup cup discovered hebrides loch former royal navy diver","story":"A 5,500-year-old cup has been discovered by a former Royal Navy er in the mud of a loch in the Outer Hebrides.Archaeologists are said to be very excited over the find which could provide clues to the lives of the mysterious early islanders.The cup was found on the Isle of Lewis on Friday by Chris Murray.Mr Murray described it as a beautiful example of the Neolithic age and had been the first person to drink from it in thousands of years.Mr Murray has also previously discovered similar bowls around artificial stone built islands, known as crannogs, in the Outer Hebrides which have led to a startling re-writing of history.Crannogs date back to more than 1000 years older than Egypt\u0027s pyramids and before Stonehenge.Of the latest find Mr Murray from Stornoway said: It is the cup of our ancestors, a very ancient early Neolithic bowl or drinking vessel around 5,500 years old.I had an idea there might be some items around the crannog on the loch.

To think it is older than Stonehenge, Callanish and the pyramids is just fantastic.I have been in touch with archaeologists from Southampton and Reading universities who are very excited about it.”Mr Murray also recovered 40 shards of pottery from the loch.Archaeologists in Scotland have made astounding discoveries in the islands\u0027 lochs in recent years.Mr Murray has previously scoured Loch Arnish, Loch Langabhat and Loch Borgastail on Lewis and made a number of finds.It shows that people were building these islands long before the pyramids and Stonehenge. It really is startling what we are finding out.These man made islands were clearly very important to early Hebrideans. Some of the pottery is now even called Hebridean Ware. Some of the bowls were scallop shaped and even the rims were decorated.The archaeologists don\u0027t know why they were throwing these pots into the loch nearly 6000 years ago - was it a sacrifice to water gods? I just decided to e on them out of curiosity and I couldn\u0027t believe my eyes - on some lochs it was full of pottery. It was incredible - a real archaeological treasure trove.The search was first sparked in 2011, when Mr Murray recovered a set of remarkably preserved Neolithic treasures submerged around a crannog.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"expanded bubbles can reunite grandparents families","story":"Boris Johnson will announce an expansion of household “bubbles” on Tuesday that could mean millions more grandparents being reunited with their grandchildren.In a widespread easing of remaining lockdown measures, the Prime Minister will also put pubs, restaurants and hairdressers on notice to reopen on July 4 and cut the two metre rule to one metre. Staycations will also be opened up to millions of families.The move is designed to save tens of thousands of businesses from going under, and bring the country closer to normality than at any time since the lockdown started in March. It also has the potential to allow more schools to reopen before the summer.But Downing St said Mr Johnson “will not hesitate to put the handbrake on” if the virus starts spreading again, and that the new easements would be first in line to be reversed.Under current rules, any group of six people can meet in the open air, but the only people who can come closer than two metres are those living in the same household and one other nominated person who lives alone under a different roof.It has meant families having to make tough choices about which grandparent can hug their grandchildren or hold new-born babies.Mr Johnson is keen to find a way for more families to be reunited, and is studying different plans for expanding the current “support bubbles” policy that has allowed people living alone to link up with another household.One option is to allow two households to join together without any limit on numbers, though that would still mean couples having to choose between different sets of grandparents.Another option is to allow “bubbles” of a set number of people from more than two households, which would enable a family to have physical contact with both sets of grandparents. This option also has limits, as people with more than one set of grandchildren would still have to choose between them.A senior Government source said: “There will be an expansion of social bubbles but the details are still being finalised.”Another source said: “The question with bubbles has always been how you help families reunite to the maximum possible extent without too much risk.“The scientists’ main concern has always been infections spreading from one household to another, which is why this is one of the more difficult decisions we have to take.”Mr Johnson said on Sunday: “The disease is increasingly under control and I just want people to reflect on that important fact.“So, of course, as we make that progress it will be possible to open up more and you will be hearing more about what we want to do with not just non-essential retail but with the hospitality sector from July 4 and we’re sticking absolutely like glue to the road map to the plan that I set out on May 10.”Mr Johnson will on Monday be given the recommendations of a Government review into the two metre rule, which is expected to conclude that it should be cut to one metre as long as it can be mitigated with face coverings, perspex screens or other measures.On Tuesday he will discuss the issue with his Cabinet before making a statement to Parliament on the latest easing of lockdown.A Downing Street source said: “The reason we are able to move forward this week is because the vast majority of people have taken steps to contain the virus. The more we open up, the more important it is that everyone follows the social distancing rules. “We will not hesitate to put the handbrake on to stop the virus running out of control.” Do you welcome the prospect of an expanded \u0027bubble\u0027?

He was my best friend and he was definitely a pervert and more than capable of snatching a child, for sexual kicks or money.I was sure it was him the minute the police came to find me in Austria. They were very clear with me from the first minute. They said \u0027we are investigating Maddie McCann and Christian Brückner’ and I told them I knew it already. I was convinced it was him.”Speaking for the first time about his old friend, Tatschl described how he became involved with Brückner in Portugal in the early 2000s.The pair lived together, drank together and ultimately committed crimes together.I was staying at his house and camping in a van in the garden. We spent a lot of time together and had good fun.But he was definitely quite a strange character.“He was always quite criminal. He liked to brag about the crimes he had done and planned to do, and how he aimed to steal as much money as he could until he reached his dream of having €1 million. Then he would stop.It was rich pickings there in Praia da Luz. He was always breaking into apartments in the area and bragging about it to me,” Tatschl claimed.“He was a very good burglar and would easily climb up to first floor apartments when tourists were out.He would climb up to the first floor and steal everything, lots of money, valuables and so many passports. In fact hundreds of passports and lots of watches. Rolexes and other expensive watches.He had a hiding place in the house in the rafters in the roof. He had all the money and passports hidden up there, Tatschl claimed.The property in question is a farmhouse just outside Praia da Luz which Brückner rented from a British man. Neighbours said he used to race down the dusty gravel track in his Jaguar and have heated shouting matches with a string of girlfriends. Tatschl said Brückner was in a relationship with a German woman 20 years his senior at the time.It is also where a camcorder was discovered that allegedly had footage of Brückner raping a 72-year-old tourist at a luxury villa in 2005. The video was destroyed, but the testimony of the two men who saw it helped convict Bruckner of the crime last year.“That’s how I found out he was a sick b******.“It was of this elderly lady who was chained to a wooden post and she was being beaten and raped.“But I admit I got sucked into some of his schemes,” said Tatschl.Taking fuel seemed pretty harmless and we did it for a few months.The cops caught us red handed, caught us stealing diesel and we got eight-and-a-half months in prison on remand waiting for a trial in Portimao.It\u0027s just a small prison, so we got to spend a lot of time together.”In 2006, while the pair were in jail, the farmhouse was robbed, and the money, valuables and camcorder was taken.The father-of-one says he “cannot believe” that Portuguese detectives have not yet searched the former home they shared.When the pair were released from prison, Brückner moved into the distinctive white and yellow VW Westfalia campervan, while Tatschl said he left Portugal for Orgiva, Spain.He had lost the house but he was still enjoying living in the area. I think that confused the police a little as they were not sure where he was living exactly when Maddie vanished,” said Tatschl.The next time I saw him was in late May or early June 2007 and he arrived in Spain with his big American campervan, the Winnebago, the one with the swimsuits.He parked it up in Orgiva and came looking for me. It was the only reason he had come to Orgiva to find me. He knew that I was living there and he knew I had connections to the marijuana world and could help him make money.We all wondered where he’d got the money from.I remember specifically having a conversation with an English guy who lived there and we both said how on earth could have had that vehicle? “We assumed a big drug deal or something like that. Now I suspect it was Maddie.He was only there that time for a couple of days and went on back to Germany selling marijuana.”Brückner has a string of convictions, ranging from molesting a six-year-old girl in a playground when he was just a teenager, to raping a 72-year-old American woman in a horrific attack in Praia da Luz more than a decade later.Now, he has been identified as the prime suspect in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann. German authorities say they have evidence that she is dead, and that Brückner “did the deed” but they do not have enough evidence to charge him.He was definitely a pervert and all his friends thought that about him. He had some sexual issues but we didn’t think that he liked young children,” Tatschl said.Christian was always on the dark web. He would talk about it and he always had internet in the houses he rented.I don’t know exactly what he did but I suspect it involved drugs and pornography.He was always bragging about money and making money. He even talked about selling kids maybe to Morocco.I didn\u0027t really think about it at the time. Just brushed it off as joking.”Things changed when he watched an eight-part series on the McCann case in March last year.When I saw the Netflix documentary I knew immediately that he was guilty.The part where the female tourist talked about the man turning up at her door while her child played by the front door, the creepy guy with acne and blonde hair. I just knew it was Christian for sure.”Days later, police arrived at Tatschl’s front door.“I had two Austrian police and two German Police turn up at my house. I was then taken to the police station where I told them my story over 14 hours.It was the first week of April last year and they had me in the police station from 10am to 6pm on the first day and then from 10 am until 4pm the next day.They were very clear with me from the first minute. They said \u0027we are investigating Maddie McCann and Christian Brückner’ and I told them I knew it already. I was convinced it was him. I told them ‘I know what you want. I hope I can help.’”I really hope they can finally close this case for the family and find Christian guilty for what he has done. He needs to admit it to the police and close it for good.”Last week, lawyers defending Brückner said their client “denies any involvement” in the McCann case.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus positive good news round up glastonbury garden","story":"As we enter what should have been the week of Glastonbury, one family in Worcestershire have come up with an ingenuous solution to the no-festival blues.Fiona Rees, 50, her husband Matt, 43, and their son Dylan, 11, are all huge fans of the world-famous festival, which would have welcomed more than 200,000 music lovers to Worthy Farm over the coming days.While they were understandably upset when it was cancelled, they have enlisted the help of Colin Stent - Fiona\u0027s 67-year-old father - to build their own festival, complete with the Pyramid Stage, a bar, and a camping area.

Over the whole of Germany in the past seven days there were 3,280 new cases of Covid-19. That works out as 3.9 per 100,000 people. What does that look like? Think a mid-sized town like Bath, Worcester or Rochdale and imagine that four people caught the virus last week. Oh, and only one of them showed any symptoms. That is the extent of Covid-19 in Germany at present.The apparent acceleration in Germany\u0027s R number shows the foolishness of focusing so much on a single figure. The R number might have some meaning in the right circumstances, but publishing a single R for Germany doesn’t mean a lot at present. The rise in the number is entirely due to an outbreak in an abattoir in the town of Gutersloh in the region of North Rhine Westphalia, where 650 workers were found to have the virus. That is a closed environment kept at a chilled temperature which seems to have been an ideal place to promote the spread of the virus. It tells us nothing about Covid-19 in the rest of Germany where, according to the Robert Koch Institute, the epidemic continues to decline.  The R number is, in any case, only a crude estimate. It is the average number of people onto whom each infected inidual is estimated to have passed the virus. Except no-one really knows how anybody catches the virus.  Did the abattoir workers catch it by being coughed over by their colleagues in the work canteen? Did they catch it via some sort of cleaning process, involving a fine spray of water droplets, or from contact with a cold surface on which the virus was present?  If investigators have any insight into this they haven’t revealed it so far. All we do know is that abattoirs around the world have had a problem with Covid 19 – and that the conditions within them have little resemblance to the outside world. The models used to calculate the R number, however, are just looking at the raw mathematics of it. Paradoxically, the abattoir outbreak would have had a lower impact on Germany’s R number had the nationwide incidence of the disease been much higher. It has come out at a shocking 2.88 because there are few cases elsewhere in the country to dilute the infections at the plant.When the history of Covid-19 comes to be written, one issue which will need addressing is how mass fear was spread by the constant feeding of statistics by government and their agencies – figures which many people struggled to put into perspective. Here’s just a little more perspective. Germany so far has recorded 8,882 deaths from Covid 19.  That is less than 1 per cent of the approximately one million people who die in Germany every year.    More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/06/22/09/wwdc.jpg","title":"apple event 2020 live latest wwdc iphone update","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Apple is about to hold its WWDC event, revealing updates for every one of its platforms.As well as new versions of the operating systems for its iPhone, iPad, Macs, Apple Watch and TVs, the company could reveal major new changes including the introduction of entirely new chips for its Macs.It is the 31st time that Apple has held the event. But it is the first ever time that it has been entirely virtual, conducted only through the internet – and Apple is yet to reveal how the normally boisterous and well-attended keynote will be adapted to the new format.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhat time does WWDC start where you are?How to watch alongApple has released the schedule for WWDC, which runs from today until 26 June. The full list of events and sessions can be found here.Not much detail is given about today\u0027s keynote. The description simply states: Discover exciting new innovations and updates coming to all Apple platforms later this year.Whatever format the virtual event comes in, one thing for sure is that it will be entirely online. When Apple announced this in March, it also pledged to donate money to local businesses that would lose out as a result.The tech giant said it will commit $1 million to local San Jose organisations to offset associated revenue loss as a result of WWDC 2020’s new online format.The virtual format means Apple can get away with pre-recording the event if it so wishes. This may take away some of the\u0026nbspexcitement that comes with a live event, but it would minimise\u0026nbspthe risk of demonstrations going awry –\u0026nbspsomething Apple is no stranger to, as this 11-minute\u0026nbspblooper compilation demonstrates.https:www.youtube-nocookieembed-zw8L_84Apple has applied for the Rosetta trademark in Japan, Macrumors notes. That\u0027s interesting because Rosetta was the software that Apple used to allow users and developers move from PowerPC to Intel processors – which was the last time Apple did anything like the rumoured ARM transition that could be announced today.There are a whole lot of last-minute rumours coming out today – none of them especially definitive or significant.They include a poster on Weibo claiming that the new version of MacOS will be called Big Sur, undergo a big UI redesign, and a new version of Safari. The same post claims that there\u0027ll be smaller changes in iOS 14, which will include widgets on the home screen and – finally – a phone call notification that doesn\u0027t take over the whole screen.A number of late rumours have also suggested there\u0027ll be no hardware revealed. But it\u0027s not clear whether that means there will be none released, or none mentioned – it could still be that Apple announces that it has ARM Macs on their way, but that they\u0027re not actually released or launch during this event. (Rumours from reliable leaker Ming-Chi Kuo suggested new computers would come later this year.)But generally there have been few last-minute leaks coming out of Apple today. Is that because the crackdown on leaks has worked? Is it because Apple isn\u0027t holding a physical event, so there\u0027s less chance of anyone getting a glimpse of any products? Or is it simply because there\u0027s not all that much to reveal? We\u0027ll find out later, maybe.Welcome to\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0027s live coverage of WWDC 2020.

It is also now at the top of other rankings that test how quickly it would perform in real-world applications, how well it can conduct certain artificial intelligence tasks, and how well it can perform with data-intensive processes.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesNo supercomputer has ever scored at the top of the three rankings – known as Top500, HPCG, and Graph500 – before, the creators said.In the Top500 ranking, it achieved a score of 415.53 petaflops. That is compared with the 148.6 petaflop score achieved by its nearest competitor, Summit, which is based in the US and is based on IBM hardware.At the moment, Fugaku is doing experimental work on Covid-19, including simulating how the virus spreads. Many supercomputers around the world are being put to work on the coronavirus outbreak, allowing researchers to better understand the new virus and how to fight the pandemic.Aside from that work, Japan hopes to use the computer for its Society 5.0 technology programme. That could see it used for everything from simulating nuclear blasts to modelling climate change.I very much hope that Fugaku will show itself to be highly effective in real-world applications and will help to realize Society 5.0, said Naoki Shinjo, corporate executive officer of Fujitsu, in a statement.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

Users post “Parleys” that can be commented on, “echoed” (like retweets) and voted on.It is available on the web, as well as on the App Store for Apple users and the Google Play Store for Android users.In May 2019, founder John Matze said the site had approximately 100,000 users in total. In June, 200,000 Saudi Arabian users joined the site to protest claimed censorship from Twitter.Twitter had approximately 326 million users at the time.How is Parler different from Twitter?The most prominent difference between the social media sites, apart from their size, is their attitudes towards content on their platforms.Parler is more tolerant of speech that other platforms would deem offensive.In its guidelines, it references the FCC’s definition of obscene content which asks if the work is sexual in nature, if it “ is offensive,” and “Whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.”Parler advises users not to “use languagevisuals which is sexual in nature” and not to “use languagevisuals that are offensive and offer no literary, artistic, political, or scientific value”It has also made exceptions for content from prominent users, such as Mr Trump, that would otherwise breach its terms and conditions and be taken down were it tweeted by another user.Who is on Parler?Katie Hopkins recently joined the platform after being removed from Twitter.“Keeping Twitter safe is a top priority for us – abuse and hateful conduct have no place on our service and we will continue to take action when our rules are broken” it said in a statement.Other prominent users include Donald Trump’s son Eric Trump, far-right activist Laura Loomer who chained herself to Twitter’s headquarters, Mr Trump’s campaign manager Brad Parscale, and far-right activist Candace Owens who infamously said that “If Hitler just wanted to make Germany great and have things run well, OK, fine.”Since then, some Conservative MPs have joined Parler. These include the MP for Mansfield Ben Bradley, MP for Guildford Angela Richardson, and MP for Wycombe Steve Baker.Accounts have been made for other MPs including MP for Crawley Harry Smith and Daily Mail columnist and wife of Michael Gove Sarah Vine, although it is currently unclear if these are legitimate.What do people post on Parler?Jewish News website Forward has said that the app is “full of fury, fear and conspiracy theories” with notable antisemitism and Islamophobia.“The belief that Jews are running the world, encouraging immigrants to flood America’s borders, controlling the media and generally working behind the scenes as master puppeteers are easy to find on Parler” it continues.Antisemitic conspiracy theories about Mark Zuckerberg and George Soros are also commonplace.Many users are also vocal supporters of Mr Trump, and have developed far-right communities on the platform.Upon signing up to the website, Parler recommended trends that were popular “right now” included #trumptweetsmatter, #kukluxklan, #georgesoros and #covidiots.There were also a number of tweets related to Christianity, with hashtags including #2NDCOMING and #godisloveUnder the #kukluxklan were six posts. Two of which were about the recently deceased Senator Robert Byrd, a member of the Klan who came to embrace civil rights and desegregation in the 1970s.Another was a tweet quoting American news commentator Van Jones from 29 May.Two more were from October 2019, related to Clifford the Big Red Dog memes that reference the Ku Klux Klan.The final two were about “antiwhiteracism” and the Klan’s founding, respectively.It is unclear why Parler’s algorithm surfaced this recommendation to a new account. The Independent has reached out to the app for comment.In May 2019, CBS News reported that Parler would not suspend accounts, no matter what was posted.Are there other apps like Parler?Inside the social network used by alleged Pittsburgh synagogue shooterOther social networks with “free speech” ideologies include Gab, another platform where far right-wing iniduals take advantage of its leniency to spread hateful messages.Before killing 11 Jewish people at the Tree of Life synagogue, Robert Bowers allegedly posted on Gab: “I can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I’m going in.”Bowers had also used the account to post numerous racist and antisemitic memes.Parler and Gab also exist as part of an assortment of apps designed to provide solutions to those who have been deplatformed, such as Bitchute, an alternative to YouTube.

Such a shame,” another added.Other people who found the brightness levels to be acceptable were just generally flummoxed by the plot.“Obviously it was very stylish but does anyone know what the hell was going on?” one person wrote.Another viewer stated: “I feel like I fell asleep and missed about 10 episodes of The Luminaries.”The series, which stars Himesh Patel, Eva Green and Bono‘s daughter Eve Hewson, continues tonight (22 June) at 9pm on BBC1.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Two of the stores – in Ross-on-Wye and Leominster – reopened on Monday 15 June.“Being able to shop in person, especially at smaller independents, is a joy,” owner Andy Rossiter, pictured above, says. “I think lockdown made a lot of people realise that they don’t want all their shopping to just land at their door, but booksellers also know they need to work hard for their audience. It’s not simply a case of just opening your doors.”Rossiter has been busy preparing the stores, moving fixtures and checkouts so that staff and customers can socially distance while browsing for books.Carry out a risk assessment: employers will need to carry out Covid-19 risk assessments in consultation with their workers or trade unions.Maintain social distancing: employers should redesign workspaces to maintain social distancing between people and stagger start times.Manage transmission risk:\u0026nbspemployers should look into putting barriers in shared spaces, creating workplace shift patterns or fixed teams.Reinforcing cleaning processes: workplaces should be cleaned more frequently, paying close attention to\u0026nbspdoor handles and keyboards.“We have installed Perspex screens at till points, bought hand sanitiser stations for the entrances to our stores and placed tape and signage throughout so we can clearly indicate the social distancing rules within our stores,” he says.The bookshops have reopened with less members of staff and they have limited their opening hours from their pre-lockdown seven days to just five. Rossiter has also been consulting staff and getting their input on the UK Government’s coronavirus advice.“Our trade body, the Booksellers Association, has been brilliant at reading and interpreting this advice to make it bookshop-specific and releasing it in digestible and accessible weekly bulletins, he says.“Booksellers love serving customers, and we’ve been serving our local community for a decade, so seeing those regulars again and having that relationship start to return to normal will be fantastic.Surinder Josan, owner of All Seasons DIY, a family-run shop, explains how he has used strict safe workplace measures to keep his shop doors open and his businesses afloat.“All Seasons DIY is a family-run shop which was established over 40 years ago, run by myself, my wife, and my mother. My son and daughter work in the shop around their university studies as well,” Josan, below, says.The family decided to shut the shop when school closures were announced. But after just a week they decided to reopen the business in order to serve the local community, who relied on the store for essential food and other items.“In order to reopen, we had to reassess how we both serve and interact with our customers,” Josan explains. “We adopted several new measures to comply with social distancing to keep both ourselves and our customers safe.”These new measures they adopted included safe distance markers outside the shop, to limit the number of people in store at any one time, installing screens at the checkout areas, encouraging contactless payments, lowering the minimum card spend to £1, and offering hand wipes to customers.“The number of customers who have come in and complimented us for it is unbelievable. They say when they come here they feel really safe,” Josan adds.Blend Coffee Co is an independent coffee shop based in Portslade, East Sussex, near Brighton. The two directors behind the business, Oli Crawley and Tom Jennion, have introduced a range of measures so they could confidently reopen for staff and customers.“Our primary concern is to keep people safe, so to make sure our coffee shop was ready to be reopened we implemented a number of safer working measures,” says Crawley.These new measures included a deep clean of the shop prior to reopening, implementation of a new ordering layout and adopting a new policy which stipulates that no customers are allowed inside the store.Working alongside Crawley and Jennion are a further three members of staff.“Only the directors returned to work to alleviate any pressure on our barista team feeling they need to work,” says Crawley. “This also allows an operational analysis of all our new protocols to ensure they are efficient and safe.”The checkout system has now been moved to the front of the shop, Blend now only accepts card payments and there is a new waiting area outside the shop.This plan was developed after we undertook a risk assessment and analysis of the premises to ensure that customer-staff interaction could be maintained and sustained in a safe manner. We ran a test prior to reopening to ensure that our new measures would work and allow us and our customers to stay safe,” adds Crawley.For further information from the UK Government on how employers, employees and the self-employed can return to work safely, click hereThis is Government advice for EnglandWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms.Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort. Visit pickforbritain.org.uk to find out moreEat seasonal and local vegBut that’s not the only way to support the industry right now. Simply eating more in-season local produce will help to prevent wastage.A wide range of vegetables are currently being harvested in the UK. These include asparagus, cucumbers, mushrooms, courgettes, spinach, summer squash, radishes, beetroot and tomatoes – and buying and cooking with this seasonal veg is a great way to contribute to the farming industry.​In need of some recipe inspo?

You can get involved too: share your recipes using #SeasonalVeg on social mediaTry different types of fishSimilarly, the UK\u0027s fishing industry has suffered during the current coronavirus pandemic.While higher-end produce is currently not being purchased by restaurants, much of the catch from UK waters that would usually be exported hasn’t been, so boats across the country have struggled to sell their fish and seafood. That’s why there\u0027s never been a better time to try something new.Among the wide range of different species found in UK waters are mussels, crab, mackerel, herring, rainbow trout, hake and coley (or saithe).

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them.

And today, because of the enormous generosity of Virustatic Shield, whose innovative anti-viral snoods we’ve also been producing, 10,000 of London’s most vulnerable people will receive a vital face covering, delivered to them via The Independent’s fantastic campaign.Which star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day It is now mandatory to wear face coverings on public transport, but these coverings are in short supply.That’s why we started The Big Community Sew to encourage people to make face coverings for their friends and neighbours, and by doing so preserve vital supplies of PPE for NHS workers and care home staff who are fighting this virus on the frontline.The science behind face coverings is simple: they help prevent the wearer from unwittingly spreading the disease.

Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It has four core beliefs: family, integrity, teamwork and success – all integral pillars of its Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme.Put together by Sharon Gray OBE and the federation’s head teachers, it’s designed to welcome pupils back to class after lockdown. “Everybody in the Embark community has done their bit,” says Gray, a headteacher for 20 years, mostly in special schools supporting youngsters experiencing social, emotional and mental health difficulties and schools going through challenges.“It’s been all hands on deck,” executive headteacher and Trust leader of Embark’s schools Matthew Crawford adds. “Even two weeks into lockdown we were thinking about our children returning to school, whatever date that may be.”Safety at school1. Anyone who is unwell or been in contact with somebody showing coronavirus symptoms should stay away from schools, colleges and childcare settings2. Hands should be cleaned more often than usual with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds and dried thoroughly. Alternatively, hand sanitiser or alcohol hand rub can be used3. Promote the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach to coughing and sneezing4. Clean frequently touched surfaces regularly using standard products, such as detergent and bleach5. Help to minimise contact and mixing by altering classroom layout and timetablesWith regards to physical changes that parents and pupils can expect to see in corridors and classrooms, Embark is working with Government guidance and undertaking a thorough, bespoke risk assessment for each of its schools. “It can’t be a one-size-fits all approach,” Crawford stresses.According to Anna Upton – head of the 240-pupil Chaucer Junior School in Ilkeston, Derbyshire – questionnaires were sent out to reconnect with parents, through which they could express concerns and suggest ideas about the return to classrooms.According to Upton, staggered breaks and how drop-offs will work were important issues that were flagged in questionnaires. “But the risk assessment the Trust has put in has allowed us to make a comprehensive plan and we can communicate that to the parents,” she explains.“What the Trust have done with the programme is to implement nine stages which support our schools to open as safely as possible, supporting the staff parents and the children. The risk assessment means that I, as a headteacher, can do what’s right for my school.”Chair of trustees Sarah Armitage emphasises the importance of teamwork based around a guiding principle: families first. We look after families, so we reach out we talk.” she says.“Then there’s teamwork. Let’s harness the power of the team so it’s not the headteacher sitting by themselves with all these things to think about – that load is shared.”Armitage’s back-to-school outlook is optimistic too: “We have created something with this programme that we hope will be massively beneficial. Our role as leaders is to keep that going, carry on putting emotional needs at the heart of everything we do, because then children are able to learn and benefit – and move through this crisis.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe GNA, backed militarily by Turkey, called Mr Sisi’s threat a “declaration of war,” and refused to halt its offensive. “We reject this, condemn it and consider it an act of aggression, a blatant intervention, which amounts to a declaration of war,” the GNA said in a letter Sunday.The Arab League is scheduled to discuss the confrontation in Libya during an emergency session on Tuesday, but Tripoli is boycotting.

Turkey and its allies appear confident of a win and in no mood for a deal. , and Mr Haftar and his supporters abroad, humiliated in weeks of battlefield advances, are reluctant to give any concessions from a position of weakness. “The Turks had a point,” said one western diplomat involved in Libya affairs. “They had to establish deterrence. Now they are acknowledging that they want to take control of the whole territory. They are saying Haftar has to go.”Libya’s civil war has been deadly, disruptive and gruesome. Hundreds of thousands have been displaced and hundreds killed. Last week came the discovery of mass graves filled with scores of bodies in the city of Tarhouna, where a militia loyal to Mr Haftar was pushed out last month by GNA forces.“Civilians in Libya continue to suffer disproportionately,” Stephanie Williams, the acting UN envoy to Libya, said last week in a presentation. “One million people are now in need of some form of humanitarian assistance.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailSirte, a city of some 50,000 people, is significant as the last major urban cluster before a set of crucial Libyan oil facilities and depots located on Libya’s eastern Meditarranean shore and controlled for now by forces loyal to Mr Haftar. It is home to a local population filled with supporters of Gaddafi who are allied with Mr Haftar and remain intensely hostile to the Islamist-tinged government in Tripoli.  It was controlled by militias loyal to the GNA until earlier this year, and both Ankara and the Tripoli government have said they would halt their offensive and be open to peace talks once it and Jufrah are under their control.Egypt boasts significant air and ground forces which could boost Mr Haftar in the battlefield and challenge any forces Turkey and the GNA could muster. But Marsa Matrouh, the last city at the Egyptian border where its troops are garrisoned, is some 15 hours away from Sirte. Meanwhile, Turks and allied GNA militias have a strong presence in Misurata, which lies less than three hours from Sirte, and Ankara has been flooding western Libya with military material and personnel for months. “Egypt\u0027s political will to enter a physical contest with the Turkish-backed GNA coalition is not big,” said Jalel Harchaoui, a north Africa specialist at the Clingendael Institute in the Netherlands.  “Turkey and the GNA forces are ready to move forcefully into both Sirte and Jufrah any day now.”Mr Sisi has appeared disappointed in Mr Haftar’s failures but is also under pressure from financial backers in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, who are hostile to the GNA’s inclusion of populist Islamist factions and see Turkey as a strategic threat. Egypt also views events in Libya with grave concern, worried troubles could spill over into its borders.“I believe the assertive language is serious and could lead to some form of action or military deployment even if largely symbolic,” said one Egyptian military analyst. “It appears Egypt\u0027s intent is to force ceasefire negotiations by acting as counterbalance to Turkish and GNA strength on the ground.”The conflict in Libya has drawn in various international powers and their local backers. On the one side is Mr Haftar, the eastern commander and former CIA asset who is supported by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Russia and France. On the other side is the GNA in Tripoli, which in addition to Ankara has begun to receive the implicit blessing of Italy, Germany and the UK.Backed by UAE air power and Russian and Sudanese mercenaries, Mr Haftar launched an ill-fated offensive to take control of Tripoli last year. All of his gains were wiped out in a few extraordinary weeks after Turkey forcefully intervened, dispatching drones, anti-aircraft machinery, military personnel, and Syrian mercenaries to back the GNA forces. After initially supporting Mr Haftar, the White House under President Donald Trump appears to have settled into indifference. On Monday, GNA Prime Minister Fayez Serraj and high-profile interior minister Fathi Bashagha reportedly received a delegation of US military commanders from Africom, the US military force in Africa, amid concern about the deployment of Russian fighter jets in Jufrah. “I  don’t think the Trump administration is willing to be associated with someone who’s losing and also a war criminal,” Mohammed Ali Abdallah, a GNA envoy to the US, said in an interview.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

There have been more than 170 new cases of Covid-19 since last week, marking the biggest increase since the virus\u0027s spread was close to being eliminated in April.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

That is something her devoted husband, Scott Mitchell, has been dreading.The couple married in  with some cynics snfily declaring it would never last, mainly because of the -year age gap, but Scott proved them all completely wrong.He adores his we and has put his le on hold, and his physical and mental health at risk, to take care of his Barbara.Scott has also helped to raise funds and awareness for dementia charities, even taking part in the London Marathon with a group of Barbara’s friends from EastEnders.It has been deeply sad to see how this disease has ravaged one of the most delightful women in showbiz.I always adored interviewing Barbara. She was sunny, funny, full of fascinating stories and always interested in everyone and everything.She would have a laugh with the crew, a cheery chat with our production team and was exactly the same whether the cameras were rolling or not.I know a lot of famous actors and entertainers who are grumpy gits until the red light goes on. Barbara was never like that. She is a consummate professional, but also a delightfully warm human being.I remember seeing her at an event in London, where she was swamped by photographers and members of the public. She’s so tiny I couldn’t actually see her in that large sea of people, but what I did observe was how everyone came away with an autograph or a selfie.Barbara is old school. She always said she owes her fame to the public and that they deserved a smile, a cheery wave and a quick photograph.That’s why she is so adored and why we are so very upset she is having to go through this anguish. Scott says her speech is growing worse and she now struggles to find the words to express herself.She ends up sitting shaking her head in sadness and frustration. Barbara is also getting up two or three times a night, becoming unsteady on her feet and falling over. Scott is worried sick that she will suffer a really serious injury.Sometimes Barbara looks at old photos of herself and asks, “Who is she ” and increasingly she doesn’t recognise Scott, which cuts him to his very heart and soul.This disease is so brutal, because it chips away at the sufferer, steals their memories and erodes what makes them unique. You gradually lose the person you love and have to mourn them while they are still alive. That’s why the work both Scott and Barbara have been doing is so vital.When she bravely told us she was ill two years ago, the Alzheimer’s Society saw visits to its website double and one-off donations to the charity rose by  per cent.She made a plea to the PM to help carers and sufferers, and to increase funding, and Barbara was one of the few people that made Boris Johnson stop waffling and actually listen.Dementia is a second epidemic within this pandemic, which is why we need more documentaries like the ones from Ross.There are , sufferers that we know about in the UK, and with us all living longer that number will carry on increasing.Relatives caring for those blighted by the disease can often feel alone and helpless. GPs and the NHS do their best, but it can be a lottery as to what expert care is available.As we have seen during this crisis, care home workers are an extraordinary group of people who treat their frail and elderly patients like a second family, but no one really wants to put a beloved parent or partner into a nursing home.There comes a time, however, when there is no other choice. Scott is now facing that prospect and it is tearing him apart. I also spoke this week to the musician Naughty Boy, whose mum Zahida suffers from dementia.He is a devoted son and lives with his mum to take care of her. Naughty Boy is backing Dementia UK’s Lives On Hold campaign, which focuses on carers and how draining it is for them, especially since lockdown. He wants to stress that there is help out there. I was touched at how he makes sure there is at least one thing every day for his mum to look forward to, to give her joy.He tries to see some light in the darkness and it’s also something Scott has always tried to do. He has to be Barbara’s memory and keep a hold of the love they have for one another.Eventhey have to be parted so she can go into a home, nothing can take that love away from him or anyone  going through the same sad experience.IF you are going to quote Game Of Thrones, then for the love of God at least get it right.Tone deaf Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab dismissed those who support the Black Lives Matter campaign by taking a knee, as seeming to “get the idea from Game Of Thrones”.This was not only hugely insulting, but Raab didn’t even bother to get the phraseology right. In Game Of Thrones, the characters are willing to die before they would BEND the knee in front of despots and royalty.In the real world it’s about expressing solidarity against racial inequality.Raab believes the heartfelt gesture is a “symbol of subjugation and subordination” and he would only do so for the Queen and his we. Those who take the knee, including footballers at theof the Premier League this week, and many protesters here and in the US, were astounded by his crass remarks.Following such wide­spread incredulity and anger, Raab has been furiously back-tracking. I do hope his Twitter clarication is genuine and not just another Government damage-limitation tactic.If this really was an episode of Game Of Thrones, he would have had his a*** handed to him by my favourite character, Sandor Clegane, known as The Hound.After that encounter, I guarantee he would never again be able to bend any part of his anatomy.HOLLYOAKS actor Adam Rickitt is an astonishingly candid and brave man. He not only spoke about his mental health at a time when it was considered career-destroying, but has talked frankly this week about being infertile.Adam suffers from an auto-immune disease that has made it impossible for him to ever father children. The -year-old has ankylosing spondylitis, which has had a devastating effect on his sperm count.While other men might have felt embarrassed about it, Adam has been refreshingly honest. He revealed the doctor told him most men have three million sperm, but he only had two. Not two million but TWO.He and his we Katy Fawcett, a top correspondent with Good Morning Britain, are very happy with their three dogs. Adam has been equally upfront about his mental health and suicidal thoughts. Since meeting Katy in  his le has turned around and, alongside acting jobs, he’s running a craft beer bar and shop. The couple call it their “baby”.They adore each other and are lucky to feel complete without kids.GWYNETH PALTROW’S latest attention- seeking wheeze is to bring out a candle that “smells of her orgasm”. This is a follow-up to last year’s model that bore the catchy title, “This candle smells of my vagina”.Not sure about you, but I have no wish to have my living room reeking of Gywn or anything to do with her sex le.I also cannot begin to imagine the sheer buttock-clenching embarrassment suffered by her two teenage kids.I think what her candles really smell of are pure unadulterated bulls**t.THE Oscars and Baftas have been delayed for a few months due to Covid-, so this could be a good time for the film industry to have a rethink about the whole business of award shows.Instead of a seemingly never-ending run of ceremonies, perhaps there should be a cull. In the US they could keep the Oscars for films, the Emmys for TV and the Tonys for theatre, and here the Baftas, NTAs and Oliviers.Then each event would be special, rather than a seemingly endless parade of bored-looking stars like Renee Zellweger, above, done up to the nines and wishing they were at home.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No matter that I am not, nor have ever been, a member of the Conservative Party.I would never be forgiven by some people, who just couldn’t understand why an ethnic minority person would have sympathy for Conservative policies. At best we’ve been hoodwinked at worst we must just be plain evil.It often feels like we are not allowed to think for ourselves, outside of the orthodoxies set down by left-wing political groupthink.In the days of fighting to set up my school, and in our first few years of establishing ourselves, I received racist emails and threats of violence — from the Left.There were protests outside my school and abuse was shouted in my face from militant union members opposed to free schools.My detractors tried hard to discredit me in ways that made sense to them.There was even a running Wikipedia battle over my heritage, lasting for years.It was regularly edited to state that I was of Indian descent, while some people claimed my ancestry to be Indian Ugandan, and thereforethat I must hate black people.It was absurd, and I didn’t know from one day to the next what race my Wikipedia page would say I was.While it seems a bizarre thing to fight over, some opponents clearly believed that my criticisms of the education system and my support for free schools could be discountedI wasn’t black.My experience ten years ago is why today I have the greatest sympathy for Conservative MPs such as Priti Patel and Kemi Badenoch. Heaven knows what actual Tory MPs from ethnic minorities must have to endure.Mirza has been working with the Conservative Party for many years and her simple appointment to this role has enraged her detractors. For them, a “good” ethnic minority is one who always toes the leftist line.So play around with my Wikipedia page, make me Indian with a couple of keyboard strokes, and suddenly not only have they wiped my mother out of existence, but my words don’t really matter any more. This accusation of “not being black enough” raised its ugly head when Priti Patel was accused of distracting from the racism facing black people by highlighting her own experiences — assomehow her struggles were worth less because she is of Indian heritage .That being called a “P**i” as a young girl wouldn’t have had the same crushing, hurtful impact as any other racial slur. Similarly, Munira Mirza has been accused of not being able to understand the experiences of black people because she is of Pakistani origin.The recent protests inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement should have provoked serious conversations about the meaning and impact of race we all need to explore the nature of racism and what to do about it.But it is clear to me, from the black boxes on Instagram to the meaningless supportive BLM statements on corporate websites, that few people are interested in examining race in our own society.Most people want an easy fix, a stamp of approval that will allow them to be branded a non-racist so that they can go back to their normal lives, satisfied that they are a good person .This is not even remotely helpful to anyone, it’s simple box ticking but the desire to signal “anti-racism” instead of just not being a racist is so prevalent that at times I wonder whether human beings have the capacity to distinguish between the two: The signal and the reality.This tick-box race culture goes hand in hand with the oppression Olympics. Hierarchies of race are the easy bingo card that allows ethnic people to be ticked off on a sheet.Chinese  Sorry, only two oppression points for you. Black  Wow, that’s ten points! You go straight to the top!This is why,you are merely interested in appearing to be non-racist, rather than actually being a non-racist, you will buy into the idea of this totem pole of oppression.You will ignore that race and class are so much more complex than this.My father was of Indian heritage, but he came from a much poorer environment than my black mother and grew up without any shoes.Le is more complicated than the tick-box culture allows, butyour only interest in race is to do enough to signal to everyone that you aren’t a racist, then you will promote that hierarchy enthusiastically, because it is the perfect prop for your non-racist dissimulation. It doesn’t require any thought or effort.The reality of being anti-racist requires years of reading and discussion, befriending a iety of black people, including ones who think dferently from you politicallyand really coming to terms with one’s own uncomfortable feelings around race. Signalling requires a black box on Instagram and instantly everyone approves of you. You can see why most people choose the simpler option.In fact, spending a letime helping black boys realise their potential, something Black Lives Matter should approve of, instead of earning me adoration as a black box on Instagram does, has given me many enemies.My -plus years of improving young people’s lives is meaningless next to the superficial letters of support for BLM, because making a useful dference to people’s lives is less important than being seen to do so. It is a wonder why anyone ever does anything truly good at all.But there is one way of being anti-racist in a very simple and real way that takes no time at all.Allow Priti Patel, Kemi Badenoch and Munira Mirza the right that so many white people enjoy and take for granted: The right to think for themselves.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mums.And when you are responsible for home-educating your children as well as working out how to feed them three meals a day while holding down your job and everything  you used to do before children went to school at home, there is a strong incentive to get those schools open. And quick.Perhaps less so when someone  is taking care of all that stuff for you.Getting our classrooms back up and running may well take a bit of lateral thought, because of course it has to be safe to do so. But on the basis we can now pop to Zara or Ikea, surely we can open our schools safely Few disagree that lockdown should have included schools, but they need to open as soon as it is safe to do so.Yes, these things all need proper managing and organising. So why don’t schools ask local business leaders to help them with the logistics and arrangements To socially distance safely, we may need to cut class sizes in half and have twice as many classrooms, so why not look to use dferent spaces, for example empty community halls, empty libraries, empty offices etc.What about outdoor learning in small groups If we cut classrooms by half we will need twice as many teachers.So how about encouraging unemployed graduates to work as teaching assistants Or asking retired teachers to come out of retirement, just as many nurses did at the beginning of the pandemic.You know you can find the solution when it’s your problem to solve. Which is why any government and any Cabinet should be as representational of “real le” as possible, which is why we need more women advising the Prime Minister.That said, no doubt many women just don’t fancy a le in politics. When you look at the abuse, death treats, and sexism they face, who can blame them.But unless there are people from all walks of le — including women — in the Cabinet, then the issues that affect real people will not be properly tackled or solved.Just look at the incredible effect that some of the world’s female leaders have had when they’ve acted swtly and decisively in the face of Covid-.Germany’s Angela Merkel has kept deaths in her country down to just  per million — compared to  per million in the UK.New Zealand’s inspiring Jacinda Ardern has overseen a remarkable response to the pandemic which involved a rapid, draconian lockdown.Only  people died there. She has been widely praised for her strength in leadership.These daily UK Government press briefings have made it all too clear that we are crying out for more women at the helm.The steady stream of menfielding questions on the topics of the day has been alarming. Priti Patel’s appearances could be counted on one hand.It does make you wonder whether we’d be in a healthier positionmore women had been given more prominence in Boris’s Cabinet.I think we would be.Until recently, many people knew Maya Jama as the girlfriend of rapper Stormzy, but they broke up as a couple last year.What people are now gradually realising is that she has had a fantastic career in her own right – and she proved it last week when she stole the show while co-presenting Peter Crouch: Save Our Summer on BBC.And it wasn’t because her low-cut top, inset, raised a few eyebrows, though certainly not mine.As she rightly pointed out, she can dress how she pleases.She stole the show because she is good at what she does and is engaging.At the age of  she has already done a stint on MTV, DJing on Rinse FM, a job on Radio , and now she is presenting Saturday night TV.Andit weren’t for Covid- she would be acting in her first film around about now too.Plus, as a sideline she is launching a skincare range and has a mysterious big project brewing – rumoured by some to be Strictly Come Dancing.In fact, she said in an interview this week that lockdown is the first time since she was  that she has had such an extended rest .All of this would be impressive for any -year-old but way more so when you know that Maya’s father was in and out of prison for much of her childhood. And not only that – in  when she was , her then boyfriend, Rico Gordon, was killed in a shooting.These are the kind of le experiences that can lead young people down a very dferent track to the one that Maya has put herself on, and for that alone she deserves our admiration.But really we should admire her solely because she is so good at what she does, and such a brave and eloquent voice for her generation.Kate Ferdinand has announced she is pregnant and expecting her first child with husband of nine months Rio.It really could not happen to a nicer or more deserving couple, as evidenced by the fact that when they told Rio’s three children – Lorenz, , Tate, , and nine-year-old Tia – the youngsters jumped up and down with joy.That is the reaction of children who have been made to feel happy, secure and, above all, loved by their father and his new we, despite having gone through the pain of losing their mother.Kate put the video on Instagram with the caption: “The crazy house is about to get a little bit crazier . . . every time I watch this it makes me cry, the best reaction. Baby Ferdy, we are all so excited to meet you.”Good luck to them.About bloody time.This is an opportunity to be seized.If we think carefully about how to spend the money in the right way, we can achieve a great deal of good in this country – and God knows we need that right now.I am sure I’m not the only one having mixed feelings about shops reopening and the huge step back towards “normality” that we all took this week.On the one hand it feels like a huge relief.Thank goodness things are moving again.On the other, I’m a bit worried about how to get out of my pyjamas, start wearing make-up and navigate my working wardrobe again.On balance, though, I’m excited for us to all start doing what we can to get the economy growing again.Talking of shops reopening, I didn’t enjoy the level of scorn being heaped by people on social media on to the huge queues outside Primark stores, which re-opened on Monday.I think before they are so judgmental they should stop for a minute and consider that many people do not have credit cards so cannot shop online.But not only that – say what you like about Primark clothes, one thing they are is cheap.Families with kids who have grown out of their gear over lockdown couldn’t wait to get in there to grab what they needed, and there was a distinctly snobbish element to some people’s judgment.They should think before they speak.Photos of Reese Witherspoon running in a baseball cap with her face concealed by a mask made me realise celebs everywhere – especially those with lockdown hair and faces that might need a bit of  TLC – are seeing this season’s new must-have accessory as an opportunity to conceal a multitude of sins.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They do what they are told to by top brass but these horribly mixed messages are not a good look.It was once commonplace to hear that this country has the best police force in the world. When was the last time you heard that But it was true. Think of the late PC Keith Palmer, who died in  while heroically preventing a kne-wielding Islamist terrorist from entering the Palace of ­Westminster.Yet during this lockdown, there has been a steady draining away of respect for the police.How we all chortled to learn that in Hampshire,  per cent of police are now overweight or obese — the fat-buttocked blue line.While in London, when a ­protester leapt in front of the PM’s car causing a minor crash, it was hardly a complete surprise to see day-dreaming officers gormlessly staring off into space, as oblivious as Keystone Cops in a coma.There is a growing lack of respect for the police and that is the reason why  officers were injured in one weekend.The ordinary copper has been poorly led, leading to inevitable inaction the moment they are met by protesters or a crowd of eager shoppers at Nike Town.Their own senior officers seem far more concerned about ­displaying their politically correct credentials rather than anything resembling law and order. More than  years ago, the Macpherson Report into the death of Stephen Lawrence in South East London found the Met Police to be ­“institutionally racist”.There has been a great overhaul in the force since.It is hugely welcome that there are Black Asian and Minority ­Ethnicofficers now in senior Scotland Yard roles. This was long overdue.But there is still a long way to go before the force can be regarded as being truly erse.Five of the nation’s police forces have only one black officer.Forces in Durham, North ­Yorkshire, Warwickshire, Dyfed-Powys and North Wales had only one black officer in their ranks each as of March last year.This doesn’t mean our officers should be drawn into events like the death of George Floyd , miles away.It should be self-evident that British police were not in any way responsible for that death in Minneapolis.And yet a statement issued on behalf of Britain’s Chief Constables solemnly stated: “We stand alongside all those across the globe who are appalled and ­horried by the way George Floyd lost his le.“Justice and accountability should follow. We will tackle bias, racism or discrimination wherever we find it.”But the appalling racist violence of American cops — or indeed, when the police go on a violent rampage in Paris or Hong Kong — should not be clumsily confused with the issues our bobbies face here.As the violent clashes of the past few weeks have demonstrated, our officers should be focused on our own problems dealing with crime on our own streets.PAMELA ANDERSON ­promotes fake leather vegan handbags.You would never guess it’s mostly plastic.The bag, I mean. Not Pam.“Is Dad a James Bond fan by any chance ” cooed Britt on the website Cameo. “I’m here to fulfil your wildest desires.”Wow – you’ve got one old dad going now, Britt!You couldn’t get me a signed photo of Ana de Armas, could you AND they’re off!” cried Lizzie Cundy. No, not her clothes – the horses.“Doing this year’s Ascot at home,” sighs Lizzie.Just as well. They would never have let her into the Royal Enclosure carrying that glass of champagne.SIR KEIR STARMER, Labour’s gutless leader, is scared ­witless of upsetting his union paymasters so he can’t bring himself to admit that opening our schools is safe – despite sending his own children to school throughout the lockdown.Same old Labour – always hypocrites when it comes to educating their children.

But in the background, people on legacy benefits—including disabled people, carers and people with young families—have slipped down the list of priorities. It’s now time for the Government to redress that balance and increase legacy benefits too. It’s simply not right for people to miss out on support just because they happen, through no fault of their own, to be claiming the ‘wrong’ kind of benefit.And they demanded that people who are not allowed to claim benefits or other help due to their immigration statue have the rule suspended during the pandemic.Thousands of people who legally live and work in the UK are left unable to get helpthey lose their jobs.And they can struggle to get access to domestic violence help too.Labour MP Jess Phillips is campaigning to end the discrimination of no recourse to public funds and is fighting to change the law.Speaking to The Sun last week she said: “Domestic violence abusers dont discriminate, so we have to make sure our domestic violence laws do not discriminate.”Immigrant women can only access the schemetheir visa is tied to their spouse - and lasts for three months.Ms Philips hopes to see the scheme extended for six months, and opened up to women on student visa, work visas and ever tourist visas.She said: “It shouldnt matter -you have just been beaten up or your le has been threatened, and you go to a police station, they should be able to say there is somewhere for you to go where you will be safe, no matter who you are, no matter where you come from.”Mr Timms added: People whose immigration status leaves them with no recourse to public funds have been left with no support from the benefits system at all—and at risk of destitution and homelessness. Some have had to face the invidious choice between staying at home and facing financial ruin, for themselves and their children, or going to work and risking spreading the disease. The Government must suspend these rules for the duration of the pandemic.A DWP spokesperson said: “We rolled out measures that could be quickly and effectively put into place and that benefited those facing the most financial disruption.“There have been more than . million new claims for Universal Credit since  March and the system has stood up to the test in a way which the paper-based legacy benefit system could not have, ensuring around % of people are paid in full and on time.“We have made a number of changes to legacy and other working age benefits, such as increasing certain entitlements such as Local Housing Allowance, and introduced a range of additional measures to provide financial protection for those affected by COVID-, including those with no recourse to public funds.”To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The frequency of the testing scheme will help identy cases early on and it is likely to help stop the spread of the virus.If a person tests positive the results will be shared in conjunction with the NHS Test and Trace programme.This way people who have been in contact with an infected person will then be able to self-isolate.The pilot scheme will run alongside routine testing of asymptomatic staff in health and care settings.The pilot will be run for four weeks and is being led by the NHS, Southampton City Council and the University of Southampton.The department for Health and Social Care said it was also exploring other no-swab saliva tests.It said it was working with a iety of companies to develop “bespoke” saliva collection kits.Health Secretary, Matt Hancock said: “Saliva testing could potentially make it even easier for people to take coronavirus tests at home, without having to use swabs.

This will not break me, I will not give in nor will I back down. I will continue to proudly stand for what I believe in.”The banning of the Confederate flag at races comes amid the global Black Lives Matter movement, with protests across the US demanding racial equality following the death of an unarmed black man at the hands of police.However, outside the Talladega Speedway circuit, several drivers displayed the banned confederate flag that is a popular symbol for some in the southern part of the United States - but has historic ties to pro-slavery movements.Vehicles waving the flag were seen lining the bouled outside the race track in Lincoln, Alabama, while a plane flew above the track sporting a banner of a Confederate flag that read, Defund NASCAR.The message made reference to the recent protest slogan of “defund police” during demonstrations demanding racial equality.Major cities across the nation have seen widespread demonstrations demanding for change following the death of George Floyd in Minnesota on May  in Minneapolis.Tensions have been stoked further by president Donald Trump, as the presidents supporters faced off with Black Lives Matter protesters on Saturday in Tulsa during his first campaign rally in months.Confederate flags have been a familiar sight at Nascar races across its -year history.Defenders of the blue and red flag of the breakaway confederacy states in the US Civil War deny that its racist, arguing that it is a symbol of Southern heritage that commemorates soldiers who fought with honor.The flag is based on battle flags used by a number of armies in the American civil war between Southern slave-owning states and rest of the Union in the north.The most well known was the banner flown by General Lees Army of Northern Virginia.It bore the familiar white stars on a blue cross set against a red background.After the war it became a symbol of rebel pride and was also known as the Dixie flag and the Southern Cross.Later in the early th century it was adopted by the Ku Klux Klan as it waged a white supremacist terror campaign against black people.Its appearance in the  film Gone With The Wind inspired a widespread nostalgia for the flag a symbol of the Old South.Supporters who use it today say it represents Southern US heritage and the sovereignty of inidual states.It still appears in the corner of the official flag of Mississippi, the only US state flag that includes it since Georgia changed its design in .But for many, its a symbol of slavery and racism that had been a familiar sight at stock car events for more than seven decades.Following the discovery of the noose in Talladega, NASCAR said said it will do everything possible to find who was responsible and “eliminate them from the sport.”Referring to the incident on Sunday, a NASCAR statement read: “We are angry and outraged, and cannot state strongly enough how seriously we take this heinous act.“As we have stated unequivocally, there is no place for racism in NASCAR, and this act only strengthens our resolve to make the sport open and welcoming to all.”Wallace - who drives for Richard Petty Motorsports - said: “Over the last several weeks, I have been overwhelmed by the support from people across the NASCAR industry including other drivers and tea members in the garage.“Together, our sport has made a commitment to driving real chance and championing a community that is accepting and welcoming of everyone.Nothing is more important and we will not be deterred by the reprehensible actions of those who seek to spread hate.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Visit Britain director Patricia Yates said it was “all to play for” for the UK industry as the Government prepares to unveil which Covid- curbs can be relaxed next, due for July . She told the BBC “destinations and councils” needed to “think about how they can control numbers” with sending people to empty car parks and less busy public lavatories. She said: “We have seen some great innovation. Bournemouth is looking at an app that tells people which beaches are less crowded and signposts people to go there. Thataposs the sort of innovation we need to see, and real destination management.” Boris Johnson is expected to outline plans tomorrow for reopening the sector in England. Ms Yates urged the Prime Minister to be clear with hotel and tourism chiefs about what was needed to reopen safely. “Itaposs very important for the tourism industry that they have clarity on date and clarity on what measures they will need to implement to be able open safely,” she said.  “The slightly worrying thing we see is that actually we are still quite nervous about travelling.

Boris Johnson is said to be looking at new ways to relax the rules as part of a wider announcement on easing lockdown tomorrow. Tomorrowaposs address to Parliament was expected to cover the reopening of pubs and hairdressers on or after July  - and could relax the two-metre rule. Now the Dailyhas reported there are plans for a change to support bubbles too. Downing Street has not confirmed the plans and thereports there is no final decision. A senior government source confirmed ministers were considering allowing more social contact from July , but did not specythat would be in the form of bubbles or other social contact, such as gathering outdoors. The system has let two households in England join together permanently since June  - allowing people to break social distancing rules for the first time. The system has reunited kids with grandparents, and allowed some couples who live apart to have sex after three months away. But millions have also lost out due to tight rules on the scheme.  Currently bubbles must consist of two households only, and one of those households must have only one adult. Each household can also be in only one aposexclusiveapos bubble, forcing people to make dficult choices about whether to see a parent or a lover. A senior government source told the Daily : There will be an expansion of social bubbles, but the details are still being finalised.  One option is said to be letting two households join together, as with the current rules, but to scrap the limit on numbers in each household. A second option is set to be allowing a bubble of any number of households, but with a cap on the overall number of people in each bubble. A source told the : The question with bubbles has always been how you help families reunite to the maximum possible extent without too much risk. The scientistsapos main concern has always been infections spreading from one household to another, which is why this is one of the more dficult decisions we have to take. Boris Johnson is expected to announce lockdown easing plans to Parliament tomorrow lunchtime after consulting his Cabinet in the morning. The PM said he has been sticking like glue to his plan to start reopening the hospitality and leisure sector from July  - including pubs, restaurants, cafes, hotels, cinemas, hairdressers and more. But itaposs likely not all sectors will reopen at once, due to the danger of pushing aposRapos - the number of people each Covid- carrier infects - above one. Rules will be tightened in some areas, with ministers looking at making people register when they enter a pub to make contact-tracing easier. And No warned any widespread breaches would lead to this weekaposs changes being axed first.

This yearaposs exams were cancelled completely due to the pandemic. The current timetable says next yearaposs exams start in May  and must end before a contingency day of  June . But Tory MP Alec Shelbrooke askedthe entire season in England could be pushed back into July.He said it would allow students and teachers more time in the classroom to try and complete the curriculum. Answering him in the Commons, Mr Williamson said the MP had raised an important point about how do we add more teaching time in. The Cabinet minister confirmed: Weaposll be consulting with Ofqual about how we can move those exams back. [Therefore] giving children extra time in order to be able to learn and really flourish and do incredibly well. It came as Mr Williamson insisted he was planning for a fullof every single child in every year group from September. Scotland and Wales are bringing back some pupils on a rota or part-time to avoid the spread of the virus. But Mr Williamson - who will outline a full plan for September next week - insisted he was planning for a fullof every single child in every year group back into school.  Boris Johnson has insisted he wants all children back in school five days per week from September.He said last week he did not want part-time learning or half days, adding: “I’m making no bones about it, I think that’s the way forward for our country. Unions warned last week it would be impossible to reopen schools fully in September with the current distancing rules in place. Current distancing rules force schools to split pupils into -strong aposbubblesapos, doubling the number of classes. Since then Mr Williamson has hinted the groups of  could be doubled into bubbles the size of normal classes, with  pupils each.  This could cause chaosthere is an outbreak, becauseone pupil tests positive for Covid- all those in the same bubble would have to isolate for two weeks. Boris Johnsonaposs official spokesman said: The PM is determined that children should be back in school in September and we want to do everything we possibly can to deliver that. “It’s important that children attend school and we don’t want them missing out on the benefits and the value of education”. Askedhaving children back in class five days a week was government policy, the spokesman said: The Education Secretary will publish a plan but you’ve got the PM’s words from Friday. He was pretty clear he wants all kids back in schools in September. Mr Williamson last week unveiled a £billion catch-up fund for schools.  Today Shadow Education Secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey slammed the fund for not including nurseries or colleges - despite an early wrong press release claiming it would. She said: Less than an hour later the Government amended the press release. The funding was not for early years and -, it was £ million, not £ million, it would not be available until September and now I hear that schools will need to find % of tuition funding themselves. So I ask the Secretary, what on Earth happened   Mr Williamson replied: There is a reality - that this side of the House is committed to getting every child back into school and we understand that actually this is where they are going to benefit from. If it was up to the party opposite we wouldnapost see any children back into the classroom, but what weaposve already got, weaposve got nursery back, weaposve got reception back, weaposve got Year  back, weaposve got Year  back, weaposve got Year  back and weaposve got .

In Angela Merkel, his country of birth has an Iron Chancellor displaying crucial leadership – while Britain is lumbered with an incompetent flip-flopper in Boris Johnson. Germany’s death rate, at  per one million people, is roughly one-sixth of our . Yet it was achieved without wrecking a fth of its economy. Our world-beating highest excess deaths, and the worst economic hit, are a double-whammy panicking a growing number of Tory MPs into contemplating le after a Johnson clowning on a clf-edge. Easing lockdown restrictions, reopening pubs and dismantling ­ludicrous quarantine is the easy part for the Prime Minister. Build, build, build a decent, fairer, prosperous country feels beyond the dithering architect of lost lives, with care home scandals, PPE shortages, missed testing targets, still-shut schools and an app that proved to be the square wheel of technology. Johnson prefers to slobber constantly over the future because he can’t justy the present or defend the past. Feeble economic growth and still-mounting debt before the plague, the NHS on a le-support system and education suffering a decade of austerity cuts were the Government’s dismal record. Labour is wrestling with how to stop slippery Johnson exploiting Covid- as a Year Zero moment a fresh start for him and the Tories. His party did it successfully last year by dumping Theresa May so Johnson, ex-Foreign Secretary and lobby fodder – who for years loyally joined assaults on working families – could run against the Tories’ own record. Johnson regenerating more often than Doctor Who is tougher in . Unless Labour nail him, the charlatan won’t care about the truth.The next election might be as far off as December  but Lib Dem potential leader Layla Moran floatinglocal pacts with Labour and also ruling out another ConDem coalition is signicant.Tactical voting is key when Keir Starmer must win  more seats to just be the biggest party. The .% swing needed for a snf of Downing Street is close to Tony Blair’s .% in the  landslide.

But according to Professor Susan Michie, a member of the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies’subgroup on behavioural science, some people do not know how to correctly put a face mask on and are putting themselves and other commuters at risk.  According to the gov.uk website, a face covering “should cover your mouth and nose while allowing you to breathe comfortably”, YorkshireLive reports.“Wash your hands or use hand sanitiser before putting it on and after taking it off,” the website advises. “Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth at all times and store used face coverings in a plastic bag until you have an opportunity to wash them. “Do not touch the front of the face covering or the part of the face covering that has been in contact with your mouth and nose. Once removed, make sure you clean any surfaces the face covering has touched.” However, Prof Michie says many people appear to be wearing their face coverings below the nose and holding the front of items to remove them, rather than using the straps behind the head. She told The Sunday : “Any time one goes out and around in parks and down the street this is the sort of thing you see.” Prof Michie added a national campaign might be needed to “train” people on how to wear their face coverings correctly.  “I think the main thing is that where you have a behaviour that requires some kind of skill, and some kind of routine and procedure to make it effective, then usually it’s not enough to say do this, ie transmit knowledge, but we also need to have training. “If it’s a question of skills, ie the behaviour surrounding the putting on, off and wearing of , then it does require skills training.”Last week, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan warned Brits may have to wear face masks for the next year. He told LBC: This is part of the new normal. For the foreseeable future, I believe for the next year or so, wearing face coverings is going to become the norm rather than the exception. I was pleased when the PM accepted the need for us to wear face coverings on public transport, and make it mandatory.

For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, click here   He knelt down at the floral tributes to read cards and look at soft toys, including teddy bears and unicorns, which had been left by dozens of friends and neighbours. The touching message on one card read: “To Fiona, my bestie forever. Thank you for the great memories we made together. You showed me exactly what a best friend is. “I will miss you very much. It’s never goodbye, just a see you soon. All my love, Hayley xoxoxo.” At one stage, the heartbroken dad looked up at the burned-out flat and wept uncontrollably.  He was supported by family members and escorted by two police family liaison officers as he left after the painful visit.The dad, who loved making TikTok videos for his children and who hoped to go to Florida with them when lockdown  was over, was too upset to speak. Expressing his grief on social media, he posted: “How I miss them already. Now I know what it feels like when your world comes crashing down.” It followed an earlier message from the distraught dad, which read: “Rest in peace u little angels.” Alex had walked to the nearby Esso garage on Friday night to buy sweets and crisps for his children, only toand find the family home engulfed in flames at about pm. The Scottish Fire and Rescue said six crews who rushed to the scene were met with a “well developed” blaze in the first-floor property. The three children were taken to Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in  Glasgow. All three were pronounced dead a short time after being admitted.Detectives went door-to-door yesterday as they talked to neighbours moments before Alex arrived at the scene. A police spokesman said: “An investigation is under way to establish the exact circumstances of this incident.  “Anyone who has information that could assist our inquiries should contact police via  quoting incident number  of June , .” A fundraising page has been set up for the family and was on course to double its target just over  hours after it was started by a friend.

Here, she explains why itaposs so important. Why in Britain, in , are black people still marching against racism and injustice  In a hard-hitting series, launching today on Windrush Day – the nd anniversary of the Empire Windrush arriving at Tilbury – we’ll look at issues affecting black British lives and why they matter. We start with health. I was honoured to play a role in commissioning a brilliant group of writers who are telling stories long overdue. I hope you read them in the spirit they are written in – a desire to deepen understanding of the issues and create a fairer society, where people are no longer judged by the colour of their skin, but by the content of their character. Mirror writer Adenike Adenitire takes a closer look at four of the most devastating health issues affecting Britainaposs black community. Here is what sheaposs found. Blood cancer  Orin Lewis OBE and we Beverley De-Gale OBE run the charity African Caribbean Leukaemia Trust. For  years it has worked to help patients with blood cancer and other illnesses to find stem cell, blood or organ donors, as there is an extreme shortage in the black community. ACLT was founded in  after the couple’s then six-year-old son Daniel De-Gale was diagnosed with leukaemia. He became the first black person in the UK to receive a stem cell transplant from an unrelated donor. Daniel unfortunately passed away in  at the age of  as a result of multiple organ failure. Orin says: “There is a pandemic virus called racism that is affecting all sectors of society, including health. The Royal College of Nursing came out last week to admit they’ve got a big problem with how black and other nurses from ethnic minorities are treated. “And we see it because our struggle to fund our work to save lives shouldn’t be this hard after nearly  years.”For details visit aclt.org.Sickle cell Sickle Cell Disease is Britain’s biggest genetic blood disease, affecting , people in the country – mainly those of African and Caribbean heritage. Episodes of excruciating pain may occur, which are treated with strong painkillers such as morphine. Those suffering from the condition are at risk of complications such as a stroke, blindness and bone damage. The disease can also result in deathnot treated properly. Approximately  babies are born with SCD in the UK every year but problems of lack of awareness and funding remain. John James OBE, CEO of Britain’s leading sickle cell charity The Sickle Cell Society, says: “Sickle Cell is something that has been known about for over  years but there has been very limited innovation research and development into modying treatment. Why is that  “Some people would ask: ‘If this was the biggest blood condition in the UK but it was affecting predominantly white people, would it still be the same ’” Dame Elizabeth Anionwu, who won a Letime Achievement Award at the Daily Mirror’s Pride of Britain Awards for transforming care for people with sickle cell disease, agrees that patients can face undue prejudice. She says: “There is still an issue about pain relief. “There are still some iniduals of African or Caribbean heritage, who are patients, but are thought of as drug addicts because they need drugs like morphine.”More information is avilable at sicklecellsociety.org.Mental health As a black person in the UK, you are four times more likely to be detained under the Mental Health Act than a white person, according to data collected from NHS Digital. Figures have shown black men are  times more likely to have serious mental health issues such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, yet only % of psychologists are from BAME backgrounds. An independent report conducted by the Centre for Mental Health noted that experiences of racism “appear to be a major influence on the mental health of black boys and young men that wear down their resilience during teenage and young adult years”. The study, which spoke to just under  participants, “found evidence of the incrementally damaging impact of a stream of negative media representations and demonising portrayals of black culture that led men to ‘mask’ their true selves”. Eche Egbuonu’s first experience with mental health issues was during his final year of university. The college lecturer, , from Hackney, East London, said: “There was an identity crisis I went through, where I was surrounded by lots of people but I still felt at my loneliest.” In , he suffered a psychotic episode of mania after having a dispute with his family. The police were called to the home and he was taken to a cell while a bed was prepared for him at a hospital. He says: “Some of the ways they got me into the cell seemed very heavy-handed given the fact that I had not been violent towards the officers or any other inidual. “So I could not understand that level of force or the need to place me in a prison cell.” Child birth  Black women in the UK are five times more likely than white women to die during childbirth according to a  report from Mothers and Babies Reducing Risk Through Audits and Confidential Enquiries. Candice Brathwaite, blogger and author of best-selling book I Am Not Your Baby Mother, understands this only too well after her own experience seven years ago of giving birth to her first child, daughter Esmé-Olivia. The  year-old says: “From beginning to end it was a mess. I was induced and left to wait hours for pain medicine while I was surrounded by labouring white women who seemed to be covered in this maternal care. It really felt like I was an annoyance.” After giving birth, Candice started feeling very unwell and told midwives. She says: “Their attitude was very much ‘you are overthinking it’ and ‘you are just having baby blues’.” But just two days after going home, baby Esmé fell asleep on Candice’s chest and the weight of her tiny body was enough to burst a septic sac growing underneath Candice’s C- section wound.

The circle of shafts, believed to be , years old, is said to be the biggest prehistoric structure ever discovered in the UK. It was found just under two miles northeast of Stonehenge at Durrington in Wiltshire, and is thought to date back to the same period. It is not yet known what it is for - but it is possible the centre of the circle could have been a holy site.Prof Vincent Gaffney, one of the leading archaeologists, told: “This is an unprecedented find of major signicance within the UK.Key researchers on Stonehenge and its landscape have been taken aback by the scale of the structure and the fact that it hadn’t been discovered until now so close to Stonehenge.” And he continued: “I can’t emphasise enough the effort that would have gone in to digging such large shafts with tools of stone, wood and bone.” The newly-discovered settlement includes a henge, or circular structure, made of timber posts.  It could demonstrate that Neolithic people were able to count - as placing the shafts so precisely could only have been done by counting paces. So far  shafts have been found, each more than five metres deep and  metres in diametre. Archaeologist Nick Snashall, of the National Trust, said: As the place where the builders of Stonehenge lived and feasted, Durrington Walls is key to unlocking the story of the wider Stonehenge landscape. This astonishing discovery offers us new insights into the lives and beliefs of our Neolithic ancestors.The circle of pits is signicantly larger than any comparable prehistoric monument in Britain.

The haunting images show tables scattered with moulds of human jaws and sets of  teeth implants left strewn across the floor.The building opened as st Dental on Wetherby Road, Harrogate, in , specialising in dental moulds for dental prosthetics but also served as a private general dentist, as reported by Yorkshire Live.Before that, the site was occupied by Aesthetic Dental services. After st Dental was placed into administration in , it was bought out by investment firm Zeus Group, but the branch closed its doors in .Eight years later it remains unused and often attracts youngsters in the town who use it as a place to socialise.

Located within the town I live, Iaposve had this old dentist pinned since the beginning, and finally found out it had access.

But Kate surprised everyone when she dropped an extra third photo of her family - and we think itaposs our favourite of the lot. The cute snap looks far less staged than the other two, showing the family in a bundle on the floor playing and laughing. All three of the relaxed snaps were taken at their countryside home, Amner Hall, where the family have spent lockdown. Charlotte looks adorable in a pair of denim dungarees featuring a zebra and a flamingo, with her hair in two plaits, while her brothers look cute in polo shirts and shorts. One of the other snaps shows the birthday boy sitting on a swing with his youngest, Louis, on his lap while George and Charlotte stood around him. The other shows Wills lying on the grass with the kids climbing on top of him. The family moved to their Norfolk home before lockdown was introduced, and Kate and William have been homeschooling their oldest two children there. In an interview last month, Kate explained that one of the big issues theyaposre having is that George is more interested in his little sisteraposs school work than his own. Speaking to Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield on This Morning to launch her new photograph project Hold Still, she said: George gets very upset because he wants too get involved in Charlotte’s projects!Making spider sandwiches is far cooler than doing literacy work.  She also opened up about how the family have found the lockdown, including not being able to see the rest of the Royal Family and Kateaposs parents Carole and Michael Middleton. She said: Itaposs really hard. We hadnapost done a huge amount of FaceTime and face calls but obviously weaposre doing that a lot more. And actually, itaposs been really great. We try to check in daily with family members and speak to them about news and things like that.  In some ways weaposve got a lot more contact and a lot more face time than prehaps we would have done before. But it is dficult, itaposs hard to explain to a five and a six, nearly seven, year old whataposs going on. The schools have been great in supporting them as well. Hard times but weaposve got the support out there I think.

They are believed to have been set up by members of the chan community - an anonymous website notorious for its trolling culture. It planned to get other white women to follow suit and then troll them for taking part, and in turn undermine the true message of Black Lives Matter.

The hashtag #BaldforBLM has since been used tens of thousands of times on Twitter, often by newly created accounts encouraging others to shave their heads. But soon after the campaign began and the hashtag began to trend, parts of the internet began to fight back. Twitter user @Lizzeth_Lemon responded to a popular tweet from a new account, claiming that it was using her photo. She tweeted: Hi yaposall, those pictures are of me. I did NOT shave my head for some fragile white performative b******t, I lost my hair during chemotherapy in  and loved that bald look so much I kept it buzzed.

He said: “He was a pervert and more than capable of snatching a child for sexual kicks or money.” We can reveal that Austrian drter Mr Tatschl was grilled last year by German and Austrian police investigating Madeleine’s disappearance.He reportedly told them how his pal bragged about burgling rich tourists’ holiday apartments.  Mr Tatschl, , claimed that Brueckner, , also boasted about “selling kids” – although there as been no evidence found of this so far – and he fears Madeleine was sold to a sex ring.  He claimed: “He was always bragging about money and making money. He even talked about selling kids, maybe to Morocco. “I think he probably sold Maddie to someone. Maybe a sex ring. I was living with him at the time. He was my best friend. I know he did it.” Mr Tatschl claimed that Brueckner was obsessed with the dark web and suspects he used it to deal in pornography and drugs.He also claimed Brueckner had a secret spot in his home in Praia da Lux where he kept stolen loot. Mr Tatschl’s name emerged last week after Portuguese authorities granted access to Brueckner’s court records.They showed Brueckner was locked up on remand with Mr Tatschl after they were caught stealing diesel from lorries.Mr Tatschl, a dad of one who is now back in his native Austria, said he expects an arrest is “imminent” in Madeleine’s case.In his first ever media interview, he described Brueckner as a “strange character”. He said: “He was definitely a pervert. All his friends thought that about him. He had some sexual issues.I really hope they can finally close this case for the family and find Christian guilty for what he has done. He needs to admit it to the police.”  rueckner befriended Mr Tatschl in late . Mr Tatschl began living with him in early  at his farmhouse in Praia da Luz, Algarve, which Brueckner shared with his German girlfriend. Mr Tatschl said: “I was staying at his house and camping in a van in the garden. We spent a lot of time together and had good fun. He did not take drugs at the time but liked to have a drink.” Mr Tatschl claimed that Brueckner bragged about regularly robbing holiday flats.He alleged: “He was a very good burglar and would easily climb up to first-floor apartments when tourists were out.He would steal money, valuables and passports. He had a hiding place in his house, in the roof. He had the money and passports hidden up there.He added: “Christian was always on the dark web. I don’t know exactly what he did but I suspect it involved drugs and pornography.”Mr Tatschl said he was “sucked in” to Brueckner’s le of crime. In April , the pair were caught by police stealing diesel from two lorries in Portimao, Algarve. They spent over eight months on remand in jail awaiting trial. Mr Tatschl claimed that while they were in jail, Brueckner got a pal to clear his home of the alleged stolen loot.He claimed: “He ordered a friend to get rid of any evidence of burglaries or robberies. But this guy and another friend ended up robbing the house and took all the valuables and money. “They also got a video camera from the house, which was how I found out he was a sick b*****d.On that camera was a video of him raping an old woman. It was of this elderly lady who was chained to a wooden post and she was being beaten and raped.”It is not believed that the woman in the video was the American pensioner Brueckner was later convicted of raping and is currently serving jail time for in Germany.After Brueckner’s release from prison, he stayed in Praia da Luz, living in the VW Westfalia van that police later seized.Mr Tatschl said: “I think that confused the police as they were not sure where he was living exactly when Maddie vanished. But he had his van and was living free.” Mr Tatschl moved to the hippy enclave of Orgiva in Andalusia, Spain, in April , weeks before Madeleine, three, vanished on May .He said Brueckner turned up in “late May or early June” driving a Tfin Allegro winnebago. It was in this vehicle that police found a stash of girls’ swimming costumes in .Brueckner also allegedly bragged he could hide “drugs and children” inside the ft-long van.Mr Tatschl said: “He parked it up in Orgiva and came looking for me.“We all wondered where he’d got the money from  It was a big expensive thing. We assumed it was from a big drug deal or something like that. Now I suspect it was Maddie. “He was only there for a couple of days and went on back to Germany. Mr Tatschl lost touch with Brueckner and ed to his native Austria several years ago to start a family. It was while watching last year’s Netflix series The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann that he became convinced his friend was responsible. He claimed: “When I saw the documentary I knew immediately that he was guilty.The part where the female tourist talked about the creepy guy with acne and blond hair, I just knew it was Christian for sure.”Within weeks of the series airing, German and Austrian police knocked on Mr Tatschl’s door. He was interviewed by detectives over two days in April .

The couple are currently in lockdown in LA with one-year-old son Archie Harrison after stepping down as senior members of the Royal Family to forge their own path. And since moving to the City of Angels, they have been keeping themselves busy with charity work, as well as supporting the Black Lives Matter movement.Now, the pair have found the time to send a heartfelt letter to national sports charity StreetGames, which helps young people in disadvantaged areas, the Daily Star reports.But some social media users have been left scratching their heads over Harry and Meghanaposs decision to use their joint HM monogram with a crown on top - despite them distancing themselves from the royals. They have, however, decided not to call themselves the Duke and Duchess of Sussex or use a HRH title and instead signed the letter off aposHarry  Meghanapos. One person commented: They need to take that crown out of that M logo. A second said: No royalty-no crown!! Rushing to Meghanaposs defence, another remarked: She’s still royal, a Duchess and married to the son of a future king. There’s no reason for the coronet to be removed. Others also pointed out that Princess Diana and Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, continued to use a crown on their letters following their orces from Prince Charles and Prince Andrew. Meanwhile, the letter dated June , was sent to StreetGames who have since shared their delight. They tweeted: Wow. Thank you so much Harry and Meghan for your kind words and your continued support for StreetGames and the brilliant local organisations working to support their communities in these challenging times. The organisation has been playing a crucial role in distributing fresh meals to young people across London during the coronavirus pandemic.Meghan and Harry said they were touched to witness from afar the coming together of the organisations we champion and so deeply care about. They said: We wanted to write and express our heartfelt thanks to the team at StreetGames following their support delivering Hubb Community kitchen meals throughout London.

Spanish newspaper El Pais report up to , people in the town of Nauta have received the treatment with Leonardo Tello, the director of local radio station Radio Ucamara, telling reporters the side effects have been terrible. Tello said that since May, the mayor of the province and an Evangelic alliance have called citizens, using radio stations, to be vaccinated with ivermectin asit were a vaccine against coronavirus. In Nauta, at least , people have received it. He said that many of those who had received the treatment had suffered an increase in their heart rate whilst others have warned of diarrhoea as a side effect. Tello says that local Evangelical pastors have linked coronavirus with the devil and the end of the world, offering the injections as a salvation. Wadson Trujillo, the head of the indigenous community in Cuninico, said that volunteers from the Misiones Evangelicas de la Amazoniahad gone to the area to give injections of ivermectin to villagers, saying that it was a medicine passed by law that gives positive results as a vaccine. He said: Almost everybody here had coronavirus symptoms and they are fighting against it with homemade medicine. He said that seven of the  coronavirus tests carried out in the community had come back positive, saying that they now have face masks for the whole population. Local media reported that in the Peruvian Amazon, where around one million people live and around , people are indigenous, fear of coronavirus has seen the widespread use of traditional medicines which have not been proven effective against the virus.The General Management of Medicine of the Ministry of Health of Peru have already warned about the use of ivermectin saying that it has not yet met all the requirements for use on humans. The ministry said: Ivermectin for animals should not be used as a replacement for ivermectin for use on human beings in order to treat coronavirus.

They are doing the same to support other temporary NHS services across Scotland.Our people have worked around the clock with health boards across the country to offer new, technical solutions to help frontline health workers get on with their jobs during this crisis.Our frontline staff in contact centres across Scotland – including Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow and Greenock – have risen to this unprecedented challenge. We’ve received a huge surge of customers asking for faster connections to help with home working, home schooling and running their businesses remotely.These colleagues – most of whom can now work from home when they want to – have performed a critical role keeping our customers, including frontline health workers and vulnerable people, connected.The people in our two  contact centres in Scotland are also playing a critical role, answering lesaving emergency calls.I couldn’t be more proud of how my colleagues have responded to these challenges and their desire to help us all through this crisis.Jane Wood, BT Group director in Scotland, Edinburgh.COVID- is seriously not a jokeGlobally kills thousands of folkYou start coughing, you can#t breatheWithout a respirator, this earth you#ll leaveSocial distancing is now in placeKeep two metres apart, not face to faceWash your hands frequently and well hours on surfaces it can dwellShop infrequently, for essentials onlyDon#t mix with othersyou#re lonelyKeep in touch by text and phoneDon#t put yourself at risk, stay aloneIt#s hoped soon this contagion will peakThen we canto normal, so to speakDon#t travel to other towns by carIt can spread the virus near and farSports, socialising and most work on holdThe alternative could cause damage untoldSupport the NHS, essential workers and neighboursThen we#ll defeat this virus by all our laboursDugald MacGilp, Lochgilphead.Sir,We are looking for people who have the passion to bring communities together, believe in the power of co-operation and who hold the well-being of their community at the forefront of their mind.The successful #Member Pioneers# will receive full training and business support as they help groups and iniduals during the coronavirus pandemic and beyond.

Action is needed and the bullies must be confronted. That they were allowed to behave in this way for so long is the real shocker.Their own managers have questions to answer. Why was this not nipped in the bud  Is there an ongoing lack of management training and support Whatever the reasons, it has to stop now.Minard folk were surprised to find themselves in the papers, on television and on the radio this week.

People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

In this monthly column, she shares her wildle diary ndash and pictures!THE day I first visited Musselburgh was not one to write home about.I came to town to see the house I had already agreed to move in to. Most people would organise a viewing before deciding to move in however, since it was my fianceacutersquos childhood home, I had simply said YES!Our move-in date was already confirmed, meaning this visit was just a formality.Upon seeing the amount of work the house still needed as it underwent considerable renovation, my initial reaction was one of utter petrication that it would not be completed on time.The weather was not particularly favourable either. Drenched in the cold September rain, I had lost my appetite to explore the area, which now seemed grim and gloomy.By contrast, my second visit to Musselburgh is one worth remembering.I had come to check on the progress of the house and to join a group of birdwatchers for a stroll around the Esk and the lagoons.The walk started at the river mouth, from where we watched a couple of cormorants sunbathing.It was not long before someone raised the cry: ldquoA kingfisher!I promptly directed my camera to where everyone was looking, and I saw him: a beautul, bright blue kingfisher.After that sighting I knew my le would change.Moving to Musselburgh ended up being one of the best decisions I have made .Since that day I have been studying this wee bird.Every spare moment is spent at the river watching for our kingfisher.It has become my all-encompassing obsession.Each encounter teaches me something new and I never stop learning.This one bird inspired me in many ways, such as helping me understand the importance of fieldcraft in wildle photography, and allowed for some unforgettable captures.So, without further ado, let me formally introduce Mr KingfisherhellipThe kingfisher is an unmistakeable bird, with its metallic azure blue back and bright orange breast.The bird is usually glimpsed, a sudden flash of glistening blue, flitting at the riverbank.If you are luckyenough, the bird may comfortably land near you.Usually, despite its exotic colouration, the bird is dficult to spot sitting on a branch surrounded by foliage, a kingfisher successfully blends into the landscape.I have spent hours in the field and can still struggle to spot a perching kingfisher.When I locate a bird, I identy the sex by the birdrsquos beak: the malersquos is completely black, whilst the femalersquos is orange underneath.Kingfishers are territorial and they will hold their ground against other iniduals.Breeding season is the only time when the male and female tolerate each other and share territory.The choice of feeding ground is extremely important as the bird is dependent on it all year round.Each area covers at least km of slow-flowing fresh water or lake, but this may extend anywhere up to km.The resident male I have been watching for almost three years exhibits slight migratory behaviour it travels upstream during the breeding season, whilst it spends the winter months near the river mouth. For its fishing ground, a kingfisher will often choose a shallow pool in the river bend.They are not titled ldquoking fishers for nothing and are experts in this field.Before ing, they sit patiently on a perch, bobbing their head back and forth to assess the exact position of a fish.Once it has spotted a fish, it es headfirst at speeds up to mph.The kingfisher enters the water with beak half open and eyes protected by its third, transparent eyelid.A split second later, the bird emerges, beak first, and flies back to the perch.Here, it twirls the fish so that it may be held by the tail, proceeding to bash it against the perch to kill it and break the spine, making it easier to swallow.If you have a favourite animal you would like me to feature next month, or are looking for advice on how to spot and photograph a kingfisher, contact me through my website or social media channels.

Those long adventurous rides I used to go on, well they have been a thing of the past, especially after my beloved bike was stolen years ago.But then, during the lockdown, my wee daughter Skye decided she wanted to learn to cycle, and with gritty determination she did so, magically on the same path in the Greenhills at Prestonpans where I learnt so many years before.So another friend very kindly leant me a bike and I was able to accompany my daughter around the then quiet streets of our town as she developed her confidence.I enjoyed this, and it was good exercise, but it began to give me itchy feet and a nostalgic longing to re-experience some of the joys of my youth and head off onto the open road and go exploring on two wheels under my own steam.So when Gareth suggested we go for a ldquovery short cycle ride to visit Green Craig island that I had heard so much about, I gladly accepted.The destination was just beyond the big gates of Gosford House in total just under five miles away. And, of course, the road follows the coast, so no horrible hills to climb.So I set off, with my children waving at me asI was going to war, and met Gareth outside Cockenzie House as arranged.It was from here I became increasingly aware of the depreciation my body has suffered since my last long cycle.The road was, as far as I could ascertain, flat.There was a very slight breeze on my face to cool me, so in theory it was perfect cycling conditions.But something was wrong I was very quickly puffing and panting as I tried to keep up with my friend, who was coasting effortlessly in front of me.I could feel my face turning red and an old lady walking her small dog looked up and gave me a sympathetic glance as I passed her.I was cycling faster than she was walking but not by much.Then another cyclist passed me, at what seemed to be close to the speed of light, at least compared to the pathetic speed I was travelling.It was at this moment I noticed Gareth was well ahead of me, and talking to himself, as he believed I was still just behind him.So I called out, ldquoGareth, slow down a wee bit! He waited for me to catch up.ldquoSorry, I said, ldquofeel free to cycle ahead but I will have to go slower.ldquoYou want to go ahead  he asked.ldquoNo, I said, ldquo we do that we may be in danger of falling over due to lack of velocity!And so we headed out of town.My comment about velocity had put me in mind of Einsteinrsquos theory of relativity that speed is not absolute and objects move at a speed relative to one another, and that this affects the passage of time.My time was most certainly being slowed down. Never had that short journey felt so long.I discovered small hills I had driven over but never noticed. I became acutely aware of the power of gravity, and I lost count of how many stops I needed before we finally arrived at our destination.But what elation when we did arrive: I was shocked on one hand at just how unfit I was, but on the other I had a sense of achievement.We locked our bikes and headed along the coast to the island. The tide was out which meant we could reach it without getting our feet wet.Gareth was keen to find a trig pole which he had discovered was on the wee island. It was used by early map makers but we didnrsquot find it.We sat on a log, and Gareth offered me a cup of tea from his flask. Hersquod bought an extra cup, and we sat there, two metres apart on an old log looking out to sea, talking. It was the best cup of tea I can remember in a long time.The island isnrsquot much in itself, more like a tuft of land or gloried sandbank, just beyond the coast.But itrsquos the location and what you can see from it which makes it special, both in terms of wildle and landscape. And history too is all around.The sea comes in fast at this point and it was soon moving in a pincer motion, enveloping the wee tuft of land to make it an island once again.Itrsquos that which perhaps excites the childhood imagination in us, beating the tide before being marooned or maybe being marooned could be the best bit!But we left just in time. The sea lapped at our feet as we walked past the huge concrete blocks from wartime and we discussed the goings on in the world.As we reached our bikes I noticed some dens made by previous visitors.Impressive constructions, showing perhaps that the lockdown for many of us has given us an opportunity to explore and discover our own area in ways perhaps we never did before.Then we set off home. The journey back gave me a new phenomena to contemplate that a road can feel uphill both ways when you are an unfit, overweight man on a bicycle.Gareth insisted on cycling with me all the way home, you know, just in case.But I made it, and got a kind reception from my kids who asked me, ldquoWhere have you been all this time, you must have gone really far Well in one way I had. Not in terms of actual physical distance perhaps, but certainly in terms of having an unexpected and unforgettable adventure with a kind and understanding friend."},{"url":null,"title":"man-stamps-mark-unique-present-idea","story":"Donald Malone ndash originally from Whittingehame and who runs his own wildle education business, Wildside Nature ndash is using stamps from all over the world in a iety of dferent ways as interesting gt ideas for people.He explained: ldquoI collected stamps when I was a child, aged seven or eight.ldquoThen about  years ago my interest in them restarted.

This would involve ldquothe introduction of a wealth tax for high net worth iniduals.ldquoThe pandemic, MacDonald says, ldquohas underscored and highlighted the many inequalities that exist in the UK. GDP shouldnrsquot be the only measure of a nationrsquos success but also ldquohealth and social care, the environment, and the quality of le.Post-pandemic unemployment could be as high as %, MacDonald warns, and ldquois likely to be especially high in Scotland given the structure of the Scottish economy.ldquoA new form of social contract will be needed as we move out of the pandemic, he says.The government should ldquoinstigate a wellbeing fiscal stimulus hellip that has a major focus on greening the economy.That means ldquonoto austerity policies, and a focus on building ldquosocial capital to create a stronger, more connected society. Simply focusing on growth, rather than human happiness, is not enough.MacDonald says: ldquoThe prioritising of health and wellbeing during the pandemic indicates that there should not be an exclusive focus on economic growth but a sht to a more holistic wellbeing measure such a measure should recognise the deficiencies of the pre-pandemic economy in terms of inequalities, a reliance on relatively low paid and insecure jobs and a lack of resilience in health and social care.MacDonaldrsquos call for such revolutionary change will be listened to by governments and policy-makers around the world given his distinguished background. Hersquos currently professor of macroeconomics and international finance at Glasgow University.MacDonald, who is an OBE, has consistently been ranked amongst the worldrsquos top % of economists. Hersquos worked with the International Monetary Fund, the European Commission, and the European Central Bank.His paper will be published by the think-tank Policy Scotland. Itrsquos titled ldquoThe Post Pandemic New Normal: the likely socio-economic implications and policy choices facing Scotland and the UK.MacDonald says: ldquoThe current dire straits engulfing the whole global community is unique in the sense that all governments are facing a stark trade-off between the health and well-being of their populations and maintaining the economic efficiency of their economies.The pandemic has also ldquoexacerbated the decline of globalisation as a ldquocentral component of the current world order. The current crisis could be the ldquofinal nail in the coffin of globalisation.The economic threat from pandemic has been heightened by ldquoa prolonged period of under-investment in developed economies. The economic response to the pandemic by governments ldquohas been uncoordinated.The threat of inflation is growing. ldquoIf inflation does start to take off then hellip there may at some point be a need to raise nominal interest rates sharply, he warns, adding: ldquoThe focus would then need to switch to what public spending would need to be cut or what taxes to raise. Given that there seems to be no appetite for spending-induced austerity now, it would seem hellip that the time to start planning for eventual tax changes is now hellip specically in terms of reforming the tax system.Therersquos likely to be ldquoa reduced appetite for risk by the private sector and an increased risk aversion with increased precautionary savings on the part of consumers and low investment by business as a consequence. Levels of debt are ldquoeyewatering. The ldquoimmediate impact of the pandemic could see ldquoa collapse in commodity prices.TAX REFORMThe damage to the economy from pandemic presents a stark choice: tax hikes or spending cuts. MacDonald says: ldquoGiven the austerity imposed after the financial crisis is one of the contributing factors to the lack of resilience in the health service and other public services during the pandemic we rule this out as an option. Which leaves taxes as the main vehicle to deliver rectitude in debt and deficit.MacDonald sees ldquothe post-Covid landscape presenting an ldquoideal opportunity to consider tax reform.ldquoIt is crucial, he says, ldquothat any tax changes that are introduced should not impede the recovery and there seems to be a growing consensus among economists that any such changes should be focussed on wealthy iniduals rather than increasing business taxes.Inequality has ldquobeen deeply intensied during the pandemic. MacDonald says: ldquoPerhaps, the time has now come for the stakeholder model of capitalism to replace the shareholder model. Fty years ago, .% of corporate revenues went to shareholders - today its %.Post-pandemic recovery will ldquorequire taxes to change. MacDonald says: ldquoGiven the large inequalities within the UK today any new system should be progressive and in large measure should avoid income and goods and services taxes.ldquoTo this end, a permanent reduction in labour taxes such as national insurance would clearly be an obvious alternative to the salary subsidies that have been given during the lockdown and would help to maintain employment levels as the recovery phase proceeds, he says.ldquoFurthermore, such a reduction in the tax wedge would give entrepreneurs the incentive to expand existing business and also invest in sectors that will become more attractive post-pandemic. It would be a mistake to pay for the lower taxes on labour by increasing corporation tax, given that an increased investment spend will be essential to permanent recovery from the recession.ldquoA wealth tax would be a credible tax on capital and is becoming increasingly popular particularly given the nature of inequalities prevalent in the UK.MacDonald also suggests a land tax as it ldquodoes not affect economic efficiency and can reduce inequality. Business rates and council tax should also be reformed, and small and medium-sized companies should be assisted by grants not loans.THE UNEMPLOYMENT CRISISUnemployment in Britain is likely to hit % by the end of the year, or even in the worst-case scenario reach %. MacDonald warns: ldquoGiven the structure of the Scottish economy, the unemployment situation in Scotland is likely to be worse than that in the UK. Scotlandrsquos dependence on the oil and hospitality sectors, and high-end food and drink exports, leave the nation vulnerable.As well as ldquothe permanent shutting of some businesses, MacDonald worries about ldquothe replacement of people with technology-driven alternatives.The ldquoblight of unemployment, he says, is ldquothe inevitable consequence of the pandemic.As lockdown eases, ldquothere is considerable uncertainty over whether people will lsquobinge spendrsquo to release pent-up demand for goods hellip or will save as a precaution due to the uncertainty in the economy.The job market will change dramatically. ldquoPeople will have to train and retrain a number of times throughout their lives and governments will have to help make that possible.Post-pandemic unemployment will ldquocreate greater inequalities in society, mostly affecting the low skilled, those on low incomes and the young. The crisis risks ldquocreating a lsquolockdown generationrsquo with permanent scarring.The ldquofracturing of globalisation hellip could also lead to a sharp fall in demand from abroad. Governments will have to stimulate the economy by ldquoincreasing investment in infrastructure hellip such spending will, of course, have further implications for the fiscal deficit and public debt.RADICAL RECOVERYKey to MacDonaldrsquos vision of post-pandemic economics is ldquothe greening of the Scottish economy. This, he believes, ldquocould generate many new jobs in construction and energy. Climate change, says MacDonald, is the pandemicrsquos ldquotwin.ldquoLow-carbon-recovery could not only initiate the signicant emissions reduction needed to halt climate change but also create more jobs and economic growth than a high-carbon recovery would, he says.MacDonald believes building lsquosocial capitalrsquo - strong, positive connections between ordinary people - is another key to recovery. He cites the  million Britons who have volunteered to help during the pandemic.ldquoSocial capital is at least as important as human and physical capital in driving forward socio-economic progress, both in terms of GDP and of wider measures of prosperity such as wellbeing. However, the move in many western societies to inidualism has led to a dramatic breakdown hellip of social capital.MacDonald adds: ldquoWestern liberal democracies have moved from societies based on the market to a market society, where the market governs our lives, and where a good, asset or service only has valueit is in a market and can be priced hellip In such a society, values such as solidarity, fairness, responsibility and compassion get downplayed and undervalued,not totally ignored.The pandemic, however, has taught us that we can prioritise ldquohealth and wellbeing before economic efficiency. There is also increasing evidence that people ldquowould prefer to prioritise health and wellbeing and other societal values over economic growth once the crisis is over.ldquoIn going forward, MacDonald suggests, ldquothe UK and Scottish governments should not make GDP their exclusive target for the nationsrsquo overall wellbeing. Health, social care, the environment and quality of le also matter.Governments need to ldquoemphasise wellbeing creation as the ultimate goal of kick-starting productivity and growth, rather than a sole focus on wealth creation. This would be a ldquomajor reprioritisation of our society.Governments should have been better prepared for a pandemic. ldquoThe appropriate form of resilience in the public and private sectors could and should have been in place, MacDonald says, adding: ldquoAs in the case of climate change, the current epidemic did not happen by chance but as a result of mankindrsquos rapacious demand for global resources.Post-pandemic, ldquogreater resilience in our health and social care systems must be built in. The World Health Organisation should be strengthened to coordinate any response to future pandemics.HOW LIFE WILL CHANGEWith ldquothe demise of the current globalisation era, countries will seek to be more resilient and self-sufficient at home. Building resilience in agriculture could led to innovations such as ldquovertical farming.However, ldquohome bias in other countries would have ldquorepercussions for the UK and Scottish export markets.MacDonald predicts that the rise of working at home during the pandemic will alter the housing market, as well as ldquoleisure, and the retail and hospitality sectors. Home-working could also ldquoreshape how people live and work in the central belt in Scotland. This would have knock-on effects for the environment, the shape of cities, and road traffic as well as health and happiness.ldquoIf a vaccine is not discovered and there are further mutations of this virus then there may be a steady migration from cities, MacDonald suggests. This could have ldquoimportant implications for house prices both in and out of the city and could lead to reduced inequality.Similarly, the sht to shopping online, e-learning in education, and also telemedicine will alter how we live and work."},{"url":null,"title":"Country Life with Rosemary Goring  Away with the birds","story":"It seems that spending spring and early summer in lockdown has turned the country into a nation of bird lovers. Itrsquos not just in the countryside that they have become a large part of our lives, a source of ersion, fascination and even, or so I have felt, of company. Stepping outside in the morning is like entering the Usher Hall during warm-up, a discordant and energetic orchestra of flutes, pipes and trumpets. As I brush my teeth, I sometimes see Wilf, the blackbird with the silver ankle ring, by the chimney, letting the wind ruffle his feathers. He has a very keen look, and when our eyes meet, you feel you have been noted. By evening, his spot is taken by a pair of turtle doves which perch side by side on the TV aerial, well camouflaged against the dusky sky.Alan saw Wilf enjoying a bath in a puddle the other day, near his HQ, in the centre of the village. On our first social gathering in months ndash a glass of wine in a neighbourrsquos garden one warm evening ndash Wilf landed on the lawn beside us, hopping behind our chairs, and unperturbed by our friendsrsquo inquisitive dog. Clearly he considers every garden to be his private food department. Theirs is Fortnum and Mason to our Lidl.A barn owl has been seen in the village lately, out hunting before dark. The photos show a beautul, ghostly creature with a heart-shaped pale face, after which Hoolet is named. It was gliding low between trees and across the edge of rough fields. I hope it kept its distance from the blue tits, because other birdsrsquo chicks are the perfect snack for owls and their owlets. That comes as little surprise, but it wasnrsquot till recently that I learned that the woodpeckers haunting our garden might be lingering near the nestbox in hope of a tasty snack. A large one had taken up position on the gatepost, a few days ago, within earshot of the nest. Squirrels, meanwhile, are the stuff of blue titsrsquo horror movies. They have been known to gnaw away at a nestbox entrance to reach the birds inside.The charm most of us find in bird le and nature is often a rose-tinted perspective. For birds, every day is a challenge, a survival exercise tougher than anything the SAS could conceive. Often Irsquoll see the older blue tits, decidedly dishevelled, stuffing themselves on our peanut feeders as they boost their blood sugar levels ahead of another caterpillar hunt. Occasionally a scattering of feathers in the flowerbeds indicate where a cat has brought down a weary or unwary bird. The RSPB says that the avian massacre by cats ndash estimated to be over  million a year ndash is a natural winnowing, with only the weak or ill falling prey. Irsquom not convinced. It sounds like a half-truth, aimed to prevent all-out conflict between bird and feline lovers. Not that the two are mutually exclusive.Danger is all around,yoursquore small and feathered. Friends were out for a walk beyond Hoolet recently, and spotted a flock of sparrows, feeding on grass-heads. Suddenly, not six feet away from them, a sparrowhawk swooped and snatched one of the birds. The speed of the attack, and the hawkrsquos audacity, were startling.Nor was this a first sighting of this turbo-charged predator that moves at the speed of a bullet. Occasionally I catch one ing between our house and a neighbourrsquos garden. As it flashes past the kitchen window, you know this is no idle reconnaissance. From its perch high in the sycamore, it has spied something delicious. The best you can hope is that, for the creature caught in its crosswires, the end is mercully swt.With less traffic, you see far fewer birds flattened on the roads, especially pheasants, which usually seem positively eager to examine the chassis of approaching cars. Our neighbours were nevertheless worried that theyrsquod found a pegged-out pheasant among their poppies. Hearing them calling to us through the beech hedge ndash by now almost as impenetrable as the Berlin Wall ndash we hurried over to offer first-aidrequired.The glittering, fearless ndash and pea-brained  ndash beauty, which has been parading our gardens since springtime, was far from dead. It had simply settled itself into an earthy dip to enjoy the sun. This would explain the dusty hollows Irsquove been finding of late in the shrubbery, asan easter egg-sized UFO had landed. Unfazed by the humans clucking anxiously around it, the pheasant only roused itself and got to its feet when it heard us approaching on the gravel.Another frequent visitor is the young hedgehog which has taken to walking up the road to the house, around tea-time, and disappearing into the back garden. Seeing it approach, I stuck my head out of the door into the pouring rain, and noticed it has a limp. Seen from behind, it lurched on one hind leg, like a trolley with a wonky wheel. Since it was going at a lick, and obviously knew exactly where it was heading, I left it to get on with it.Itrsquos a matter of days before the blue tits will be out of their nest, and bouncing around the garden. In a second-hand bookshop last year I found a guide to making your garden more bird friendly. In a chapter on building nestboxes for dferent species, it advised that, after the breeding season, these boxes must be cleaned, to protect future broods from disease. This must be how landlords feel when the end of a tenancy is approaching. The need to disinfect is clearly universal. Unique to providers of avian accommodation, however, is the warning to brace yourselves for finding addled eggs, or the remains of chicks that failed to thrive.

His immediate task  The further easing of the lockdown in England without causing a surge in new cases.Ahead of the main act announcing something this week, Downing Street sent a warm-up man in the shape of Englandrsquos Health Secretary, Matt Hancock. On the dove-ish side of the lockdown easing debate, he was perhaps better placed than some to reassure the public that it would be safe to get back out there into pubs, restaurants, and schools.Sky Newsrsquos Ridge on Sunday was first to run the rule over the numbers with Mr Hancock. By presenter Sophy Ridgersquos reckoning, the contact tracers were only reaching two people a week.: Revolutionary vision for post-Covid ScotlandFar from being a sign of failure, said the Minister, this was a good thing. It showed there was spare capacity in the system, and that was because the number of new cases was falling.So to the much hyped app, meant to be the jewel at the centre of what the PM promised would be a ldquoworld-beating system of track and trace. With the failure of the Isle of Wight trial and still no date as to when the software will appear, the app has become a Bennettian ldquochip in the sugar, a sign of standards not being met and promises unfulfilled.Asked when the app would be ready, Mr Hancock said he was not going to put a date on it . ldquoIrsquom highly confident it will happen, said the Minister. By the time he reached The Andrew Marr Show this had become ldquoWersquoll get there with the app.Nick Robinson was standing in for Andrew Marr, whose father has died. The Today presenter was among those who deputised for the Scot after his stroke in . Robinson would have found the format much the same: start with the papers, end with a Minister, and pause in the middle for something lighter, in this case interviews with Kristen Scott Thomas, who stars in one of the Talking Heads, ldquoThe Hand of God, and Nicholas Hytner, who directs three of them.One major change Robinson could not have predicted are the by now regular slots on Marr for experts. Both Professor Sir Ian Diamond, the UKrsquos National Statistician, and Professor Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stressed that coronavirus had not gone away and there was no room for complacency.Professor Piot, described in his introduction as something of a star in the fight against viruses ndash the ldquoMick Jagger of microbes someone had called him ndash said he would be okay with a relaxation of the two metre rule as long as masks were worn in public places. He also called the quarantining of people entering the UK ldquouseless and urged the UK Government to appoint a Covid- tsar at Cabinet level.: Former FMslates blended learningIn all his answers he was as clear as day, unlike Mr Hancock who had to do the usual thankless ministerial task of talking about a subject while not giving anything away before the official announcement.In lieu of detail Mr Hancock had come bearing a new word: ldquomitigations. Besides mask wearing this appeared to include adopting the New Zealand system of asking people for contact information when they go to a pub or restaurant. Expect ldquosign here for a pint headlines in England.Robinson was not going to let Mr Hancock go without bringing up the Ministerrsquos breach of the social distancing rules, as caught on camera last week when he patted a colleague on the back in the Commons. ldquoIt was just totally natural, said Mr Hancock. ldquoThis shows how dficult social distancing is. All I can do is say Irsquom incredibly sorry for this momentary breach. Itrsquos because Irsquom human. Wersquore all human. It sounded like another headline in the making.One person determined not to make the headlines was Iain Stewart, the new Scotland Office Minister, making his first appearance on Politics Scotland.Mr Stewart, the MP for Milton Keynes South, got his job because the previous incumbent had resigned over Dominic Cummingsrsquo dash to Durham.

It was her proud claim that not one of her children left without being able to read and write. Coincidentally, it seemed that the majority of them wanted to learn, teachers and parents were respected and discipline was applied rigorously, despite the widespread poverty.I find it dficult to understand why, in our modern system of free education, more and more children seem to prefer to roam the streets, rather than apply themselves to learning the basic Rs. Interestingly, the children of immigrants seem to appreciate this more than our home-grown lot.I wonder why this would be Carol MacDonald, Troon.POLITICIANS and high-ranking civil servants behind the decision for \"blended\" schooling, aka part-time school, are largely cushioned from the consequences of their decisions: they dont have to choose between working and educating their children at home because they have jobs where they can be flexible about hours, can afford for their partners not to work full-time, can afford private tutors or to send their children to private schools whichthey are not offering full-time schooling in August will still be offering much more than state schools.But it isnt just the children of politicians and high-ranking civil servants who are protected from the consequences of their decisions about lockdown.

Itrsquos a hefty chunk of money but we have been amazed at the response, added Mr Gill.Two of the Platinum memberships, which offer letime membership, a chance to have the memberrsquos name highlighted in the clubhouse, access to an annual Platinum membersrsquo event, and a gt of a tie or scarf, were sold to people with direct links to the Brora area.One, Bernard Ledworth, who moved to Brora in , told the clubrsquos website: ldquoSince I arrived in this small remote village, I soon realised how important visitors are to the survival of the golf club.ldquoLocal membership is small and membership fees remarkably low for a course of this quality. The golf club needed to reach out to its worldwide fan base, as well as its local members, in order to get financial aid.ldquoMany golf clubs worldwide will disappear over the next few months. We could not allow Brora to be one of them.ldquoBrora committee acting quickly, as they did, has given us a fighting chance of survival ndash but much more is needed.Another, Les Steel, who has family links to the area, said he had opted to buy the pound, membership rather than putting the money in the bank or stocks and shares. ldquoIrsquove effectively paid  years of golf at once, he added.Brora was established in  as a nine hole course and was extended in  to  holes.Five times Open Champion and prolic golf course designer James Braid visited the course in  and infor just pound plus travelling expenses, submitted plans for a redesigned -hole layout.The course is regarded as particularly challenging due to the North Sea wind and its natural obstacles.President Andy Stewart said: ldquoWe were looking forward to a bumper year of visitor numbers, projected at pound,, before the COVID- pandemic halted us in our tracks in March.ldquoWith a dependence on visitor income, we have had to be creative in our thinking to drive new revenue and we have simply been overwhelmed with the love for us from across the world.ldquoI think we always knew we had members and visitors who love our links. But, when that support all comes together at once, I think it has just been incredible for all of us to realise just how well regarded the golf club is.ldquoIt really has been fantastic."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-wine-events-business-brings-tasting-home-zoom-lockdown","story":"However, for wine expert and business owner Diana Thompson the face to face approach to her wine events business was something that came to an abrupt end at the start of lockdown.Several events had been planned, including a new one, Edinburgh Uncorked, aimed at introducing people to quality but reasonable wines, which had to be postponed.But wine connoisseurs and those with a passing interest didnrsquot have long to wait before a solution was found. With pubs and bars being closed, and likely to remain shut for a little while longer, people have missed out on that social interaction having a drink together offers. Andrising wine sales in lockdown are anything to go by, then there has been a fair amount of interest surrounding the world of wine.Ms Thompson, of Edinburgh-based Wine Events Scotland, said: ldquoI just remember looking at lockdown beginning and thinking what were we going to do. The whole business was based around events and people meeting socially. I had built up the business and wanted to keep it going so I just had to come up with a way of how to actually do it.ldquoI run wine workshops once a month which can be quite informal. We pick a subject and select eight or so wines and keep it friendly. I had also been planning the first Edinburgh Uncorked in May, which was all about great wines at great prices. And even the annual FizzFeast event in November is looking like it might have to be postponed until . We had a lot to look forward to.Keen to work with small, independent producers and retailers, Ms Thompson realised there was a way to bring people together socially.She added: ldquoWe really had to think hard as to what might work. How could we do tastings in peoplersquos homes. The result is online wine tastings via Zoom, with six wines delivered in advance of the sessions, with three wines sampled as part of a tutored tasting one evening and the further three sampled the following week. We are very much about promoting responsible drinking so when people sign up there is a Tasting Kit which includes a wine saver pump and two stoppers, so that any unfinished wine can be saved.One thing the online wine tasting events have allowed is the chance to introduce international guests.Ms Thompson added: ldquoI like to bring in a guest expert and while we might have been in lockdown that has presented us with some new opportunities. We have had experts from Lebanon, Portugal and South Africa who have been able to attend the wine tasting events. We have about  people in the sessions who are all interacting which has been lovely to see.ldquoI think we have also gained a lot from the Zoom wine tastings as we have only been sampling three at a time. It means we have been able to go in to greater detail and have been able to talk more about food pairings and go into the aroma and taste profile.\"Initially, Ms Thompson thought the Zoom event might appeal to people from around Edinburgh who normally attend her regular tasting events, but the online tastings are bringing wine lovers together from as far afield as Cornwall and the Scottish Highlands. She has even been askedshe will continue with the online tastings after lockdown ends.The new approach to the business has also been a novel way of bringing families together.Ms Thompson added: ldquoWe have a family who make the virtual tastings a way to come together. We have siblings who live in dferent parts of the UK and havenrsquot been able to travel to see one another in lockdown so have met online and made the tastings a way of keeping in touch.While it might be sometime before all restrictions are ease and businesses canto normal, Ms Thompson said the virtual aspect of wine tastings events has opened it up to a dferent audience.ldquoThis is something which started out of necessity, but it has meant the events have been far more accessible. We have reached people who might not have been able to come to the events. Often one person has to drive, or you might live or work remotely so this has allowed us to welcome in a new audience."},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-mark-smith-agree-nicola---scots-looking-history-identity-wrong-way","story":"Nicola Sturgeon touched on whatrsquos causing the issue the other day when she was asked whether black history should be included in the school curriculum. Yes it should, she said, because children need to have a better understanding of their identity and where they come from and Scotlandrsquos history, good and bad. ldquoAnd when it comes to colonialism and slavery, she said, ldquothere are aspects of Scotlandrsquos history that are pretty shameful and we have to be prepared to face up to that.I agree with Nicola. I also agree with the historian Tom Devine ndash who would dare do anything   ndash when he too said last week that Scots have failed to face up to their involvement in the slave trade and I agree with him about the reason for it: the Scottish sense of victimhood. ldquoIt is very dficult for a people who see themselves as victims, said Sir Tom, ldquoto accept that in their history they had also been oppressors.:Mark Smith: Staff are refusing to work on JK Rowlingrsquos new book because of her trans comments. Good on themBut this is where it gets complicated. Most of us would probably agree that a consensus is building that Scots need to do more to acknowledge and disseminate the fact that we were deeply involved in colonialism and slavery. Indeed, in his  book The Scottish Nation, Tom Devine goes further: not only were Scots involved in imperialism, the Scottish missionaries that were to the fore in Africa, India, and where gave it a moral imperative. In other words, not only were we up to our oxters in it, we convinced everyone that building a British empire was the right and moral thing to do Godrsquos work.The question is though: to what extent is a sense of victimhood, and a denial of the true picture, still a problem  Sir Tom believes things started to change in the s and that a greater interest in Scottishness led to a greater willingness by Scots to accept their past, but Irsquom inclined to agree with Nicola Sturgeon that the problem hasnrsquot really gone away and that therersquos more to do in facing up to the shameful parts of our past. Ms Sturgeon was talking about schools, but it doesnrsquot end there: therersquos politics, popular culture, social media, everywhere.And thatrsquos the problem with the tendency to turn away from the more shameful bits of history and see ourselves as victims ndash ones who suffer rather than ones who inflict suffering ndash because itrsquos pretty much there wherever you look. Many of our most celebrated historical figures are icons of suffering ndash Mary Queen of Scots in particular ndash but Irsquom afraid you can also see the same narrative in  in the way some nationalists argue for independence: we must be free, they say, because under the English we are suffering.This mentality of suffering is also particularly prevalent in the way Scots see conflict ndash a point well explained in a recent Zoom chat I sat in on involving some of the historians who belong to the Scots at War Living History Society. One of the great myths about the First World War, they said, is that Scots suffered more per capita than other parts of the UK and that the infantrymen who were sent over as canon fodder were disproportionately Scottish.:Mark Smith: What the row over Glasgows war memorials tells us about ourselvesNone of itrsquos true. Scots werenrsquot just infantrymen being sent over the top by English toffs, they were officers and doctors and they didnrsquot just serve in Scottish regiments. There were also Scots in the general staff and, of course, the man who was running the whole thing, Douglas Haig, was a Scot, the point being that there were Scots at the top of the British Army and at the top of British society and British government and theyrsquore still there today.Getting more Scots to accept this point is not going to be easy though, as one of the historians who took part in the Zoom call, James Taub, pointed out. When people have identied with a message all their lives, he said, theyrsquore going to be reluctant to change. Whatrsquos more, as Mr Taub said, much of the modern Scottish identity comes out of our perception of important historical events and the idea that Scots suffered more. History isnrsquot just who we were, itrsquos who we are, and thatrsquos true even when wersquove got the history wrong.Which leaves us with the dficult job of putting it right. Nicola Sturgeon is unlikely to agree that the tendency to see ourselves as victims rather than oppressors feeds into the way some nationalists frame the case for independence. But the First Minister does seem to be suggesting that wersquove been getting it wrong in the way we educate children about some of our history. In supporting the inclusion of black history in the curriculum, she also seems to be suggesting children need to know more about the role Scotland played in the oppression of colonialism and thatrsquos undoubtedly a good idea.:Mark Smith: Cruel and unjustied: the legal case against the Scottish Government that you might not have heard aboutHowever, it needs to go further than that because wersquore all guilty of telling the same, wrong story. We do it when we talk about English imperialists and donrsquot talk about Scottish ones. We do it when we talk about our lonely imprisoned queens and not our brutal warrior kings. And we do it when we talk about Scottish infantrymen on the Western Front and not the Scottish officers who were running the war.And we do it too, Irsquom afraid, when we talk today about Scots suffering in the shackles of the UK. The idea, I suppose, is that Scots have suffered disproportionately in the past and that wersquore still suffering now and in some ways, the story is understandable ndash the role of victim is better than the role of oppressor. But the truth is we have always been both and itrsquos time for what Nicola Sturgeon says she wants: a proper understanding of history, the story of the good and the bad, the story of who we were and who we are.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Wersquove seen huge increases in families claiming social security support, piling financial pressures on families who can least afford it. Parents are struggling to make ends meet and are already cutting back on food and essentials,\" she said.\"As the job retention scheme tapers off, we fear further unemployment and hardship ahead. Social security should be an anchor in stormy times, putting more money in familiesrsquo pockets.\"It comes as research by Save the Children and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation found that seven in ten of Scotlands poorest families have had to cut back on food and other essentials while half have had to borrow money to get through the coronavirus lockdown.More than half of families on Universal Credit or Child Tax Credit in Scotland have been pushed to borrow money since start of crisis ndash with many relying on expensive forms of credit.Ms Telfer added that they are calling on the UK Government to provide a leline for children by increasing the child element of Universal Credit and Child Tax Credits by pound per week. They are also calling on the Scottish Government and councils to provide a \"dignied, cash-first approach\" to free school meals over the summer holidays.Across Scotland the claimant count has soared by % from , to ,.Eastwood, which had the lowest levels of unemployment on the Scottish mainland saw numbers rise by two-and-three-quarters- the third highest of all  constituencies.The analysis also reveals that the region with the smallest rise in claimants at just .% is an area with already high levels of unemployment - Greenock and Inverclyde. In , the Inverclyde council area was rated as the most deprived in Scotland by the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation , with Greenock Town Centre the most deprived community.And there is an east-west ide in terms of the effect of Covid- unemployment, with the six Edinburgh constituencies seeing a rise in claimants typically running at two-and-a-half times over the three months - about half the rate in Glasgow which has seen a % increase.Dave Moxham, deputy general secretary of the Scottish Trades Union Congress said it feared a disproportionate unemployment hit to fall on young people going forward with the October end of the furlough scheme presenting a \"clf edge\" with government either forced to accept very high employment or to act to invest in jobs.ldquoThe spike in unemployment and the impending furlough clf edge underline the fragility of the Scottish economy with its high reliance on the service sector. The coronavirus crisis has been layered on to an economic system that wasnrsquot working. Large parts of Scotland have never recovered from industrial decline, relying on out-of-town shopping centres to inflate a local economy built on consumer debt, while other parts are dependent on the low-waged tourism and hospitality sector which is unlikely to recover anytime soon.\"Liz Cameron , chief executive of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce said that to prevent mass unemployment, support needs to be aimed at sectors such as renewable energy where there can be growth.She said the UK should align unemployment benefits to reskilling and retraining focused on sectors such as decarbonisation, green energy, manufacturing and digital which is expected to show growth going forward.\"There is no easy fix, but we need to remain focussed, party politics aside, to tackle the global economic and jobs crisis we face,\" she said.\"Scotlandrsquos economy has proven particularly vulnerable to the effects of the pandemic. This is in part due to Scotlandrsquos heavy reliance in certain sectors, for example tourism and our independent retail and hospitality businesses in particular. They were the first to close down and are at the end of the road map to be able to restart completely.ldquoWe have already seen major employers such as Rolls Royce and several major hoteliers forced to enter discussions on redundancy which will inevitably mean even more job losses.ldquoThis situation has been partly shielded by the financial support provided to businesses through the UK Governmentrsquos Jobs Retention Scheme. With this financial support being reduced and finally withdrawn, businesses being unable to trade, earning no income to pay wages, there is no viable alternative. The unemployment situation in Scotland is also compounded by the fact that we tend to lag behind other parts of the UK in terms of economic performance even before the pandemic.ldquoWe also need quick solutions targeted in the right areas to support those graduates and school leavers who are just entering the employment market. We will need to roll-out retraining and upskilling modules that are quick and agile that match up with the needs of Scotlandrsquos economic sectors. Only by aligning our workforce and the needs of the economy will we be able to help large numbers of iniduals to keep their jobs and secure new ones. Anything less will do permanent damage to the economy and to our skills base. \"Last week it emerged that Scotlands unemployment rate was now the highest among all the UK nations.The Office for National Statisticssaid unemployment in Scotland for people over  was .%, compared with a UK rate of .%.Unemployment rose by rose by , to , between February and April as lockdown hit the labour market.And ministers said the figures were a clear indication of the challenge facing Scotland as a result of the pandemic.Scotlands unemployment rate went up from .% in the previous quarter.Meanwhile the latest figures show Englands rate now stands at .%, Wales is at % and Northern Ireland is at .%.The figures only captured the first five weeks of lockdown.AScottishGovernment spokesman said: \"We know the scale of the challenge facingScotland as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and understand that many people will be feeling a deep sense of anxiety about their livelihoods.

from NHS Greater Glasgow andClyde found thatthe most likely explanation for the high proportion ofdeaths in Scotlands coronavirus capital was due to the pandemic taking hold earlier in Inverclyde compared to where in Scotland.The report ruled out chronic levels of urban deprivation and higher than average elderly population figuresas to why fatalities in the area were signicantly abovethe national average.:Scotlands Covid Capital Inverclyde has five times as many deaths as New ZealandThe study mdash which included input from Inverclyde Council, Inverclyde HSCP, Public Health Scotland and National Records of Scotland mdash examined a range of hypotheses regarding age, deprivation and an earlier date of sustained transmission and applied dferent tests to data collected during the pandemic.Louise Long, chief officer of Inverclyde Health  Social Care Partnership , said: \"It seems unlikely that age, sex and deprivation explain the pattern of COVID- deaths in Inverclyde in comparison with NHS GGC.\"Report authors John ODowd, NHS GGC clinical director, and John Burton, public health information manager, saidthat it appeared thatInverclyde was just unlucky early on in the health emergency adding thatsocio-economic deprivation has a profound effect on COVID- related illness and death.The report read: \"It can be seen that both hospitalisations and deaths from COVID- are signicantly higher in those living in the poorest circumstances in comparison with those in the most affluent areas.\"\"This analysis is challenging to perform at a partnership level due to the smaller numbers involved.\"Mr ODowd and Mr Burton state: \"In the early part of the pandemic, the SMR [standardised mortality ratio] for Inverclyde is far higher than that of NHS GGC but the dference at this point was not statistically signicant in comparison with NHS GGC rates.\"We can therefore see that with standardisation for age, sex and deprivation, whilst a higher mortality rate remains, the dference may have arisen by chance.\"Thereport into Covid- deaths in Inverclyde reveals that the weekly death rate peaked in the week beginning April , with  people losing their lives.A total of  people have died in the area as a result ofcoronavirus.Analysis of all available information for the report shows that there was an earlier rise in Inverclyde compared with other areas.The report reads: \"It is considered likely that the rates were much higher than recorded due to testing criteria and availability early in the pandemic.\":Coronavirus: How Inverclyde became the worst-hit area in Scotland\"There is some evidence that the COVID- positive testing rate was higher in Inverclyde than in other areas.\"The report adds: \"The most likely scenario which explains the excess deaths in Inverclyde is that the pandemic took hold earlier in Inverclyde in comparison with other areas of Scotland and NHS GGC.\"This fits with the higher positive rates of COVID- testing in Inverclyde, and with the higher admission rates of patients with COVID- in Inverclyde.\"This most likely reflects the early nature of the pandemic experience in Inverclyde, and a greater propensity to admit cases where there was no experience of their clinical needs at an early stage of the pandemic.\"There is no evidence that the quality of care or access to care was worse in Inverclyde, as the admission rates were higher than across the rest of NHS GGC, and there was no dference in the death rates from those in Inverclyde admitted with COVID- in comparison with NHS GGC as a

A storm in  showed something strange in the sand at the Bay of Skaill and the Laird, William Graham Watt, went on to excavate part of a , year old village. After reading the original reports, I now know that this isn’t true. The real story is more interesting.The Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, has three papers on Skara Brae. The first was by Samuel Laing, who visited the site in autumn .“Two chambers have been completely excavated, together with the passage and parts of the entrances to other chambers by Mr William Watt, a relative of William Watt, Esq of Breckness, residing at Skaill, to whose zeal the scientic world is indebted for the discovery and exhumation of this interesting relic of antiquity.#When I saw the credit being given to a relative of William Watt Esq, rather than the man himself, I remembered my father, Peter Leith, telling me that his father, also Peter, had told him that a dferent William Watt, known as Black Willie, had been the man responsible.In the  Census, I found the Laird living at Skaill, aged , with a son William, aged . His son and heir, William WG Watt was  and living at Kierfiold, so there were two sons called William.In James Irvine’s  book, ‘The Breckness Estate’, I read that William G Watt had a natural son, William, who in  was given £ a year and free board, “so long as he chose to remain a clerk in the house.”The story then turned into a neat circle. I followed up a reference in the book and found it was an Orkney Herald article written by my grandfather. It was about Hugh Miller’s book ‘Rambles of a Geologist’, in which Miller recorded his visit to Orkney in .My grandfather had written: “Another interesting person, who has already been mentioned, was William Watt of Skaill. This was not, as some readers may suppose, the laird of Skaill, but a distant relative who made his home there. He was well-known to everybody as “Black Willie” from his dark hair and complexion. Like Miller, he was a self-taught geologist, he always carried a little bag with a hammer and chisel to dig out any fossils he came across. He brought some of his more interesting specimens for Hugh Miller’s inspection and they had an interesting discussion. When Skarabrae was first dug into in the ’s, it is certain that Black Willie took an active part in the work and saw to it that anything found was safely preserved.”I looked up the references to William Watt in the book and found that Hugh Miller had come with a letter of introduction to him and described him both as an intelligent geologist and an intelligent palaeontologist. He showed Watt, along with Dr Garson of Stromness, where his famous discovery, the Astrolepsis fossil, lay.To read about the second and third papers on Skara Brae and what Patricia found out, see page  of this week#s edition of The Orcadian.Patricia Long is a tourist guide based in Stenness with a strong interest in social history.

The financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here are two examples of how companies have been helped, and what support is available.Source: Her Majesty’s TreasuryAn unprecedented package of UK Government financial support has helped firms like Q-Mass in East Kilbride weather the coronavirus crisis. Director Ronnie Robertson said lockdown hit his company’s order book, but the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been vital to help them hang on to their valued staff.Ronnie said: “Before this, we had quite a good order book, with three to four months of work planned, so we were pretty worried where it was going to take us.” At first, he was worried how he would keep Q-Mass’  staff on the payroll, but then the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme was announced.It offers UK Government support to pay  per cent of staff’s wages up to £, a month, and the scheme has now been extended until the end of October.Q-Mass manufactures bespoke parts for the oil, gas and defence industry so staff training is important. Ronnie said: “Our staff are very highly skilled. We’ve gathered a bunch of people here and trained them up and taken on apprentices. We do a lot of training, we’ve got good people, we train them a lot and we want to hang on to them.”He found applying for the furlough scheme quick and straightforward. He said: “It was surprisingly easy and we were surprised that the money came through relatively quickly.”Now staff at the firm who’ve been furloughed are gradually ing to work, with strict safety measures in place. Ronnie said: “We’ve put a day sht back on and we’ve still got a few office people working at home, with quite a few still on furlough.And because of the size of the building, maintaining a two-metre distance hasn’t been a problem for ing staff.“The workshop’s a big, wide open space and we have to keep cleaning things like photocopiers and touch screens, but it’s been quite straightforward.”Now Ronnie’s looking forward to a brighter future. He said: “I feel like we’re on the side of the valley and we’re looking across to the other side and it looks absolutely fantastic. Getting through the next few months is crucial for us. We have a really good bunch of people and we want to hang on to them. The furlough scheme has helped us to do that.” vw, px\"  Planning, forward thinking and invaluable help from the UK Government has enabled a Northern Ireland firm to ersy and remain solvent. When Covid- struck, Newtownards baby product manufacturer Shnuggle’s owners Sinead and Adam Murphy were prepared thanks to advice from their export colleagues in China.Sinead said: “We reduced our out-goings, put on pause our marketing spend in the business. We just tried to protect the cash that we had.“The first impact was our customers that we sell to in Asia. They all went into lockdown so our orders and sales to them stopped. But also a lot of our production happens out in Asia so our factories went into lockdown.“Luckily we had bought a lot of stock beforehand. We were so relieved that we had, at least we could carry on trading with our UK and European customers.” With around half of the company’s sales in the UK and Ireland and half in the export business, Shnuggle had to rely on their local retail-base.Sinead continued: “Baby items were classed as essential goods which was a huge relief to us. This meant as long as we could socially distance within the warehouse we could continue trading and selling online.“All of our business is supplying other retailers like John Lewis, Mamas and Papas, Amazon. But our online sales actually grew because everyone was at home and maybe an element of panic buying.”Shnuggle took advantage of the furlough and Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Schemeschemes.Sinead said: “We furloughed five out of our  team, and were able to access the Business Interruption loan through Ulster Bank.“That was our biggest headache and stress, we owed signicant amounts of money to them and we didn’t have the cash as we needed time to sell our products.”Shnuggle also received a £, Small Business Grant.Adam said: “Furloughing was brilliant, and the CBILS was the one that was the best for us because it meant that we could keep all our suppliers happy.“So even though we had a temporary dip in our sales, and obviously the inventory was sitting there ready to sell, it just kept us solvent and the cash flow moving.” vw, px\"  Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers.

He has been so passionate about this issue but gone about attempting to bring change in a highly commendable manner. “He is a credit to his family and his club and we at STATSports SuperCupNI are privileged that he is one of our tournament graduates who has gone on to achieve greatness in his football career and also through his campaigning for something in which he believes so fervently. “Hopefully he will continue to be an inspiration to all of us.” Rashford has raised about poundm to supply around three million meals to vulnerable people while working with charity FareShare UK during the coronavirus lockdown.

The February Dail election saw signicant gains for the Green Party throughout Ireland as people voted for transformative change - a fairer society and a serious effort to tackle climate breakdown. Intensive negotiations aimed at forming a coalition government involving multiple parties followed. A draft programme for government is now on the table and it was negotiated in good faith by a very committed group of TDs.However, I am voting no on this offer of government. I believe that a better deal is possible, one which can deliver a just transition to a fairer society and a low carbon economy. Across these islands we face the huge task of recovering from the Covid- crisis. The frailties of our economic system, built on fossil-fuelled over consumption, have been laid bare. The challenge is to build back better and deal with climate crisis and Covid- concurrently. Emerging data shows that the poorest in our society have borne the brunt of Covid- and we know that climate breakdown is an emergency for all, especially those facing economic hardship. That#s why governments across these islands must prioritise our most vulnerable and lay the foundations for just and sustainable societies. Unfortunately, the draft programme for government fails to do that and reverts back to fiscal conservatism. It imposes regressive taxation through carbon and sugar taxes while maintaining the status quo on corporation tax and the top rate of income tax. Transformative change was called for by the Irish electorate this year and there is growing recognition of the need to build back better. Along with a signicant number of Green Party members and elected representatives from across this island, I believe that a better deal is possible. It#s time for the parties that promised positive change earlier this year to step up and deliver.

The Center for Vaccine Research at the university - renowned as the home base of Dr Jonas Salk, the father of polio immunisation - is using the measles vaccine as its . Most of those on the fast track to trials are based on biotechnology, which has never been tried before.But the Pittsburgh team is grafting genetic fragments of SARS-CoV- into the existing measles vaccine, a product which has proven to be safe and effective for hundreds of millions of people for decades.Platform-based vaccines have great promise - for example, one has been licensed to protect against Ebola and the Oxford group is working on a iation of that approach, the Northern Ireland scientist said. Genomes are combined to create a recombitant, or genetically modied virus, which should allow antibodies to be generated by immune cells. The Pittsburgh team is already testing their candidate vaccine in animals to seeit leads to the generation of antibodies andit protects from Covid- disease. This will be followed by small scale, then midsize and finally large-number human trials. Safety is paramount in this process, Dr Duprex said.Many teams are racing towards large-scale human trials, the ersity of approaches they are taking is stunning and is a testament to the creative, basic science being undertaken all across the world by virologists and vaccinologists trained for this moment in history, the scientist said.Five were named as part of #Operation Warp Speed# to develop a vaccine by early next year. They are the US Government#s preferred candidates and will receive extra federal funding and resources.AstraZeneca, which is working with Oxford University, and Boston-based Moderna will be among the first to carry out mass trials this summer. The latter is based on biotechnology. In total, there are currently  vaccine trials, with  in human testing, mostly in the US, Europe, India and China.Immunologist and deputy editor of the journal Science Advances, Dr Douglas J. Green, has said that bypassing any essential clinical trial stages for any vaccine could be catastrophic. He argues scientists must weigh up these risks against the potential benefits, according to a report in the Medical News Today.Dr Duprex agrees that moving too fast throws up potential pitfalls, but that the idea now is to move quickly to test things to failure. We will need more than one vaccine - multiple vaccines - and that is why it is important to have lots of runners, he said. Competition is a good thing, it drives innovation. There will be someone gets a vaccine, but it is not going to be one. The vast amounts of money being thrown at private companies, particularly by the US Government, is prompting questions over whether any should profit. It is perfectly reasonable for taxpayers to ask whether these vaccines will be provided at cost when so much of their money is being spent, and that any should be available throughout the developing world, said Dr Duprex.He noted also that work on producing vaccines for SARS- and MERS largely halted when those viruses were brought under control, essentially because there was no immediate profit motive. Yetwork had continued, and successful vaccines developed, they would have been invaluable as s to develop one for Covid-, Dr Duprex said.That was a big mistake and one that cannot be made again, particularly as another coronavirus, maybe even more deadly, is likely to emerge in the future, the scientist said.While there are favoured candidates, Dr Duprex said that is not stopping others from working just as hard, and trying to find funding where. A consortium that included the Pittsburgh centre, Themis and the Institut Pasteur received  million from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations , which was founded by the governments of Norway and India, the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation, the Wellcome Trust, and the World Economic Forum.

His plight is not helped by the fact that he has become the first player within the sport to test positive for the virus.His loss would certainly be felt by the Essendon club, given the fact that last year he proved a shining light at half-back in what was to prove nothing more than a moderate season for his team.Having initially honed his skills with his GAA club in Eglish, McKenna had come to the attention of AFL scouts and subsequently Tyrone manager Mickey Harte had suggested that he might like to remain at home for longer and bid to become a regular in his Red Hands side.But the opportunity to achieve new status on the other side of the world was to prove too good to resist, although the prodigiously-talented McKenna has made no secret of the homesickness from which he has suffered during his involvement to date in the AFL.The fact that his sister Kerri lived quite close to him and that his brother Ryan came to stay with him eased his burden in this connection. It allowed him to highlight the many-sided skills he boasts - and for which Essendon have been grateful.Now, though, he may be confronted by a big decision regarding his future in what is proving an unprecedented yet in some respects turbulent sporting year on several fronts to date.Should he be served with a y ban by the AFL, McKenna might well wish to reconsider his future, which could see him make ato Eglish, while on the other hand Essendon may be unwilling to lose his many-sided talents.He has previously served an AFL ban after having pleaded guilty to biting an opponent.Belfast Most ReadBobby Storey: Hated by the RUC, Sinn Fein figure was the hardest of IRA hardmenUVF gang in -hour terror rampageMankilled and six young people injured in Killyleagh crashLoyalist hits out at East Belfast mob #torturing the Protestant people#Senior Belfast republican Bobby Storey dies,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I grew alpines, achillea, helichrysum and physalis.I was also into exotic dried flowers and went to a local florist shop every week to buy blooms, like proteas.When he was , Will started working in Jim Bell#s florist on Broughshane Street in the Co Antrim town every Saturday, wiring and mossing wreaths and spending all the money he earned on seeds.From there, Will developed a keen interest in art and photography and at the age of  moved to London to study for a BAdegree in Fine Art at Central St Martins.Two years later Will was working in department stores Selfridges and Harvey Nichols for internationally acclaimed florist Jane Packer, who had provided the flowers for Sarah Ferguson#s wedding to Prince Andrew in July .The royal connections don#t stop there as Will later moved to Moyses Stevens in Cha#s Sloane Square, which held the Royal Warrant for the late Queen Mother and currently for the Prince of Wales.Among those who regularly graced the store were the future Duchess of Cambridge and Princess Beatrice.Because we were based at the back door of Peter Jones department store we would have had a lot of celebrity clients like Courtney Love, Brian May, Claudia Schfer and Lulu.Kate Middleton used to come in to buy hyacinths and I always found her to be very polite, Will recalls.The last occasion she came in was in  just before her engagement to William was announced and there were about  paparazzi outside waiting for her.Beatrice also came in to buy peonies and was very nice and friendly.We would have provided flowers for Prince Charles, usually wreaths from him for memorial services.A letter would arrive to us on a motorbike from Clarence House and then we would send the flowers out.After five years at Moyses Stevens, Will moved to McQueens and was initially based in the headquarters at Clerkenwell, prior to moving to manage the team of florists based at Claridge#s Hotel.We would have got requests for bouquets in a particular colour or specic type of flowers from VIP guests so I#d have to contact one of our suppliers to source them, Will said.It could be very stressful at times and involve long hours - especiallyyou were told that someone like Madonna was coming the next day and needed a certain type of lily in one of the suites or penthouses that would then have to be found.One of the highlights was having to build a tree with red roses hanging on it inside the hotel#s French Salon for a wedding, while Christmas was always a big undertaking.After  years in London, Will ed to Ballymena two years ago to support his father John who had been battling bowel cancer.Now at the age of  he#s left the hustle and bustle of big city le behind and is back on Broughshane Street where he recently opened his new business, Le Jardin Sauvage .This building had been lying empty for five years and after passing it one day I thought it would make for a marvellous greenhouse as it#s all glass, Will said.Will was all set to open just before the Covid- lockdown and had great plans to provide flowers for the upcoming wedding season until many marriage ceremonies were postponed.He adds: Instead I turned my attention to tropical house plants which has paid off as a lot of people seem to want good quality orchids and unusual hanging plants which are all fashionable again.The focus now is all about more green and plants that were popular back in the s like ivy and air and spider plants.I spent the lockdown getting the place all cleaned up and filled with plants with my two parrots, Onslow and Sammy, for company.While it has been a challenge opening at this particular time, I#m very optimistic as I have a great passion for what I do and I#m bringing a bit of London back to where it all began.

But, for now, all that has stopped.Fans of the local game have been left scratching their heads wondering what to do with their Saturday afternoons since the game came to a halt in March due to Covid-, never mind trying to wrap their minds around the proposals to bring back the action. Whether the club you love often basks in the glory of lting the Gibson or Irish Cups, or you trod home thinking what might have been, the Irish League is like no other in terms of the friendships forged on those Saturday afternoons.Certainly, some of the best memories this reporter has made in his  years is sharing Glenavon#s Irish Cup wins in ,  and  with his family. Who knowsthe Irish Cup will finish at all this season, but fans will not be able to share that special cup-winning feeling with the players, their friends and their families.Four Irish League fans who miss their weekend football fix spoke to the Belfast , looking back at those Saturday afternoons that feel so long ago and discussed what they are doing now to try and fill that void.Cltonville supporter Brian Smyth , Glentoran man David Kerr , Newry City fanatic Laura Hillenand Lurgan Blues fan Michael Scottwere all in agreement - it is not just the football, but the social aspect of our local game that has been missed over the last three months.Brian, a Green Party councillor in Belfast, described following his beloved Reds as an outlet and misses the unique quirks of the Irish League.If you#re invested in it, it#s family, he said. Your family is a bit of a melt sometimes, but that#s what the Irish League is, it#s your family.You miss it. You miss the characters and there is a social aspect to the Irish League. We don#t go there for sexy football. Sexy football comes along once in a generation for most teams, like Cltonville from  to  with Liam Boyce and Joe Gormley.You go along because it#s an extension of your family and you#re invested in it and you love it.I#ve been keeping myself busy with my council stuff, but I miss football. I#m a Manchester United man as well and a mate of mine said that the matches are back, but football isn#t, as the fans aren#t there.Michael was forced to watch old football fixtures on TV and YouTube at the beginning of lockdown.Like all those dedicated to following their team home and away every Saturday afternoon Michael, who is the editor of the Ulster Gazette in Armagh, has been totally knocked out of his weekend routine. I found that really, really hard. I missed that routine of getting up on a Saturday, going to the match, seeing my mates, have the craic, maybe stay on for a wee while afterwards and then come home, he said.I#ve been going out for a walk on Saturday afternoons, and like everybody  I ended up painting the fence. There was wee jobs in the house you end up doing.I miss meeting up with my mates. Saturday would be the day I would see a lot of people that I hang about with.You do miss that and obviously going to match might lead to staying on and getting a couple of pints or going round to a mate#s house for a pizza or a bite to eat. My routine on a Saturday now is basically get up and sit in a dferent room to the one I work in.Meanwhile, David#s Saturday afternoons at The Oval consisted of working with Glentoran#s media team, but all that has changed since Covid- struck.Focusing on nostalgic periods in the Glens# history during lockdown, David has been trying to bring a bit of Irish League football back into people#s lives through the club#s social media channels.You don#t have that usual routine of getting up, seeing what your mates and family are doing and heading to the ground, he explained.It#s the wee things you miss. I drive down and see that green mecca of mine that#s The Oval, so you miss that. You miss the smells, the taste of the burger and maybe getting a drink after the game.I think whether you#re a fan of Warrenpoint, Institute, Linfield, Glenavon, Cltonville or whoever, you all still have that same social side and I think that#s a massive part that everybody is missing and can#t wait to get back to.My job is trying to bring people closer to the club and Irish League football, so I guess I miss going out and speaking to people to create content.David added that no matter what your day job is, everyone who attends the game is the same when the referee blows the whistle at pm.Newry City#s Press officer Laura has even started supporting Hertha Berlin with their blue and white striped kit after the Bundesliga was the first major league toto screens.Her weekly routine consisted of attending committee meetings on Mondays, watching the players train on Tuesday, the under- games on Friday and seeing the first team play in the Championship on a Saturday.Going from that to nothing at all has been particularly tough.I would go to the matches with my sister and my daddy, she said. We all support Newry, so you#re getting to spend time with your family as well. My mummy is sick of the sight of us.Supporting local football is a great way to be part of the community and make friends.A large amount of our support would be the older generation and aren#t into social media, so without face-to-face contact they have no link to the club, so I#m sure as hard as it is for me, it#s harder for them.During this break we have launched a #KeepYourHeadUp campaign, getting videos from people from all over the sporting community - even a referee - to promote positive mental health and to keep your head up until we are back together again. Hopefully that#s sooner rather than later.Irish League football can generate a lot of negativity, mainly from those who don#t watch the local game, be it through the perceived quality of football or attendances, but Brian feels that is what makes our league.You even miss the games where there#s just  fans or less, he added. You can hear everything and the stuff coming out of people, which can be slightly outrageous, but it#s in your head for the rest of the week and it gets you through.I#m missing the routine, I#m missing the familiarity and I#m missing the social aspect. I think my we would prefer me going to watch a match.It is now up to the powers that be to get the ball rolling again, whenever that may be...

I also believe that a better deal is possible, one that will bring positive change and a just transition to a fairer society and low carbon economy. That#s why I#m voting no to this programme for government.Ms Bailey had originally abstained from a vote among the Green parliamentary team last week, but has now added her name to a statement opposing the chance to enter a coalition.The statement reads: As Green Party elected representatives and members from across this island, we believe that this draft programme for government represents an unjust recovery. That#s why we will vote no on this draft programme for government.This offer of government represents one of the most fiscally conservative arrangements in a generation. Regressive taxation in the form of carbon and sugar taxes are included, while corporation tax and the top rate of income tax remain unchanged.It#s a deal that was negotiated in good faith but fails to deliver on our promise to tackle homelessness and provide better healthcare. It sets out an inadequate and vague pathway towards climate action.A better deal is possible - voting no on this programme for government is a step towards securing that better deal.Transformative change was called for by the electorate earlier this year. That call must be answered by not only the Green Party, but every party that promised positive change.Writing in this paper, Ms Bailey said the deal did not deliver a just transition to a fairer society and a low carbon economy and called for parties that had promised change earlier this year to step up and deliver. Belfast councillors Anthony Flynn and Brian Smyth also voiced their opposition.Mr Flynn said: I spoke about the lack of action on tackling cruel and inhumane greyhound industry in RoI as well as hare coursing and other animal welfare issues, Brexit and austerity. I cannot support an unjust transition, we can do better.Mr Smyth added: Climate justice and social justice are one. As a qualied youth worker I can#t support something that reduces the opportunity of young people. Green politics should be that hand reaching into the darkness to bring those up into the light and to deliver a fairer society.Of the three possible coalition partners, the Greens require the biggest endorsement from their membership to proceed.At least two-thirds of members registered to vote must back the deal ahead of next Friday.Here, only  out of an estimated  party members have registered to vote.Mr Ryan said he believed it was possible to address the climate and bioersity crisis in government, while also addressing issues such as housing and health.He admitted the deal was not perfect, but he said it was important to get the best deal for the country and not just for the party.Mr Ryan also warned uncertainty would followthe coalition deal was not passed.Belfast Most ReadBobby Storey: Hated by the RUC, Sinn Fein figure was the hardest of IRA hardmenUVF gang in -hour terror rampageMankilled and six young people injured in Killyleagh crashSenior Belfast republican Bobby Storey diesLoyalist hits out at East Belfast mob #torturing the Protestant people#,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Carried high by his brothers, Detective Garda Colm Horkan made his final journey through the streets of his home town to the church where he was baptised over  years ago.

As his coffin entered the doors of the church Ave Maria echoed around the church grounds and up and down the streets.Read More Colm Horkan: Country observes minute#s silence to honour police officer killed in line of dutySupt Goretti Sheridan, Colm#s superintendent in Castlerea, broke the suffocating silence. Stepping slowly to the altar, she announced a nationwide minute#s silence to remember Colm and his sacrice. Welcoming everyone, chief celebrant of the Mass and Charlestown parish priest, Monsignor Tommy Johnston, described Colm as someone who was deeply loved. He added simply Colm Horkan was a man of goodness. In his homily Monsignor Johnston described the collective shock of Colm#s death and explained how he came to hear about the tragedy. The gunshots that rang out in the early hours of Thursday morning echoed not just in the town of Castlerea but right across the country, spreading a story of tragedy and sadness and the loss of le of a Detective Garda, he said.Commissioner Drew Harris said he felt immense sadness but also a great privilege to be asked to speak in tribute to Colm. Detective Garda Colm Horkan epitomised what all of us as members of An Garda Siochana should strive to be, he said.He was approachable, well-known and respected in his local community and also in Castlerea. His policing service was characterised by his hard work and his diligence.As the Mass drew to a close Colm#s brother Brendan paid an emotional tribute to his brother. He had all the values you would associate with a good and decent human being. He was kind, considerate, selfless and, above all, loyal to the core, he said.Colm commanded respect wherever he went, time spent in his company was precious, and there was always a laugh and a joke to be had with that disarming, beaming smile of his lightening up a room and brightening up many a dark hour and day. He loved le and lived in the best way he knew how.Belfast Most ReadBobby Storey: Hated by the RUC, Sinn Fein figure was the hardest of IRA hardmenUVF gang in -hour terror rampageMankilled and six young people injured in Killyleagh crashSenior Belfast republican Bobby Storey diesLoyalist hits out at East Belfast mob #torturing the Protestant people#,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Publicans in Derry who took a ‘massive’ financial hit by closing ahead of St Patrick’s Day in the interest of public safety have encouraged the public to ‘support their local’ once they reopen. Northern Irelands hotels, bars, restaurants and cafes can reopen from July . William McGuinness and his business partner Phil Nolan own Paedar O’Donnells, The Gweedore and Fty Seven nightclub on Waterloo Street. Before the government issued any formal directive for businesses to shut, Paedar’s led the way by announcing that it was closing its doors on March . googletag.cmd.push It came two days before the busiest date on the calendar for Irish bars, St Patrick’s Day. “It was a matter of conscience for us,” Mr McGuinness said, “the general feeling at the time was that the NHS was going to be under pressure and we thought St Patrick’s Day would have been a petri dish for infection and we didn’t want to be responsible for that.” Boris Johnson’s order for all non-essential businesses would come over a week later on March . Derry City and Strabane has the second lowest COVID- death rate of every council area in the country and just  positive Coronavirus cases to date – also the second lowest in the country. googletag.cmd.push Chair of the British Medical Association in NI, Derry doctor Tom Black, has credited the part played by local businesses who took their cues from the Republic of Ireland. Mr McGuinness said they’re happy they made that decision even though the business took a ‘massive hit’ because of it. “St Patrick’s Day is our busiest day of the year and we were thinking about retirement soon but this thing has thrown it all up in the air. “We knew that, but we were just concerned about the health of Derry people.” Paedar’s missed out on grants because it didn’t meet the criteria but employees were furloughed. The rebuild will be a slow process, Mr McGuinness said, as the pandemic took its toll. DIFFICULT From July  pubs and bars will be allowed to trade but must serve food and operate on a table service basis. Pubs that do not serve food will be allowed to sell alcohol outdoors, such as beer gardens, also restricted to table service. Mr McGuinness said that will make it ‘very dficult’ for small bars like Paedar’s with limited outdoor space. Permission to use that space is absolutely essential in his view. He added: “I would object to the fact that restaurant bars are allowed to open but bars aren’t allowed to serve inside. “I think the risk is higher in a restaurant bar with adults and children being served food and drink whereas we’re just serving alcohol to adults. “With food there are all sorts of utensils but we just have glasses and disposable plastic. “I don’t see the sense in holding us up because we don’t do food.” The ‘rush’ is now on to ready the bar for customers and bar owners like Mr McGuinness are looking to the government and local authorities for guidance. Paedar O’Donnell’s has been cleared of tables and chairs to allow for the walls to be freshly painted and floors nished ahead of the grand reopening.  Mr McGuinness hopes that the government advice is relaxed to allow bars to serve indoors. They’re awaiting further guidance before spending any money on Perspex screens or other safety measures. He concluded: “We’d encourage people to come back but it’s going to be very limited space. “We don’t have the tourists, we were a very busy bar at weekends, and we’re not going to get those numbers in – nowhere is – because Derry people like to go out on a Friday and Saturday and nowhere will be able to cater for them because of social distancing. “There’s no money to be made in the next few months that’s the reality. “But hopefully over timeit is under control and there’s no resurgence maybe we can get back to some normality.” INFORMATION The owner of numerous bar-restaurants in the city including the Bentley, The Magnet and Molly Malones, Tony O’Connor, is also seeking clarity. “I’m surmising that they’re working on it at Stormont but we need more information about social distancing and so on,” he said. With all of his restaurants serving food he’s assured by the fact that customers can sit indoors but is unsure as to whether dining customers can stay longer to socialise. Mr O Connor said: “Every one of our premises will be opening on July  because of the food situation. Out of our six bars, five of them have outdoor areas.” This week he held a meeting with management and they’re ‘all positive and raring to go’. Like many businesses, the pandemic has been a ‘nightmare’ for Mr O’Connor but he realises that everybody is on the same boat. The Irish government ‘deserves a massive pat on the back’ for closing bars before St Patrick’s Day, he said, because ‘you would have had thousands and thousands across Ireland’ spreading the virus. “A lot of bars lost out on revenue there, no money was coming in and none getting paid out, so you just start over again,” he added. AMAZING  Bars have been actively discouraged from staging live music events or screening football matches to minimise the urge for customers to ‘dance’ or ‘hug each other’ after a goal is scored. It’s Mr O’Connor’s aspiration that the bar will be allowed to have a singer-songwriter, two-piece band performing or DJ providing entertainment. The local businessman said they will have hand sanitisers at each entrance, on every floor, at every table and also behind the bars and in kitchen areas for staff. “I’d rather not open as to have big screens in front of the bar because I think it takes the atmosphere away. “We have enough space so we can take tables away to create distance,” he stated. They’re also considering an App on which people can order food and drinks but are awaiting further guidance. And extra staff will be on hand to carry out an increased cleaning schedule. Looking to the future, Mr O’Connor would like to see visitors to the city from other parts of the island. He said: “I think Derry will get a good turnout because we handled the pandemic well as a city, there was a low number of Coronavirus cases. “I can’t wait to get my teeth back into it, we’ve been doing nothing the past few months, and the not knowing is the worst thing. “We’ve been doing takeaways but getting fully open is going to be amazing. “We’d invite people to get back out and support your local. “Self-awareness is key, Derry has played a blinder, it should be recognised and people here don’t have to be told to social distance, they’re fully aware.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Patrick McGonagle, , whose address was given as Old School Lane in Shantallow appeared in court on June  charged with breaching his bail conditions on June  by ‘intentionally exposing his genitals’. The defendant had been released on bail on June  after being charged with common assault, namely throwing bread at a woman and attempting to grab her, and disorderly behaviour in a public place. A police officer said that on June  the PSNI became aware of a video circulating online showing a man acting in an ‘indecent manner’. googletag.cmd.push It was brought to the attention of police by community representatives and family members of children who witnessed it. McGonagle was identied in multiple reports. The officer said the incident took place at Old School Lane where the -year-old was seen ‘defecating in view of children’. A -year-old recorded the incident. The officer added: “He used chip shop wrappers to wipe himself. He was extremely intoxicated.” Police located the defendant at Old School Lane and he charged straight away. Objecting to bail, the officer said on June  McGonagle was warned about his behaviour and not to be intoxicated in a public place. googletag.cmd.push The court heard the -year-old has  previous convictions and two suspended sentences. There is an ‘extremely high risk of reoffending’, the officer added, ‘this man is incapable of not being intoxicated in a public place.’ Defence barrister Stephen Mooney said his client pleaded guilty to the offences before the court on Monday at the first opportunity and it was adjourned for a pre-sentence report. McGonagle was not in a position to be interviewed by the police due to his level of intoxication. Mr Mooney told the court that back in   the -year-old spent a ‘very signicant’ period of time in custody on remand. He was then found ‘unfit for trial’ because of his mental capacity and the prosecution was discontinued. The defence barrister said it is not so much a ‘fool’s pardon but a street drinker’s pardon’ as he is a well-known street drinker. His alcoholism is being criminalised because of his inability to stay sober, he added. Mr Mooney asked for bail to be granted with strict conditions attached. District Judge Peter King said ‘you’re absolutely correct’ and any bail conditions would have to include a prohibition on alcohol which would set him up for ‘spectacular failure’. He added that McGonagle may upset the ‘wrong person or group of people and find himself facing more dficulties’. The defendant was remanded in custody due to a ‘clear risk of reoffending’ to appear by way of video link on July .

From  July, people who are shielding will be able to meet up to sixpeople outside the home, as long as social distancing is strictly observed. In addition, people who are shielding and living alone will be able to form a support bubble from July  with one other household. These easements are based on the continuing reduction in the rate of community transmission of the virus in Northern Ireland. Further details will be provided in writing to people who are shielding. This letter will also set out plans to put shielding on hold from  July. googletag.cmd.push Minister Swann said:“I have no doubt that shielding has played a key role in saving many lives. It has undoubtedly been extremely dficult for those who are shielding. I have listened with great sympathy to what people have told us about feeling isolated and how they have missed their loved ones. “I know these easements that take effect on  July will be welcome news to many as we move towards the pause in shielding from the end of July. “However, I am also very conscious that there will be some who are apprehensive about this change. I would therefore, once again, repeat my call to everyone to continue to observe social distancing and to be considerate of the fact that the people you meet may have been shielding for many weeks.” googletag.cmd.push The Minister added that people who are shielding must strictly follow public health advice on social distancing and hand washing. “While the risk of being infected has reduced, the virus still constitutes a serious threat to those who are shielding should they get it. “It is important to remember that because of your underlying condition, Covid- will remain a threat to you. At the same time, it is accepted that shielding has been really challenging and that being stuck indoors indefinitely is bad for mental and physical health. What we all have to do in these dficult times is try to strike the right balance. “This is about minimising any risk as much as possible, being aware that all contacts with the outside world must be managed really carefully. “Keep your distance, wash your hands, don’t touch your face, avoid touching hard surfacesyou are out. Wherever possible, avoid enclosed spaces where social distancing is hard to maintain – such as public transport and shops.” The easements in shielding guidance from  July were agreed at today’s Executive meeting. This includes meeting up to six people outside the home providing social distancing is strictly observed. People who are shielding alone can form a support bubble with one other household. Social distancing is not required with this other household. This will allow people to visit, stay over and spend more time with the second household. The second household can be of any size. Both households should not be part of more than one bubble and should continue to socially distance outside the bubble.

This is dferent. Last weeks edition of this column made two proposals for a new-look Derry senior football championship. Both were based around the inclusion of isional teams and in part two, we put some flesh on the bones. The thought process is the poorof players from the intermediate and junior grades coming through to the Derry senior football team in the last decade. Of  players used in league and championship, by five dferent managers, none hail from junior clubs and  from intermediate, one less than Ballinderrys club total. googletag.cmd.push Also, the decade saw Coleraine, Slaughtneil and Ballinderry dominate the competition. Its great for the clubs in question, but in a bid to help raise the quality overall. A county team needs more options. In Sideline Views proposal,  senior clubs have been selected on the basis of the last five years of the senior championship. The  teams who reached at least one semi-final were joined by Swatraghand Dungivenas the highest placed teams in the  league standings. The other three teams are isional teams picked from the rest of the clubs. Foyle Oaks , North Derry and South Derry. googletag.cmd.push Logistically it will be dficult to fit in around hurling. So in a case where Tiarnaacuten McHugh is trying to balance North Derry, Drumsurn and Kevin Lynchs, it will be far from ideal. A balance will be needed and proper dialogue between all three managers, with the players training regime at the heart of it. The senior championship will need to be played off over dferent weekends to intermediate and junior. This would be a stumbling block as it stands, with so much tied up in the leagues. Under this new concept, leagues would be totally dferent from championship. Leagues of  with a two up two down relegation, would be devised with one thing in mind – getting as many games as possible. The CCC would allocate rounds on the weekends the NFL is on. Club games are on Friday or Saturday night, with the county taking place on Sunday. The county manager names his starting  and anyone outside of that, who didnt see any meaningful game time in previous round, is eligible for club football. It would need checked with the county physio, buta player is going to be of any benefit, they need competition in the legs. The advantage is having more games on a more regular basis, with more room to balance the club championship commitments. It would help avoid loggerheads at a time of year when it really matters, it would help get rid of the alarming drop-off rate from players being caught between two stools. A situation where nobody wins and in the case of Derry, it leaves a situation that stles any continuity. ON THE DRAW Last week, Liam Tunneyrandomly picked  numbers and the draw was populated as you see below. It has some mouthwatering ties. North Derrys clash with a Dungiven side clambering their way back to their decline is the tie of the round, with the late Sunday night billing at Owenbeg. The appointment of former Dungiven manager Michael OKane and Darren McShane as managers of North Derry will add a bit of spice along the sideline. South Derrys debut in the championship see them up against a ravenous Slaughtneil, who have aim to win back the John McLaughlin Cup after a two year absence and have the astute Paul Bradley at the helm. In the opposition dugout is Ronan Rocks who will know the intermediate scene well and has an handle on the up and coming minor talent from his time with Derry Us. He is joined in the South Derry management team by Hugh Mulholland, who never misses a club championship game and will know Slaughtneil inside out. Foyle Oaks, under the management of Michael McLaughlin and Joe Gray, come up against Loup, with Paddy Bradley in his first season in charge. Lavey and Coleraine renew their  final rivalries. The #SidelineView Derry SFC ROUND  Thursday.South Derry v Slaughtneil  Friday.Ballinascreen v Bellaghy  Saturday . - Glen v Greenlough . - Loup v Foyle Oaks  Sunday . – Swatragh v Ballinderry . – Coleraine v Lavey  Sunday . - Magherafelt v Banagher . - Dungiven v North Derry  There is a glance at what the isional teams could look like. FOYLE OAKS: Kieran Reilly, Eoghan Concannon, Kevin Lindsay, Tomaacutes McCrossan, Neil Forester, Michael Sweeney, Jordan Curran, Michael McLaughlin, Caolan Doyle, Oran Armstrong, Marty Donaghy, Paddy OKane, Odhraacuten McKane, Ben McCarron, Conor McGee.SUBS: Daryl Moore, Fionain Smyth, Conor Johnston, Shane McGahon, Gavin McShane, Aaron Kerrigan, Colin Murray, Conor McGee, Paul Quigley. NORTH DERRY: Oran Hartin, Eoin Ferris, Oisin Duffy, Tiarnaacuten Woods, Niall Ferris, John OKane, Gerard OKane, Neil McNicholl, Mark McCormick, Eoghan Duffy, Eoin Bradley, Niall McGowan, Fergal Mortimer, Gary Keane, Richard King.SUBS: Pearse McNicholl, Dara Rafferty, Damien Brolly, Cahir Mullan, Daryl Mullan, Martin McGonigle, Collie Mullan, Kevin OConnor, Jude McLaughlin.

At the end of the season, two from the first teams eliminated will meet in a play-off to stay in the senior championship. From the last five years, form will be assessed for wins, draws and defeats, as well as scoring totals to pick the two lowest performing teams, who will play in a relegation play-off. The loser will drop to intermediate, with the intermediate winners promoted to the senior grade.

This is dferent. Last weeks edition of this column made two proposals for a new-look Derry senior football championship. Both were based around the inclusion of isional teams and in part two, we put some flesh on the bones. The thought process is the poorof players from the intermediate and junior grades coming through to the Derry senior football team in the last decade. Of  players used in league and championship, by five dferent managers, none hail from junior clubs and  from intermediate, one less than Ballinderrys club total. googletag.cmd.push Also, the decade saw Coleraine, Slaughtneil and Ballinderry dominate the competition. Its great for the clubs in question, but in a bid to help raise the quality overall. A county team needs more options. In Sideline Views proposal,  senior clubs have been selected on the basis of the last five years of the senior championship. The  teams who reached at least one semi-final were joined by Swatraghand Dungivenas the highest placed teams in the  league standings. The other three teams are isional teams picked from the rest of the clubs. Foyle Oaks , North Derry and South Derry. googletag.cmd.push Logistically it will be dficult to fit in around hurling. So in a case where Tiarnaacuten McHugh is trying to balance North Derry, Drumsurn and Kevin Lynchs, it will be far from ideal. A balance will be needed and proper dialogue between all three managers, with the players training regime at the heart of it. The senior championship will need to be played off over dferent weekends to intermediate and junior. This would be a stumbling block as it stands, with so much tied up in the leagues. Under this new concept, leagues would be totally dferent from championship. Leagues of  with a two up two down relegation, would be devised with one thing in mind – getting as many games as possible. The CCC would allocate rounds on the weekends the NFL is on. Club games are on Friday or Saturday night, with the county taking place on Sunday. The county manager names his starting  and anyone outside of that, who didnt see any meaningful game time in previous round, is eligible for club football. It would need checked with the county physio, buta player is going to be of any benefit, they need competition in the legs. The advantage is having more games on a more regular basis, with more room to balance the club championship commitments. It would help avoid loggerheads at a time of year when it really matters, it would help get rid of the alarming drop-off rate from players being caught between two stools. A situation where nobody wins and in the case of Derry, it leaves a situation that stles any continuity. ON THE DRAW Last week, Liam Tunneyrandomly picked  numbers and the draw was populated as you see below. It has some mouthwatering ties. North Derrys clash with a Dungiven side clambering their way back to their decline is the tie of the round, with the late Sunday night billing at Owenbeg. The appointment of former Dungiven manager Michael OKane and Darren McShane as managers of North Derry will add a bit of spice along the sideline. South Derrys debut in the championship see them up against a ravenous Slaughtneil, who have aim to win back the John McLaughlin Cup after a two year absence and have the astute Paul Bradley at the helm. In the opposition dugout is Ronan Rocks who will know the intermediate scene well and has an handle on the up and coming minor talent from his time with Derry Us. He is joined in the South Derry management team by Hugh Mulholland, who never misses a club championship game and will know Slaughtneil inside out. Foyle Oaks, under the management of Michael McLaughlin and Joe Gray, come up against Loup, with Paddy Bradley in his first season in charge. Lavey and Coleraine renew their  final rivalries.

At the end of the season, two from the first teams eliminated will meet in a play-off to stay in the senior championship. From the last five years, form will be assessed for wins, draws and defeats, as well as scoring totals to pick the two lowest performing teams, who will play in a relegation play-off. The loser will drop to intermediate, with the intermediate winners promoted to the senior grade.

With handsanitiserat the door to every store, one-way systems, contactlesspayment, and limits on customernumbers, the new normal might take a while to get used to. Around half the shops in Foyleside Shopping Centre were open on Tuesday morning, with Dunnes Stores attracting the biggest crowds. Staff in Marks and Spencers and Boots, which have remained open throughout the pandemic, were glad to see a bit more hustle and bustle in the centre And with sales on in Debenhams, Dunnes and Marks and Spencer, many shoppers remarked on how happy they were to be out spendingagain. googletag.cmd.push But while the shops are open, cafes and coffee shops in the shopping centres remain closed for now. Mary McLaughlin, who hasnt been shopping in the city centrein over three months, said shewas glad to be back. This is my first day back up the town and Im all hyper with it, she said. I havent been up thetown since way beforeSt Patricks Day Its been awful not being able toget up the town, butas long as we are all healthy thats the main thing. Its just great to get out again. Ive been looking forward to it. Self-confessed shopaholic Geraldine Deery has been yearning for the social side of shopping. googletag.cmd.push Im ashopaholic and its been drivingme crazy, she said. I missed going up the town and meeting people and having a chat. And I really miss going in for a cup of coffee with my sister. Ive gone abit crazy buying things, Im making up for losttime of the weeks I missed. The management at Foyleside, The Richmond Centre and Debenhams have clearly put a lot of timeand effortinto establishingand marking out one-way systems and there are plenty of signs in place reminding people to keep to the two metre social distance rule. You do be a bit nervous because youre looking at the floor, trying to make sure you are going the right way, said Mrs McLaughlin. Everything is well spaced out and the floors are all marked out. Although Im glad I came out early because its quiet at the minute. Derrys small independent retailers are also slowly getting back to business after getting the go ahead this week, David Thomas, whose jewellery shop and workshop Thomas Goldsmith has operated from Pump Street for over  years, has been surprised that some of his fellow small traders havent reopned yet.  Ive just been for a walk round and Ive noticed that a large number of small independents arent openat the minute. This is the second dayinto it and they are taking their time to get back to work. Maybe thats their own choice. It surprisedme because to rebuild businessagain is important. For a lot of them who have furloughed staff and who are self employed as it were and are receiving payments they are thinking I wont risk it because theres a safety net there. But obviously that safety net is going to start disappearing. Business has been quite slow this week, but MrThomas is hopeful that shoppers will be back. We arecompleting the work we werent able to complete in March after the guillotine came down and we werent able to finish. And then we were hit by problems in the supply chain but that has started to ease up. In the last two weeks it has relaxed and things are filtering thoughnow. Were now able to complete things we should have done in March so weve stillgot that momentum from then, but in terms of work coming through its going to be a bit slow. There are a lot of people are being made redundant or who havent been able to claim grants and things like that. But on the other hand there are people who were furloughed and had to stay at home and werent able to spend money and they should have a fairly healthy bank account and they are desperate to get out and buy stuff. Mr Thomas has made changes to the way the shop operates in order to comply with the new regulations. Only one customer is admitted at a time, staff are usingfacemasks and hand sanitiser, and jewellery that has been tried on is being cleaned before it goes back on th shelf. People are understanding and respectful, remarked Mr Thomas. He feels that lockdown has given people time to reflect on their work le balance and lestyle. People are saying it will never be the same, he said. We were all chasing our tails a bit, workingvery hard. Does it have to be like that  Can we take things a bit easier  Do we have to be rushing off to Portugal on cheap flights  It has been strangeto sit at home in the garden and look up and see the skies totally clear. Many of Derrys charity shops have also reopened their doors, with Oxfam, Kinship Care, the Red Cross and Cancer Focus back in businessearlier this week. However, the three month closure has meant some stores are struggling with low stock levels. Deborah Tracey is the manager at Cancer Focus on Shipquay Street, which opened in May .  The shop reopened last Friday after a week of cleaning and preparation and have been busy ever since. Inside there is hand sanitiser at thedoor and a one-waysystem in place. Most people have been using the hand sanitiser before they come in, said Ms Tracey. We have been busy with people bringing stuff in and buying stuff too. People seem to feel confident coming out to shop now and theyare glad toget back to a bit of normality. Cancer Focus has amanager and deputy manager but all the other staff are volunteers. Some of our volunteers have been worried about coming back because they are older and more at risk, said MsTracy. So weare lookingfor newvolunteers now. We provide everyonewith shields, masks and gloves for their safety. Cancer Focus has also launched an appeal for donations. Any donations to the shop must be quarantined for  hours when we receive them, said Ms Tracy. We are looking for donations of clothes, bric-a-brac, shoes, bags and books. If you would like to make a donation to Cancer Focus or to enquire about becoming a volunteer telephone .

At present, hospitality businesses have to adhere to strict licensing laws in terms of serving outdoors. However, local councils have been encouraged by the Northern Ireland Executive to take a flexible approach to the situation to support the sector as it emerges from the coronavirus lockdown. Derry City and Strabane District Council is currently looking at ways it can help local businesses. They have launched a short survey asking for peoples opinions on the matter. The survey can be filled in here -https:bit.ly eohTnm googletag.cmd.push A council spokesperson said: The hospitality and retail industries have been some of the hardest hit in terms of lost revenue during COVID-. They will also be one of the last to fully emerge from the lockdown. With the impact of the pandemic and the resulting social distancing measures that must continue when businesses reopen it is essential that we start to reimagine how theservice industries can adapt and operate in the current circumstances.New business models and taking hospitality and trade outdoors will play a signicant part in the survival of the service industry locally. Using private and public spaces such as pavements, car parking spaces and events spaces such as Guildhall Square, Waterloo Place and the Canal Basin in Strabane could be part of the solution. googletag.cmd.push To achieve this, Council and key stakeholders including Department for Infrastructure and the Department for Communities will be adopting a flexible approach that seeks to facilitate innovation - whilst ensuring appropriate controls such as Insurance, disability access, enforcement and public health are in place.

In this extract the autistic teenager shares his joy of the natural world on a day out to Murlough with his sister and brother.OUR garden is thrumming with birds today: coal, blue and great tits, blackbird, thrush, magpie, jackdaw, rook, all of them revelling on the grass, pecking at the feeders.I could happily watch them all day but rain is coming from the east, so we decide to go west to the coast at Murlough to stay in the sunshine. I usually despise being in the sun. I find its light too bright, its heat too hot, and it can make me feel astherersquos nowhere to hide. But with this rain coming, I feel like being on the dunes at Murlough, pressed by warmth and sea breezes.The ancient dune system here is six thousand years old, fragile and spectacular. The unusually high dunes were formed in the late th and th centuries by massive storms, and were used by people in the Middle Ages as rabbit warrens to provide them with meat and pelts.Grazing rabbits encouraged the grassy heathland here, but when myxomatosis first broke out in the s, as it did in other parts of Ireland and Britain, the population was almost wiped out. With fewer rabbits, sea buckthorn and sycamore could grow, turning heath to scrubland. Now the National Trust have intervened at Murlough, managing the landscape so it reverts back to heath mdash and judging from the copious pings, it looks like the rabbits are thriving again, too.The day is sparkling, the wind is shaking and shaping the clouds. Lorcan and Blaacutethnaid want to swim, so I stroll along the beach with my binoculars. Shapes out at sea stop me: a trinity of torpedoing gannets. They swoop, wheel and suddenly drop, spiralling until the last second when they transform into arrows before hitting the water.Swallows are overhead ndash I can see their small bodies so clearly, weightless and constantly moving. I feel myself rising with them.My dark, knotted thoughts seem to be staying away at the moment. I feel as free as the gannets and swallows. If they can live their lives, shouldnrsquot I do the same  Can I breathe and live and also fight  The natural world mdash which includes us mdash is facing such enormous challenges that itrsquos easy to become overwhelmed and depressed. But we must fix them, andIrsquom no longer here, alive, I canrsquot be part of the solution.What is it thatrsquos holding me back  Anxiety  Depression  Autism  These are the shackles. Surely, I can break free. Or at least I can accept these things as part of me. I have no answers, but the lightness of these thoughts and these days weave my body and mind with everything around me. The only thing that I am really bound to is nature ndash as we all are.Lorcan and Blaacutethnaid are running towards me, and I run to them, and then we run together, exultant. We slow down in unison, all feeling the same pull of the large peculiar shells dotted around the beach. We each pick one up and hold them outstretched, delicate porcelain in our hands.They look like pale planets, pockmarked with symmetrical lines. I rattle mine, listening to the whisper of sand and the past. These are sea potatoes mdash a type of sand-burrowing sea urchin mdash with pocks that once held spines and a bleached calcium carbonate shell that could so easily shatter on land or at sea. Each one is a miracle. So many miracles washed up at once.We start to collect them and Lorcan decides to name three of the best specimens Sandy, Sam and Sandra. He holds a conversation with them, three sea potatoes, which makes us laugh so hard that tears well up and almost flow, and wersquore still laughing as a warm rain starts to fall on us.Under dark skies, I feel completely unburdened of any doubts in my own abilities to help our planet. Instead, I feel energised and ready. Sopping wet and cold and with chattering teeth, still giggling madly, I feel hope pouring in the rain. Being myself is enough.Diary of a Young Naturalist by Dara McAnulty is published by Little Tollerand can be bought online, or at No Alibis bookshop in Belfast..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"A lifetime of capturing Ireland’s scenic beauty  ","story":"AMATEUR photographer Chris Laverty spent a letime capturing Irelandrsquos scenic beauty.The former Queenrsquos University computer centre manager travelled extensively, always with his camera, and always with an eye for the magic of the countryside around him.

As we work to do so, our absolute priority will be to keep our patients, service users and staff safe. the statement adds.The health trustrsquos insistence that emergency services will be restored at the Downe comes ahead of a meeting with a Sinn Fein delegation to discuss the issue.Spearheaded by South Down MP, Chris Hazzard, the delegation will be seeking assurances that all services will be restored to their previous level.Ahead of the meeting, Mr Hazzard said that due to the pandemic, the local community was left without access to vital services at the Downe due to the health systemrsquos response to coronavirus which ldquorequired what amounted to extraordinary measures for an extraordinary time.The MP said the Downe was left ldquounrecognisable as emergency and outpatient services, amongst others, closed from the end of March.ldquoWhere required, all available staff and equipment from these units was also requisitioned for use in other parts of the South Eastern Trust area, he continued.ldquoIn agreeing to the radical reconfiguration of the Downe, the community made a big sacrice in order to accommodate the unprecedented demands made by both health trusts in the fight against Covid-.Insisting that it was the right thing to do at the right time, Mr Hazzard said there is now an onus on trust management to respond in kind to the community.He said the recently published recovery plans have delayed the restoration of vital services to the community, causing signicant concern amongst many who fear that ldquotemporary closure might inevitably mean permanent removal.Mr Hazzard said the Sinn Fein delegation will be calling for the full restoration of services at the Downe and will also be meeting with the chief executive of the Southern Trust to call for services removed from Newryrsquos Daisy Hill hospital to be reinstated.Rowallane DUP councillors are also demanding the full restoration of services at the Downe Hospital, highlighting the importance of reopening the emergency department as soon as possible.Cllr Billy Walker said it was ironic that within hours of confirmation that the Downpatrick ED would not reopen at this stage, the South Eastern Trust revealed via social media that the Ulster Hospitalrsquos emergency department was extremely busy.ldquoThis is nothing new, he declared. ldquoThere is a clear need for the Downersquos emergency department to reopen now. Having this facility available can help ease the pressure on other EDs and we cannot understand why there is not increased investment in Downpatrick.ldquoWe all understood the temporary closure of services at the Downe to allow health chiefs to respond to the global pandemic, but the time for those services to be reinstated is now.

However, bearing in mind the scheme is all but shovel ready, this should be a simple case of signing the commencement orders with construction starting as soon as possible.Mr Hazzard said the roads minister has a capital budget of more than poundm to be spent this year, suggesting that very few projects are as advanced as the Ballynahinch bypass.ldquoThere is no logical reason why this long overdue project canrsquot get the green light for construction as a matter of priority, he said.The MP added: ldquoIn light of the severe economic impact of Covid- and the ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the commencement of this scheme would be a welcome step towards improving both our local economy and the wellbeing of our community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Darragh Cross residents bring cheer to local residential home  ","story":"RESIDENTS from Oakland Court in Darragh Cross made the most of the lockdown by having socially distanced nights of entertainment while helping the residents of a nearby residential home.From hosting fun events such as bingo and discos, they raised pound for Willowview Residential Home in Saintfield.Oakland Court residents would like to thank Darragh Crossrsquo Vivo shop for its donation of prize hampers and everyone who donated prizes and gts.In turn, all residents and staff of Willowview Residential Home would like to say pay their gratitude to to all the residents of Oakland Court and Darragh Cross Vivo for their kindness and thoughtfulness..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"DNA testing on dog dirt  ","story":"SENIOR Newry, Mourne and Down Council officers say they will need time to research the issue of using DNA testing on dog dirt in a bid to trace animals which are allowed to use public areas as open air toilets.Members of the local authorityrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee will discuss the issue at their virtual meeting later today.A motion on the issue tabled by Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown at the March meeting of the full council was referred to the local authority committee for discussion.Dog dirt poses a major health risk, especially to children, who could potentially lose their sight as a result of coming into contact with it.Cllr Brown said there was a need to consider innovative ways of tackling the issue which has been raised on a regular basis by elected representatives across the local authorityrsquos seven DEAs.He is keen for the local authority to investigate the viability of using DNA testing in a bid to identy offenders and aid enforcement officers to dish out fines.Cllr Brown is also eager for council officials to draw upon best practice from other councils who have introduced such a scheme in a bid to crack down on the dog fouling issue.In addition, he wants the local authority to roll out what he has described as an ldquoenhanced public awareness campaign focusing on the dangers of dog fouling.Ahead of tonightrsquos council meeting, officers are recommending that Cllr Brownrsquos motion is agreed to allow them time to research similar schemes which have been introduced where.In addition, officers say that they will need to understand the time and resources required to implement such a scheme locally beforereporting back to the council committee.Politicians, who have previously asked for more enforcement staff to be deployed across the district to deal with the dog fouling problem, say the highly contentious issue is one of the single most complained about problems in the area.They say that despite valiant efforts over recent years by council officials and others, the issue has not been adequately addressed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Drive in assembly at Crossgar primary school  ","story":"CEDAR Integrated Primary School in Crossgar has said farewell to its P pupils.Staff held a drive-in leavers ceremony for the outgoing P class last Friday.Parents and carers were invited to park in the playground and watch the  pupils receive folders of their work from their time at Cedar.They also received a survival kit for lsquobig schoolrsquo, as well as trophies for sports, arts and ICT,.

The team, captained by Harry Manley and Matilda Harty, secured a superb win.This yearrsquos Provincial Towns League galas provided a fantastic opportunity for club members to swim competitively and aim for personal best times, whilst having fun and making new friends with other clubs.The galas included a medley relay, inidual back, breast, fly and free swims, inidual medley and finally a freestyle relay for each of the four age groups.Lecalersquos galas took place from September to February with two at Down Leisure Centre and two away. Lecale swam against Cookstown, Leander, Coleraine and Portadown with some extremely close scores. Many parents, coaches and volunteers helped time and again, and this was truly appreciated.Swimmers at Lecale are able to start on the competitive pathway through development and open galas. Thirty-one swimmers have competed this season, gaining personal best times and medals.Of particular note, Tom Williamson was a medal winner in every event he entered across the four development meets of the season, winning eight gold medals, three silvers and one bronze medal.Orla Gibney shone at the Ards Christmas meet, winning two golds, a silver and a trophy for the best performance in the age  category, while Matilda Harty was in fine form at the Templemore open meet, winning medals in all four of her events mdash one gold, two silvers and a bronze.This season Lecale also had a squad of six elite swimmers who are involved in Swim Ulster Regional Talent Development and Performance Pathway, training and competing at national level.They qualied to compete in Swim Ulster meets and were placed within the top five in their age group in the spring qualying meets.Swim Ulster National Qualying Division  times were recorded for Adam Colgan, Adam Mahon and Aidan Mallett, Division  times for Christopher Mason and Rebecca Colgan and Aoe Mason were close to Division  times as the season was interrupted.Adam Colgan, Adam Mahon and Aidan Mallett qualied for the Swim Ulster short course championships in November and Aidan and Adam Colgan qualied for the McCullagh international meet in February, competing with the best swimmers in Ireland and GB, including Olympic swimmers Adam Peaty and Duncan Scott.Adam Colgan also qualied for the Irish long course meet, which serves as the Irish Olympic trials, prior to its Covid- cancellation.In challenging times for athletes used to training five or six times a week, swimmers now take part in al land work training up to three times per week under the direction of club coaches.Up to  swimmers are regularly taking part in what has become a highlight of the week. Although it cannot take the place of training in water, coaches hope power, balance and coordination levels can be maintained and that the swimmers will be to get back to business in the pool at a future date.It is always sad to say goodbye to swimmers who are ready to move on after finishing their school career. This season, Lecale said goodbye to Year  swimmers Chloe Galloway, Sarah Colgan, Peter Murphy and Tom Rodgers.Coaches, committee and club members thank them for their long and dedicated association with the club and look forward to hearing about their successes in the future.The club also wishes to thank the outgoing captains, Chloe Galloway and James Kane, for their dedication and service to the club this season.Lecale Swimming Club continues to take their lead from the governing bodies, Swim Ireland and Swim Ulster, and look forwards to welcoming swimmers back to training before too long and new members when the next season starts..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Mr Joseph McMcIlmail  ","story":"MR Joseph McIlmail, of Crew Road, Downpatrick, died peacefully at home on Tuesday, April , at the age of .Joe, as he was known to his family and many friends, was the fourth child of the late John Joe and Margaret McIlmail, from Bright.

He was also famous for discovering milk chocolate.Born in Killyleagh on April , , Sir Hans died in Cha in , aged  and described as the worldrsquos greatest collector who, from his earliest years, catalogued and carefully encased every artefact that he found.Over the years he accumulated nearly , items many of which today are on display in the British Museum.Close to the picturesque harbour in Killyleagh stands a copy of the London statue in honour of Sir Hans with a local councillor branding the campaign to take down the statues in the capital as ldquoridiculousCllr Billy Walker insists that the pioneering physician was not a slave trader and that the clamour for many statues to be taken down was becoming ldquosilly, urging the Government to show some backbone on the matter.He said Sir Hans was ldquorevered in his home town where people were proud to have a copy of the statue to a man who did so much for the world.Cllr Walker continued: ldquoSir Hans gave us the concept of free museums, found a cure for smallpox and pioneered science and medicine to do away with magic for treating illness.ldquoHe also promoted the use of quinine against malaria, discovered milk chocolate and was the first man to lead both Royal Colleges. Sir Hans also treated the poor for free and was no slave trader.Cllr Walker said Sir Hans left Killyleagh for London when he was  where he studied chemistry, before deciding on a career in medicine, qualying in France and ing to London.He was subsequently appointed as the personal physician to the governor of Jamaica and it was there that he discovered drinking chocolate.When he ed to England, Sir Hans was able to market his find and Cadburyrsquos promoted this drink for many years.Cllr Walker said that Sir Hans, who has a centre named after him in his home town, encouraged inoculation against ious diseases and for  years was President of the Royal College of Surgeons and a Fellow and hard working secretary of the Royal Society for many years.ldquoWe in Killyleagh are rightly very proud of Sir Hans and his links with our town, he continued.The councillor added: ldquoI hope that his statue in London will remain in place as he was a man of great distinction which is evidenced by the fact that there is now a centre dedicated to him in his home town.

In addition to the services directly provided at our local hospital mdash the peoplersquos hospital mdash Downe staff were redeployed to other healthcare facilities andcontributed enormously to the NHS effort.When the emergency planning was taking effect, it was the clear understanding of many local political and community representatives, that the emergency department service would be restored immediately upon the conclusion of the pandemic.Whilst there is clearly a signicant possibility of a so-called second surge in infections mdash and we are all aware as to just how serious such a second surge could be mdash at the same time there is increased normalisation of health provision across the North.The restoration of the urgent care service previously provided at the Downe must be a top priority as part of this normalisation. It should have been included in the June action plan, published by the health trust last week.Just last week, as attendances were increasing at the remaining emergency departments, including at the Ulster Hospital, it was apparent that existing facilities are and will be unable to cope with demand.During the Covid emergency planning, decisions were taken to temporarily close the emergency departments at the Downe, Daisy Hill and the Mater hospitals.Just last week, trade union representatives received categorical assurances from the Southern Trust about the re-opening of about Daisy Hill Hospital. Similar assurances are now required about the Downe.There is also a signicant impetus gathering now for the implementation of restructuring of healthcare services generally, and of urgent care in particular, across Northern Ireland.Decisions about the future of healthcare, particularly urgent care, afford an excellent opportunity to redress health inequalities that have arisen and been perpetuated by the historic under investment in the health service by successive governments and by the pursuit of centralisation policies.Many people believe that those centralisation policies played a crucial role in leaving us facing into a pandemic with insufficient hospital beds, insufficient intensive care beds, insufficient ambulance cover, insufficient ventilators and insufficient healthcare workers.Any change to emergency and urgent care provision is only permissible where it happens with the consent of the people.In the final analysis, decisions about the allocation of healthcare resources are political decisions taken by politicians, elected by the people and not by bureaucrats. Tiers and levels of bureaucracy make no dference to where ultimate responsibility lies.I have a great deal of sympathy for the recently appointed health minister, Robin Swann, who within a few weeks of his appointment, found himself facing the biggest public health emergency in the history of the National Health Service.I would respectfully suggest that Mr Swann should insist upon the criteria for change stated by Michelle OrsquoNeill when she was Health Minister.The now Deputy First Minister stated in November  that local people should be at the centre of decision-making processes in designing and delivering services. The , people who marched through Downpatrick in support of the Downe Hospitalin the Love the Downe Rally on February , , would certainly agree with that.As far back as , Dr Michael McBride, speaking at the sod cutting ceremony for the new Downe Hospital, said that ldquothe emphasis would be on making the health system respond to the patient rather than the patient to the system. I concur with that.In the Down Recorder of November , , after the publication of the Bengoa Report, Michelle OrsquoNeill was quoted as saying: ldquoWe will deliver care and support in the most appropriate settings, ideally in peoplersquos homes and communities.Again, I would concur with that.If there is to be a change in urgent care provision across Northern Ireland, no one can expect to be immune from that change. At the same time, change would only be possible or acceptableit is to create a better service for all of the people and a fair and equitable distribution of services.Many people in this area believe that we have had a very raw deal for over  years from the health service and some politicians.It sometimes seems to be forgotten that the National Health Service is free at the point of use, but it is certainly not without cost. It is the people who pay for it.Rural communities have particular characteristics and needs that must be addressed, in terms of at the most basic, accessibility to services. Like everyone , they have rights.Access to healthcare is a right, not a privilege.If it is to be the case that urgent care is being restructured, citizens in rural areas which, for this purpose, includes virtually anyone outside the Greater Belfast area, cannot be expected to forego services so that Belfast can continue to enjoy a proleration of emergency services, with not one but two Type  emergency departments on the scale of that at the Ulster Hospital, on its overdeveloped and cramped site, the Royal Victoria Hospital and the Mater, with the Type  unit at the Lagan Valley hospital, just seven miles from Belfast, a similar distance to that travelled by the people of Ardglass to the Downe hospital.Of course, Type  emergency departments are also to be found at Antrim and Craigavon, neither of which are far from Belfast and are linked by the best possible road infrastructure.Logically, it would seem, that the existence of two Type  units in Belfast is not sustainable, given the apparent massive pressure on services.We were told by the Department of Health at the time of the January  public meeting in Downpatrick Cricket Club that the purpose of that meeting was to enable local people to ldquofundamentally shape, inform and influence the criteria to be used to deliver services in the future.We hope that is still the case and await meaningful engagement with the community before change is implemented.The then deputy permanent secretary was quoted as having said that the then Minister would want to see ldquoongoing engagement in redesigning services. I am sure that the current Health Minister has the same views.The challenge for the Health Minister in the future must surely be to develop a fair and equitable distribution of services that would end discrimination against rural communities and ensure that all services, including ambulance services, are readily accessible to all of the people.It is worth remembering as well, that there was actually a .%in the attendances at emergency departments in Northern Ireland between December  and December . In the same period, attendances at the Downe Hospitalrsquos emergency department rose signicantly.Decisions about change in the health service are political decisions. All of the major parties form the Northern Ireland Executive, which is collectively accountable for the program for government and all that it delivers or fails to deliver for the people.It is imperative that any attempt to change or restructure healthcare provision in Northern Ireland is done so in full consultation with the end users of the services, who are also the paymasters for it. This will be very dficult, as history has created a deep mistrust between substantial elements in our community and the Department of Health.Our community has suffered greatly from repeated cuts to services and the ruthless pursuit of a centralisation agenda a pursuit that has continued even in recent years when the NHS in England and Wales has been investing in and supporting smaller hospitals, recognising their crucial roles at the heart of local communities and using technological advances to support them.If it appears that Covid- is being used as a cover to implement long-standing Department of Health policy, then any changes would be resented by the community and in fact rejected by it. This would lead to an irreparable breach of trust between the people and the State.If an attempt is made to in any way reduce the services that are currently on offer at the Downe Hospital, this community, as it has done before, will rise up in righteous indignation.Twenty five thousand people took to the streets of Downpatrick in February . If our emergency department is not restored within a reasonable timescale mdash a matter of weeks mdash it is very likely that this area will see an unprecedented display of anger, with , plus people on the street, with legal challenges about any perceived abuse of process and a community-wide campaign, a cross-community campaign and political upheaval at the highest level of government.The people of East and South Down have had enough. They have reluctantly sacriced local services, as a temporary measure in the short term, but their resolve should not be underestimated.The people of Newcastle, Ballynahinch, Castlewellan, Ardglass, Killough, Clough, Downpatrick, Strangford, Crossgar, Lower Mourne and the vast surrounding rural hinterland need these services.Farmers, fishermen and builders need emergency care as much as ever, so too do the tourists who flock into our area every year and probably will do so in even greater numbers this year.It is time to restore the Downe Hospitalrsquos emergency department and it is time to concentrate investment in local services, delivering for the people who need the services, where they need those services.The NHS must serve the people from ldquocradle to grave. It is a part of the social contract between the people and those who govern them.Politicians and administrators come and go. The Downe hospital must live on, developing all the time the range of services it offers.Equality demands nothing less..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Revered servant of local cricket  ","story":"Robin Walsh remembers Alfie Linehan, the distinguished Downpatrick cricket stalwart who died last yearTHE great paradox of Alfie Linehan was to be found in his disposition on the cricket field and off it.At the crease, his was a belligerent style, hitting the ball farther than anyone , compiling his runs in a manner that kept the scorers busy. Beyond the boundary!Yet this domineering, almost bullying, approach belied one of Irish cricketrsquos truest gentlemen off it: soft-spoken, never a word that offended, never a word against him.In one of the most distinguished legacies to the local game, the late Downpatrick farmer captained the Ireland team before turning to administration in the roles of chairman and president of the Northern Cricket Union and president of the Irish Cricket Union.Yet it was where it mattered most, at the grassroots of the game, that Alfie left his indelible mark.His devotion to the Downpatrick club and its famous international ground The Meadow was boundless and le-long, from underage player to captain of the club, coach and ultimately chairman and president.He either played or captained Downpatrick in five NCU Senior League, three Senior Cup-winning sides and an Irish Senior Cup triumph along with his older brother Hugh, another talented batsman whose death at the age of  dealt a terrible blow to Alfie.In later years it was a source of great pride that Hughrsquos son, Paul, was to captain the club and daughter Anne played for Ireland.His wersquos nephew, James Cunningham, also captained the club.Alfiersquos hard-hitting ways over four decades from the s took him to  Irish appearances mdash six of them as captain mdash in the days when international caps were much less liberally awarded, and his contribution to the success of NCU representative cricket has rarely been equalled.Administration was an endless labour of love at local, provincial and national level. Such was his accommodating nature that he chaired countless committees ranging from solving an umpire shortage in the NCU to raising funds at ICU golf days.His contribution to his local community extended far beyond the boundaries of the cricket club.In his day he was a member of the NI Sports Council, a director of his local hospital trust and president of Ardglass Golf Club.Alfiersquos friends were legion, none more close than Cecil Walker, that leading light of the Lisburn club.Their playing days over, they travelled the world with their wives watching international cricket and storing delightful memories of new friendships, whether tales of the Bodyline era over tea with Harold Larwood at his home in Sydney, or a fond mention by David lsquoBumblersquo Lloyd from the commentary box.Of all thatrsquos been written down the years about Alfie Linehan, one game has been overlooked and yet it speaks more than any of his commitment to Downpatrick.It was Saturday, August , , and Downpatrick were due to play Lurgan. It was also the day of Alfiersquos wedding to his beloved Mary. No problem: wedding in the morning, cricket in the afternoon, reception in the evening, off on honeymoon the next day.Of all the tributes paid to Alfie none has been more signicant than that on BBC Televisionrsquos Sports Personality of the Year programme last December.He was included in the prestigious roll of honour of international sports personalities who had died during .

Not a single new case of the virus was detected at health labs across the Province, the first time that has happened since the introduction of the crippling lockdown at the end of March. The number of new cases has been falling for weeks of course, but we have probably reached the ‘no new cases’ landmark sooner than some expected. Health minister Robin Swann, who suffered despicable online abusein the early weeks of this crisis, and not forgetting some criticism from partners in government, deserves praise for his handling of the crisis. Mr Swann has often struck an ominously downbeat and cautious tone during press conferences, particularly during the beginning of lockdown, and while that was frustrating at times, in the long run it might have influenced people to adhere to the rules on staying at home during the full lockdown, and latterly following social distancing advice as restrictions have been eased. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

A long path to recovery now stretches ahead. Economically, the cost of the lockdown has been crippling, and there will be further pain ahead for businesses here who simply couldn’t sustain several months of little or no income. The Executive’s greatest failure has been on education. It was an obvious move to bring back children on a staggered basis at the end of this month, as much for their social wellbeing as anything , but incredibly, even a full-timefor pupils in September, has been placed in doubt. If we continue along the current path, and there is no second surge, it would be unthinkable for schools not toproperly in autumn.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

in one of his articles that such a progressive town as Penarth was without an operatic and dramatic society, writes Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Societypresident, Mary Gardner.The response to his outcry was quickly taken up and within three weeks the Penarth Operatic Society was formed.The Societyrsquos first production was Gilbert  Sullivanrsquos Iolanthe, played at The Hippodrome which later burnt down, and what a glittering opening evening it must have been as the audience wore evening dress.The review featured next day read, ldquoBrilliant Initial Performance.More newsVale council issues warning over the use of parksFines increased for coronavirus lockdown breachesMarie Curie Great Blooming Tea Party goes virtualA few years later in , the drama section came into being and with it a new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One, PODS presented the very special play, Last Man Standing, which also won a NODA award for Best Drama.In , PODS decided to do pantomime, and this has been a greatly gratying and popular addition to the companyrsquos output.Itrsquos wonderful to see children in the cast having on-stage experience, and then those children in the audience, perhaps for the first time, enjoying and loving live theatre.PODS is a very busy Society putting on four shows a year, a musical, two plays and a pantomime.Mrs Gardner said: ldquoThis year, sadly and very upsettingly after much hard work by all involved, the covid- virus struck as PODS had just set-up at the Paget Rooms ready for its run of Goodnight Mister Tom, only to be told the venue would be shut down next day.ldquoSince January, the Society had also been rehearsing for its May musical, The Full Monty, and that too has had to be cancelled.       ,params: .pushldquoNevertheless, when this terrible emergency is over the company will put on these two productions sometime in the future. ldquoPODS is proud of its achievement in giving much pleasure and entertainment to the local community with its first-class shows over the last  years, and its goal is to make its centenary in  with the help of its faithful audiences, friends and patrons.PODS is always ready to welcome new members, but at the moment it cannot meet or rehearse due to the covid- restrictions.It might be some time before restrictions are lted on groups being able to rehearse together, or audiences allowed back in theatres, meanwhile PODS members keep in touch

make face masks compulsory public transport","story":"Mark Drakeford said Englands decision to bring in a requirement for coverings had raised issues for people commuting between the two countries.It came as Public Health Wales said a further four people had died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to ,, while the number of positive cases grew by  to ,.More NewsLuxury car manufacturer Aston Martin to axe  jobsMans efforts toWorld War One Penarth soldiers plaque found in New ZealandPenarth RNLI leboat crew rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public transportthe journey is essential and theres no other travel

decision to bring in a requirement for coverings had raised issues for people commuting between the two countries.It came as Public Health Wales said a further four people had died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to ,, while the number of positive cases grew by  to ,.More NewsLuxury car manufacturer Aston Martin to axe  jobsMans efforts toWorld War One Penarth soldiers plaque found in New ZealandPenarth RNLI leboat crew rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public transportthe journey is essential and theres no other travel alternative.\" article_url   content_id

option to alleviate potential flood risk.More NewsVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldMillions become unpaid carers due to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh Government is keen for Wales to become

including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the A to reduce flood risk.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquolsquoFollowing our meeting on May  Sir David Henshaw chairman of NRW wrote to me on May  to say that NRW received almost  responses to our consultation on the Outline Business Case with the vast majority being opposed to the upstream storage option on the Cadoxton Brook.NRW chairman, Sir Henshaw said: ldquoWhen we consider the marginal

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

These include:Communication of health information, and how effective it isCultural issues relating to the suitability of health and social services for BAME communitiesIncome and employment insecurity, which is experienced disproportionately by BAME communitiesPoor quality of ethnicity data, which is preventing accurate analysisHousing overcrowding and environmentThe financial burden created by migration statusThe role of structural and systemic racism and disadvantage.The report is by the BAME Covid- expert advisory group, set up by First Minister Mark Drakeford to look at the reasons why people from BAME communities were more likely to be adversely affected by coronavirus.:One of its two sub-groups was tasked with examining the socio-economic factors, chaired by Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna, professor of management and organization at Cardf Business School, Cardf University.\"Therersquos an overall theme running through our research for this report. It centres on long-standing racism and disadvantage, and the lack of BAME representation within decision-making processes,\" said Professor Ogbonna, who is also a trustee and vice-chair of Race Council Wales.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is, in some respects, revealing the consequences of a lack of action on race equality.ldquoMany of the issues wersquove highlighted have been identied and discussed previously, but they havenrsquot been addressed in any systematic and sustained way.Analysis of Covid- related deaths across England and Wales by ethnicity showed that people from a black ethnic background are at a greater risk of death involving COVID- than all other ethnic groups.The Office for National Statistics study showe that the risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males, and nearly two-and-a-half times higher for black females than white.Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for black males and around one-and-a-half times for black females.

searches across Co ArmaghRow brewing over name for new leisure centre in CraigavonNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsPoliticsProposed name for leisure centre under the spotlightArmagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council’s Ulster Unionist grouping will meet today to discuss a range of matters including the name of a new £ million leisurecentre.By The NewsroomMonday, nd June , : pm\"\"A perspective of the new South Lake Leisure Centre in Craigavon.The meeting of the UUP council group is, the Local Democracry Reporting Service understands, due to take place at pm, just over two hours before Council’s monthly meeting at which the DUP will present a controversial proposal to name the South Lake Leisure Centre ‘Centinary Leisure Centre’.The proposal looks certain to ide the chamber and due to the make up of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council, the Ulster Unionist Party’s vote will be crucial to its success or failure.SDLP Councillor Joe Nelson has called on the UUP to vote against it and described the move as “nothing more than a political stunt”.“The proposal will be taken by the Catholic Nationalist community as another insult by the DUP group on Council as it continues to try and drag us back to the ‘Ballygobackwards’ days of Craigavon Council,” said Councillor Nelson.“It is a slap in the face to nationalist people and I would urge the Ulster Unionist Party to stand up and be counted.”The Alliance Party has also come out in opposition to the proposal, with party group leader, Councillor Eoin Tennyson concerned such a move would require an equality impact assessment.“Any change at this late stage would mean further delay to the opening of the centre and additional cost to ratepayers as an Equality Impact Assessment would have to be satisfied, signage replaced at a potential cost of more than £k and planning implications would have to be considered,” said Cllr Tennyson.“We may even find ourselves in a position where residents are left without leisure provision altogether for an extended period.”He continued: “The centenary of Northern Ireland is a signicant event in our shared history, and of course it is right that we mark it in a thoughtful, inclusive and informative way.“Now, more than ever, people want to see their councillors showing leadership, working together and focused on the ongoing pandemic.“Engaging in political point-scoring or afaux fight over the name of a leisure centre ismerely a distraction from that.”Speaking last week, DUP group leader, Councillor Mark Baxter said of the proposal: “Our country celebrates a great milestone on May  next year, our th anniversary as a nation within the United Kingdom.“Given the current economic situation, we, as a party, discussed a fitting and inexpensive way to mark this signicant anniversary, so we will propose that the Council officially name the new leisure centre in Craigavon as the ‘Centenary Leisure Centre’.”A decision on the proposal will be taken at tonight’s full meeting of Armagh City, Banbridge and CraigavonBorough Council.Sinn Fein was asked for comment.Adam Morton , Local Democracy Reporting Service\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\"

","story":"Health Minister Robin Swann has announced plans to pause the shielding advice that was issued to people ahead of the Covid- peak in Northern Ireland. From  July, subject to the rate of community transmission continuing to be low, people will no longer need to shield and should instead follow the same guidance and precautions as those considered to be generally vulnerable. That involves taking particular care when out and about - and strictly maintaining social distancing.Letters will be issued in the coming days to all those covered by shielding informing them of the planned change.Mr Swann stated: “I have been clear that shielding would not last one minute longer than it needed to. We have now reached the point where,the current trends continue, there will be no need for anyone to shield after  July. “I have listened to many of you and to the challenges you have faced during this period. I am in no doubt as to the dficulties shielding has presented for a great many people.“It is unrealistic to think these dficulties will just vanish because the need to shield has ended. That is why the letters we issue will provide details of the support which will continue to be available up to and after  July.“While my announcement today will be welcome news for many who are shielding, some will view the prospect of an end to shielding with great anxiety. I want to assure them that they should decide what to do at their own pace. Everyone will approach this situation dferently.“As is so often the case at present, this will be about weighing up the options and making informed choices. Going outside can bring some degree of potential risk but this can be mitigated and minimised by strict social distancing. Staying indoors indefinitely is not good for anyone’s mental or physical health.“Finally, I would ask everyone to be considerate as people end their periods of shielding.We should all continue to social distance, but in the coming weeks I want you to be particularly understanding of the fact you might be encountering someone who has had to stay at home for many weeks. Please be aware of this, show respect and kindness to all and keep your distance.”  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fbdceacab   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cabdecdabffeb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
