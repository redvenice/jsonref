His eyesight was so bad, they were scared he’d wipe them out too’This wave is known as the Pipeline. It breaks near the north shore of Oahu, Hawaii’s third largest island. It’s one of the pinnacles of surf culture. In the 1970s, when this shot was taken, it was probably the most radical wave in the world. We knew of nothing else like it.To catch a wave like this, you need to amass a wealth of knowledge from years on the ocean. In California, the slope of the wave is more gentle, thanks to the gradient of the seabed to the shore. In this part of Hawaii, the waves form on such deep water that when they reach the shallow reefs near the shore, they tower right up and create a ledge at the crest. They go straight up and down.Mastering the ledge takes real expertise. You need to analyse the wave’s approach then, at precisely the right moment, paddle furiously to get over the top. Then you need to hold your balance as it pitches out furiously. You’re this tiny body being launched with unimaginable speed. It’s like jumping off a 20ft building without a safety net. It doesn’t always go right. This guy who’s wiping out here was called Fred. My friends, who were very good at surfing the Pipeline, were terrified of him. One day, they bumped into him on dry land and he barely recognised them. They realised it was because he wore these super-thick glasses because his eyesight wasn’t great. So when everyone lines up in the water, jockeying for position as the wave approaches, they’d furiously paddle out of the way for fear of being wiped out by him.Fred didn’t suffer any major injuries. What was interesting, in the decades I’ve spent shooting surf culture, is how few people get killed. It’s not unheard of, and this wave can be really dangerous, but you mostly pick up only scratches and bruises. That’s remarkable when you think about the force of the waves and the risks you’re taking.In my early 20s, I was working in a commercial studio. We did rock bands, jewellery, condominiums, bread – you name it, we’d shoot it. But one summer, I remember thinking: “Screw this, I’m doing surf photography.” I knew the ocean, I grew up on the ocean, and I knew I would be good at it because I was so passionate about it. The Beach Boys asked me to photograph them at one point, but it seemed like a joke. Why would I want to hang out in Los Angeles when I could be on the shores of Honolulu?When I was growing up, the ocean was basically my backyard. My friends and I started surfing in our teens. It was our entire life. Whereas some people played tennis or golf or socialised or whatever, we were going to beaches that weren’t named on any map, finding secret paths out to the sea that we’d label and that nobody else knew about. My parents and all their friends had no clue what it was like. It was a secret world. We were like wilderness kids exploring.Surfing isn’t just sport: it has its own language, codes and culture. It’s like sailing communities, historically, or skate culture today. It’s often hard to explain it to outsiders. I remember showing an issue of Surfer magazine – where I’ve worked throughout my career – to my grandmother. She said she couldn’t really tell the difference between the images. As someone who has spent a life on the inside, that was crazy to me. But that’s because I recognise the people, the landscapes, the waves, the positions, the interaction between man and wave.The work is a joy but it isn’t always easy. You wait for hours, analysing the waves, getting to know the surfers, predicting who’s going to make it and who’s going to wipe out, because you have maybe one or two seconds to get the shot. When I started out, film was $10 a roll and you had to wait up to a week to see the finished shots. It felt amazing when you got what you wanted, but there was that element of suspense.Spending years in the blazing sun takes its toll: I’ve had multiple skin cancers. But the lifestyle was incredible. It’s a world I remain completely enamoured with. Photographing man and wave has been the work of my life.Trained: “Self-taught but mentored by Steve Wilkings in Honolulu in the mid-1970s.”Influences: “My artist grandmother: she painted watercolours of begonias.”High point: “A yacht trip to the Mentawai islands off Sumatra, Indonesia, in 1996 with a group of the best surfers in the world.

Please don’t read this.” The novel, a debut by the 26-year-old from Newcastle, will make most readers howl with laughter andor shut their eyes in horror.Irina, a beautiful twentysomething, picks up mediocre-looking men in places such as Tesco and photographs them in compromising positions. When the mother of one young model – “I’d scouted him on the bus and suspected he may have been in sixth form” – tracks her down at her bar job, Irina leaves to focus on her photography, which she’s been invited to show at an exhibition of contemporary fetish art in London. But digging through her archive throws up repressed memories, and so begins a spiral of self-destruction and violence towards her young male muses during their shoots – “Another dig at his mangled nipple elicits a high-pitched, piggy squeal” – that leaves the reader queasy.It is all a bit American Psycho, if Patrick Bateman were a consistently underestimated pretty girl. And it is hilariously sardonic take Irina’s derisive verdict on her on-again-off-again best friend Flo’s taste in men: “She likes that white-bread, absolute fucking baguette of a lad from Call Me by Your Name.”Have her parents read it? “They have not,” says Clark. One, because it’s so explicit and she feels grossed out by the thought of their doing so. And two, she’s worried they will think she based Irina’s parents on them. “Her mum’s this absurd harpy and her dad’s this weird, spineless, Freudian … and my parents aren’t like that! I suppose I’m going to have to let them at some point. It’s just, as far as my parents are aware, I’ve never had sex, I’ve never taken drugs, and I definitely don’t know what the member of a man looks like.”Chatting via Zoom, Clark is gentler than I’d anticipated from her book, but just as entertaining. “In my head things are often a bit darker than I think they are, and then I read them back and realise they’re actually quite funny,” she says of her sense of humour. “Or the other way around, I think they’re funny and then someone else reads them and is like, ‘This is fucking horrible.’”The fact that she grew up in Newcastle means she is regarded as a erse voice in the publishing world. She recently wrote on Twitter: “a good thing about me is that you can enjoy my book without finding out that i went to oxbridge and my parents are both famous journalists like 6 months later and feeling somewhat betrayed.”“It’s insane,” she says, of this perception. “Ultimately, I’m a white woman who grew up relatively comfortably and is university-educated, and yet, because I went to state school and I’m from the north-east and I have a regional accent and a working-class background, I’m erse.” She had a similar experience when she finished school and went to Chelsea College of Arts: “I went from being in Newcastle, and being fairly privileged compared to lots of people, to going down to London and being like – ah no, I’m actually rough as arsehole. None of these people have ever set foot in a working men’s club.”In Clark’s eyes, the north-south ide has become more of a metropolitan-rural one, partly because every city in the UK now has its own big university. But the lack of funding and opportunities in the north, and particularly the north-east, is still a problem. “There are these amazing, scrappy DIY scenes all over the UK, but national and international success is preserved for a privileged handful of people who have connections.”Not just personal connections but geographical connections, too – publishing is concentrated in London, and the ability to live and write there relies on being able to afford it, while also having the time and space to be creative. Clark began writing Boy Parts in 2018 after working in a string of bars and retail jobs and receiving a grant from New Writing North, as part of a fund dedicated to talented writers aged between 15 and 25.“Part of me does think that London is this complete capitalist cesspit where all of the money goes and where dreams go to die,” she says, deadpan. “But at the same time I do really like it. I love how varied it is, in terms of the stuff you can do and the people who live here.”The American Psycho comparison is apt in many ways, one being that Irina can get off scot-free because she’s hot. “People always conflate beauty with goodness … I can just cry a bit, talk like I’m daft, tease my hair up like a televangelist,” she scoffs. Clark is interested in the way people treat others better when they are dressed nicely or are conventionally good-looking, and how that manifests, “even casual things like getting free stuff at Pret”.She never wanted Irina to be “nice”. “Her voice was originally quite similar to my own, then I went back and stripped out all the self-deprecation. She was more likable, and anxious, and self-effacing – then I made her nastier, and nastier, and nastier,” Clark says. The notion that characters – especially female ones – ought to be likable is something authors often have to fight against. “There’s this expectation that women should be nurturing and comforting, even in books, and that’s absurd,” she adds, citing a Goodreads review of Melissa Broder’s The Pisces, which criticised the book because the protagonist was mean to a dog. (Together with her partner, Clark runs the Twitter account @GoodreadsBazaar, which is dedicated to nonsensical Goodreads reviews.)Still, the one thing that has tripped Clark up is the thought that people might project Irina on to her. “I’m a nice person,” she says. “And I’m very concerned about whether I’m liked or not.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/572109a94f3c138356e9cfa2a7907ddfbd4f3ad1/18_170_4792_2875/master/4792.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=893808d065d260e00150075bad88a462","title":"burrito dining chain chilango prepares to enter administration","story":"Small investors who sank millions into ‘burrito bond’ could lose most of their moneySmall investors who sank millions of pounds into a “burrito bond” scheme could lose most of their cash after the Chilango dining chain said it planned to call in administrators.The collapse may lead to the closure of the group’s 12 Mexican-themed restaurants, with the potential loss of 152 jobs.More than 1,000 investors bought £5.8m worth of mini-bonds in two fundraising efforts by Chilango, the most recent of which ended in April last year.Bond holders were given the chance to cash out or to convert their investments to preferential shares. It is understood that only about 20 cashed out and the process of conversion was not completed in the light of poor trading during the pandemic.A string of casual dining chains including Pizza Express and Azzurri, the owner of Zizzi and Ask, are planning to close outlets. The sector was already suffering from rising costs and falling visitor numbers before the pandemic forced them to close outlets for weeks.Chilango said it was looking for a buyer but had been hit hard by lockdown.“No business could have foreseen the impact the coronavirus crisis would have on our industry, with few sectors being hit harder by the pandemic than hospitality,” the group said.“During this period we have done our very best to mitigate the pandemic’s impact, operating as much as is safely possible while implementing the various government support measures available.

Registration began last week and outlets can sign up at any time until the last day of the scheme.Starbucks has not yet signed up while other businesses – including “wet-led” pubs, which do not offer food, and smaller outlets, which could struggle to serve customers safely – are still weighing up whether it makes business sense for them to join.To help prospective diners identify participating restaurants, the government has designed posters to display in windows, on walls and on restaurant tables. A website is expected to launch in the next few days to allow diners to search for local restaurants before it goes live on 3 August.Customers do not need a voucher, as participating establishments will apply the discount to their bill. Businesses will reclaim the discounted amount through an online service, supported by HMRC. Claims can be made on a weekly basis and will be paid into bank accounts within five working days.An HMRC spokesperson said: “Although restaurants and establishments can register now for the scheme, some may choose not to register until the scheme is launched to the public. Businesses are working hard to ensure their premises are Covid-safe and have plenty of time to sign up.

Photographs by  Carly EarlThere is a place on a Boeing 747 that you’ve probably never seen.At the back of the giant plane there is a panel that opens up to an incredibly narrow set of stairs. Squeeze your way up these and you come to a small cavity where eight slender beds are wedged in Jenga-style configuration, with curtains for privacy.It’s like the basement in Parasite, but in the sky, and more cramped.You have to ask yourself how anyone could sleep up here without having a panic attack. But the crew of a 747 has to do just that – or at least used to.The secret room is just one of a number of oddities that will soon disappear forever. The 747 – the original jumbo jet – is soon to be no more.Qantas’s last model departed Sydney for the final time on Wednesday, bringing to an end five decades of service. The planes, with their distinctive shape of a hump-like upper deck, have been flying in Australia since 1971.The retirement was always on the cards, but the date was brought forward six months due to the ravaging effects of Covid-19 on the aviation industry. This week British Airways also retired their 31-strong fleet of 747s, citing the pandemic and a major downturn in travel.But before the curtain fell on a piece of aviation history and the plane flew off to the Mojave desert in the US, the  was invited on board for a last look.The tour had a dystopian edge. Without the aircon or lights on, the cabin was super-hot and dark. Entering via the back of the plane, there was a gaping hole where the seats in rows 61 to 64 had been ripped out. The carpet was gashed where the seats had been.On the plastic around the windows and the armrests were messages scrawled in texta: “Goodbye 747 you’ll be missed – 25 years of flying with you was a pleasure”, “Kim was here :) Farewell Queen”.The disorientating effect of boarding the plane (a plane without passengers, a plane that was not going to take you anywhere, a plane with seats missing) was intensified when surveying the airport. Apart from one tiny plane, no flights were taking off. Aircraft were parked. The runways were empty. There were no passengers.There was so much symbolism, it seemed to be screaming: “An epoch is ending!”Qantas Group CEO Alan Joyce said in a statement that the 747 was significant as it bought in a new era of lower fares and nonstop flights.“It’s hard to overstate the impact that the 747 had on aviation and a country as far away as Australia. It replaced the 707, which was a huge leap forward in itself but didn’t have the sheer size and scale to lower airfares the way the 747 did. That put international travel within reach of the average Australian and people jumped at the opportunity,” Joyce said.Although beloved by passengers and crew alike, the 747s were environmentally unsound, often cited as a worst-offending model by Heathrow when it published its league tables of the noisiest, most polluting airlines.But there was no doubt in talking to pilots and engineers, that this plane was deeply loved.There is nostalgia for the 747 because perhaps more than any other plane, it required immense magical thinking. This hulking thing, this beast, was going to lift off the ground and take you and 400 other people all drinking cocktails and watching movies from Sydney to London.“Everything works really well. There is nothing cumbersome about it,” said Cameron. “It looked cumbersome when I first saw it – I was struck by the pure size. I have a fair understanding of aerodynamics, but watching it take off you think, ‘that shouldn’t happen’”.It shouldn’t, but it did. Over and over again.The story of the manufacturing of the first Boeing 747 is legendary.A workforce of 50,000 that called itself “the Incredibles” built the aircraft in less than 16 months.John Sutter, Boeing’s 747 engineer, wrote of the 1969 maiden flight: “I saw Boeing’s new jet as 75,000 drawings, 4.5 million parts, 136 miles of electrical wiring, five landing gear legs, four hydraulic systems, and 10 million labour hours.”Before the end of our little tour we were taken into the cockpit that felt like being inside the guts of an old IBM super-computer, with buttons, levers and knobs that went from the dashboard right up to the roof.Then we each got a turn at sitting in business class in the big old leather (or leather-feel) chairs that had a scotch, cigar and fireplace vibe. Once you sank into a business class seat, it was difficult to get up.Around 4pm, Qantas had to move the plane from the hanger. We all got off and stood on the bridge.The enormous plane was pushed out on wheels that seemed comically too small to carry such weight. But it moved gracefully, and although not airborne, seemed to glide across the tarmac, more like an ocean liner than a plane. The word magisterial came to mind.The scene in the hangar, as the plane was towed out, felt reminiscent of a funeral procession, where people line the roads and pay respects as the hearse rolls by slowly.But here, engineers and maintenance workers stood on the bridge, watching the plane roll out, their arms outstretched, filming the departure on their cameras. It was a moment that almost seemed choreographed, it was so like a salute."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4de9ef24b06c7eb6e40ac6d8fedf24b46dd40116/270_578_4508_2706/master/4508.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64ea4b7f4a6b0b8e79ea5e8bbd724062","title":"recovery deal eu unifying economic boost integration","story":"The huge economic boost breaks important political taboos, and suggests a willingness for more integrationIt was a long time coming, but the coronavirus crisis seems to have allowed Europe to make a leap towards genuine integration. The global financial crisis in 2008 exposed the inherent fragilities and incompleteness of Europe’s monetary union, prompting a decade of agonising debate over fiscal union. Essentially, sharing a common currency without sharing a real budget was always going to be unstable and potentially dangerous .But now European leaders seem to be finally facing up this profound architectural problem. Common debt, common expenditure and the possibility of common taxation – which all seemed out of reach over the last decade – were accepted this week unanimously after a marathon summit that lasted more than four days.The €750bn recovery and resilience package is far from perfect. From a macroeconomic standpoint, it is too small and too slow to respond alone to the depth of the shock imparted by the epidemic and the economic shutdown. From a practical standpoint, the governance is too complex – it requires national governments to present reform programmes before they can receive funds. But from a political standpoint, by agreeing both to pool part of the economic response to the economic crisis and by authorising transfers between member states, the agreement breaks important taboos.It is the combination of these political realities that can make this a meaningful recovery package. Reluctantly for some, gone are the days when weaker eurozone countries could only hope for European loans with austerity conditions attached. Indeed, member states whose public finances were shaky can now point to a political backing for their increased government expenditure. The European Central Bank can now feel that its sovereign debt purchase programme, which effectively mutualises debt, is unanimously sanctioned by European governments.But the agreement also raises a number of questions. First, in order to finance this recovery fund, member states had to agree to cut some of the most important and future-oriented parts of the EU budget, in particular in research, healthcare and the green-energy transition. Luckily, the European parliament that has to approve the deal is already threatening to block it if these critical spending items are not revisited.Second, because the compromise required unanimity there is only a very superficial control of the compliance of the spending with the EU’s climate objectives and, perhaps more importantly, there is no clear mechanism for ensuring that recipient countries abide by the essential rule of law and democratic values enshrined in European treaties. These concessions were particularly key to enlist the support of eastern European countries such as Hungary – which is effectively a one-party state – and Poland, but they create a fundamental dilemma for the EU and its cherished values.Third, a coalition of small countries led by the Netherlands (including Denmark, Sweden, Austria and at times Finland), dubbed “the frugals”, extracted a number of important concessions such as getting rebates for their contributions to the EU budget. This is a practice that had been originally requested by the Thatcher government in the 1980s and has since become a fixture of European budgetary negotiations – but it also a mechanism that allows them to veto disbursements if they are displeased with economic reforms undertaken in southern economies.Finally, the critical weakness of the agreement, and what certainly makes it fall short of a real “Hamiltonian leap”, is the lack of a clear commitment to common European taxation. (Alexander Hamilton propelled the United States into a true federation by engineering the government takeover of the debts of inidual states in the 18th century.) Indeed, the agreement has the merit of setting some important milestones in 2021 and 2023 for agreeing some level of “own resources” to the EU budget (a shorthand euphemism for European taxation) but it falls short of naming them clearly and of opening a real debate about a common European tax. A pan-continental corporate or carbon tax will be necessary sooner than later, unless Europeans want to entertain the illusion that this new borrowing can somehow be repaid ex-nihilo.There is a profound irony, but maybe not a coincidence, that the EU is making strides towards integration at a time when it is severing its ties to the United Kingdom. A negotiation like this one would have certainly been derailed by the current British government. But while this agreement opens new possibilities, it also points to new fractures. For decades, it has been quietly assumed that France and Germany could call the shots alone. But the intense negotiations and compromises show that they can no longer carry the day on their own.The growing powers of a growing coalition of small countries, willing to use their vetoes, as well as the internal isions inside European political parties (the socialists, the European People’s party and the liberals), suggests that the institutional and constitutional overhaul that is required for the EU to stand more firmly on its feet will be long and hard.• Shahin Vallée is a French economist, and was an adviser to Emmanuel Macron when he was economy minister"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f361e76a5d1fe02c1fdf3e1fa8607c8339ac85c2/0_70_3726_2235/master/3726.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06be0cc7749718242154a5f64ac35ae4","title":"schoolgirls in england have you been informally excluded","story":"We’d like to hear from girls – or their parents – who have been excluded from a school in England via informal methods Girls are being informally excluded at a higher rate than boys from some schools in England, according to a study by not-for-profit group Social Finance.While boys are much more likely to be formally excluded, research shows girls are being excluded through moves to other schools or by leaving one school before the end of year 11 and not finishing their studies elsewhere.

Here are six other cultures to look to for a thrilling grillBarbecue talk is usually delivered in an American accent. The land of pit ribs and tattooed barbecue bros has come to dominate how we perceive grilling outdoors. Yet people cook over charcoal and flames all around the world. Looking for fresh barbecue inspiration this summer? It is time to broaden your horizons.Cooking outdoors is standard in the Philippines. “You’re probably considered middle-class if you have an inside kitchen,” says Rachel Stockley, a chef of Filipino heritage who cooks at Baratxuri in Manchester.“Like Thai food, Filipino is all about hot, sour, sweet, salty flavours,” says Stockley, with sawsawan dipping sauces essential in that. Commercial versions can include a variety of ingredients, even strawberries, but the basic recipe is equal parts white sugar cane vinegar or rice wine vinegar and light soy mixed with finely diced white onion, garlic, chilli, lime juice and fish sauce – “Filipino patis if you can get it.”“That condiment or salsa is used with everything from barbecued pork belly to grilled tilapia,” says Stockley, but building in those four dimensions of flavour can begin much earlier, too. Before it is grilled, explains Mary San Pablo, the owner of London supper club and delivery kitchen Luto, pork or chicken is “half-brined, half-marinated” in an approximate mix of equal parts lemonade (usually 7Up or Sprite), soy sauce and sugar cane vinegar (watered-down cider vinegar, alternatively), with added garlic and pepper and sometimes extra sugar and banana ketchup. Lemongrass is also beaten into the marinade and then used as a brush to baste the meat as it caramelises on the grill.San Pablo recommends marinating skewers of interspersed fatty pork belly and shoulder overnight: “You want a deep flavour penetration.” Serve your pork or chicken with grilled corn or barbecued aubergines, scooping out the flesh and topping it with tomatoes, chopped shallots and toyomansi, a mix of soy and juice from the Philippines’ beloved calamansi citrus fruit. You can substitute lemon and lime for calamansi, but, if you are really keen, Ikea sells small calamansi, AKA calamondin, trees and San Pablo has harvested “quite a lot of juice” from these.“From an early age going to St Vincent, I vividly remember the Friday night ‘jump-off’ – barbecues where there’d be various meats in West Indian spices, jerk chicken being the classic,” says James Cochran, chef-owner at London’s Around the Cluck.Sides of fried plantain, spinach-like callaloo and rice and peas can be cooked ahead and served cold so you can concentrate on barbecuing. But, says Shaun McAnuff, half of Jamaican food exponents Original Flava, jerk-seasoned vegetables and even fruits are increasingly common at Jamaican barbecues, partly inspired by the vegetarian Ital diet followed by many Rastafarians. McAnuff also suggests abandoning burger buns for festival, a sub-shaped, slightly sweet fried cornmeal roll: “They’re predominantly eaten with fish but they’re great for carnival street food and barbecues, hence the name.”To drink, Cochran demands rum punch: “Rum, grenadine and nutmeg with orange, pineapple or guava juice, shaken with loads of ice. Lethal!”“There is no such thing as Indian food,” says the food writer and chef Romy Gill. “It’s very regional. We all speak different languages, look different, eat different.”That variety offers plenty of barbecue inspiration for dishes such as Gill’s Punjabi-style chicken wings marinated in ginger, garlic, fresh turmeric, honey, green chillies and lime juice, or her Keralan-style beef or jackfruit ribs flavoured with tamarind chutney, tandoori masala spices, ginger and garlic. “Cook them on a quick high burst of heat,” advises the Ready Steady Cook regular, “and then gently so the outside is charcoaled dark and the inside beautifully pink.”Across the wider Indian subcontinent, the opportunity to drill down into specific authentic flavours is endless, says Sumayya Usmani, Pakistani food expert and the owner of Glasgow’s Kaleyard Cook School and Kitchen. For instance, Afghani-influenced kebabs of skewered lamb use just a light lemon and salt marinade: “The rest of the flavour comes from smaller alternating pieces of lamb fat or dark meat.” Conversely, Karachi’s chicken tikka packs in the spice. Chickens are quartered on the bone and marinated, not in yoghurt, but in lemon juice with ground Kashmiri chillies, ginger, garlic, green chilli paste, salt, ground cumin, garam masala and turmeric: “It’s extremely red and slit so the flavours go right to the bone.”On fine days, even in winter, Alissa Timoshkina’s family would regularly head out into the Siberian woodlands outside Omsk to cook over fire. “It is,” says the author of Salt \u0026amp Time, “a big part of my culinary culture.”Rugged shashlik kebabs of beer-marinated pork or Georgian-style beef, the chunks of meat ided by pieces of onion, were the centrepiece of such meals. The beef is marinated in red wine, tomatoes and onions and, before grilling, is rubbed with the Georgian herb mix khmeli suneli. Specialist suppliers such as Seasoned Pioneers sell it pre-mixed or you could attempt your own. It is complex but apart from a couple of ingredients available from herb nerds such as Steenbergs (summer savory, marigold), uses readily available dried herbs, including (depending which recipe you work from) marjoram, dill, mint, parsley, coriander, fenugreek leaves and seeds, black pepper and bay leaves.The meat would be swiped from the skewer using Armenian lavash flatbreads and perhaps dressed with homemade Georgian chilli sauce known as adjika, thickened with concentrated tomato puree: “In the Soviet days, there were no ready bought sauces.” In summer, shashlik might be bundled together with pickles and salads of seasonal vegetables dressed with unrefined sunflower oil and dominated by “crazy amounts of chopped parsley, dill and coriander, so herbs are the bulk of the salad”. Note: if you cannot find lavash in local Turkish or Kurdish shops, tortillas or chapattis will work as a stand-in.Finally, the family would cook jacket potatoes as the fire subsided, throwing them in without foil and, later, topping them with “really fatty, super-rich sour cream, dill and chopped garlic”, scooping the insides from ashy jackets with a spoon: “We’d have it as a side but it’s a meal in itself.”You might balk at digging up the back garden for pachamanca, Peru’s famous submerged fire-pit feast. But anticuchos, marinated skewers similar to the Japanese yakitori, is a Peruvian obsession we can all get into.“There’s huge tradition behind it,” says the chef at Birmingham’s Chakana, Robert Ortiz, a man who discovered his talent for cooking during a school barbecue contest. “Anticuchos was done at weekends on street corners and families would gather to eat. Now anticucheria restaurants just do the skewers.”Traditionally made with deliciously beefy ox heart and other bits of offal, anticuchos now incorporate everything from chicken to octopus and chorizo. The marinade is always the same, however, based around aji panca, a smoky, fruity chilli you can find dried or in paste form online. The skewers are marinated overnight in (this would cover 40 to 50, for a party), 1kg of pureed rehydrated chillies, let down with water 200g garlic puree four bay leaves 100ml white wine vinegar 60g sugar 40g salt 20g each of cumin and ground black pepper.Serve the anticuchos with boiled and barbecued corn cobs and waxy potatoes (eg Charlotte, Jersey Royals). Dress them with a simple salsa of onion, coriander, fresh chilli and lime juice or aji verde, a smoothly blended sauce of yellow aji amarillo paste, lots of coriander, garlic, onion and a few blobs of mayonnaise. Wash all that down with a pisco sour."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/777bfb9f216680586f584e700574d05af84dda77/0_0_2121_1273/master/2121.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=22afbd3fd9e612b81823f5a8244a421a","title":"liverpool chelsea premier league match report","story":"How fitting that a knee injury did not prevent Jordan Henderson performing his now customary shuffle before lifting the Premier League trophy at an empty yet joyful Anfield.In a season like no other, nothing has stood in the way of Jürgen Klopp’s remarkable force and the piece of silverware Liverpool have craved for over 30 years. The wait finally ended last month. The party really got going during, and especially after, another piece of history was made against Chelsea.Before climbing the steps to a specially constructed podium on the Kop to receive the title from Sir Kenny Dalglish, Liverpool’s players served up one more rousing and hugely entertaining display to end the league season unbeaten at Anfield. They have now gone three successive league campaigns without defeat on home soil.No other team in Liverpool’s illustrious history achieved that feat. A 59th unbeaten home game arrived courtesy of outstanding goals from Naby Keïta, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Roberto Firmino and the substitute Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain – plus a more prosaic effort from Georginio Wijnaldum – and with a reminder to Chelsea of how far they have to go to be considered challengers at this level.Frank Lampard’s side could have secured Champions League qualification with a point at Anfield but, despite a late recovery inspired by the substitute Christian Pulisic, defeat means their hopes of a top-four finish will be decided on the final day.Chelsea were the more dangerous team until Keïta opened the scoring with a stunning effort, but it was to Liverpool’s immense credit that the post-match party never distracted from their duties on the pitch. And there was plenty to distract them. The fireworks started over an hour before kick off in nearby Stanley Park and intensified over Anfield throughout the game. A group of approximately 100 Liverpool fans ignored pleas to keep away and gathered on Anfield Road to greet the team bus. A security cordon kept them at a distance from the stadium but Merseyside police had to issue a dispersal order as crowd numbers increased during the night.Lampard’s team were in the ascendancy when the contest turned in the blink of Liverpool’s relentless pressing and Keïta’s unstoppable finish. The Guinea international, having dispossessed Willian with help from Wijnaldum, seized on the loose ball and had only one intention as he bore down on Kepa Arrizabalaga’s goal. His thunderous shot beat the Chelsea goalkeeper convincingly from 25 yards, kissing the underside of the crossbar on its way as the Liverpool bench exploded with joy.Alexander-Arnold doubled the champions’ advantage with another memorable free-kick reminiscent of his recent goal against Crystal Palace. Mateo Kovacic was eventually, and correctly, adjudged to have fouled Sadio Mané by the referee Andre Marriner, prompting a furious exchange between Lampard and the Liverpool assistant manager, Pepijn Lijnders. Chelsea’s manager was unhappy at Lijnders leaping from the bench after the foul. He sat back down, only to spring back up again as Alexander-Arnold swept the set piece past a rooted Arrizabalaga from almost 30 yards. The keeper’s movement, and lack of homework on the Liverpool full-back, were poor.Number three arrived when Andy Robertson’s corner caused havoc inside the Chelsea penalty area. Olivier Giroud’s headed clearance struck Jorginho’s arm and, while Mohamed Salah appealed for a penalty, Wijnaldum volleyed the loose ball into the roof of the Chelsea net. It was the 11th goal that Lampard’s team had conceded in their last four away matches.Liverpool were a class apart from the moment Keïta struck but Giroud gave Chelsea a glimmer of hope when he prodded home in first-half stoppage time, converting after Alisson had saved superbly from Willian. The glimmer was quickly extinguished.A strange quirk of Liverpool’s campaign was Firmino’s failure to score a single league goal at Anfield despite being fundamental to their success. That minor blemish was erased in fine style when Alexander-Arnold produced a perfect cross and the Brazilian, powering in ahead of Kurt Zouma and César Azpilicueta, headed past Arrizabalaga.Chelsea could have been routed before a triple substitution by Lampard sparked improvement. Salah missed two excellent chances to become the first Liverpool player since Roger Hunt in 1965-66 to score 20 goals in three successive seasons.The visitors reduced the arrears again when Pulisic weaved his way past three Liverpool defenders and centred for his fellow substitute Tammy Abraham to tap home. Abraham returned the favour with a cross that Pulisic took on his chest before beating Alisson, but Oxlade-Chamberlain sealed the win in style when Liverpool broke superbly from a Chelsea free-kick.

Dalglish, a late substitute when Liverpool last received the championship on 1 May 1990, performed the honours while families of the players watched from the main stand. They had been allowed in after a U-turn by the local safety advisory group, on condition they watched the game on televisions in the stand. Klopp broke from the throng to salute his wife and two sons in the small crowd while ticker-tape fell all around and fireworks continued to explode into the night sky. Henderson, injured yet still shuffling, lifted the trophy and 30 years of frustration along with it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d6fd07c215ccff8593e831966ba2416832a224b/0_55_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f5e15388efc7d202cd74f2e19d70290","title":"manchester united west ham premier league match report","story":"Mason Greenwood’s 17th goal of the season places him alongside George Best, Wayne Rooney and Brian Kidd as Manchester United’s most prolific teenagers in a single campaign.More important his second-half equaliser means Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s side moved a point ahead of Leicester and need only draw at the King Power on Sunday to seal a top-four place and Champions League qualification: a demand the manager would have accepted during the dark days of winter.The issue for Solskjær is how tired United look and how he must somehow rouse them for one last salvo to ensure the Foxes do not end their league season in deep disappointment.“We’ve given ourselves a fantastic opportunity and a great starting point for Sunday,” he said. “We know we’re going to play against a very good team – they are very dangerous – we’ll be ready physically and mentally.”Solskjær retained the error-prone David de Gea, while Timothy Fosu‑Mensah came in for Aaron Wan‑Bissaka at right-back. West Ham’s goal difference made them all but safe and David Moyes sent out an unchanged XI.United’s intent was shown when Bruno Fernandes slid Anthony Martial in along the right. The centre-forward dipped a shoulder and forced a sharp save from Lukasz Fabianski. Greenwood did precisely the same moments later and United’s tempo was already higher than Sunday’s soporific pace when they were being knocked out of the FA Cup by Chelsea. Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:audio.guim20200721-31139-gnl.fsof.20200721.ds.white_ball.mp3 Fosu-Mensah, Fernandes, Nemanja Matic, Paul Pogba, Martial and Marcus Rashford were next to probe. Yet United’s rearguard had a scare when Aaron Cresswell swung a free-kick over from the left and the ball bounced straight across De Gea’s goal.United’s forte is attack: a dipping Rashford pass that found Fernandes in the clear was illustrative though the latter’s touch let him down. After a too-high Martial shot, Michail Antonio forced a corner that Fernandes inadvertently flicked on and Harry Maguire had to clear.West Ham were dangerous but only when allowed to be. A Rashford dash down the left channel turned a clutch of visiting defenders the wrong way and showed that when United hit higher gear they were a class above.Next came a patient attack that went from wing-to-wing that ended with Fernandes pulling the trigger from long range – a sign of how robust West Ham were proving.Then, Brandon Williams got the wrong side of Jarrod Bowen, Matic intervened and West Ham had a corner. This was taken short to the excellent Bowen and Angelo Ogbonna had a free header but he failed to work De Gea.The latest in a catalogue of first-half shots from United was fired at Fabianski by Rashford and the goalkeeper had to beat this one away. What United lacked was incision – when Williams did get in behind West Ham and his cross found Fosu-Mensah, he volleyed weakly.Disaster struck for United from a free-kick. Declan Rice struck his shot at the wall, Pogba raised his arms to protect his face, the ball hit a hand and VAR awarded a penalty. Michail Antonio made no mistake from the spot.While Pogba reportedly apologised to his teammates, Solskjær said: “Paul’s held his hand up – he knows he should have taken it in the mush.”At the interval a sharp word – or three – was required from Solskjær, who replaced Fosu-Mensah with Wan-Bissaka. Now, finally, United clicked: Pogba fed Greenwood who fed Martial, who returned the ball. A second one-two between the pair ended with Greenwood in, and the 18-year-old smashed home for his 10th league goal.Solskjær said of the scorer: “He’s bailed us out a few times, he’s done it again and he’s been top class.”United had wrested momentum. Suddenly Williams was surging into the area and Bowen pushed him over but VAR was not interested. De Gea had to be: a Bowen snap-shot that hit Williams had the keeper making a fine fingertip save in what was another West Ham warning. “David showed why we keep him in that goal with that great save,” said Solskjær.This had become about United maintaining control and ensuring their unbeaten league run stretched to 13 games. The best method was to operate in the opposition half, yet West Ham had their moments. A Mark Noble free-kick that Rashford jumped out of way of summed United’s jitters up but they hung on.Moyes said of his side: “They deserved a point,” and it confirmed survival. For United it is all about Leicester on Sunday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4510155e119e6599f9c40c5d0609fc80a5870907/0_0_4053_2432/master/4053.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2dcbb8ac6fe4e3cd28613f226259b43d","title":"womens transfer window 2020 wsl frauen bundesliga femminile serie a d1 feminine primera iberdrola","story":"Latest deals and club-by-club guides for the WSL and leagues in Italy, France, Germany and Spain"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50477e86a44e0ce9d55227e464a5065ed6e90c02/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=577374e599b3cbf02751c5bc4453bd52","title":"cuddle therapy coronavirus social distancing virtual","story":"Social distancing nixed a calming practice based on physical touch, forcing practitioners and clients to find a virtual optionWhen Jean Franzblau, the founder of Cuddle Sanctuary in Los Angeles, first heard of a contagious virus spreading across the globe in March, she set stringent policies for all participants: wash your hands the moment you arrive to a cuddle don’t come if you feel ill if a client appears sick or is coughing, a cuddle session leader may send them home.“We implemented that for two events, a Wednesday and a Saturday. And then we were closed,” said Franzblau, who won’t reopen until a vaccine is made widely available. “It was so quick: here’s our new protocol and then our protocol is we’re closed. It was very intense and very dramatic.”Professional cuddle organizations like Cuddle Sanctuary aim to provide clients with a sense of calm and bliss, thanks in part to the anxiety-reducing hormone oxytocin which is released in response to positive, social touch, like a hug from a friend or a nuzzle from a dog. First popularized in the early 2000s, professional cuddling aimed to fulfill touch needs for a range of clients including survivors of post-traumatic stress disorder and sexual assault and adults on the autistic spectrum. Now, there are dozens of independent professional cuddling organizations, like Portland’s Cuddle Up To Me, and larger networks of professionals like Cuddlist, who have trained hundreds of touch facilitators nationwide.Research has shown that without physical touch, we’re likely to experience loneliness, depression, anxiety disorders and stress. As the pandemic presses on, clients regularly accustomed to getting their touch needs fulfilled by professional cuddlers struggle to find that relief. But professional cuddlers are finding a way to provide an approximate feelgood sensation from afar. Franzblau and some of Cuddle Sanctuary’s professional cuddlers – those who have completed four online courses, including a 12-day training – are offering virtual cuddle sessions on Zoom.Initially, Franzblau was staunchly against the notion of a virtual cuddle. Without skin-on-skin contact, there would be no way for oxytocin to flow. “I was resistant on a very deep level to offer something that I thought would be value-less or seem like snake oil,” she said. However, after consulting with Cuddle Sanctuary professional cuddlers, the group created a format they believed could leave clients feeling good, albeit only with emotional buy-in from both parties. “There are two elements that must be in place: expertise on behalf of the professional and the willingness to try something new on behalf of the client,” Franzblau said. “We must meet each other halfway to make the magic.”Usually, in a one-on-one cuddle session – which ranges from $80 to $100 an hour and is held in a private room either in the client’s home or the cuddler’s workspace – the client and cuddler first go over current stressors and then engage in an open dialogue about where the client wants to be touched. In group sessions which take place at the Sanctuary and last two hours, a professional cuddling facilitator leads attendees through icebreaker and consent exercises, like how to kindly decline an unwanted hug from a peer. Consent is integral and sessions are always fully clothed, no sexual touching allowed.Online, similar communication still has to occur, but in the absence of interpersonal touch, cuddler and client situate themselves in comfortable positions in their homes, visualizing the sensation of being held by another person and massaging themselves.After self-quarantining alone for over a month in New York City, actor and writer Randy Wade Kelley noticed he, like many others, craved human connection. The 37-year-old had never tried professional cuddling in the flesh, but he was introduced to Cuddle Sanctuary through a friend and decided to give the virtual experience a shot in June. A virtual cuddle session, he imagined, would consist of snuggling with pillows and stuffed animals. Instead, he was instructed by Franzblau to recall a pleasant cuddling experience from the past and to lie in a manner that simulated an embrace. Lying on his side, with one arm stretched beneath his head and the other close to his torso, Kelley reveled in his own grasp while Franzblau supervised from nearly 3,000 miles away.After, Kelley said he felt as if he’d spent the week meditating. In the weeks since the virtual cuddle, he’s returned to the side-lounge position as a way of self-placating when he feels lonely. “There’s no substitution for human touch, but it definitely helps bridge the gap,” he said. “I’m so thankful I’m able to cuddle myself.”The client’s openness in learning to self-soothe in the absence of a physical embrace from a professional has been one of the greatest opportunities for growth, said Fei Wyatt, a professional cuddler with Cuddle Sanctuary. “I can’t make them feel something by touching them,” she said. “They have to pay attention to their own body. My clients are being asked to be a lot more aware, pay a lot closer attention and take responsibility for that.”In addition to touch, emotional awareness is integral to the practice of therapeutic cuddling. Asking a stranger to stroke your hair or caress your back requires vulnerability – and in the process, cuddlers and clients build a verbal and physical rapport. In the midst of the pandemic, to compensate for a lack of physical intimacy, Shawn Coleman, a professional cuddler in Chicago, held virtual events promoting emotional togetherness. Inspired by the 36 questions psychologists believe promote feelings of closeness, Coleman hosted nightly Zoom meetings where participants would answer a question a night for 36 days.While Coleman, who uses gender-neutral pronouns, won’t host an in-person cuddle event at least through the end of the year, they see value in reminding clients of the importance of physical and emotional connection. “We can try to get creative during this time in order to find a way to get our needs met,” they said. “For some people, it’s very much around touch, but also for some people it’s not a touch requirement, it’s a connection requirement or an intimacy requirement.”For Teron Mobley, a furloughed restaurant worker in Chicago, virtual cuddle sessions more easily facilitate an emotional bond through meaningful eye contact, something the 35-year-old struggles with in his daily life due to social anxiety, he said. After a year of monthly professional cuddling sessions with Madelon Guinazzo, the co-founder and director of training at Cuddlist, an online directory and training platform for cuddle therapists, Mobley experimented with his first virtual cuddle in early June. Because he can’t currently touch Guinazzo, he built intimacy by gazing into her eyes on his computer screen. “It’s a powerful thing to look into someone’s eyes,” Mobley said. “After that I was like, hmm, actually, this could work. We can’t actually cuddle but it’s some sort of connection.”Mobley is open to another virtual session but eagerly awaits when Guinazzo opens her books for in-person sessions. She has no plans at this time to do so, she said. For both cuddler and client alike, nothing quite compares to the real thing.“It’s like when you’re used to having your favorite meal, let’s say lasagne, and then somebody says here’s a substitute lasagne,” Guinazzo said of the virtual cuddling experience. “It’s OK as long as you’re expecting it not to taste like lasagne.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46c98d85791ec46886f1caf63c13090cca5003c1/0_91_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=dad6d9506e50453cef51e0321aa9ee33","title":"cardiacs tim smith a one man subculture who inspired total devotion","story":"Tim Smith, who has died aged 59, made a bizarre kind of rock music that was so wrong it was right – and his boundless enthusiasm was so infectious it created an army of followersIf Tim Smith influenced you, he really influenced you. His legacy following his death aged 59 might be small in the wider realm of pop, but for many of us it feels disproportionately massive. If you ventured far enough into his chaotic world of sound – somewhere between pop, psych, punk and prog – it would inevitably become an all-encompassing love.The music he created, primarily with his band Cardiacs, pushed the standard structures of rock music into bizarre patterns: resolutely British, with any hint of Americana cast aside in favour of hymns, marches and misshapen folk melodies. The idiosyncratic sequences of chords he assembled were, in any traditional sense, completely wrong, but through sheer buoyancy of spirit they became unwaveringly right. At gigs, his music inspired devotion of the like I’ve never seen before or since. Countless friendships blossomed as a direct result of his work whole families of groups were formed, all radiating from Tim.The last gig I was involved with before lockdown was a celebration of Tim’s lesser-known work, a project initiated by our mutual friend, Richard Larcombe, and performed by a somewhat nervous group of five of us. We worked for weeks on this one-off show, trying to get under the skin of his music, as its magic unfolded in a series of “ah!” moments. Tim admitted a couple of years ago that his intricate compositions were largely instinctive. “I had no idea the tunes just happened,” he said. “They just come out of my stupid head. I am not one of these people what can hear a note and know what it is.” And yet their intricacy belies his modesty. One exquisite and deceptively complex piece, Dergo, became known as Fucking Dergo in rehearsals – but at the finale of the gig, we nailed it. Tim, who had been living in care homes since a stroke in 2008 robbed him of most of his movement and speech, watched us via the internet. After the show, the camera turned to the crowd, who waved to him, saluting his genius.Cardiacs, formed in the late 1970s, were the ultimate high-concept band. The singular nature of the music was bolstered by Tim’s carefully constructed myth of an exploitative organisation, the Alphabet Business Concern, who dictated Cardiacs activities and held them to account. Their extraordinary live show was characterised by colour, chaos and (fake) cruelty. Early cohorts of the band tell of venues being transformed into psychedelic grottoes which took teams of people hours to assemble, all working for free in a typical display of devotion. Cardiacs would then perform their hearts out, dressed as filthy soldiers with smeared makeup. In an independent music scene where nonchalance was prized and effort derided, Tim and his band tried harder than anyone. And they never broke character.It won them few fans in the media, but Tim wasn’t overly bothered. According to one legendary story, an unfortunate journalist was sent to meet the band on their Surrey home turf in the middle of summer. They dressed up in full stage gear, crammed into a Mini, kept the windows closed, turned the heating up and chain-smoked cigarettes. Tim instructed them to spray their clothes with water to create a hideous fug. The radio was tuned to static. The journalist was collected from the station and had to cram in the back for the duration of the interview. The car never went above 15mph. Cardiacs were undoubtedly awkward bastards.And yet in person, Tim was the opposite. His bandmates speak of a generous hippy, a man who made everyone feel good about themselves. He was no extrovert, but was certainly a magnet. He ran an open house, welcomed you in, and offered limitless reserves of enthusiasm and support. He always said that his favourite music was his friends’ music. He’d go to your gigs, and he’d stand at the front.After standing at the front of a My Bloody Valentine show in June 2008, he was felled by a stroke on his way to the station. He spent the next 12 years wrestling with his condition, with the support of friends who’d play him music and converse with him as he painstakingly spelled out letters on a specially constructed board. A fundraising appeal to help with his care, launched in January 2018, raised more than £125,000, and it led to sufficient improvement in his condition for him to plan a move back to his old house in Wiltshire. Sadly, he never made it.“He was always looking forward to being in Cardiacs when he was old,” said a friend and colleague. “Twenty years ago or more he was saying that this absurd music would be so much more impressive emanating from a bunch of old men.” But there, Tim was wrong. It was impressive then, and it will be forever."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c666b82d69ddb1714c3af4883aaf7c22f32ec18/0_57_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d2ad60a17f313a72f0c9000a1560eda","title":"kim kardashian requests compassion for kanye wests bipolar disorder","story":"The rapper’s recent string of erratic tweets prompted his wife to comment on his mental health for the first timeKim Kardashian West has spoken for the first time about her husband Kanye West’s bipolar disorder after he posted and deleted a string of erratic tweets regarding his family life after the launch of his presidential campaign in Charleston, South Carolina, on Monday.“Those who are close with Kanye know his heart and understand his words sometimes do not align with his intentions,” she wrote on her Instagram Stories.The fashion and reality TV mogul said she had previously avoided commenting on West’s mental health in order to protect her children and West’s right to privacy. In breaking that silence, she said she wished to address the “stigma and misconceptions” surrounding mental health.She wrote: “Those that understand mental illness or even compulsive behaviour know that the family is powerless unless the member is a minor. People who are unaware or far removed from this experience can be judgmental and not understand that the inidual themselves have to engage in the process of getting help no matter how hard family and friends try.”In the US, involuntary hospitalisation and treatment is deemed to violate an inidual’s civil rights. An inidual must pose a danger to themselves or others in order to be held, for evaluation only, which typically lasts no longer than 72 hours. An elderly or “gravely disabled” person may be placed under a conservatorship. Britney Spears has been subject to such an arrangement since she experienced a breakdown in 2008, which has given rise to controversy over its appropriateness to her situation.West was willingly admitted to hospital in 2016, after an emergency call regarding his welfare during a period of erratic behaviour.Kardashian West added: “I understand Kanye is subject to criticism because he is a public figure and his actions at times can cause strong opinions and emotions. He is a brilliant but complicated person who on top of the pressures of being an artist and a black man, who experienced the painful loss of his mother, and has to deal with the pressure and isolation that is heightened by his bipolar disorder.”West has been subject to more widespread media attention than usual since he announced his presidential campaign in early July. While he is not thought to have filed official paperwork, he has tweeted asking fans to get him on the ballot in certain states.Kardashian West asked the media and the public to give their family “compassion and empathy” and thanked those who had expressed concern for her husband’s wellbeing. “We as a society talk about giving grace to the issue of mental health as a whole, however we should also give it to the iniduals who are living with it in times when they need it the most,” she wrote.West has said he will release a new album, Donda: With Child – named after his late mother – this Friday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5802818c450e69a8cb13a55b63147b8d31921865/0_54_4708_2825/master/4708.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31672eea888ed879cc667435337618c0","title":"is kanye west seriously running for president podcast","story":"The rapper has entered the race for the White House invoking his religious beliefs.

The latest round is expected to end on Thursday without advancing on a deal.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, and his UK counterpart, David Frost, are in the midst of intensified discussions. A fifth round of talks will go ahead as planned next week, with another round scheduled for August unless agreed otherwise.After 47 years and 30 days it was all over. As the clock struck 11pm on 31 January 2020, the UK was officially orced from the EU and began trying to carve out a new global role as a sovereign nation. It was a union that got off to a tricky start and continued to be marked by the UK’s sometimes conflicted relationship with its neighbours.The French president, Charles de Gaulle, vetoes Britain’s entry to EEC, accusing the UK of a “deep-seated hostility” towards the European project.With Sir Edward Heath having signed the accession treaty the previous year, the UK enters the EEC in an official ceremony complete with a torch-lit rally, dickie-bowed officials and a procession of political leaders, including former prime ministers Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home.Margaret Thatcher negotiated what became known as the UK rebate with other EU members after the iron lady marched into the former French royal palace at Fontainebleau to demand “our own money back” claiming for every £2 contributed we get only £1 back” despite being one of the “three poorer” members of the community.It was a move that sowed the seeds of Tory Euroscepticism that was to later cause the Brexit schism in the party.\u0026nbspCollapse of Berlin wall and fall of communism in eastern Europe, which would later lead to expansion of EU.Divisions between the UK and the EU deepened with Thatcher telling the Commons in an infamous speech it was ‘no, no, no’ to what she saw as Delors’ continued power grab. Rupert Murdoch’s Sun newspaper ratchets up its opposition to Europe with a two-fingered “Up yours Delors” front page.A collapse in the pound forced prime minister John Major and the then chancellor Norman Lamont to pull the UK out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism.On 1 January, customs checks and duties were removed across the bloc.

The EU’s preference for a role for the European court of justice is also a sticking point.The prime minister’s official spokesperson said the UK was continuing to engage with the EU constructively. “Round five negotiations are ongoing and we remain committed to working hard to find the outlines of a balanced agreement … but significant differences still remain on a number of important issues,” he said.He added: “The discussions do continue to be constructive and I think that’s been the case throughout this intensified state of the discussions, but equally I think we acknowledge that there are still significant differences on a number of important issues.”Some backbench Conservative MPs are said to be getting nervous that a deal will not be ready in time for the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020.Reports that Frost had said the UK would accept tariffs on certain goods are believed to have added to confusion among the Tory ranks about the government’s position.Labour is also said to be looking closely at recent polling that has shown voters in their former “red wall” strongholds overwhelmingly want Johnson to strike a deal on Brexit rather than walk away from talks.The north and Midlands could bear the brunt of the economic downturn because of the coronavirus pandemic and potential consequences of a no-deal scenario.The UK has piled on pressure to get a quick Brexit deal sealed this month, with Boris Johnson saying in June there was no reason an outline agreement could not be struck in July, urging the EU to put “the tiger in the tank”, a reference to a 1960s Esso slogan.However, his flamboyant approach was immediately punctured by the EU, which said it expected talks to go into September. Charles Michel, the European council president, batted back that the bloc was “ready to put a tiger in the tank but not to buy a pig in a poke”.One senior EU source predicted before the latest round of talks that the UK would try and “inject some drama and theatre” into the talks, with rows seen as a by-product of the tension to create the space for a deal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea0748119492880663b2787ec8c35aa95af20337/0_0_4056_2433/master/4056.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ccc933f3d8faabd789a99f0071c9688","title":"uk employers are you seeing a surge in job applications","story":"We’d like to hear from employers about the number of people applying for jobs.

The concluding round would be played in its entirety the following week before a rest weekend preceding the autumn campaign which will end on 5 December.“The temporary windows have been determined following extensive and productive consultation with international competitions, national unions, professional club competitions and international players,” said World Rugby in a statement. “The rescheduling means clubs will have access to their star southern hemisphere players for the completion of their seasons when they would ordinarily have been on international duty.”Wales will not play their matches at the Principality Stadium as it is set to continue to be used as a surge hospital. The outstanding Six Nations match against Scotland and their other fixtures will either be played elsewhere in Wales or in the London area, depending on whether fans will be allowed back into grounds by then.“The most difficult scenario will be if crowds are allowed in England but not in Wales,” said the Welsh Rugby Union chief executive, Martyn Phillips. “There are clearly a range of risks, not least Welsh fans leaving the country for a match and then returning.”The Premiership is on course to resume on 14 August.

Recommended measures included the scrapping of parachute payments and the possibility of a salary cap on lower league clubs, while the Premier League was called on to “step up” in providing funding for clubs lower down the football pyramid.“The Covid-19 crisis has shone a stark light on the financial issues within football, specifically in the leagues below the Premier League,” the report said. “The Premier League is the main income generator of English football. If it does not step up to help the English Football League, many more clubs will follow in Bury FC’s footsteps.” Bury were expelled from League One in August for financial reasons.“Football must also become more representative,” the report said, calling for more black executives and board members in the game. “We do not believe that the voluntary initiative proposed by the FA will motivate clubs to act with sufficient speed. Instead, we recommend that DCMS revises the Code for Sport Governance, adding targets for BAME representation on boards.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c90414da93270e85a99d66d2ccacfb79117cf96/0_0_1050_630/master/1050.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=774a771a52cb8784d7b2b67bb596083d","title":"dadderrs the lockdown telly show review surreality tv gem is a hoot","story":"Available onlineFrauke Requardt and Daniel Oliver reprise their brave, surreal 2019 show for the coronavirus ageTo this cocktail of surrealism, domesticity and performance-art lampooning, they add a shot of bitters.

His total wealth now makes him worth more than Britain’s biggest company, the pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca which is valued on the stock exchange at £121bn.Bezos’s fortune has been swelled by Amazon’s soaraway share price as hundreds of millions of people trapped at home by coronavirus lockdowns around the world turn to the online delivery giant to keep themselves fed and entertained.Oxfam, the global development charity, said it was “truly shocking” that Bezos had managed to make so much money during the coronavirus crisis, which has forced hundreds of millions of people around the world to rely on food banks and government support.“It is hard to reconcile this obscene figure with the reality the rest of us are living through,” Rebecca Gowland, Oxfam’s head of inequality campaign and policy, said. “At a time when hardship is commonplace, hunger is on the increase and half a billion more people face being pushed into extreme poverty, it is truly shocking that one already extremely wealthy inidual has pocketed another $74bn already this year.”Gowland said it showed global economic policies are “not fit for purpose” and “allow the super-rich to accumulate vast amounts of money at the expense of the rest of us when that money is desperately needed for healthcare and social safety nets”.Bezos’s $189bn fortune, as estimated by Bloomberg Billionaires Index, means he is personally worth more than companies such as Exxon Mobil, Nike or McDonald’s.In the UK, Bezos has more than enough money to buy the big four banks – HSBC, Barclays, RBS and Lloyds – and have enough change left over to pick up British Airways owner IAG as well as Sainsbury’s and Marks \u0026amp Spencer.He has so much money, that his fortune now dwarfs the GDP of Hungary, Ukraine and Qatar. And he is within striking distance of overtaking Greece and New Zealand who are ranked by the World Bank as the 51st and 52nd biggest economies in the world.The $13bn increase Bezos achieved on Monday is the biggest single-day jump in anyone’s net worth since Bloomberg began tracking the daily changes in fortunes of the world’s wealthiest people in 2012.Bezos is now $71bn richer than the next-wealthiest person on the list: Microsoft founder Bill Gates. Gates, who was the world’s richest person until Bezos overtook him, and his wife Melinda have given more than $50bn to charitable causes, including the Bill \u0026amp Melinda Gates Foundation, according to the Chronicle of Philanthropy.Bezos has donated $100m to a food bank charity to help Americans struggling with the economic fallout from the pandemic. Amazon is also pumping $25m into an “Amazon Relief Fund” to support delivery drivers and “seasonal employees under financial distress”.Bezos is unique among the world’s five wealthiest people as the only one not to have signed the Giving Pledge, a philanthropic initiative created by Gates and investor Warren Buffett to encourage the world’s richest people to commit to giving at least half their wealth to charity.Oxfam has called for a windfall tax on huge profits made during the pandemic to help pay for the recovery from the economic destruction wrought by the coronavirus.“The Covid-19 pandemic has exposed deep inequalities and massive failures in our economic system, leaving tens of millions of people in the US without jobs, devastating public services and bankrupting countless small businesses,” Irit Tamir of Oxfam said.“Yet at the same time, thanks to a combination of government assistance and pure luck, a handful of companies are raking it in and making already rich shareholders even richer.”MacKenzie signed the Giving Pledge saying she had “a disproportionate amount of money to share” and promised to work hard at giving it away “until the safe is empty”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ac5624529781c0bdd23e9afcc59b3c8dc382eeb/0_58_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=923ad720d5888066a10590a6245e0347","title":"facebook investigate claims algorithms discriminate ethnic minorities","story":"‘Equity and inclusion’ teams to be assess Facebook and Instagram algorithms for biasFacebook is launching an investigation into whether its algorithms discriminate against minority ethnic groups, after internal protests forced the company to reassess the possibility that its machine learning systems could have picked up on real-world bias.The company’s new “equity and inclusion” teams will be tasked with assessing the algorithms that govern Instagram and Facebook and making sure they are not biased against black, Hiic and other minority ethnic groups. Facebook said the focus would be on “ensuring fairness and equitable product development are present in everything we do”.Vishal Shah, the vice-president of product for Instagram, said in a statement: “The racial justice movement is a moment of real significance for our company. Any bias in our systems and policies runs counter to providing a platform for everyone to express themselves. While we’re always working to create a more equitable experience, we are setting up additional efforts to continue this progress, from establishing the Instagram equity team to Facebook’s inclusive product council.”Algorithmic discrimination has long been a concern of civil liberties watchdogs. For instance, an advertising system that learns who to show adverts to could inadvertently recreate racial biases if it comes to associate a particular race with low incomes.In 2016, the activist and entrepreneur Maciej Cegłowski said: “Machine learning is like money laundering for bias. It’s a clean, mathematical apparatus that gives the status quo the aura of logical inevitability. The numbers don’t lie.”The goal of Facebook’s new teams is to actively seek out such biased approaches and work to ensure the end product treats users of all races fairly.“As we have done for some time, we will continue to work closely with Facebook’s Responsible AI team to ensure we are looking at potential biases across our respective platforms. It’s early, and we plan to share more details on this work in the coming months,” the company said of the initiative.According to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the existence of the equity teams, the company had previously banned such research from taking place without the permission of its senior leadership.

If you can make someone laugh to the point where they lose control of their bodily functions then you’ve done the job you’ve been paid to do – they can’t ask for their money back.I’ve never wet myself laughing, but that’s not to say it’ll never happen ... it just means we haven’t reached peak comedy yet. When I wet myself laughing, all of us comedians can happily retire.The closest I’ve come was probably watching Peter Kay talk about how his family would put a cushion over the VCR when they went on holiday so nobody could think they were rich and try to rob them. It brought back a long-forgotten memory of my family doing exactly the same, and being generally obsessed with our old video recorder and its big rubbery buttons. Trying to set the timer was like being at the controls of Apollo 13.There are three main reasons why people laugh: embarrassment, resonance and surprise, and that joke is the perfect example of resonance for me. It takes me straight back to being a kid a joke that makes you almost wet yourself is a joke you’ll never tire of.While I was pregnant, I used an app to remind me to do my pelvic floor exercises, but I preferred doing them out of sight, where nobody could see my facial expressions. Maybe I’m being paranoid but I’m sure every clench made me wink or do something weird with my eyebrows.I’m glad I kept it up though. My daughter was delivered by caesarean and once that had healed, it was important to me to start walking and taking exercise - I wanted everything, including my pelvic floor, to feel like it was working well.As a mum, I want to demonstrate to my daughter a love of movement, health and wellbeing – I want her to like herself and look after herself. I remember putting her in her bouncy chair so that she could watch me skip in the garden – I say watch, she was probably just wondering what her milk supply was up to.These days I’m a full-time writer and comedian, and I think it’s great that women are so much less apologetic when it comes to talking about so-called women’s issues. I do jokes about accidental leaks, periods, tampons (I mean, really, would a woman have designed something discreet to have bright yellow wrapping?).I love that it’s fine to go on stage and make these jokes. I’m looking forward to talking to my daughter about periods and the patriarchy – I feel lucky that feminism isn’t just an academic theory now, it’s a way for us to examine the world and speak up for ourselves.There’s no way women should feel embarrassed about wetting themselves in public. Men get caught short all the time and when they do, they find the nearest upright structure, and shamelessly relieve themselves.Sadly we don’t have that luxury, but if it happens – because of bladder weakness, pregnancy or comedy – just accept your fate and remember that if you were a man, you’d have had a wall. Laugh it off and remember that in a few weeks, it’ll be a distant memory, and maybe it’ll make for a really great joke.As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

Everyone hunched over, legs crossed, waving their arms going: “Don’t make me laugh, don’t make me laugh.”\u0026nbspIt happened only this week, when I managed to corral my parents into the car to go to our nearest Covid drive-through testing centre, and my dad was so bad at having the test up his nose, and the hysterical nervous energy of the whole thing was so overwhelming, that the whole car was crying with laughter. Our nurse Julie (God bless the NHS) was leaning against our bonnet weeping, going: “Oh my god, I’m going to wee!” It’s maybe the best thing that’s happened all lockdown.But it really got me thinking about bladder weakness, and how I’m rapidly approaching the age group where the statistic “one in three women over 35 experience bladder incontinence” applies. One in three! My school friends have started having babies and are reporting back that the whole bladder situation is indeed “as bad as you imagine”.The messages were pretty clear – you get a few good years, and then everything goes rapidly downhill and one day you’ll have a vaginal prolapse in the middle of Zumba and your whole womb will shoot out. (That’s a real story they used to tell at my school. It happened to the aunt of a friend of a friend, and her womb just shot across the floor.)Maybe we all need to do a little less whispering and little more talking openly. So that if we do experience bladder weakness in some form, as about a third of us will, we’re prepared for it, and ready to laugh – just maybe not too hard. Until then, face it confidently, straight on and tell it to piss off! Here are three pieces of advice to help get you through.1. Talk about itWe’re so good at never, ever mentioning anything even slightly embarrassing. But all that means is that people suffer needlessly in silence, and another whole generation of schoolchildren are confused enough to think an entire womb could shoot out with the velocity of a T-shirt cannon.2. Start those pelvic floor exercises NOWYou can safely ignore everything Gwyneth Paltrow is suggesting about going about your day with two jade eggs and a wasps’ nest up there, and retiring for the evening after a quick crouch over the kettle for a steam. The only really helpful thing you ever need to do is work on strengthening your pelvic floor muscles for a few minutes every day. Practise stopping mid-wee next time you’re on the toilet, release and then stop again. Whatever muscles you used there, those are the ones you need. Practise squeezing during dull moments, or in boring meetings. And start now! No matter how young you are.As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

No wonder there are so many misconceptions about everything from its effect on our sex lives to the best treatmentsIn many ways, incontinence is one of the last taboos when it comes to women’s health. For all the progress that has been made in other sensitive areas – such as women’s reproductive health, miscarriage and abortion – incontinence can still seem shrouded in silence. Culturally, we often joke about wetting ourselves laughing, yet for many of those affected by incontinence, the experience is anything but funny.On a more positive note, says Clare Bourne, a pelvic health physio at Six Physio, the shame that many associated with this issue appears slowly to be dissipating. “I’m seeing a huge shift,” she says. “Lots of women have been in touch with me since I shared some recent work around prolapse. It’s still not being spoken about nearly enough, especially among younger generations, but it was encouraging to receive so many messages from women willing to share their experiences.”According to a study as part of TENA’s #IWillBeMe campaign, six out of 10 women under the age of 34 are worried about bladder leakage as a negative side effect of ageing. Yet it’s not just the over 50s or postnatal women that experience incontinence. “As with many other areas of women’s health, misinformation is rife,” says Bourne. So what are the biggest myths that exist around incontinence in women? And what can women do both to prevent problems and treat symptoms?Myth one: it only happens to women after childbirth or during the menopauseFor many women, the first mention of their pelvic floor in a medical context comes during pregnancy. This has probably contributed to the common misconception that incontinence is associated only with giving birth or, later in life, the menopause. Bourne is keen to debunk these ideas.“Incontinence can happen to anyone, at any time in their life,” she says. “Although, of course, prevalence increases around the time of pregnancy and childbirth due to an increase in pressure on the pelvic floor.” Cases rise again during the menopause when hormone changes can cause the pelvic muscles to weaken, leading to stress incontinence.However, there are many reasons why someone may experience incontinence, says Bourne. She suggests visiting your GP if you have issues, and asking for a referral to a pelvic physio. “Depending on the result of the assessment, there are exercises and treatments that can alleviate symptoms.”Myth two: incontinence is always a sign of a weak pelvic floor“This is one of the biggest myths there is,” Bourne says. “There are multiple reasons why someone might experience urinary incontinence, of which a weak pelvic floor is just one.” In fact, she says, women who struggle to relax their pelvic floor muscles may also have issues with bladder leakage.“We call this a hypertonic pelvic floor, the main symptoms of which are increased urgency and frequency in urinating or pain during sex. Hypertonia can sometimes result in leakage as the muscles cannot perform optimally when stress is placed on them, for example during exercise,” she says. Bourne has found that breathing work is useful for alleviating symptoms, along with learning to relax the muscles with the help of a physio.Myth three: you can’t fix a weak pelvic floorA range of gadgets and apps are available to help strengthen the pelvic muscles. Bourne recommends downloading the NHS’s Squeezy app, which is packed with information on pelvic floor exercises, and sends out reminders when it’s time to do them. Another handy option is the free MyPFF app from Lights by TENA, which lets you track your progress so you can see how you are improving. Bourne is a fan, too, of Pilates, which has been shown to improve functioning of the range of muscles that comprise the pelvic floor area.“Usually coital incontinence occurs in one of two ways,” says Bourne. “Some women leak on penetration and some on orgasm.” Bourne suggests that pelvic floor exercises do often help, but also recommends seeking medical advice and support.Myth five: you’re the odd one outThe shame associated with incontinence is in part a result of our embarrassment, which prevents us from speaking openly about it. Yet there is a whole range of liners, pads and pants available to help manage the condition, and empower users to live life to the full.“Incontinence is nothing to be ashamed of and it certainly shouldn’t be something you feel embarrassed talking to a healthcare professional or friends about,” says Murray. Bourne echoes this sentiment: “I always say to clients, first and foremost: ‘You are not the only one.’ Bladder leakage is far more common than many people realise. Make an appointment with a GP or go and see a pelvic physio – in most cases, there are a range of straightforward solutions that can make a huge difference!”For anyone affected by the issue of incontinence, TENA offers a multitude of different options to help to alleviate symptoms and allow those experiencing them to live comfortably.

Follow the latest updates Even at the best of times, there is a wide scope for misunderstanding in modern international relations, says António Guterres, the UN secretary general. “When two diplomats meet”, he says, “there are at least six perceptions to manage: how the two perceive themselves, how they perceive each other – and how they think the other perceives them”.Four months into the coronavirus epidemic and it is the worst of times – and the opportunities for misperception have multiplied. The virus has left the UN members talking past one another, and advocates of multilateralism increasingly looking anywhere but the security council to promote liberal democracy, seek compromise or campaign for accountability.For Guterres, this is deeply frustrating. He was one of the first world leaders to grasp the seriousness of the pandemic, and saw an opportunity for the 15-strong UN security council to play a convening role:Germany’s coronavirus infections rose 569 to 203,368, data from the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases showed on Thursday, with the tally of deaths up six to stand at 9,101.More on South Korea now from AFP: South Korea’s economy recorded its worst performance in more than 20 years in the second quarter, the central bank said Thursday, as as the coronavirus pandemic hammered its exports.South Korea endured one of the worst early outbreaks of the coronavirus outside mainland China, and while it never imposed a compulsory lockdown, strict social distancing was widely observed from March until it started loosening restrictions in May.The decline was driven by “decreases in motor vehicles and coal \u0026amp petroleum products”, the Bank of Korea said in a statement.South Korea has fallen into recession as the country reels from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.In recent weeks official figures have confirmed that both Japan and Singapore have also gone into recession.But South Korea’s finance minister Hong Nam-ki remains optimistic that the economy will recover swiftly.China plans to provide a $1bn loan to make its coronavirus vaccine accessible for countries across Latin America and the Caribbean, the Mexican foreign ministry said on Wednesday, Reuters reports. Mexico’s foreign ministry said in a statement that China had made the pledge in a virtual meeting between ministers from some Latin American and Caribbean countries.The ticket resale website Viagogo is refusing to refund fans who bought tickets for gigs and sporting events cancelled because of the pandemic, according to the consumer group Which?.Hundreds of summer events have fallen victim to the coronavirus outbreak, with organisers offering to give fans their money back if they do not want to, or cannot, transfer their tickets to 2021.But Viagogo, which has been criticised by the music industry, MPs and campaign groups over its treatment of customers and alliances with powerful ticket touts, is refusing to follow suit:Hong Kong has reported a record 113 new cases for Wednesday, in a continuing third wave of Covid-19 infections, including a large proportion of which are unsourced. The government said the risk of large scale community outbreak was now the highest since the pandemic began.“New cases recorded during the period from July 15 to July 21 include 393 cases without travel history during the incubation period and 56 imported cases,” said a government statement. “The recent emergence of local cases of unknown infection source indicates the existence of sustained silent transmission in the community.”Of Wednesday’s 113 cases, just five were imported and 63 of the local transmissions did not have a known source. Restrictions have now been tightened again.Masks are mandatory at indoor public spaces and outdoor transport hubs, from today for 14 days. People have been largely wearing masks everywhere in the city since the pandemic began.“Many indoor public places would be included, for example, shopping malls, supermarkets, markets, all the covered places, the shops and all that, even building lobbies,” said Secretary for Food \u0026amp Health Prof Sophia Chan.Anyone arriving to Hong Kong from the US or Kazakhstan must now have proof of a negative Covid-19 test in the preceding 72 hours. The two countries join Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines and South Africa, which were already on the list of high risk departure points.The government also extended quarantine orders on arrivals. Hong Kong remains closed to non-residents.Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador on Wednesday downplayed the importance of wearing face masks during the pandemic, calling his treasury secretary’s assertion that using them would be a factor in reactivating the economy “disproportionate”, AP reports. López Obrador had never been seen publicly wearing a mask until he flew to Washington earlier this month to meet with President Donald Trump.“If a mask was an option for the economy’s reactivation, Id put one on immediately,” López Obrador said Wednesday. “But it’s not like that. I follow the recommendations of the doctors, of the scientists.”The World Health Organization recommends the wearing of masks among other measures to slow the spread of Covid-19. At age 66, López Obrador also falls into an at-risk group of people who should wear masks.Mexico continued to report high transmission rates Wednesday, with 6,019 newly confirmed cases, for a cumulative total of 362,274 infections. The Health Department also reported 790 more deaths, bringing the total so far in the pandemic to 41,190, the fourth highest total behind the United Kingdom at 45,586.The European Union has granted Honduras €80m ($93m) in aid to help the impoverished Central American nation’s health system cope with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, an EU representative said on Wednesday. Reuters reports that, despite strict measures to curb the spread of the pandemic, local hospitals have struggled to cope with the number of patients with respiratory illnesses in Honduras, which has registered 35,345 infections and 988 deaths from the virus. NSW recorded 19 new cases of coronavirus in the 24 hours to 8pm yesterday. The number is around what we’ve seen in recent days, with 20 cases recorded on Sunday – at the time the highest one-day total for NSW in three months. The 19 new cases are:In Australia, Victorian state premier Daniel Andrews says the state has recorded 403 new cases overnight, and five new deaths. The cases figure is down from yesterday’s record increase of 484. Four of the people who died were in aged care, Andrews said. Donald Trump has cited Black Lives Matter protests against the police killing of George Floyd as among the likely causes of the recent surge in coronavirus cases.The US president did not blame the anti-racism demonstrations directly but suggested that they “presumably” led Americans to lower their guard against the pandemic.“There are likely a number of causes for the spike in infections cases,” Trump told reporters at his second briefing on the virus in two days following a three-month impasse. “Cases started to rise among young Americans shortly after demonstrations, which you know very well about, which presumably triggered a broader relaxation of mitigation efforts nationwide.”Public health experts say there is little evidence that the protests spread Covid-19 in New York, Chicago, Minneapolis, Washington or other cities. They took place outdoors, where the virus spreads less easily, and most participants wore face masks, which Trump has conceded is an effective preventive measure:More on the White House Cafeteria closing, from NBC: The White House is conducting contact tracing after a cafeteria worker tested positive for coronavirus, three Trump administration officials tell NBC News.The cafeteria in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, or EEOB, was closed this week after the case was discovered, officials said. It was unclear how long the facility will remain closed, although some staffers were told it could remain shuttered for two weeks.Part of the White House complex, the Eisenhower Executive Office Building sits just across West Executive Ave. from the West Wing. It houses the offices of much of the senior White House staff, including officials from the coronavirus task force, the vice president’s office, the National Security Council and several economic policy shops.A cafeteria employee who works in a building where some White House staffers have offices has tested positive for the coronavirus, NBC reports. The White House is doing contact tracing after the worker in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, which is next to the White House, tested positive, NBC News reporter Josh Lederman said on Twitter. The White House Medical Office has determined the risk of transmission of the virus is low, he said.Mexico’s Health Ministry on Wednesday reported 6,019 new confirmed coronavirus infections and 790 additional fatalities, bringing the total in the country to 362,274 cases and 41,190 deaths.The government has said the real number of infected people is likely significantly higher than the confirmed cases.Earlier, Latin America exceeded the 4 million mark after Brazil reported a record number of cases. South Africa on Wednesday announced a record 24-hour increase of 572 coronavirus deaths, bringing its total number of fatalities to 5,940, AFP reports. The country is the worst-affected in Africa and among the top five in the world in terms of confirmed cases, with 394,948 infections reported to date.“Regrettably we report 572 new Covid-19 related deaths. This brings the cumulative number of deaths to 5,940,” Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said in a daily statement.Almost half the total number of deaths have been reported in the Western Cape province, while the majority of positive cases are in Gauteng - South Africa’s financial hub and epicentre of the outbreak.Dr Deborah Birx, the chief medical officer on the White House’s coronavirus task force, has called the surge in infections across the United States, “a very different epidemic than we had in March and April”.Speaking on Fox news, Birx said that the the virus event across the South and West of the US really started after 10 June: “This was an event that we think can be traced to Memorial Day, opening up and people travelling again.”In late May, Memorial Day saw many Americans across the country abandon social distancing guidelines as they sunbathed on beaches and held pool parties for the holiday that traditionally marks the beginning of the US summer.Hello and welcome to today’s live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic with me, Helen Sullivan.

Vaccines for this pandemic are not for the wealthy, they are not for the poor, they are for everybody,” he said.The US government will pay $1.95 billion to buy 100 million doses of a Covid-19 vaccine being developed by Pfizer Inc and German biotech BioNTech if it proves safe and effective, the companies said.Dr Ryan also cautioned schools to be careful about re-opening until community transmission of Covid-19 is under control. Debate in the United States over restarting education has intensified, even as the pandemic flares up in dozens of states.“We have to do everything possible to bring our children back to school, and the most effective thing we can do is to stop the disease in our community,” he said. “Because if you control the disease in the community, you can open the schools.” –Reuters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4311086.1595457023!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"wide ranging reform of nursing home sector recommended by oireachtas committee","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA draft report recommends the Department of Health ‘urgently review clinical oversight and governance arrangements for private nursing homes’. Photograph: Regis DuvignauReutersA draft report by the Oireachtas Covid-19 committee has recommended wide-ranging reform of the nursing home sector, including a governance shake-up and closer oversight of clinical practice. The potential recommendations of the report, seen by The , were drawn up by committee staff and will be discussed by members at a closed session on Thursday. It states that the committee is “of the opinion that the lack of national clinical oversight of care for patients in the private nursing home sector is one of the biggest weaknesses exposed by Covid-19”. It recommends that the Department of Health “urgently review clinical oversight and governance arrangements for private nursing homes”. It also recommends that an independent review be commissioned into the circumstances of all deaths in nursing homes during the pandemic. Submit amendmentsThe draft document is subject to change, with committee members having until next Monday to submit amendments. It also recommends a series of structural reforms, including the integration of private nursing homes into “the wider framework of public health and social care”, and that the care of older people be planned for as part of the implementation of Sláintecare.It also recommends that a review should take place of how patients are allocated under the State’s € 1 billion per annum Fair Deal scheme to ensure their needs are central to any placement and “that patients are not placed in centres which have consistently not complied with Hiqa standards”. Strengthening the role of Hiqa (Health Information and Quality Authority) in enforcing the regulation of care homes is also recommended, as are the introduction of regulations regarding staffing and staff ratios which “need to be strengthened in order to protect patient health”. Staffing structures, salaries, terms and contracts should also be reviewed, the draft report states. ‘Matter of urgency’The report recommends the Department of Health should “urgently support nursing homes which have planned capital works in order to fulfil statutory obligations under the Health Act, 2007”. It says this work should be completed as a matter of urgency, given the ongoing threat of Covid-19 to the health of residents living in congregated settings.Informed sources said on Wednesday that the private nursing home sector does not receive any State capital funding.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Co-founder Maria Jikijela says the group will \u0026lsquoreinvest all profits in the carers\u0026rsquoFigures show percentage of follow-up calls being answered appears to be decliningPlan will include new employment scheme to support wages of those temporarily laid offOne in every 10 cases of coronavirus was contracted in clusters in private dwellingsCovid-19 group\u0026rsquos draft report seeks governance shake-up for private nursing homesIreland is a \u0026lsquoprime target\u0026rsquo for disinformation campaigns, ex-military intelligence boss saysExperts say 5,000-year-old monuments will not survive unless action is takenHigh Court overturns permission for 245 apartments and childcare facility in FinglasResearch Lives: PhD researcher John Noone of DCU School of Health and Human Performance and National Institute for Cellular BiologyMinister says all frontline employees including locums to be includedLorraine McCabe says everything today was \u0026lsquowonderful\u0026rsquo but family had gone through \u0026lsquoten years of hell\u0026rsquoEamon Harrison last month lost his challenge aimed at preventing his extraditionRobin Swann\u0026rsquos move described as \u0026lsquomomentous by kidney care charityLong-serving TD elected unopposed, with Jennifer Carroll MacNeill as vice-chairThe small number of people landing in Dublin Airport know what is expectedDubliner Josephine Silo\u0026rsquos outlook was \u0026lsquoI have lived my life and I am ready to go\u0026rsquoQ4PR was one of over 50 third parties to share in payments totalling \u0026euro213.88mStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4310913.1595450707!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sligo s neolithic tombs are being vandalised on scale never seen before","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPádraig Meehan surveys the damaged Teach Cailleach a’ Bheara passage tomb in Ballygawley, Co Sligo. Five-thousand-year-old Neolithic tombs in Co Sligo are suffering damage and vandalism “on a scale never seen before” and will not survive unless action is taken immediately, archaeological experts have warned.There are 75 passage tombs in Co Sligo, almost one-third of the estimated 240 in the State, according to the Sligo Neolithic Landscapes Group, which is pressing for the county’s Neolithic heritage to be deemed a World Heritage Site by Unesco. So much material has been removed from one passage tomb, known as Teach Cailleach a’ Bheara (the House of the Witch) on the Ballygawley mountains, that an adult can now lie in the hole created. People walking on top of some cairns are doing so much damage “that not only is there a fear that they won’t be there for future generations, they may be lost to this generation”, warned expert Dr Robert Hensey.Saying that it would be hard to find a comparable landscape anywhere else in the world, the group warned that “a very fragile landscape” is under “grave existential threat” from tourism and development.One of Sligo’s best-known landmarks, Queen Maebdh’s cairn on top of Knocknarea, has suffered ongoing damage including the removal of stones from the base of the monument and “walking scars” left by ever-increasing footfall, Dr Hensey adds.The author and archaeologist, who discovered megalithic art not visible to the human eye in a Carrowkeel passage grave overlooking Lough Arrow, Co Sligo, in 2009, said many walkers instinctively climb on top of the tombs.However, the tombs are smaller and more fragile than the Knocknarea cairn and are in danger of collapse, Dr Hensey said. A couple chose to stay in one of the tombs some years ago “with straw bedding, and their tins of beans and washing line”.Stealing quartzMeanwhile, Carrowkeel is also plagued by graffiti, with a significant increase in people scratching their names on to the monuments, causing potential damage to the megalithic art which has been there for 5,000 years.While some damage is accidental, or simply carelessness, there is evidence that some people are stealing quartz to sell online: “For some, taking a piece is an instinct almost like bringing home holy water from Knock,” said Dr Hensey. Meanwhile, there is evidence that some people may be trying to find hidden chambers or entrances to monuments at Teach Cailleach a’ Bheara under the “misguided notion” that there are valuables are to be found. Some people believe valuable gold or bronze objects are deposited inside ancient monuments, he added: “They may not be aware that stone age sites are over 5,000 years old and predate the use of metals in Ireland. ” Under law, it is illegal to be in possession of metal detectors at monuments and sites, or to dig or excavate for archaeological objects, an offence liable to fines of up to €65,000 or up to three months imprisonment.“We cannot have 24-hour surveillance on all of the endangered monuments in Sligo,” said Dr Hensey, but better signage and more engagement with the public would be key to raising awareness about the vulnerability of the sites, he added. ‘Visitor pressure’Ireland has two Unesco-listed Neolithic tombs, Brú na Bóinne and Skellig Michael, and seven more on the UN body’s tentative list. The Sligo group argues that placing Sligo’s tombs on the tentative list could provide some protection.On July 25th two group members Dr Stefan Bergh, an archaeology lecturer at NUI Galway, and Pádraig Meehan, a guide at Carrowmore, will lead guided tours to Teach Cailleach a’ Bheara and Queen Maebdh’s grave to highlight the dangers facing the tombs.The Office of Public Works said it was aware of “visitor pressure” facing Neolithic sites and is working with other State bodies to address the issue, “particularly at those sites, including Carrowkeel, where we have a maintenance responsibility”.The Department of Heritage confirmed that its National Monuments Service (NMS) had inspected the passage tomb in Ballygawley after it was damaged in 2019 and “unfortunately, the latest report we have received does indicate further damaging activity at the site, which is in a very remote location”. A spokesperson said: “ It is not in the care of the State and we would appeal to the public for any information that may assist in our investigations”.The Department said it was aware of “the challenges” at Knocknarea following a dramatic rise in walkers there, and th NMS was doing a detailed recording of the site, to be used as a baseline to measure ongoing erosion . A drone survey was undertaken there last week as part of the processThe OPW was preparing a programme of works for the preservation and protection of the monument at Carrowkeel, the department said.Dorothy Clarke, director of services with Sligo County Council said it was involved in and fully supported the bid for Unesco listing, though she pointed out that some key sites are on privately-owned land.The council had a “balancing act” between encouraging tourists and protecting sites. “We are damned if we do, and damned if we don’t,” she said – adding that the local authority wanted local tourism to be sustainable.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4311104.1595456336!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus government to announce details of 7bn stimulus plan","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Micheál Martin: The centrepiece of the Government stimulus plan will be  new employment supports based on a German scheme. Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireThe Government will announce its long-awaited stimulus plan on Thursday with a package of about €7 billion including capital spending, welfare and employment supports, grants and tax cuts.A centrepiece of the plan will be the announcement of new employment supports based on the German “kurzarbeit” scheme, under which the State supports the wages of workers who have been temporarily laid off, and which has been credited with keeping unemployment low during the pandemic, and during the financial crisis a decade ago.Other details of the stimulus plan were still being finalised between the parties on Wednesday night with differences persisting between the Green Party and Fianna Fáil over a proposed reduction in capital gains tax.The plan will include a huge injection of cash to revive the stricken economy through capital spending and grants, as well as a series of schemes to support businesses and workers.Public investments will be targeted at a number of areas, including cycling and walking infrastructure, town centre investment schemes and programmes which are ready to be started soon in a number of State companies, notably Irish Water.Every school in the country will be eligible for an enhanced minor works scheme worth tens of millions of euros, intended to fund structural alterations to classrooms and improve bathrooms to facilitate hand-washing.The waiver on commercial rates will be extended until the end of September. There are also plans to allow firms warehouse part of their PAYE and VAT bills without attracting interest or penalties, though these liabilities will eventually fall due.There will be a major revamp of the temporary wage subsidy scheme (TWSS), converting it into a permanent support to help businesses to retain staff. While the scheme will continue for a period to pay a large portion of the wages of staff in companies hit by the pandemic, it will be relaunched in the autumn to incorporate a longer-term scheme to help pay for staff in companies trying to trade their way back to profitability.Back-to-work schemesTo put it on a permanent footing, it is understood that revenue is likely to be raised through an increase in employers’ PRSI , currently charged at 11.05 per cent on most earnings. It is likely to be based on the German “kurzarbeit” – or short-time working – scheme, under which the State supports the earnings of people who have been put on short-term work during periods of economic difficulty.Tens of thousands of places on a variety of back-to-work schemes are being readied at a cost of €100 million, with the intention that these schemes come on stream as the pandemic unemployment payment is wound down.The so-called “staycation voucher” scheme will see a tax refund of up to €125 being paid to consumers who spend in the region of €600 on accommodation, food or non-alcoholic drinks, and will be valid from this autumn until the end of April next year.The restart grant for SMEs, capped at €10,000, will be increased and more companies and self-employed people will qualify.

Video: Oireachtas TV\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMary Lou McDonald arriving at the Convention Centre for the Dáil session. Photograph: Alan BetsonThanks to Mary Lou McDonald, the identity crisis at the top of Government infected Leaders’ Questions, despite Tánaiste Leo Varadkar, with supreme discipline, managing to keep out of the headlines for a whole day.Nonetheless, Taoiseach Micheál Martin asserted himself after a series of peppery exchanges with a theatrically disdainful McDonald by bullishly declaring: “I know how to handle myself.”He was talking about holding his own at meetings of the North-South Ministerial Council, but it could just as easily have been a cry of exasperation after weeks of criticism of his early performance in the top job.Naturally the Sinn Féin president zoned in on what she called the “absolute public confusion” caused by the Government’s “green list” of countries people can now visit but really shouldn’t. And as leader of the main opposition party, it would have been a dereliction of duty to overlook the extremely unhelpful intervention of the former taoiseach, now Tánaiste, in the run-up to the publication of the controversial list.“Yesterday you were at odds with the Taoiseach, and the confusion between your two selves hardly adds to public confidence,” boomed a confused Mary Lou, to the, eh, Taoiseach. This could have been a gratuitous attempt at an insult, but it was clear from her expression that it was a slip of the tongue. She wasn’t taking a sly dig at Micheál over jibes about Varadkar behaving like he is still in charge.Did Martin notice it? Or was it lost in the litany of shortcomings listed by McDonald in his Government’s handling of advice on international travel?Its approach was “cack-handed” and “reckless” and smacked of an administration operating “on a wing and a prayer”. And on she went.In reply the Taoiseach decided to proffer some unwanted advice to the Sinn Féin president, who now occupies that place across the parliament floor that he filled for nearly a decade.“When I was leader of the opposition myself, I saw my role to be essentially one of a constructive contribution to protecting public health and rising above partisan political sniping,” said butter-wouldn’t-melt Micheál, talking down to his replacement from the lofty heights of amnesia.Pearse Doherty sniped back, “Is that directed to the Tánaiste?”Micheál explained that he was clear in his mind that the safest thing for people to do would be to stay at home this year and not travel abroad. But the 15 countries in the list have a lower infection rate than here, so his Government is taking a very “conservative” approach to the matter of overseas travel.Open seasonNot so in the North, where Mary Lou McDonald’s party “had a view that it was okay to open up the island to 59 countries” and signed up to in the Northern Ireland Executive two weeks ago.“I understand that there are different jurisdictions and all of that, but this was signed off on by Sinn Féin in Northern Ireland. That has to be said.”Across the other side, Mary Lou couldn’t believe her ears. “Wow,” she mouthed.As for all that sniping, the Sinn Féin leader indicated it wasn’t coming from her ranks. Presumably the party has that filed under L for “Legacy issues” now.There is a very brittle edge to the exchanges between Martin and McDonald. Their bouts of parliamentary sparring have barely begun but already there is a sense of growing antagonism between the two.The Taoiseach has been challenging her choice of robust language and combative debating style. The Sinn Féin leader listens to what he says with barely disguised contempt, like when he outlines for Independent TD Michael McNamara the expert advice he has received on whether or not quarantine for visitors returning from unlisted countries should be mandatory.It’s “questionable” if this is the right approach, he told the Dáil, as this had resulted in Covid-19 clusters breaking out among quarantined groups in some places.Mary Lou rolled her eyes to heaven and tut-tutted her disagreement, telling him in weary tones that it was about quarantining the “right” people.“That happened,” insisted Micheál, as a clamour of protest rose from the Sinn Féin seats. “Sorry. That did happen,” he repeated, to noises off from the side of the theatre.“You’re misleading the Dáil,” shouted Pearse Doherty.The barracking from Mary Lou and her cohorts continued. “I’m responding to deputy McNamara,” snapped the Taoiseach.“Deputy McDonald got an opportunity to answer and I really think you should allow others their time on Leaders’ Questions,” he protested, before rounding on the Sinn Féin leader. “You don’t own the entire parliament and you should allow other opposition deputies to have their say.”Panto seasonIt really is a shame that they don’t sell popcorn in the Convention Centre when the Dáil is sitting, because TDs all around the auditorium were riveted.A chorus of “Oooooh!” went up.The Taoiseach moved to soothe ruffled feathers.“I say that in good form, you know.”But it wasn’t long before hostilities resumed. This time it was during questions to the Taoiseach on matters relating to his department. Northern Ireland was one of the subjects up for discussion, and the Sinn Féin leader urged Martin not to adopt a “passive” approach to the Covid-19 emergency at the next meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council because an All-Ireland approach to the crisis was needed.“We need it to be energetic,” she told him, urging him to work actively to achieve a “coherent single-island approach”.While not wishing to throw “brickbats” at Sinn Féin (must be because the general election is over), he repeated that the party signed off on opening up 59 countries in terms of travel.“There are two public health jurisdictions, whether you like it or not,” he told Mary Lou, who was giving out yards across the way.“Jesus, you’re a disaster,” she contemptuously dripped.“There’s no need to be calling in the good Lord now, in terms of your responses,” chided Micheál. “You can’t have it both ways.”And as for that upcoming meeting? “I do have experience in the past of North South Ministerial Councils,” he began.Again, Mary Lou gave him a withering, condescending look.“I remember,” she sighed.“Yeah, and it was a very positive one,” Micheál recalled. “I know how to handle myself in a North South Ministerial Council.”He finished with one last, barbed word on how best to conduct business in Northern Ireland, telling the highly affronted Sinn Féin leader: “You’ll get nowhere if you think that if you just hector people or lecture people that they’re all going to fall in line.”That should improve ongoing relations between the two.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19

four black women considered vice presidential","story":"Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, has said that four black women are being considered for his vice presidential pick in a move that would make history.No black woman has ever been either the presidential or vice presidential candidate for a major political party in the United States. A decision on who will join Mr Biden on the Democratic ticket ahead of November’s election is expected within weeks given the party’s convention will take place next month.The choice will not just have major political consequences for the campaign but also potentially the country, with the person elected becoming next in line for the presidency if Mr Biden takes office.  Mr Biden has already pledged to select a woman and there are growing calls for an African-American to be chosen, in part given the backdrop of anti-racism protests that have broken out across America this year.Prominent black female Democrats including Kamala Harris, the California senator who sought this year’s presidential nomination, Susan Rice, Barack Obama’s national security adviser, and Val Demings, the Florida congresswoman, are said to be in the running.Other candidates reportedly being seriously considered by the Biden camp include Elizabeth Warren, the progressive senator from Massachusetts who also ran for this year’s nomination, and Tammy Duckworth, an Asian-American senator for Illinois.Mr Biden made the new comment during an interview on MSNBC when he was asked if he would commit to selecting an African-American woman as his running mate.“I am not committed to naming any but the people I’ve named, and among them there are four black women. So, that decision is underway right now,” Mr Biden said.It was the latest hint dropped by the candidate, who has previously said he also wants a vice president who is experienced and ready to step into the job from day one if necessitated.Mr Biden, as he has throughout his presidential run, also stressed that if he wins he wants an administration that reflects the ersity of America’s population.“It is important that my administration, I promise you, will look like America, both from vice president to Supreme Court to cabinet positions to every major position in the White House, he said. Mr Biden’s choice is seen as having unusual importance given the circumstances of his candidacy, in particular his age - 77.If successful in defeating Donald Trump on November 3 Mr Biden will become the oldest person ever elected to the US presidency.Should Mr Biden not seek a second term, as has been speculated, then his vice president will be the clear front-runner to win the party’s 2024 presidential nomination.The choice also is a moment of political risk for Mr Biden, who currently enjoys around a nine-point lead over Mr Trump in national polls - a huge gap over an incumbent president.With a little over three months to go in the race the decision is one of the few known moments in the campaign calendar, along with the conventions and the debates, that have the potential to shift the dynamics of the race.Strategists and commentators have noted that Mr Biden is facing a mix of competing and at times contradictory political incentives when it comes to making his selection.Some have urged him to be cautious, noting his poll lead, warning him against picking a left-wing running mate like Ms Warren which could make winning over undecided voters harder.Others have stressed that Mr Biden must reflect the energy of the moment, in particular the public support for the Black Lives Matter movement and the surge of frustration at racial injustice seen in recent months.David Axelrod, Barack Obama’s former top campaign strategist, has urged Mr Biden not to be swayed by overt political considerations but instead pick someone who he feels he can work with and would be best for the country.Mr Trump is widely expected to stick with vice president Mike Pence for his 2020 ticket, despite reports throughout his time in office that he has asked allies about picking former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley instead. In a separate development, Mr Trump has warned he could deploy more military-clad federal law enforcement officers into US cities despite outcry over their use in Portland, Oregon.I\u0027m going to do something, that I can tell you, because we\u0027re not going to leave New York and Chicago and Philadelphia, Detroit and Baltimore,” Mr Trump said, criticising violent crime rates in those cities. Democrats and protesters have criticised the heavy-handed tactics of officers not clearly identifiable as government employees in controlling demonstrators in Portland.New footage of a veteran being beaten by a uniformed officer while standing still provoked a new wave of condemnation on Tuesday.

In reluctantly asking my daughter to come with me, I felt the independence I’ve spent my whole life building up slip away in one fell swoop.I am profoundly deaf and rely on lip-reading for communication. It’s only ever felt like a minor part of who I am. But now that I’m faced with a high proportion of the population wearing face masks, my method of communicating with the world outside my home is lost. Being hearing-impaired has suddenly become a huge part of my identity.Growing up in the 1970s meant that telephones were the main electronic form of communication, although I was unable to use them. The advent of email, mobile phones, texting and subtitles gave me an independence that would have been impossible to generations before me. To me, my “profound hearing loss” had become a minor disability.I now consider myself a confident, outgoing 55-year-old academic who has been lucky enough to carve out a career in an area that I love and feel passionate about: leukaemia research. It’s a challenging job and requires me to communicate continually with others.To go from such an active, high-powered role to feeling nervous about even leaving the house without somebody accompanying me is not something I ever envisioned happening.But more and more people are wearing face masks. I don’t blame them at all for following a clear and effective public health measure, but the more they do so, the more reclusive I feel. Face masks are now compulsory on public transport.I have never been able to hear announcements on trains but now my coping mechanism of asking fellow passengers to tell me what has been said is lost. What do I do now? I guess I just turn up for my journey and cross my fingers?There are 11 million people in the UK with hearing loss and nearly one million are profoundly deaf like me. Many of us depend on lip-reading and facial expressions to communicate.In the current crisis my biggest fear is myself or a loved one being admitted to hospital and me being unable to communicate with the care team. Sadly, many will have slipped away from the world seeing a face mask moving above them, but with no idea what the last spoken words to them were.The Government’s indecisive handling of the pandemic has meant that masks will become normal attire for much longer than they should have. Indeed, they may now become a permanent feature of life outside our homes. So I urge the public to support me in my campaign for all face masks to be made from transparent material.Transparent masks are available in other countries and need to become the norm here, too.Indeed, I have no idea why masks are traditionally made from paper and then disposed of. Surely it is more economical and environmentally friendly for them to be made from a material that can be disinfected and used again and again?Don’t make me feel I have to give up on everyday life. If you have the technology to manufacture clear face masks, please come forward and help hearing-impaired Britons regain their independence.Keeping people safe should not mean disabling others.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"officers should not take knee black lives matter says scotland","story":"Police officers have been told by Scotland Yard’s commissioner not to take the knee in support of Black Lives Matter.Dame Cressida Dick defended the two officers who adopted the pose during Black Lives Matter protests in Whitehall and outside Downing Street. But since then she revealed that she had ordered officers not to kneel while on the job in subsequent briefings“That evening I said we are not going to do that in a public order or an operational situation and every briefing after that for the protests included: we will not be taking the knee,” Dame Cressida told LBC yesterday.  Taking the knee was taken up as a symbolic anti-racist gesture by the Black Lives Matter campaign  after the death of George Floyd, when a police officer restraining him knelt on his neck for more than eight minutes.  It has led to controversy as some officers in some forces have been told they should be prepared to take the knee if it might defuse a situation.  An operational briefing by Hertfordshire constabulary warned that those who chose not to make the solidarity gesture “may become the focus of the protesters’ attention.”  It pointed out that, when officers knelt down, it had “a very positive reaction on the protest groups.”Dame Cressida said she understood why her two officers in June knelt after enduring a long day with hours of protest with abuse and a crowd saying “again and again and again take the knee, take the knee, take the knee.”“I haven’t spoken to them personally but I imagine that they thought in order to keep that bit of the crowd a bit quieter and to show some respect and humility, some respect for what had happened to George Floyd, they took the knee,” she said.Although she had ruled it inappropriate in operations, she accepted Kent Chief Constable Alan Pughsley’s decision to take the knee at a demonstration involving Caribbean and equality campaigners was a “completely different situation. It was not a public order or operational situation.”However, she said she would not do it herself. “You can see, racing drivers, goodness knows who, footballers, people are taking the knee for all sorts of reasons. I wouldn’t. I’m a professional police officer and I don’t think we should in operational duties,” she said.She was backed by Ken Marsh, chair of the politan Police Federation, who told The Daily  that he did not believe an officer while in uniform should make such gestures.“I don’t think officers should for all sorts of reasons around operational requirements and everything that goes with it,” he said.“People are entitled to personal views but you should keep them outside policing. When you have a police uniform on, you should police without fear or favour.”However, a spokesman for Sadiq Khan, mayor of London, said it was a personal decision whether people took the knee. “It’s clearly a personal decision for each officer, but the Mayor supports their decision to do so, as long it is safe and operationally appropriate for them to do so,” he said.The National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) said there was no nationally-agreed position. “It’s a decision for inidual forces and chiefs,” said a spokesman.The NPCC is due to publish this month a “plan of action” to address racial inequalities in the criminal justice system following the death of Mr Floyd.It said it aimed to address concerns over stop and search, the use of force and under-representation of black and minority ethnic officers.Martin Hewitt, chair of the NPCC, said officers were “listening to the national debate” and the more than 220,000 people who have joined Black Lives Matter protests across the UK.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"watch do need gyms anymore life covid 19 lockdown","story":"Since gyms around the UK closed in March, exercise fanatics have had to think about how to get their fitness fix during lockdown.Some people have bought bits of equipment and moved their gym routines to the park. Others have started following online workouts in their living room, or taken up hiking, running or cycling outdoors.So when gyms reopen to a new socially-distanced standard, which for England will be on July 25, will people be going back to use them? Or will they be able to do without them?For Anna Magee, a health journalist and founder of Healthista, lockdown has changed her perspective on gyms. Before the coronavirus pandemic, she says she used to go to the gym four or five times a week for an hour. It was her “escape”. “I didn\u0027t do really heavy weights but I liked things like medicine balls and the things that you lift and and bars and things. I enjoyed having the space and I enjoyed having somewhere else to go. So I freaked out when I heard that gyms were closing, I literally freaked out.”But lockdown has forced her to adapt her fitness routine and she’s taken up hiking, HIIT training, yoga and pilates. “I got really into these things. I found that not going to the gym meant that I could exercise little and often. So it wasn\u0027t that structured one hour, four to five times a week, but it was maybe like 20 minutes here, 20 minutes there. I think it added up to probably more than what I was doing before.But for PhD student Claudia D’Ettorre, the gym is something she’s not willing to do without anymore. “I think I\u0027m going to be one of the first ones standing at the door for the gym to open very early on Saturday morning.“I’m very excited to go back to the gym because I\u0027m a bit tired of dragging weights up and down my flat to the garden. I\u0027ve missed the environment and all my friends that I got to know in the gym.”Has our attitude towards gyms and exercise been transformed by lockdown?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.The coronavirus infection rate in England is five-times greater than that of Scotland’s, the latest data has revealed.Since mid-May, both countries have seen new daily coronavirus cases reduce significantly, though Scotland’s handling of the virus appears to have been far more effective.At their peak, both nations recorded a similar amount of new cases per day, with England recording around 73 new cases per million people compared to Scotland’s 63 infections per million people.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut while Scotland’s rate of new Covid-19 cases has fallen consistently below two per million since late June, England’s is yet to drop below seven per million.The latest figures, taken from Public Health England and Public Health Scotland, come after Nicola Sturgeon said she would “not shy away” from imposing quarantine restrictions on visitors from England.Scotland\u0027s more rapidly declining number of new daily coronavirus cases means that the difference between the two nation\u0027s infection rates has grown wider.Since mid May, England\u0027s infection rate compared to Scotland\u0027s rose from around 1.4-times greater, to more than 7-times greater by mid July. It currently stands at around 5.5-times greater.The disparity between England and Scotland\u0027s infection rates was highlighted in a recent report by the Independent Sage group, which attributed it to the differing containment strategies of each nation.In Scotland we\u0027ve seen such a clear strategy, clearly articulated, elimination is the aim and all objectives are geared towards driving things as low as possible, Professor Stephen Reicher told a briefing last week.In England, the UK government hasn\u0027t been clear about the strategy, we don\u0027t see any particular strategy, some people talk about herd immunity by default, but nothing has been articulated at all.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Images of exoplanets of any kind are incredibly rare, but the new picture represents a breakthrough in the discovery of other planets like our own.Researchers hope that in addition to offering the first real look at such a similar planetary system, the image and observations could help us understand how our solar system\u0027s planets were formed and went on to evolve around our Sun.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBeing able to take such direct observations will also be an important part of the search for planets that can support life, researchers said.“This discovery is a snapshot of an environment that is very similar to our Solar System, but at a much earlier stage of its evolution,” said Alexander Bohn, a PhD student at Leiden University in the Netherlands who led the new research, in a statement.The image was taken by the European Southern Observatory\u0027s Very Large Telescope. It shows the planetary system known as TYC 8998-760-1, which is about 300 light years away.Astronomers have already found thousands of other planets in our own galaxy. But almost all of them have been discovered through the transit method, where scientists watch for the trademark drop in light that happens as the planets move in front of their star, meaning that scientists do not get to see them directly.Water is found on habitable alien exoplanet for the first timeResearchers have only ever been able to directly observe two other systems that had more than one planet before. But in both of those cases, the stars were very different from our Sun.As such, the new image represents humanity\u0027s first look at a direct image of star like our Sun, surrounded by more than one planet, as in our solar system.“Our team has now been able to take the first image of two gas giant companions that are orbiting a young, solar analogue,” says Maddalena Reggiani, a postdoctoral researcher from KU Leuven, Belgium, who was part of the research.While the star in the system is more similar to our Sun than any other observed in such a way before, it still has important differences. Scientists describe it as a very young version of our own Sun, since it is only about 17 million years old.The planets are even more different from our own Earth – they are gas giants, like Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. They orbit at around 160 times and 320 times the distance we are from the Sun, and are much heavier than the planets in our solar system.Scientists were able to take the images using the European Southern Observatory\u0027s SPHERE instrument. That is able to block out bright light from the star, allowing the for more dim planets to be seen – such a technique would not work on the planets of our solar system, since they are older and cooler, but younger planets glow from their heat.Astronomers hope to conduct further observations of this system to understand the history of the planets. New technology such as that in the upcoming Extremely Large Telescope could allow astronomers to see even more hidden planets, scientists said.“The possibility that future instruments, such as those available on the ELT, will be able to detect even lower-mass planets around this star marks an important milestone in understanding multi-planet systems, with potential implications for the history of our own Solar System, Mr Bohn said.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Take a walk at Virginia WaterSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis spectacular destination is only part of a vast, aristocratic pleasure ground of woodlands, parks and meadows that would take weeks to fully explore on foot.The 4.5-mile circuit of the lake takes you past an eclectic mix of attractions, including an ornamental cascade waterfall, Roman ruins brought from Libya and an authentic 100ft-high totem pole gifted by British Columbia.With so much space, there is plenty of room for a secluded picnic too.See windsorgreatpark for more information.2. Cycle the New ForestWhether you discovered a love of cycling thanks to the lockdown or have been a convert for many years, the traffic-free and waymarked trails of the New Forest make it an enticing spot for all levels of rider.If you want to leave your wheels at home, there are plenty of local bike-hire options, which can also provide advice on the best routes for your party – from easy family jaunts to long-distance challenges.See thenewforest for information on cycling routes.3. Hike through the Chilterns Stay safe and have fun with this important travel guidance:Only travel in a car with members of your household andor support bubbleAlways wear a face covering or mask on public transportWash your hands before putting on your face covering and after you’ve taken it offWash your face covering dailyWhere possible, leave the car behind and reach your destination by walking or cyclingChef Tom Kerridge on reopening his Michelin-starred pub safelyAn area of outstanding natural beauty with rolling hills (such as Coombe Hill, above, the highest vantage point in the area), the sparkling chalk streams and ancient woodlands right on London’s doorstep sounds too good to be true, but the Chilterns offer precisely that.With over 300 square miles of scenery and attractions to absorb the crowds, a quiet route is also a walker\u0027s goal. The Chilterns Conservation Board and Chiltern Society have developed a series of 23 walks across the Chilterns which are social-distance-friendly, taking in hill climbs and gentle ambles.Visit chilternsaonb.org for more details about their social-distance-friendly walks.4. Kitesurf at Camber SandsCamber Sands has over two miles of beach to absorb the post-lockdown crowds. The eastern end, marked with black and white flags, is reserved for activities such as kitesurfing, and there is plenty of space for novices to learn how to handle a power kite on land or water.An introduction from The Kitesurf Centre covers the fundamentals and can be booked as one-to-one coaching, as a single group from the same household, or in groups of up to three people from separate households.The nearest train station is in Rye, four miles away. A six-hour introduction to kitesurfing course starts at £99, minimum age 12. See thekitesurfcentre for details.With the pools closed and the seaside crowded, many swimmers are looking elsewhere to take a dip. Far from the chlorinated confines of the local swimming bath, a fresh water reservoir, lake or river can be an exhilarating alternative, but there are many safety issues to consider before getting wet in the wild, so make sure you read up on the hazards first.​See outdoorswimmingsociety for advice and a directory of open-water swimming lakes to explore.6. Learn to jet skiThe beaches could be busy, but you can leave the crowds in your wake after completing a Royal Yachting Association (RYA) personal watercraft course that, in just one day, provides you with all you need to safely helm a jet ski inland or on the coast.There are plenty of places in the UK that can teach you – such as Jetski Safaris in Poole – and no experience is necessary.Visit jetskiandpowerboattraining for more information. Single-person RYA proficiency course for jet skis from £180.7. Ride on an Olympic bike trackThe Hadleigh mountain bike track hosted the London 2012 Olympics and has evolved since then into one of the premier cross-country destinations in the UK.Hadleigh Country Park also provides one of the largest green spaces in Essex, with plenty of opportunities to explore the coast from Southend-on-Sea to Benfleet. The nearby castle ruins offer panoramic views of the River Thames and Kent on the opposite shore.Leigh-on-Sea or Benfleet stations are the closest to the country park. It’s a 10 to 20-minute ride from there to the track. See explore-essex for details.Meet the kayaking instructor...Having been cooped up during lockdown, it’s safe to say that large numbers are wanting to experience the great outdoors like never before now businesses are reopening.“We\u0027ve been ridiculously busy,” says Adrian Fall, below, owner of Brighton-based The Kayak Coach. “People have been so excited about being on the water.”Fall\u0027s passion is teaching people how to kayak, canoe and paddleboard – then leading them on trips up Sussex\u0027s beautiful estuaries and rivers.He set up The Kayak Coach almost 12 years ago and has just taken on two extra staff to add to the three he already employs teaching and guiding on the water: “I love being outside and now\u0027s the time to meet people again and introduce them to the sport I love,” he says.Reopening the business required important changes, as per Government guidelines. Group sizes have been reduced from eight to five to comply with social distancing – “It\u0027s actually a nicer experience for everybody,” Fall adds – and all equipment (boat, buoyancy aid, helmet) is cleaned and sterilised after each use.A one-way system has also been added to its training centre at Ashurst. “We\u0027ve made changes to what we do. But we\u0027re almost back to normal in terms of what we can offer,” Fall explains. Additionally, barrels of water are provided for sailors to wash their hands before and after each session. Fall admits that the past three months of enforced closure have been tough for the business and lovers of the outdoor life, but that people are “having to look locally because they\u0027re not going to France or America”. He adds: “They didn\u0027t know we were here, but they\u0027re excited about accessing the river on our doorstep.”See thekayakcoach for more detailsTo help plan your trip visit Know Before You Go Please keep in mind that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently have different guidelines, advice and timelines for reopening tourism.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.

This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Leicester may have been the first, but it was never going to be the last. After a recent spike in Covid-19 infections, Blackburn with Darwen has become the second local authority to have taken preventative action and tighten certain restrictions as the country continues to grapple with the coronavirus pandemic. The Lancashire council has not gone as far as its East Midlands counterpart in imposing a lockdown – residents have instead been told to limit the number of people they accept into their homes, and to wear face coverings in all enclosed public spaces – but the leaders and people of this northwestern region know what is waiting around the corner.“We do not want to end up like Leicester,” councillor Paul Marrow tells The Independent. “It’s all about being proactive, which is the approach we’ve taken.” Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFor now, the resurgence of the virus in these parts appears small by comparison. Whereas Leicester recorded roughly 155 cases per 100,000 people prior to its lockdown, Blackburn with Darwen has, to date, reported a peak rate of 47 infections per 100,000. But all fires start from a single spark – and authorities here are doing what they can to put out the growing flames.Focus has turned to the danger of household transmission across Blackburn and its neighbouring towns. Unlike in Leicester – where officials have struggled to pinpoint the source of the city’s outbreak – local health authorities for Blackburn with Darwen have managed to develop a clear picture of the way in which the disease has spread within the region.“It seems to be household clusters where a person who has been infected may not know it, they may be asymptotic they return home and then pass it on to four or five family members,” Denise Park, chief executive of the local council, said.“We do have a higher than average number of large households – five or more people – so we’ve been looking at that. The most recent data testing shows that the majority of cases are from our south Asian heritage communities.”What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyAround a third of Blackburn with Darwen’s 148,000 population are from ethnic backgrounds, with a large Pakistani and Indian heritage population, and according to Professor Dominic Harrison, the council’s director of public health, 97 of the 114 cases recorded across the past two weeks derive from these minority groups. To help protect these communities, and prevent the situation from escalating across the region, authorities have tailored their measures accordingly, telling people they can now only accept two visitors into their homes beyond their immediate families.“With it being household transmission, we didn’t think a Leicester-styled lockdown was the right answer,” explains Ms Park. “It’s about being targeted with the action we take.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe response of Prof Harrison and his team has so far been met with positivity and optimism, on account of its specified and proactive nature. “Dominic Harrison has been absolutely on the ball with Covid-19 and he’s doing his job very well, keeping a good eye on the local community,” Gabriel Scally, a member of the Independent Sage board and professor of public health at the University of Bristol, said.“I think the council is handling it extremely well. This is the sort of approach that will work well nationally, because it’s generated by the local community, their representatives and the director of public health – trusted figures that the people can be sure they’re acting in the interest of the towns and the population.”It’s rare praise in these troubling and ided times, when the overwhelming narrative of the Covid-19 pandemic has been one of chaos and confusion. And there’s certainly hope to believe that the strategy adopted by Blackburn with Darwen proves effective.Leaning on the side of caution, authorities have announced that the current measures – which also recommend against hugs and handshakes – will be in place for four weeks before the council considers easing them. In the meantime the region’s caseload is expected to rise due to increased testing, says Ms Park, but after that it’s hoped the numbers will drop again.The story of Leicester’s lockdown – and the lessons to be learntAnd thankfully, access to data has not proved an issue, as was the case with Leicester. Ms Park said that the information provided by the local government to Prof Harrison has contained details on ethnicity, postcodes and ages, ensuring authorities have the means to develop a more comprehensive understanding of what’s going on in and around Blackburn.Additional testing units have been deployed in the local community, allowing more people who are carrying the disease but not displaying symptoms to get easily tested. “Let’s not wait till people have got symptoms,” says Ms Park. “Let’s do asymptomatic testing, do some case finding and then say to people they need to isolate.”Equally, the council has said that footways in the centre of Blackburn will be widened, to further promote social distancing, while some parking bays will be removed to help separate people queueing for takeaways and pubs. Council workers have meanwhile been visiting local religious and community centres to spread the message, and providing advice to smaller shops as to how they can protect their customers.Still, for all the encouraging work of the council, and the sense of “stoicism” that it has drawn from the local population, as Mr Marrow put its, the situation in Blackburn and Darwen has not passed by without the dangerous, racist rhetoric which marked many conversations concerning Leicester and its outbreak.“The danger is people see the data and say it’s one section of society to blame, and that is absolutely not what we’re saying,” councillor Saima Afzal said. “There are are a cocktail of factors at play here.“We are aware there are problems in the south Asian wards but I want to make it clear that they are not less or more likely to follow the rules. That’s not what my experience shows. From what I’ve seen and images I’ve been sent, there are groups gathering from a whole range of backgrounds.” She warned against analysing the statistics inaccurately as “they can be twisted any way you want to portray them”.Against this backdrop of tension, Blackburn with Darwen holds its breath as it takes another step into the unknown. Lessons have clearly been learnt from the Leicester episode, with the Lancashire council well poised to fight the virus, but there’s still a long way to go for the region.Blackburn with Darwen\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.For a town already caught in a slow and painful state of decline, the coronavirus pandemic has brought Blackburn to its knees. Decades of de-industrialisation and growing economic deprivation have left the area struggling to find its purpose – while larger, more prosperous neighbours have reinvented themselves – but the economic damage wrought by Covid-19 could prove to be the final straw.“We’ve been here for 32 long years,” said Maria Elder, the owner of Sudell Sandwiches, a small cafe in the town centre. “Lots of loyal customers over the years. We’d serve students from the college too. We even had a contract with the police to feed the officers when the football was on. That’s all gone, for now at least. We’re barely coping.”The worry for Ms Elder and other independent businesses is what a second lockdown would mean for the town. After a recent surge in cases, Blackburn finds itself walking a dangerous line. The region’s seven-day rate currently stands at 47 infections per 100,000 people and is expected to rise in the coming days.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAuthorities have already tightened restrictions this week, urging residents to limit the number of visitors to their homes and to wear face coverings in enclosed public settings, but the plunge back into full lockdown would likely drive many companies to the point of no return.“I think it’d shut us down,” said Ms Elder. “People are extremely scared and worried, because there’s a lot of places that only opened on Monday – beauticians, hairdressers. And it’s still very quiet.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safely“We’ve been here a long time, we’re an established business, but it has seriously impacted us, it really has. I’ve had to lay off one girl as a result.”Asad Jalil, who has run a dry cleaning shop in the town centre since 1989, said a second lockdown would push his business “over the edge”.“If there’s another lockdown for two or three weeks, it’s going to make it worse. People are already scared. There’s not enough money for going out, buying new stuff, people are making do with what they’ve got. “I can’t see my business returning. I doubt I’ll be here next year. Many of my usual customers are at home, working in their pyjamas. They don’t need to go into the office anymore. They don’t need to get their suits cleaned. I only came back yesterday but I don’t think it’s going to pick up again.” No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Although trade has been good for Anna Green and Emily Yates since they reopened their salon earlier this month, they are one of the few to have come through this period of turbulence.“In this building alone, there’s one room empty next door and upstairs there’s six empty,” Ms Green said. “They’ve had to fold. It’s not the most affluent of areas. A lot of people have packed up and gone.”The pandemic has only added to Blackburn’s problems. The local council has seen its spending power decline by nearly one-third since 2010, losing out on tens of millions of pounds, while the region has one of the lowest life-expectancy rates in the country.Some buildings in the town centre have stood empty for 10 years or more. Unwilling to take a risk on Blackburn and its struggling economy, business has been turning elsewhere in the northwest.“Blackburn was a booming town,” said Mr Jalil, the dry cleaner owner. “People used to flock here from all around, but now they don’t even bother. They either go into Bolton or Preston. There’s no footfall in Blackburn anymore.”Deprivation is also a serious and growing issue. Last year, the charity End Child Poverty revealed that half of all children in Blackburn lived in poverty, with this rate up to two-thirds in the ward of Bastwell.Nonetheless, stoicism runs deep in these parts. Residents are aware that everyone has a role to play in getting through the pandemic.Blackburn holds its breath after recent spike in Covid-19 cases“Everyone is putting on face masks, all our customers are taking it on board,” said Marcus Gannon, director of Hobkirk Sewing Machines, which can trace its history in the town back to 1903. “No one has got anything against it. They all appreciate it. And in a way, it gives customers who want to come in here the confidence to do so. People are just getting on with it.”Ms Elder, the cafe owner, echoed these sentiments, saying that “the majority of people are now wearing masks” and abiding by the rules – at least in public. “Everyone is taking it seriously,” she said. “I think the new restrictions are a good thing but we’ll have to see how it goes.”The council has also been working hard with small businesses to ensure they can operate under the current system. “I know some of our officers have been out and helped put the new guidance in place,” said Saima Afzal, a councillor. “Everyone has been really proactive. I think we’ve got a really resilient community in Blackburn so they are carrying on.”“My company has been here for 100 odd years,” said Mr Gannon. “I want it to be here another 100 years. We can’t give in.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Several areas in England are experiencing a surge in new coronavirus cases, with places in the North West appearing most at risk to a second wave of infections similar to the one seen in Leicester.The latest figures from Public Health England reveal Bradford and neighbouring Kirklees in West Yorkshire have seen high numbers of daily confirmed cases in recent days.Higher infection rates in Leicester prompted the government to introduce a local lockdown just weeks after nationwide containment measures first began to ease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFollowing Leicester’s lockdown last week, epidemiologist Professor Neil Ferguson warned that more localised lockdowns in the UK are “inevitable”.The former government adviser said that an estimated 8 per cent of the UK population has so far been infected, and that the pandemic is still in its “early stages”.Leicester remains the worst affected area in England in terms of cumulative case rate, with more than 1,000 people per 100,000 residents having been infected by Covid-19.Other areas to have experienced similarly high case rates include Ashford in Kent and Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, however both places have seen new cases fall substantially since May.The rate of new coronavirus infections in Ashford began to flatten off in early June, according to data collected by PHE. By contrast, daily cases in Leicester appeared to accelerate at around the same time.A similar surge occurred in Kirklees, despite the curve initially appearing to flatten one month ago. The number of new daily cases consistently fell below 20 in the first week of June, before spiking to more than 40 on 11 June.In Bradford, the number of new cases fell significantly in late May, before rising again throughout June. Unlike Kirklees, however, the rate of new infections appears to be once again slowing.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them.

On her third day of giving evidence at the High Court in London, 34-year-old Heard said she was “too scared to look behind” as Depp threw “all the bottles in reach”. She said he threw around 30 bottles in total.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHeard has accused Depp of repeatedly assaulting her during the trip while high on drugs and drink.And she has previously claimed that Depp “explicitly threatened” to kill her on several occasions during their tumultuous relationship.Amber Heard says Depp pressed so hard on neck she could not breatheDepp, 57, is suing The Sun’s executive editor Dan Wooton, and the newspaper’s publisher over a 2018 article that described the actor as a “wife beater”.Depp denies 14 allegations of violence against Heard and claims he was the victim of violence in the relationship.During Wednesday’s proceedings, Eleanor Laws QC – representing Depp – put it to Heard that during the alleged Australia incident she worked herself “into a rage, screaming at him” and threw a glass bottle.Heard said she got angry “at times” but “not to the extent where I would throw anything at him offensively”.In response to a suggestion from Laws that she threw a bottle at Mr Depp’s head, smashing a mirror behind him, Ms Heard said she did break a bottle “very early” on the second evening of the trip, and it was “before Johnny had started to throw the bottles at me”.She claimed the couple were in an argument about Depp’s drinking and when she confronted him, he offered her the bottle.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It was no-fly.“And he gestured to offer it to me and I reached to take it and he pulled it back.”Heard went on to say she “reached for it a second time and I smashed it on the floor in between Johnny and I”.She added: “I regret I did that.”Heard then told the court: “He started picking them (bottles) up one by one and throwing them like grenades.“One after the other after the other, in my direction, and I felt glass breaking behind me, I retreated more into the bar and he didn’t stop.”Elon Musk offered to give Amber Heard ‘247 security’, High Court toldOn Tuesday, the court heard that billionaire Tesla founder Elon Musk offered to provide Heard with “247 security” after she said she would apply for a restraining order against her former husband.Laws read out text messages between Heard and Musk dating back to May 2016. According to the texts, Heard tells Musk that she is going to obtain a restraining order against her then-husband.Ms Heard has denied having an affair with the businessman while married to Mr Depp.Depp and Heard met on the set of The Rum Diary in 2009 and married in 2015.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.The £120m of taxpayers’ money promised by the government for a “Festival of Brexit” in 2022 should be erted to save long-standing and much-loved arts events whose future is threatened by the coronavirus pandemic, the body representing Britain’s festival sector has said.Reallocating the funds away from the Brexit festival is a key plank of a programme to reinvigorate the creative sector launched today by the Liberal Democrats, whose culture spokesperson, Daisy Cooper, warned of a “cultural catastrophe” unless the government provides more help.Originally proposed by Jacob Rees-Mogg as a celebration of leaving the EU, the event was renamed the Festival of Great Britain and Northern Ireland by Theresa May in 2018 and Boris Johnson confirmed in December that it would go ahead in 2022 backed by £120m of taxpayers’ money.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut the director of the British Arts Festivals Association (BAFA), Fiona Goh, said the money would be better spent sustaining the existing network of cultural experiences across the country, most of which have been cancelled this year because of the coronavirus lockdown, with many feared never to return. Alongside major events such as Glastonbury and Reading that attract hundreds of thousands of music lovers, hundreds of smaller celebrations of music, literature, theatre and dance were unable to go ahead.Ms Goh said reallocating the cash would “acknowledge the strength and creativity of the existing nationwide festival infrastructure”, which has the proven ability do “truly extraordinary things in all corners of the country” with the money currently earmarked for an untested event.

The UK’s festivals could do truly extraordinary things in all corners of the country with such a cash boost. Arts festivals are a vital fabric in our cultural ecology they support artists at all stages of their careers, the creation of new work, community cohesion and participation, as well as driving local visitor economies.“Festivals are place-makers, bringing moments of extraordinary cultural experience to villages and towns that might otherwise go without. Now is the time to invest in our communities and those who enrich them.”The acting chief executive of UK Music, Tom Kiehl, said it was vital to ensure that Britain remains open to international talent after Brexit, as venues closed by the pandemic open their doors.“The music industry is worth £5.2bn to the economy and to maintain this it’s crucial we ensure copyright is respected and protected after Brexit,” said Mr Kiehl.“The UK must also remain open to international talent.

The MPs suggest the Treasury should extend the coronavirus furlough scheme for affected businesses until mass gatherings are once again permitted.July and August are key in terms of organising Christmas seasons, the report said, which means “continued uncertainty about reopening could have devastating consequences far beyond the end of this year”.Mr Knight added the UK is “witnessing the biggest threat to our cultural landscape in a generation”, claiming: “The failure of the government to act quickly has jeopardised the future of institutions that are part of our national life and the livelihoods of those who work for them.”“Our report points to a department that has been treated as a ‘Cinderella’ by government when it comes to spending, despite the enormous contribution DCMS sectors make to the economy and job creation.” Reopening theatres for Christmas pantomimes ‘challenging’Referring to the announcement by the culture secretary Oliver Dowden for a cash injection into the struggling industry, Mr Knight went on: “We can see the damaging effect that has had on the robustness and ability of these areas to recover from the Covid crisis. The £1.57bn support is welcome but for many help has come too late. “We urge the government to act on our recommendations, to recognise the value these sectors provide and imagine how much bleaker the outcome for all without their survival.”Unveiling the plan earlier in July, Boris Johnson said the money would help safeguard the arts for “future generations” and ensure businesses could stay afloat – despite still not being able to open their doors.A DCMS spokesperson said: “We disagree with the committee. We have worked with urgency day in, day out since the start of the pandemic in providing support for our sectors and on plans to reopen them safely.“Thousands of organisations and hundreds of thousands of jobs working across culture, the arts, sport and tourism have been saved by furloughing and loan schemes. Hospitality and tourism firms have also been helped by a year’s business rates holiday and a £4bn reduction in VAT.“Our £1.57bn investment is the largest ever one-off cash injection into culture in this country. We have also worked with our arms-length bodies on additional emergency packages and provided billions in support to charities to help those most in need. We will respond in detail to the select committee’s report in due course.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

While the furlough scheme and self-employment assistance covers many workers, others types of employment, including some of the most insecure “gig economy” work, has fallen through the cracks. A universal basic income is a flat cash benefit paid to everyone whether they are in work or not, designed to provide a floor of economic security under the population. The policy has long been backed by the Green Party and has seen a surge in interest during the coronavirus pandemic as a way of protecting people losing work.Lib Dem Davey pledges citizen’s basic income in leadership bid launchUniversal basic income improves well-being and employment, study finds“Tours, gigs, events and performances have rightly been cancelled due to coronavirus. On top of that, a high proportion of artists and cultural professionals supplement their income with casual work in the exact same industries that have been hit by coronavirus, with many working part-time in hospitality.  It is clear that lockdown has simply shone a light onto the way our industry operates with constant insecurity,” the letter says.“This work is tough for those in the industry when so many don’t have upfront funds to create their work, or build and develop it. For many of us, a universal basic income would bridge a gap of seasonal work and tour, for others it would be a support in additional training. “Working in culture has for too long been an option open only to people from more privileged backgrounds who have family support to pursue their dreams. If the UK is serious about being a fair and open society, then expressing this through access to the arts and the sharing of the resultant output is a powerful way of demonstrating that commitment.“To build back better than before we must ensure that everyone has the financial security that a UBI can provide, and help ensure that we are supporting the creativity of erse communities, and define our generation.”Billy Lunn, the lead singer of rock band The Subways, who helped organise the letter, said: “Following an extended period over which grassroots venues and community centres all across the UK have been closing at an unprecedented scale, and all whilst the Conservative government has ostensibly praised UK artists as both economic and cultural global exports, the coronavirus pandemic has sent shockwaves of panic through the entire scope of the artistic community.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We can go back and have a look at whether something happened, and I’m not opposed to that – I just think there are far more serious things now, actively, that we should be considering.”The committee chair suggested the government could consider introducing legislation to toughen up on espionage and foreign lobbying in the UK, “rather than going back and looking over the past”.Intelligence and Security Committee\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As well as two Michelin-starred pubs – The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach – he also opened a traditional butcher and founded Pub in the Park, the biggest food and music festival tour in the UK.During lockdown, staff from Kerridge’s businesses were volunteering to help a new charity called Meals from Marlow which delivers free food to NHS staff, key workers and people in need. This started small in early April and with support from over 1,000 donors, it recently ended up serving its 75,000th meal.From 4 July, both The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach have reopened fully in Marlow to welcome back hungry diners.7 great summer days out for the familyThe team have prepared a comprehensive Covid-19 policy document with a number of measures to protect the health and safety of guests and staff. Measures include daily staff temperature checks, hands-free antibacterial gel dispensers, one-way systems, private sole-use of bathrooms, cleaning touchpoints and toilets every 20 minutes, and even sanitising deliveries.Kerridge is also working with a company that provides protection against a wide range of pathogens, including Covid-19, using a sanitising treatment applied through fogging machines to provide an even coat on all surfaces, followed by manual application to hot spots, such as door handles.Form a bubble with a one-adult householdVisit your local salon, restaurant or bar, following UK Government guidelinesMeet in private gardens with up to six peopleTravel on public transport without a face covering or maskShare a car with people outside of your householdFor more information, visit gov.ukcoronavirus“Welcoming, safeguarding and taking care of others is at the very heart of what we do, says Kerridge. The last few months have been such a challenging time and we have been eagerly waiting to establish a little normality back into everyone’s lives, and get back to what we do best – providing great hospitality and food.”Kerridge\u0027s pubs have also been altered to make sure that spacing is as per UK Government guidelines. Partitions have been placed to ensure people have privacy and are able to enjoy their experience in the same way as before.Following the success of Meals from Marlow, it has now become a permanent charity and is set to provide 30,000+ meals a year to local people. “I know the people of Marlow are a very generous group but I’m astonished by the speed and the level of kindness, says Kerridge. Thank you, Marlow, I’m proud of you.”Colin Steele and Jade Windsor, pub landlords of the Falcon InnColin Steele and Jade Windsor, pictured below, took over the Falcon Inn five months before lockdown, restoring the pub as a community hub at the heart of the village of Fawley, Hampshire. After coronavirus threw a ner in the works, they were eager to reopen last weekend. “We have social distancing, hand sanitisers and a booking system, so our locals get a guaranteed spot,” says Windsor.The couple made the most of the lockdown by revamping the pub, painting the interiors and outside fencing, and putting up a pergola in the garden for some weather protection. “Because of lockdown we had the time to give the garden the love and attention it really needed,” says Steele. “Painting the fence outside has meant that we\u0027ve been able to interact with the village as they walk past. We\u0027ve been trying to bring that community spirit back.” To keep business going, they opened their car park for plant sales and teamed up with local company HMS Spirits to serve takeaway cocktails on Friday nights, which they will continue on weekends throughout the summer. “It kept us doing what we love, says Windsor, and keeping in contact with our customers.” They also recruited a chef with the goal of making back some of the lost income from closure and the now-reduced capacity that allows for distancing. Where they once accommodated 150 inside, now they can host 40. The team have ramped up hygiene measures: doors are wiped every half hour screens at the bar and face shields protect staff. Additional outdoor seating means that everyone is seated, and a new app will enable customers to order food from their tables. “We\u0027re a family-run business and everyone just wants us to succeed,” says Steele.Windsor adds: “I\u0027m sure we will come across a few issues, it’s something that no one\u0027s ever had to deal with before. I want my pub back the way it was more than anyone, but we\u0027ve all got to deal with it together.”Sarah Bentley, owner of The Cutting Room unisex salon As a small village salon that’s been open for 16 years, it’s little wonder that The Cutting Room’s loyal clientele had been keenly anticipating its reopening after temporarily closing back in March.A tight-knit team with great customer relationships, Bentley and her employees were excited to get back to a sense of normality. After a meeting last week, they felt reassured about the safety precautions put in place for their return. “It was a bit of relief coming back from staff training and just seeing everybody’s face light up and looking forward to being back,” she says. “We’ve had Zoom meetings discussing all the guidelines.”The salon may have been closed, but plenty was going on in the background to ensure that the premises and the team were as prepared as possible for a safe reopening.For example, they worked hard to keep customers informed about changes to their haircutting experience: as well as the salon now being appointment-only, clients have been informed that they are not able to enter the premises before their appointment, as well being asked to wear a face covering.“Because we are such a small salon, we have screens up between all our sections,” Bentley explains, adding that their booking and payment system has been made completely contactless.Though refreshments or magazines can no longer be provided, The Cutting Room has set up its outdoor space for clients to sit in a socially-distanced manner.The Cutting Room\u0027s kit used has also changed: “We’ve got disposable gowns, towels – everybody’s got all their completely own equipment it’s all labelled in their name – their own trollies, Bentley adds.Ultimately, safety is The Cutting Room’s number-one priority. “It’s there to keep us and the clients and my staff safe – and if I felt that they weren’t safe, I would shut the salon tomorrow,” Bentley says. “Everybody’s health comes first.Keeping you safe: a selection of guidelines for UK businesses All businesses are required to be Covid-19-secure in order to help protect their staff and customers.

But when coronavirus hit in March, Ireland’s biggest sportswear brand had to break the habit of a lifetime and sack its entire 750-strong workforce at its Strabane factory due to the lockdown.With sports events cancelled or postponed, orders from teams and retailers vanished.However, the company was thrown a surprise lifeline when, a day after announcing the layoffs, the Western Health and Social Care Trust approached O’Neills on a Friday about fulfilling a shortage of scrubs to safeguard frontline NHS workers.Factory staff spent that weekend making sample scrubs. By the Monday, O’Neills had secured an order for 10,000 sets of maroon tops and trousers for GPs at a coronavirus testing centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Londonderry.As a result, the company rehired 150 workers immediately. It has since brought back more than 400 staff overall as orders from other health trusts across Northern Ireland grew, with the remaining 350 employees being furloughed.The company now produces some 10,000 sets of scrubs a week. Managing director Kieran Kennedy, a veteran of 41 years at the business, says employees have been supportive of the switch from making sporting goods.“We are a close-knit community in Strabane. Many employees know people who work in the NHS and they want to give back,” he explains. “We could either feel sorry for ourselves or be productive and take a bite at the cherry. Without the NHS orders, we would have had no sales and no cash flow. The scrubs kept the show on the road.”Kennedy says the move outside the company’s traditional business area has been relatively easy. For instance, O’Neills had stockpiled a six-month supply of yarn – the raw material for the scrubs and other clothing – from China to hedge against Brexit uncertainty. The company knits the scrubs at its Strabane factory, then dyes and coats them with anti-viral substances at its production plant in Dublin.Workers on the factory floors are social distancing, as well as wearing face masks, sanitising their hands and having their temperature checked.Kennedy is upbeat on the company’s future prospects, noting that big sporting fixtures are returning, which should boost sales and enable him to rehire more workers. But for the foreseeable future, Kennedy plans to continue producing protective gear – an unexpected new revenue stream.   The gift shop owner donating Happy Bags to localsWhen Sarah Lloyd Williams, pictured above, had to temporarily close her quirky little gift shop in Frome on 22 March, she had no idea what she was going to do with the time ahead.At first, Lloyd Williams relished the opportunity to spend every day with her dog, Chester, taking him with other dogs out for walks. However, by nature, she is a hands-on person and soon realised she needed to find something to fill her time other than dog walking and cleaning.She had found out that someone local to her had been having a hard time. “I knew this lady slightly and wondered if there was anything I could do to help, Lloyd Williams explains. I didn’t feel that I knew her enough to contact her offering assistance, so instead I decided to leave a little gift on her doorstep.” She called it a Happy Bag, containing a copy of The Happy Newspaper (a quarterly newspaper by Emily Coxhead containing nothing but good news), a chocolate bar, bath bomb and a little note.This good deed went down very well: the recipient messaged Lloyd Williams to ask if she could buy a Happy Bag for her friend. “I didn’t want any money, Lloyd Williams explains. This was something small that I could do with items that I already sell in Figgins, so I delivered a Happy Bag to her friend and it went from there.”She ended up delivering a number of bags in the local area and it led to doing a few other little things for people, such as picking up medicines, shopping and more dog walking.For Lloyd Williams, this became a lovely way to connect with people that she barely knew, or had never met before, and it made lockdown much easier to navigate: “Giving away some Happy Bags certainly made me feel much happier. It’s a tiny thing, but sometimes that’s all it takes to make someone’s day,” she says.Figgins has now reopened, with Lloyd Williams taking steps to make sure her shop is safer with a screen, hand sanitising stations, floor stickers and limiting the number of people in the shop at any one time. Lloyd Williams is also donating a Happy Bag every week to someone in the local community.At the start of lockdown, Andy Hibbert, above, transformed his car-sharing business.Launched in 2017, Car \u0026amp Away had enabled holidaymakers to rent out their cars from Gatwick and Bristol Airports while they were away, but when the coronavirus forced airports to close, business plummeted.The CEO from south west London quickly decided to use the business\u0027 existing assets to help key workers and launched a new service: Karshare.“We had this burgeoning desire for people to rent their car from home because it was sat there doing nothing,” Hibbert explains. “But then Covid came along. As a business we were stranded. We thought: this is ridiculous. We have all the systems in place to enable us to share cars. Why don\u0027t we launch the car-sharing concept where owners donate their cars to critical-care workers and people who are supporting the most vulnerable in our community?”At the peak of the pandemic, travelling by car minimised viral spread on public transport and limited key workers’ exposure, while making their journeys easier at a stressful time. Karshare encouraged members of the public in Bristol, Brighton, London, Manchester and Leeds to donate their cars for a week to NHS staff and volunteer organisations. The cars were then deep cleaned and matched to local key workers in need of transport.Insurance and road coverage were provided for free, and the owner received a full tank of petrol as a thank you.Impressively, 700 cars have since been donated – including to 31 London NHS trusts – with a total 19,000 days of use. Leasing company ALD donated 30 new cars in Bristol. “We were overwhelmed initially about the donations,” says Hibbert.One key worker who benefited was Michaela Morris, deputy chief operating officer at the NHS Nightingale Hospital London in Docklands. “She was put into a hotel and told she needs to be on call 247, so we quickly found her a car,” says Hibbert. “It’s remarkable that she has been able to continue that work because of the generosity of the public.”Karshare also helped a care worker who had only been able to reach a couple of vulnerable patients a day on his bicycle. When he was loaned a car he could reach up to 11 – and save more lives.While Karshare is now focusing efforts on making the business profitable again, it is also inviting donations to critical workers and will ask for contributions to cover the insurance. Karshare is also being extended to the wider community, allowing people to rent their cars from home.“There are financial pressures for people,” adds Hibbert, “yet they\u0027ve got an asset on their driveway that could really help.”The distillery that swapped gin for hand sanitiserIn the midst of a global pandemic, constrained by lockdown, a fledging gin brand was surrounded by alcohol with no bars open to supply. But reports of hand sanitiser shortages hit the headlines and gave the team an idea.Sean Roche launched Aintree Gin in December 2019. An organic, craft spirit, it takes its name from its home in Merseyside – a village renowned for its famous racecourse which hosts the historic Grand National.By spring, Roche and the team had introduced the gin to over 30 establishments around Liverpool. They were gearing up for the steeplechase, but lockdown put paid to their plans. “As soon as everything started to shut … all of our income went down to zero,” Roche says.Realising online sales would be key, the team started building a website – then they had a brainwave. “News reports started to regularly mention how shortages of… alcohol-based sanitiser were putting NHS and care workers at risk,” says Roche. “We knew that because we were already using pure alcohol to make our gin, we could change our production line to make sanitiser.”Their first batch was ready within weeks. Word got out and, soon after, they were inundated with requests from care homes, hospitals and more, Roche recalls.Volunteers were recruited and more than 600 litres were donated in six weeks. But as supplies ran low, and with no money coming in, the enterprise became financially unviable. “We had two choices,” says Roche. “Stop – or start selling something.”Opting for the latter, new containers were ordered and labels designed so the sanitiser could be sold online. They started offering a range of PPE products too, from face shields to masks. “This created a revenue stream that allowed us to continue,” adds Roche.A PPE pop-up and free hand sanitiser stations at an Asda store followed. “We donated more than we made in profit over the period,” Roche admits.Today, sales are going strong. As businesses look to reopen, many are turning to Aintree Gin for their sanitisation requirements – and also the brand’s primary product. They now aim to supply as many bars and restaurants as possible, and get into supermarkets as well.To read about more inspiring GREAT stories, visit greatbritaincampaigninspirationsWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Goldberg, meanwhile, played a psychic, in a performance that won her an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress.She was the second ever black actress to win an Oscar, after Hattie McDaniel took home an Academy Award for 1939’s Gone with the Wind. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesGhost had a budget of $22m (£17.3m) but stunned its producers when it took $505m (£396.7m) globally. Unlike other big-budget classics such as Star Wars and ET, Ghost did not spawn spin-offs or adaptations – a planned TV series never got beyond pilot stage.Speaking to Deadline, Goldberg said the film may have been a victim of racism.Courtney Marie Andrews: ‘I was embarrassed by my vulnerability’Whoopi Goldberg believes she had ‘some form’ of coronavirus in 2019“We were a very mixed cast, and it makes you wonder 30 years later, was it because we were a mixed cast that nobody wanted to celebrate it? Had it been any other cast that happened to be maybe all white, people might’ve celebrated it?” she asked.Goldberg also suggested that Ghost might have been selected for screenings at drive-in cinemas this year, alongside classics such as Pretty Woman, if she were white. “I hate to be an egotistical little thing but I feel like I’ve been in several movies that should be in drive-ins,” she said. “Would it have been different if I had been short and cute and blonde?”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Help is desperately needed to support wildlife rangers, local communities and law enforcement personnel to prevent wildlife crime. Donate to help Stop the Illegal Wildlife Trade\u0026nbspHEREThe Independent employs reporters around the world to bring you truly independent journalism. To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Boosting businesses that protect nature but also bring benefits to people and governments is the best way to prove the value of conservation in Africa, two of the continent’s leading economic thinkers have said.  The economic value of every acre of land in countries with some of the world’s fastest growing human populations needs to be proven, they say. Quick wins like logging or farming have so far won out over conserving wildlife habitats.  But nature-based businesses can compete against extractive industries if governments and people grasp their economic as well as ecological benefits, according to Fred Swaniker, a Ghanaian entrepreneur and education pioneer, and Clare Akamanzi, the head of the Rwanda Development Board. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThat will help protect wildlife species, conserve habitats that provide clean air and water, and keep human development distant from animal species that carry deadly diseases, they said.The pair took part in the second in a series of webinars hosted by The Independent as part of its Stop The Illegal Wildlife Trade campaign, in partnership with international conservation organisation Space for Giants. “Poverty in Africa is often so high we can’t do conservation for conservation’s sake,” Mr Swaniker said. “We need to show people how nature benefits them and how it’s the pathway to the prosperity that they need.” Conservationists warn of poaching pandemic due to coronavirus crisisHis African Leadership University’s campus in Kigali, Rwanda, was dedicated to mentoring a new generation of young Africans aiming to transform conservation into a growth sector. “As an economic sector this is one that has tremendous unfulfilled potential,” Mr Swaniker said. “As we look at developing Africa we can’t just copy the rest of the world, we have to look at what we as Africans have that is unique to the continent. One of the things that we have that is a true competitive advantage is nature, some of the unique bioersity in the world that can therefore really be leveraged for growth.” Rwanda has transformed itself into one of Africa’s fastest-growing and modernising economies. That growth has in huge part been driven by wildlife tourism, Ms Akamanzi said. Tourism and conservation contribute 7 per cent of Rwanda’s GDP and bring in more foreign business than any other sector, she said. Tourism investors had opened the way for other enterprises to follow. Key to that success was strong leadership, transparent laws, and making it easy to do business, Ms Akamanzi added.Stop the Illegal Wildlife Trade\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Customers who do not wear one will face a £ fine, but it could be cut to £they pay within a fortnight.Also, it has been compulsory for travellers to wear a mask on public transport since June , .But Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: There will be exceptions to these rules for very young children, disabled people and those with breathing dficulties.According to the official Government guidance, the following groups are not required to wear a face-covering while using public transport or in a shop:There are also a series of factors which the Government describes as a “reasonable excuse”, which also means you don’t have to wear a mask:Travellers who are not among the exempt categories will be refused boardingthey are not wearing a mask or told to get off.Mr Shapps said: I can announce that as of Monday, June , face coverings will become mandatory on public transport.The evidence suggests that wearing a face masks offers some, limited protection.You can be refused travelyou dont comply and you could be fined.It’s a condition of travel. You cannot travelyou are not wearing a face covering.On July , Matt Hancock confirmed that from July  it would be mandatory for people in England to wear face masks in shops and supermarkets.Shopkeepers have been asked to implement the new rules in their stores.But ultimately, the new rules on wearing masks in shops will be enforced by the police, not shop workers.Anyone spotted flouting the new rules could be hit with a £ fine.Doctors have insisted masks are crucial to slow the spread of coronavirus and make le safer for the most vulnerable.On July , Chair of the British Medical Association’s Medical Academic Staff Committee and Exeter University lecturer Dr David Strain said: “We need masks to slow the spread and make le safer for the most vulnerable to go about essential activities.“Yesterday more than  people tested positive for the virus, which the ONS figures suggest is only about a third of the true number of new cases in the UK.“The remaining two thirds of the population with the virus are the ‘silent spreaders’, people who carry and can potentially spread the virus despite having no symptoms themselves.“The mandatory use of face coverings will reduce the risk to the population at large from these iniduals.”Those who are exempted from wearing a face mask will be asked to get a face-covering exemption card.Those exempt will be required to carry the card on their person while using public transport.The card is available to download for free on the TfL website.TfL will also recognise similar cards that may have been issued by other transport operators.

Quick-witted, smart, self-deprecating, incredibly likeable and a bit odd-looking. A man who gives hope to fans, both through his career and marriage to Abbey Clancy.Then a double calamity struck. Euro  was cancelled and instead of ­canning the project the BBC pressed on with SOS, shackling it with a hostage-to-fortune title and all sorts of baggage and “other stuff” the show could have done ­without as well.Aside from a garden centre set and enormous table, around which Churchill could’ve signed the Yalta agreement, the baggage came in human form: Crouchy’s former team-mates, The Horne Section studio band, a guest comedian and, of course, Maya, who provided my series highlight when she got dangerously side-tracked by the host’s leisure and tourism qualication.“I don’t want to sound silly or anything,” said Maya, carefully setting her own trap, “But what is a GVNQ ”“It’s a GNVQ.” Obviously.As awkwardly as hosts and guests have all gelled, though, the thing that’s really torpedoed this show has been the other stuff. Those outside broadcasts and studio features that were meant to fill the ­football gap, but didn’t.Two regulars were a chino-clad irritant called Fast Dad, who competed against the host to win football memorabilia for a viewer and “Peter’s Extreme Retirement”, which included all the ideas Alan ­Partridge would’ve thought a bit naff, like water-skiing with Joe Cole.The game not even Crouchy’s GNVQ could help him understand, though, was a VAR-related pun called Very Accurate Rhythm.On Saturday it involved Mo Gilligan playing keepie-uppie to The Horne ­Section’s version of Hit Me Baby One More Time. In previous weeks, however, it was Tinie Tempah and Katherine Ryan having a go at swingball and Jimmy Carr playing Mel C at table tennis.There’s a scoreboard as well, yet no sense of what the hell’s going on here, other than the fact that not a single ­person at the BBC knows how to produce light entertainment.If they did, one of them would have given Peter Crouch the two words of prime-time advice he desperately needed to hear. Don’t. Swear.They didn’t, though. Crouchy and his mates swore like he was presenting a late-night E show and so ended up with an E-sized audience of about one ­million. That’s the reason you never see masters of the light entertainment art, Ant  Dec, dropping the F-bomb.In its youth-driven madness, the BBC might think this is a good thing but it alienates the people who actually pay their wages and has direct consequences for Crouch who, before this started, I thought, could have become a ­Saturday night staple. Now  Mystery guest round on A Question Of Sport, tops. That’s how he’s been coping without the football, Maya.And ex-Celtic manager John Barnes enlivening ITV’s Stephen Lawrence: Has Britain Changed  debate by telling the audience it needed to “elevate people like me and people like Barack Obama”, asthe former US President had ever worked with anyone of the magnitude of Jackie McNamara and Regi Blinker.You’re far too modest, John.Celebrity Snoop Dogs, Kevin McCloud: “It’s the much-loved Martine McCutcheon.” The One Show, Amol Rajan: “Today’s first guest is a man of many talents, Nick Knowles.”Peter Crouch: Save Our Summer, Maya Jama to the host: “God loves a trier.”Loves  He’s sent down a plague of locusts for less than SOS.ANYONE who watched last night’s episode of the landmark BBC series Once Upon A Time In Iraq is unlikely to forget it in a hurry.The story of the  invasion is grimly familiar, but what sets this show apart are the testimonies from its eyewitnesses.None of them wastes words. All of them are mesmerising.Two, though, still managed to stand out from the others.The first was a darkly funny Iraqi called Waleed Nesy who, before he became a journalist’s translator, was pro-war and fronted Baghdad’s only state-approved heavy metal band which, I’m desperately hoping, were called Black Sabba’ath.The other was ferociously bright US army officer Lieutenant-Colonel Nate Sassaman, “a charismatic leader of men” who was hoping to bring peace, democracy and lots of other empty promises to the country until he entered his first local medical centre and: “I’m telling you, the woman running it  She was as hard as a woodpecker’s lips.”Both were damaged by the catastrophe that unfolded and, in the case of Sassaman, helped cause, but they somehow retained their humanity, honesty and sense of humour, which made their testimony all the more astonishing.Like all great war documentaries, Once Upon A Time In Iraq was also prepared to let silence tell the story when the brutality or stupidity became too overwhelming.They made an exception for Waleed, though, when, six weeks into the invasion, President George W Bush boldly declared: “Mission accomplished.”“Mission accomplished  Oh yeah  . . . SERIOUSLY ”Three more episodes will tell you very graphically how well that worked out and they’re as good as anything you’ve watched all year.INCIDENTALLY, I’m grateful to This Morning hosts Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes for revealing blind Celebrity MasterChef contestant Amar Lat measured liquids with “talking jugs”.Which, by a million-to-one coincidence, was also ITV’s original working title for Loose Women.My Strange Addiction: “Eating mattresses can lead to liver damage, intestinal blockage and even death.”But on the plus side, it won’t leave you bed-ridden.Emile Heskey: “When your back’s against the wall, it’s easy to lie down.”Jeff Stelling: “This game will be over when the referee blows the final whistle.”And Chris Kamara: “Three points is another point on the board.”BY the way,you haven’t ever seen Chernobyl, one of the greatest TV dramas ever made, Friday, pm, Sky Atlantic, is your chance.No further excuses will be accepted.WITH no little air of self-congratulation, last week, Celebrity MasterChef welcomed its first ever blind contestant, “travel presenter” Amar Lat, who arrived with a helper and his own super power.“I’ve started to hear the food talking to me,” he explained. “It’s almost like it’s communicating to me and it’s saying . . .”“Don’t worry, Amar. The BBC won’t chuck you out first. It’d look bad.”As good fortune would have it, he didn’t need to worry too much as it was the worst line-up of the series and included Gethin Jones, playing to the camera, rapper Lady Leshurr, whose speciality seemed to be “in-flight meals” and Alan Partridge star Felicity “Lynn Benfield” Montagu, who served up a salad for the guest judges that looked like a Haitian voodoo rattle.The real fall guy, though, appeared to be Jeff Brazier who, at the first challenge, was tugging away at a string of garlic for a good ten seconds before he twigged. “Ah. It’s a decoration. It’s made of polystyrene.”Those people who cry at absolutely everything, of course, were quick to let everyone  know Amar’s eventual progression to the semi-final made them “cry”.I thought the highlight of the week, however, came at the end of the pair’s dessert challenge when the judges’ comments led Amar to ask: “Are you two fat ” and Gregg Wallace replied: “Are you familiar with Jean-Claude Van Damme ”“Yes.”Then get someone to talk you through his voiceover on Minions: The Rise Of Gru.The resemblance is uncanny.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We knew it cracked down on all domestic opposition. We knew of the way in which they were undercutting the economies of the West.But not until the spread of the Wuhan virus did so many people come to realise how untrustworthy the Chinese leadership is.Now, every day brings more bad news about China. It isn’t because China is doing any-thing new. It is because China has caught the world’s attention.Not in a good way.Just consider the events of recent days.The Chinese government’s mistreatment of its Uighur population in the province of Xinjiang has been known about for years.The Muslim minority group, who regard themselves as closer to Central Asian countries — their language is related to Turkish — have long been in the government’s sights.Armed guardsFor years the Chinese Communist Party has had Xinjiang under its version of special measures.Claiming the one-time independent state, which borders eight countries, constitutes a special security risk, the communists have had the people there under mass surveillance.Even before the recent mass imprisonment, they have had them subjected to forced labour.In recent years they have subjected the entire population to compulsory birth control to try to reduce the size of the population.But for years the world’s attention was not focused on this.We all had troubles of our own to look to.So the Chinese authorities got away with putting perhaps as many as one million Uighur people in what are basically concentration camps — places where these people are meant to be “re-educated” and otherwise “corrected”.Now, drone footage has surfaced which shows shackled, blindfolded prisoners in the province being marched on to trains by rows of armed guards.The scenes are awful.As our Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, rightly said at the weekend, they are “reminiscent of something we have not seen for a very long time”.He is right.Yet when the Chinese Ambassador to our country was asked about this at the weekend, he pretended to have no idea what the footage was.He even tried to ert attention by asking his inter- viewer whether he had ever himself been to the charming province in question.But we are not as easily distracted by China as we used to be. Every day brings fresh causes.First, we had China’s appalling behaviour in Hong Kong, breaking its agreements with the UK and cracking down on the local population.Then last week came our Government’s decision to remove Chinese firm Huawei from any involvement in Britain’s G network.Huawei is basically a Chinese government agency and it would have been a serious security breach to allow it to control all our internet communications. Or to develop a back door for looking into them.Then a number of senior Conservatives warned that social media app TikTok is “as much of a threat” to Britain as Huawei.That may sound funny to parents whose children are addicted to it.For most of us, the app is just a source of amusement or bemusement.Depending on your age.But whatever your reaction to it, a growing number of people believe Chinese tech-nologies like TikTok are not safe. Because TikTok’s parent company is ByteDance, a Chinese firm founded in .Of course, the company claims to be independent, as all such firms do, but in China major firms are not independent as they are in Britain or other free societies.Critics insist TikTok could easily be used by hostile forces to harvest information from, and otherwise target, all those who use it.Of course, all of this has brought a degree of sabre-rattling from Beijing.China’s leaders have got used to telling everyone  what to do.As they spread their financial wings in recent decades, countries like ours were very keen to enjoy the benefits.Universities in the UK repeatedly took money from China. Money with strings attached.But money that some of our greedier universities thought was free. Only later learning otherwise.Naturally, the turnaround of recent months has been badly received in Beijing.Its ambassadors and state media have spent recent days pretending it is Britain that is the untrustworthy partner.They are wrong.We are not inconsistent or unfair. We are simply a country that has begun to wake up to a threat.Like the rest of the world. And not a moment too soon.Jaguar Land Rover builds cars for them under a joint venture with Chery Automobile. Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca has , employees in China across several manufacturing sites, as well as an innovation centre and a ­campus.So as tensions ramp up after the decision to remove Huawei from the UK’s G network, Britain should remember it, too, has aces to play. Most notably tech and skills.To learn about these is why so many Chinese students come to our universities. It is the same reason why state-owned China General Nuclear Power is a one-third partner in the new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point C in Somerset.It will have a front-row seat to the latest tech as China prepares to build around  reactors of its own.Saying no to Chinese firms is not to be taken lightly.There are around , Chinese companies that do business in the UK. The largest  employ , people.But let’s not forget they need us too.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Weve already managed to secure  million doses of future supply of the Oxford vaccine.My best estimates are thatthis continues to run with the success that we have had so far, it would not be unreasonable to think that we will be getting some doses of that vaccine this side of Christmas. The UK has also signed deals for options on two other vaccines. When you get to the point where youve got a vaccine concept thats reasonable, then the success rate is typically about ten per cent. And what that tells you is that, to be sure that youre going to get a vaccine, you need multiple shots on goal. You’ve got to back more than one horse, and the UK Government is doing that. We are expecting to host five or six big vaccine trials in the UK in the autumn and yesterday we launched a website to allow the public to register their interest to take part in the trial. We are hoping to have , people per trial, so up to , participants.

He seems fine.” Seriously Let’s hope this was just an attempt at media distraction and that, behind the scenes, he and other influential friends are telling Kanye the truth he so badly needs to hear — that he needs serious, prolonged treatment for his mental health, and fast.And , like so many famous people, he’s surrounded by “yes men” who put profits before their clients’ health, then they too need to support his we and family in their bid to get him treatment.It won’t save his presidential chances, but it might just save his le.JOHNNY Depp reportedly referred to Magic Mike star Channing Tatum as “potato-head”.A hot potato though, right SHOW me the boy of seven and I’ll show you the man.Fellow pupils who attended the private Durham School with Dominic Cummings describe him as isive, argumentative and “contemptuous” of his peers, with a look on his face that suggested: “I know better, I’m tolerating you.”A description that will no doubt sound familiar to the entire Cabinet.

As long as they are working from home, they are contributing to this country’s problems in three separate ways. The first, and in some ways the most obvious, is that the services they provide are not as good as they should be. I remember fondly that when I was Immigration minister ten years ago, the Passport Service, which in its time had been a national disgrace, won awards for being a model public service.It was quick, flexible and customer friendly.All that has been thrown away under lockdown.There are no appointments in person any more, and I have seen reports that some passports are taking  days to be issued. More than a million passports have expired since March, soyou want to venture abroad next month you may have to be very lucky.If travelling is dficult, driving is not much easier.Anyonewho needs to renew a driving licence is stuck in a long and growing queue.At the other end of the age range, taking your driving test means waiting weeks or months. None of this is good enough in a country aching to get back to normal.The second reason why civil servants should be back at their desks as long as it is safe is that they are often the economic heartbeat of parts of our big cities.Whitehall in London is the most obvious example, but in other cities the public sector is also hugely important for economic activity.Shops, pubs and sandwich bars are open again buttheir customers are miles away they may as well shut their doors once more.As the unlocking has progressed, every MP has been lobbied hard by the sectors who have felt left behind.Gradually the second wave businesses — the nail bars and gyms — are getting their way. But so many of them rely on their location to succeed, and that location works because there are people whose offices are nearby.Empty offices are a death knell for nearby businesses. Footfall is key.The third reason is the most subtle, but perhaps the most important. It is that Government offices need to set an example to the rest of the country.If a private sector employee is wondering whether toto the office, and a neighbour who works for the Government is cheerfully planning to work from home indefinitely, the obvious question arises: “Why should I start commuting again ”Partly for reasons of safety and partly for reasons of convenience, many people have found working from home suits them.This is especially true over the summer, whenyou have a garden it is better to be there two minutes after you stop work than in a sweaty train.What this has come to mean, though, is second-class public services and the throttling of business.It is time for the civil service to set an example.It has had months to make its offices safe, and we have seen the ingenuity of pubs, restaurants and bars in doing the same in much less time, and sometimes with a clientele that will be much less disciplined.So safe offices should now be filling up again, with workers ending those backlogs and restoring the vitality to our cities.Above all they should be sending the signal that Britain can take big steps back towards normal le.A day in the office will mean our streets and shops come back to le.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The pair were pictured laughing together - with L Cpl Streetin later saying Philip had quizzed him about his other work when he wasnt playing the bugle.The musician said he highlighted his work as an assault pioneer, providing engineering support to frontline troops.The soldier said he told the duke: Were assault pioneers as well, and he replied Oh, youre keeping up your fitness then He added: But he looked me up and down and I thought Are you trying to say Im fat  - thats what we were laughing about.

I dont think the Colonel-in-Chief will change again in the time Ill be doing it. So its been a great honour to step in. Someone of his character, his charisma, you cant go wrong. Thats what we like, we are all banter. And thats what he is. At Windsor Castle, four buglers from the Band and Bugles of The Rles stood to attention when the duke - who served as a Royal Navy officer during the Second World War - walked down the steps of the Equerries Entrance. Fit Philip stood ram-rod straight and listened as he was thanked for his  years of support for The Rles, and their forming and antecedent regiments, by Assistant Colonel Commandant Major General Tom Copinger-Symes.The duke appeared to be in good health - despite having a hip replacement in  and spending a night in hospital just six months ago - waving and smiling as he chatted with officers standing to attention in the quadrangle at Windsor Castle.After chatting to the four buglers taking part in the ceremony the duke was off following a wave and a thank you, and he walked back inside the castle.The ceremony comes almost three years after the Queens husband bowed out of public office following  years of service.The Duke of Edinburgh has been one of the hardest working royals during his decades of service by Her Majestys side - conducting , solo engagements since  including  overseas tours.Todaysto royal duties saw him pass the special military title into the good hands of his daughter-in-law, the Duchess of Cornwall.

But its also really special to have the Duchess of Cornwall coming in because she has a long association with The Rles. She has been absolutely inspiring and the support that shes given and the way that she sustained that through some quite dficult and bloody tours.It is understood that the duke had been asked by The Rlesthey could mark his service with todays event and the -year-old was happy to agree.Major General Copinger-Symes said they could not have been more lucky in having the duke as their Colonel-in-Chief, and highlighting some of his qualities added: The ability to make an instant connection with Rlemen, whether junior or senior, of all ranks. And just to be able to put them at their ease and get the best from them and leave them feeling like theyre the only person in the room - or indeed the quadrangle of Windsor Castle - which you saw in the eyes of the buglers.Royal expert Phil Dampier, who has previously authored a book about Prince Philip, tweeted today: After health problems last winter, Prince Philip seems back on top form.

But Ms Sacoolas fled back to the US and claimed diplomatic immunity to prevent winding up in front of British courts. These changes to the diplomatic immunity rules cannot be applied retrospectively and wont allow British authorities to demand Ms Sacoolasto the UK.

I welcome the constructive engagement of our US allies in these discussions.The US waiver of immunity from criminal jurisdiction is now expressly extended to family members of US staff. Thus ending the anomaly in the previous arrangements and permitting the criminal prosecution of the family members of those staff, should these tragic circumstances ever arise again.Mr Raab vowed to make sure no family would ever have to endure what Harrys family had gone through in their fight for justice. He said: We have the deepest sympathy for Harry Dunn’s family. No family should have to experience what they have gone through and I recognise that these changes will not bring Harry back. However, I hope that the knowledge that thearrangements have been revised and that a family in their position would now see justice done brings some small measure of comfort.Harrys mother Charlotte Charles said todays announcement was a huge step forward adding that one of the familys aims was for this to never happen to another family again.

And no front bencher of this party has appeared on Russia today since Ive been leading this party.”He might hope to have put Labour’s loathsome Corbyn years behind him — but there is a fatal drawback.Yes, he has compensated the anti- Semitism whistleblowers. Yes, the party is unarguably “under new management”.But until last December Starmer was fully behind Corbyn, campaigning unwaveringly for the anti-Semite-in-chief to become PM of a Cabinet of Marxist fools.Starmer could have opposed them from the backbenches, as others did. But he was in the thick of them, hungry for power to secure a new Brexit referendum.Even now he won’t really take the hard Left on.

At the start of June, the number of cases being diagnosed each day was in single figures, but at present it is consistently in the hundreds. On Wednesday, the country saw  new cases confirmed,  of which were in Victoria. The metropolitan area around state capital Melbourne has been under a renewed lockdown since July , with measures expected to remain in place at least until mid-August. Speaking to Australias ABC, epidemiologist Professor Tony Blakely said Victoria risked spending months or even years isolated from other states. “Why would they let anybody inthere’s enough of a risk that they are going to bring the virus  he said. He added there were two scenarios under which the state might be forced to reintroduce a full lockdown. One is that you are actually going for elimination, which Im still advocating for because thats the better strategy in the medium to long-term,  months, two years, he said.It would be better to be in that state.The other reason is thatthe ICU capacity or Health Services were under threat. We are not at that level yet, it would be  cases a day before ICU would be near to that number. Its not being used in Victoria yet.Taking to twitter, State Premier Dan Andrews said the recent spike had come after people known to be infected by the virus refused to follow government advice to stay at home. This is incredibly concerning, he said. Of the , Victorians who tested positive for coronavirus over the past three weeks, almost  per cent kept going about their business after they began to show symptoms.He later added: “Unless we drive down the time between first illness, first sense of symptoms... and unless we have people who get tested staying at home and isolating until they get their results, then we will not see these numbers come down.“They will continue to go up and up.

You must vote Leave in that referendum.”I said to him: “Excuse me, sorry for asking, but are you a Russian ”He looked aghast and said: “Nyet! Why would you think that ”And I said: “Because you speak funny, you have borscht on your tie and you’re glowing, in a radioactive manner, slightly.”He went off around the pub saying the same thing to everyone . Later, I saw him with a bottle of vodka in one hand doing that dance where you crouch down and kick your legs out and shout “ha!” every so often. I wandered up. “Are you SURE you’re not a Russian ”There’s vodka dribbling down his chin and he smells of piroshki dumplings and isotopes. “Nyet! I am Englyishman. My name is Jyohn Smeeth.Definitely not Russian, definitely not KGB, my frent.”“Oh, OK,” I said, “No worries, good night.”“Dosvedanya, toich,” he replied.OK, that didn’t quite happen. But the remainers have got it into their heads that something like it did. We all voted Leave because the Russians interfered in our referendum. Meddled with our democratic process. Which is why we should stop leaving and have another vote.The allegation is that the Russkies tried to persuade us to vote leave by spreading  news around.What  news was that  That the European Union is an authoritarian bureaucracy run by pygmies from Luxembourg  That the EU wanted ever-closer political control over our country That we spent enormous sums of money keeping gibbering oafs like Jean Claude Juncker in office, while subsidising the useless states of Europe I don’t knowspecial agents Ivan and Dmitri were putting that stuff around, but I was well aware of the fact long beforethey were.Is there anything anyone can point to which suggests that the Russkies had an effect  There’s an allegation that they tried to ensure that the Scots voted for independence from the UK. And we should all vote for Jeremy Corbyn in the  election. Not hugely successful meddling operations, then, were they The thing about the alleged Brexit meddling is that it plays into the same narrative the remainers have been peddling for four years. We were all thick, us leavers. We voted Leave because we were DUPED. First by Boris and Nigel Farage. And now by the devilish Russians. Too dense to understand we were being conned, we voted Leave.Looking at the EU today, I’ve never been happier that we voted to get the hell out, incidentally.I have no doubt the Russians meddle in our affairs. I very much hope our own cyber spies are doing the same thing to them. I know the CIA is up to all sorts of tricks.Russia is not a very pleasant country right now and we should complain when it crosses the line — which it does, every month or so. But the idea that it had a decisive effect in our Brexit referendum is an insult to all those of us who thought long and hard and then voted Leave.The remainers can’t get over that we did so. They cannot bear to be defied. Tough. It wasn’t the Russians wot won it. It was us, the ordinary people of this fine country.And we’re still very glad we did.COVID has been good for some people. A lot of better- off people have been able to save loads of money, for example. And they don’t come much better off than the boss of Amazon, Jeff Bezos.Jeff has seen his income rise by a very agreeable £billion. That’s kind of enough money to buy France. So how about this, Jeffrey How about you get your company to pay the right amount of income tax in countries where you make so much money, such as the UK Last year Amazon did £billion worth of business in the UK – and paid £million in tax. That’s a tax rate, then, of two per cent.Not right, is it GOB on a very strange stick Janet Street Porter has been screeching about men. Again.She was having a go at Prince Andrew. Well, fair enough. The bloke is neither use nor ornament. And may soon be up to his neck in legal problems.I agree with the first part of what the toothy old harridan had to say. “Prince Andrew has no skills, no mates and no redeeming features.”Yup, largely agree, pet. But then she went on: “And so many modern middle-agedblokes are like that. That’s why women have drinks parties with their mates on Zoom, binge watch Netflix . . . and only laugh when they’re talking to gay men or their girlfriends.”She ended up by saying that men were becoming “redundant”.Can you imagine the outrageI had a go at a spectacularly useless woman – Janet Street Porter, for example.And then said most women were like her and that women in general are becoming redundant Ooh, there’d be howls of outrage.A LECTURER who said Jewish people had high intelligence has been sacked.Stephen Lamonby also said that Germans were good at engineering. For this – expelled. No job any more.Here’s the thing. Jewish people make up . per cent of the world’s population. And  per cent of Nobel Prize winners, like Bob Dylan, pictured.Countless studies have been done which show that Ashkenazi Jews have what one researcher, called, “the primo gene”. A high intellect. And Germans – well, they have been good at engineering, haven’t they Engineering Daily ranked countries in order of their prow-ess in the field. Germany came top. The magazine said: “Germany has long stood the test of time to emerge as a champion in the engineering field, reputed for its technical universities, internships and perhaps a culture and an economy that rewards engineering skills with both prestige and career growth.”Telling the truth, then, can now cost you your job. This moronic terror of the truth now infests most of our institutions. It has to stop.DAVID and Mary Sheldon took their newborn baby boy to the register office.And then got very upset. The registrar complained about their choice of name for the kid. Said it might cause him problems getting a job, later on.The Sheldons were very angry, but eventually got their way. The name they chose for their son  Lucer. Yep, that’s right, the Prince of Darkness. The parents said Lucer meant “bringer of light”.And while technically they might be right, it also means “that nasty, scaly, red b who lives in Hell”.A spokesman for Satan said yesterday: “I’m delighted by the Sheldons’ choice of name for their child. Lucer is a much maligned and misunderstood entity.“We will keep a close eye on the little mite and ensure that one day he rules the world, ha ha ha ha ha . . . ”I WAS sitting in a restaurant up here on Teesside. First meal out since lockdown. Large bloke comes in wearing a face mask. Uses the hand sanitiser by the door.Sits down, very carefully keeping his distance from everyone .

Then smothered in creamy bechamel sauce. And then with loads of Red Leicester on top of that.You eat it with chips and it’s , calories. He ordered a DOUBLE.You could almost hear his heart saying to him: “Look mate. Speaking on behalf of all of your bodily organs. We’d much rather you got Covid than ate that.“I think we can cope with Covid. But that thing is going to finish you off.”SPAIN has seen a big rise in Covid cases. Yup, amigo, it’s the dreaded “second spike” we’ve all been worried about.But people from the UK can still travel to Spain unhindered. And Spaniards can travel here without restriction.The Government says it will look at inidual countries and,need be, take them off the “air-bridge” list. Here’s my suggestion, Boris. Do it NOW.Quarantine for everyone arriving from Spain. Don’t make the same mistake you made in March. Back then there were NO restrictions on people from Covid hotspots – .million people arrived here up until lockdown.And that’s why we have one of the worst virus death rates in the world. Be quicker off the mark, Boris.

Otherwise it is too dficult to make sure this data is secure.“So we are working with like-minded democracies across the world to implement this central concept of trusted vendors, trusted networks.”In his first trip to the UK since the coronavirus crisis, Mr Pompeo said countries had to stand up to China.He admitted “confronting evil is hard”, but insisted “freedom loving democracies” like the UK had to work with the US to “convince the Chinese Communist Party to behave”.Speaking a week after the UK barred Chinese firm Huawei from future involvement in G networks over security fears, he added: “We all know Communists, right “We know what authoritarian regimes do. We know the nature of this ideology.“The way in which freedom-loving democracies behave — whether in the military space, the diplomatic space, the commercial space — the Chinese Communist Party simply isn’t behaving in that way. We also know there are hundreds of millions of Chinese people who are demanding that they continue to grow their economy and are looking for things that matter to them.“And that’s why I’ve always talked about this being the Chinese Communist Party driving this bad behaviour.”Mr Pompeo told how, while President Trump may have made China a priority, he could understand why other countries had been slow to take on a regime so quick to “punish” anyone who annoyed them.Mr Pompeo said: “Confronting evil is hard. It requires communicating to your people. There are real costs on the nations that confront it.”Previous US leaders — Republican and Democratic alike — had been affected by China’s belligerence but “just weren’t prepared to admit” to the problem. He said they had believed once China opened up commercially it leaders would conform to international norms, but added: “That simply didn’t happen.”The latest evidence was the way Chinese officials had silenced, or “disappeared”, its scientists who tried to raise the alarm over Covid-. The Secretary of State said: “The world saw it four-square with the massive cover up that took place with the Wuhan virus.“The world is still suffering. We have people dying all across the world, each and every day. And you still have a cover up that is continuing. No nation should permit China to get away with this.”The US has been highly critical of the World Health Organisation. On Tuesday Mr Pompeo even told MPs director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus had been “bought” by the Chinese government.But he told The Sun he still hoped a WHO inquiry would uncover the truth.Its secrecy and deceit over Covid has cost countless lives worldwide, including here. Its treatment of Uighur Muslims is evil, its Hong Kong betrayal appalling, its cyber-warfare indefensible.It is too early for us to ban TikTok. But the Tories must ensure the Chinese social media giant is not handing over users’ details to its totalitarian government.National security must trump economic concerns, as Boris Johnson accepts.Compare that with the EU’s response: To sign a bumper trade deal with Beijing.Brussels cares less about safety and human rights than about flogging its wine.Turning to issues in his own country amid Black Lives Matter campaigns, Mr Pompeo said: “There are people who choose to think that America’s founding was somehow fraudulent, because of the terrible tragedy of slavery. But our founders accounted for a country that could continue to reinvent its capacity to extend these rights to a broader set of people — to African Americans, to women.“We have done that and our system has proven resilient. If we forget these core rights we are at risk of floundering. If we do that, I believe that the American way of le is absolutely at risk. I don’t think that will happen. But we need to be reminded of it.”GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There is very little research about the mid-term effect of coronavirus.”Earlier this month, members of staff at working at the coronavirus ward of the Wolfson Medical Center in Holon, Israel, who had contracted the virus were found to be antibody free.That led to concerns that some recovered COVID- patients may not have any immunity.“It is worrying [to consider] why they don’t have antibodies,” Margarita Mashavi, head of internal medicine at Wolfson Medical Center in Holon.Second positive tests are a phenomenon that is still yet to be fully understood and scientists are unsurepeople can catch Covid- twice.From what is known about viruses, people who have had Covid- already should develop a level of immunity.There are numerous accounts of people testing positive twice but doctors say there is no as yet clear evidence of widespread vulnerability to reinfection.Back in April it emerged that patients in China were testing positive again for the disease  days after being given the all clear, leaving doctors baffled.There have been recent studies that appear to show antibody levels dropping off after two to three months, while others show they stable and even increase, the Washington Post reports.Some people could be suffering from a re-emergence of the same illness from virus that had been lurking somewhere in their body.Their positive Covid- tests could have been  positives - a result that shows you have something when you havent.That happened in South Korean when hundreds who tested positive for Covid- even after they recoveredThe countrys infectious-disease experts said that the positive test results were likely caused by flaws in the testing process.

The scathing verdict on Tory planning reforms exposes the grim conditions forced on people in permitted development homes. Tory ministers have been reforming planning rules since  to extend rights to convert buildings, like office or storage units, into homes without full planning permission. But campaigners warn the system opens the floodgates to slums barely big enough to swing a cat. The report by UCL and the University of Liverpool was commissioned by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government and slipped out just before MPsapos summer recess.  It found just % of permitted development homes would meet national space standards - compared to % through planning permission. The smallest were just  square metres, and ten of them had no windows at all. Many permitted development homes had layouts that “reduce access to natural light”. And even of those with windows, nearly % only had windows facing in one direction - compared to % of homes created through planning permission. Permitted schemes were eight times more likely to be in business or industrial parks - some of which had “extremely poor” services for residents. The report said: “It is the combination of very small internal space standards, a poor mix of unit types, lack of access to private amenity space   outdoor space, and inadequate natural light which can provide such a poor residential experience in some permitted development units.”Clive Betts, chairman of the Housing Committee, raised the tiny slums in a plea to Boris Johnson at PMQs today.

So Keir Starmer deserves credit for carrying out his pledge to eradicate the stain of anti-Semitism from Labour. The Labour leader had already shown he was genuine in this commitment by dismissing Rebecca Long-Bailey from the Shadow Cabinet. Today he took another major step towards restoring Labour’s reputation by apologising to staffers who had blown the whistle on Jeremy Corbyn’s failure to deal with anti-Semitism. As Mr Starmer told Boris Johnson at Prime Minister’s questions, the party is now under new management. The Labour leader’s resolute leadership puts Mr Johnson to shame.When asked a series of serious and important questions yesterday about Russian interference and the Chinese persecution of Muslims the Prime Minister responded with pathetic jibes and ill-judged jokes. Only one of these two party leaders has the gravitas and decency needed for these times – and it is not Mr Johnson. Lack of clarity From the off the Government’s policy on masks has been mired in confusion. At first we were told there was no need to wear one only for ministers to change their tune long after other countries used them. They finally ordered face coverings on public transport and from tomorrow they will be obligatory in shops and supermarkets in England.

Proud parents the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge followed in Princess Dianaaposs footsteps and posed on the hospitalaposs steps, giving the world a glimpse of their son, who is third in line to the throne. But before that historical moment, Kate had to follow a lot of royal traditions when she was bringing her little boy into the world. But she also chose to break quite a few big rules, just as her mother-in-law Diana did. The Queen has to be the first to know When any child is born in the royal family, the Queen must be the first to know before the official announcement. Itaposs reported that Prince William rang his grandmother on an encrypted phone when Prince George was born. The town crier announces the news to the public Tony Appleton had the honour of announcing the birth of both Prince George and Princess Charlotte outside the Lindo Wing. It’s a medieval tradition which began because people couldnapost read or write.  Staff are sworn to secrecy Kate had a -strong team with her when she gave birth to George, all of whom were sworn to secrecy. This comprised of two obstetricians, three midwives, three anesthesiologists, four surgical staff members, two special care staffers, four pediatricians, one lab technician for blood tests, and three or four managers. The team met once a month and would discuss Kateaposs progress as her pregnancy went on. Not only were they on call for three months before the birth, but they also had to really careful during this time. So no boozy merriment. But there are a few royal rules and traditions Kate is choosing to ignore for this birth.

The baby weighs lbs oz, the palace said via Twitter. The Duke of Cambridge was present for the birth. Her Royal Highness and her child are both doing well. They carried on the same announcement method with Charlotte and Louis. Home births are the norm Itaposs traditional for royal babies to be born at home in Buckingham Palace. The Queen followed the rules and had all her children there, but Kate Middleton decided against it.Princess Diana also broke this rule with her sons Prince Harry and Prince William and gave birth in St. Mary’s Hospitalaposs Lindo Wing.Kate had her first two children at the same hospital as her husbandaposs mother. There were rumours Kate would have baby number three at home in Kensington Palace but this was not the case.

Masks are to be made mandatory in takeaways and sandwich shops under laws introduced on Thursday, thereports. Premises with table service are said to be exempt from the new rules, though purchasing food from a counter and sitting down to eat inside is banned, according to a government source. McDonald’s customers, for example, would have to be masked while ordering at the counter, or use table service. The government has not yet confirmedthe new rules, which take effect in supermarkets and shops on Friday, will also apply to takeaways. More detail on the premises where masks should be worn is expected to be introduced on Thursday, after opposition MPs had led calls for clarity. “You have to sit down straight awayyou are going to eat in. If you can sit at a table, you don’t need to wear a mask,” the source said. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.   Those with eating in options will require the taking of customer details in case of a coronavirus outbreak. No changed the rules on masks as part of a set of new restrictions in an effort to prevent a potentially catastrophic second wave in the winter. Health Secretary Matt Hancock will publish an order to amend the Public Health Act  to make face masks compulsory in shops.  The wearing of face masks in shops from Friday had already been announced, but whether takeaways would have to follow suit has been something of a grey area. And while it is understood shoppers can be turned away at tills for not complying, the legal responsibility is on the inidual and not the shops. Official guidance on masks for businesses is due to be published on Thursday, which will include making it clear shop employees are not expected to enforce the new measures. Instead, the onus will be on the inidual. Many businesses claim they have still not been formerly told whether customers will be required to wear masks.

As restrictions ease, the Very Big Family Le Survey gives a glimpse of how le has changed over the past few months and how families view the “new normal”. The good news is that two thirds of parents of teenagers say all that time spent together at home has had a positive effect on their family. And the same applies to almost three quarters of those with kids under . Many families have created perfect memories by doing new activities together, such as playing board games, baking, walking and cycling.  Watching TV and streaming services have also provided family bonding time. Very asked parents to reflect on the past few months as they prepare for their children toto school full time. While for some it was stressful, juggling work, home schooling and quality time with the family, others found it fun and inspiring. Writer Gemma Cheetham lives with husband Mike and their two children, Ava-Violet, six, and Gabriel, one . She says the lockdown has made it feel like things have slowed down. She explained: For the first few weeks of lockdown I was working from home, and it was a struggle as Gabriel wanted to be with me all the time.  I’d end up logging on to work early in the morning, stopping at pm and starting again in the evening to make up lost hours. Normally, Mike would have taken the kids out, but when the restrictions came in he couldn’t do that. Then I got furloughed, and at first I enjoyed home schooling Ava-Violet and doing practical things like planting in the garden and baking banana bread.  But I started to notice a real dference in her. She just wanted to stay in the house. Even though we reassured her, she’d say things like, ‘I don’t want to go back to school, I want to stay safe and I want my family to stay safe.’ When her village school reopened, and she was in a small class bubble, she went back to her old self straightaway. She was glad to have the routine again, but she still likes having me at home. I feel like le has slowed down and we’ve been able to just appreciate each other’s company more. Another family feeling the benefit of spending more time together are the Blankstones. Mum Lisa and dad Mark live with daughter Olivia,  .  Estate agent Lisa told us: Olivia was due to sit her GCSEs and obviously she was upset when they were cancelled but since then she’s enjoyed being able to just chill out. I was furloughed, and Mark has his own optician’s which closed temporarily, so we were all at home. Olivia had schoolwork at first, but that eased off so we had lots of free time. We walked every day, exercised at home doing Joe Wicks and David Lloyd sessions. Olivia kept in touch with friends via video chats, and although she said a few times she wished she could see them properly, she was fine. She was disappointed to have our holiday cancelled, but she’s going to college and she’ll be more than ready to have some normality back again by September. We all get on well, so the biggest challenge for us was not being able to see other members of the family. Because he runs his own business, Mark said he’s never spent so much time with Olivia and he’s loved that. When you’re busy you feel like you’re always chasing your tail, but lockdown meant we all had more time.

The monarch and Prince Philip will go ahead with their annual stay in the Highlands after spending the last four months at their Berkshire residence during the pandemic. It will be the first time the -year-old Queen and Philip have travelled away from Windsor since relocating on March  from Buckingham Palace and the Sandringham estate shortly before the UK lockdown began. Buckingham Palace said the royal pair will make the -mile journey north in early August and take up residence at Balmoral.  But the palace declined to give an exact date of departure. The head of state and Philip, , have been staying at Windsor with a reduced household - dubbed HMS Bubble - for their safety for the past  weeks. The Queen had long been expected to go ahead with her visit - one of her favourite parts of the year -it proved safe and logistically possible. The news was confirmed after Philip carried out a rare official public engagement at Windsor on Wednesday. The duke, who retired in , attended a military handover ceremony as he transferred his role as Colonel-in-Chief of The Rles to the Duchess of Cornwall, who was nearly  miles away at Highgrove in Gloucestershire. The royal couple, who have been married for more than  years, are expected to remain in Scotland through August and September. The Palace declined to comment on whether other members of the royal family would be travelling there to spend some socially-distanced time with the monarch and her consort. The trip is dependent on relevant guidelines and advice remaining the same. Scottish Government guidance, published on July  allows people to travel to their second home and stay there alone or with other members of their household. While at Balmoral, the pair will be bound by Scots law, which includes coronavirus restrictions exclusive to Scotland.  The monarch will still be able continue with her official duties as sovereign while at Balmoral. Every day, she deals with her red boxes of state papers, and also holds regular telephone audiences. Her stay traditionally includes a visit to the nearby Braemar Gathering, where the Queen is Chieftain of the Highland Games. But due to the Covid- crisis, this yearaposs games have been cancelled for the first time since . Visitors from two other households will be able to meet her at a time at Balmoral, under current Scottish Government rules, with a recommendation for a maximum of eight people at a time when inside. his is only possible with social distancing and strict hygiene measures. Guidance indicates four other households will be able to meet the Queen at a time when outside - but with no more than  people in total in the group. For both indoors and outdoors, a cap of four households a day has been put in place.  The Scottish Government is set to review lockdown measures next Thursday but First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warned at her briefing on Wednesday not to expect the easing of many more restrictions. Currently, face coverings are mandatory across Scotland in circumstances where physical distancing is not easy to maintain. And Crathie Kirk - a regular place of worship of the royal family when they are in residence at the estate - is among the places of worship subject to rules allowing communal prayer for a maximum of  people, with two-metre distancing in place. It is also remains unlikely the monarch will be able to host her annual Ghillies Ball, which takes place in the estateaposs grand ballroom. The event is a dance for her neighbours, estate and castle staff during her summer stay at Balmoral but would contravene the current rules on gatherings. Prime ministers and first ministers usually visit the monarch and stay for short periods - but this will undoubtedly not happen this year.  As the royals arrive, pretty white heather will be about to bloom on Lochnagar - a mountain on the Balmoral estate. But during Scotlandaposs lockdown in recent months, rangers revealed how they had found discarded waste and wipes near trails on the estate after people had used the grounds as a wild toilet.   Staff at the , acre site posted pictures of the mess on paths this June. Public toilets at the site had been closed, and rangers tweeted: Disappointed to see so many wipes discarded on the Estate today. Next to paths and monuments. But many of the sights and traditions at Balmoral will have remain undisturbed. Each morning, a lone piper traditionally plays below the Queenaposs bedroom window. Years of royal memories have been forged at the residence, including family barbecues - where Philip did the cooking and the Queen the washing-up. After Philip and Princess Elizabeth married in , they spent part of their honeymoon at Birkhall - a grand hunting lodge on the Balmoral since inherited by the Prince of Wales. The Queen was staying with her grandchildren William and Harry at Balmoral when their mother Diana, Princess of Wales died in a car crash in Paris in . Princess Eugenie, the Queen and Philipaposs granddaughter, once described the estate as the most beautul place on the planet.

The documentary, Big Jack’s Other World, was made for Tyne Tees Television in . In it, the  World Cup winner takes a camera crew on a tour of his hometown as he reminisces about his childhood. It shows Jack visiting his dad’s pigeons, having a pint at a working men’s club in Ash­­ington, Northumberland, and going to whippet racing. He reveals that there had been upset about Andy Capp, as it portrayed Geordie men as “beer-drinking, whippet-racing pigeon-fanciers”. But the England and Republic of Ireland icon, a loyal Daily Mirror reader, jokes about dad Bob Sr: “Now where is he any dferent to any Andy Capp fella you have ever met  “He wears his flat cap, he has always kept pigeons. In fact, anything you have ever read in the Andy Capp series, you can see a bit of my father in it.” Seen carving a Sunday roast at mum Cissie’s house, Jack says: “It is all right this women’s liberation saying they can all go their own way and can all do their own jobs and have careers. “But they can’t all do that because there will be no population left.” Of his daughter, then nine, seen with him, he says: “Debbie will be brought up the right way. I won’t allow her to go out and stay out until she reaches an age.”"},{"url":null,"title":"mirror newspaper home delivery offer","story":"NewsGet The Mirror delivered free to your door for six weeksIts packed with breaking news, sport and entertainment - and is perfect during lockdownShareByAlison PhillipsDaily Mirror Editor:,  MAR Updated:,  APR News\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

Professor Nick Loman, who is part of the Covid- Genomics Consortium, said the new strain - known as DG - has an observable impact on cases in humans and is speeding up outbreaks across the world. But according to Prof Loman, who is based at the University of Birmingham, the new strain is not thought to increase the risk of death or en hospital stays. He said scientists analysed more than , genomes in the UK and found DG mainly increases transmissions between adults.Prof Loman told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: It exists in the spike protein, which is a very important way that the coronavirus can enter human cells, and we have been noticing in the UK and worldwide that this mutation has been increasing in frequency.This mutation was predicted first by computer modelling to have some impact on the structure of that protein and the ability of the virus to bind and enter cells and then quite recently was shown in laboratory experiments to increase the infectivity of cells. He said he suspected DG would not affect the race to find a coronavirus vaccine as it was the most dominant strain in around % of cases. This increase in this mutation is a worldwide phenomenon, he said. The original virus out of Wuhan had the D-type, but the G-type has become much more dominant across the world, including the UK.  Dismissing any concerns that the new strain signals a new potentially deadly phase of the pandemic he said its impact is thought to be confined to transmissibility. He added: Itaposs a small impact, we think, and weaposre not completely confident about that, but we found by testing what happened in the UK that the viruses that contained the G-type of mutation seemed to form clusters of cases faster, which ended up being bigger than viruses with the D-mutation. We didnapost see any signicant association with survival and theof hospital stays with this mutation – we donapost think this mutation is important in changing virulence. The effect seems to be on transmissibility. The news comes as the UK coronavirus death toll has risen by  today to ,.  The latest figures account for deaths in all setting and are released ahead of legislation making the wearing of face coverings mandatory in English shops comes into force. From Friday all but those with specic exemption will be required to cover their nose and mouth when shopping. The government said population-wide use of masks could help keep the Covid- reproduction numberbelow one. Enforcement will be carried out by police - not retail staff, and rules will be the same as those currently applicable on public transport in England.

It is understood that Transport Secretary Grant Shapps is set to update the government’s list of Covid-safe travel corridors next week. Portugal is currently excluded from the list of  countries where holidaymakers can travel without the need to self-isolate for  days when theyto England. However, the Times reports Mr Shapps is planning to announce an end to quarantine restrictions for the popular holiday destination on Monday. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.  The decision to initially exclude Portugal from the list - published at the start of July - due to a spike in cases in capital Lisbon infuriated its government which has lobbied hard for it to be included. Coronavirus cases are lower in popular tourist destinations such as the Algarve, the Azores islands and Madeira - with the Foreign Office having already lted the ban on non-essential travel to the latter two. No has, meanwhile, moved to quash reports that Spain could be axed from the list following a dramatic surge of , cases this week. Particular concern surrounds the regions of Catalonia and Aragon, and as a result there has been some suggestion of the introduction of regional air bridges. Though Government sources say that is not under consideration. However, Gloria Guea, president of the World Travel and Tourism Council, said air corridors between financial centres, such as London and New York, could provide a vital boost to business travel and help boost the economy. She added: Enforcing country-wide restrictions is a blunt instrument which benefits no one.

The Queen mum, who died aged  in , became jealous of her daughter when she ascended the throne because of all of the power and privilege that came from being the monarch, the programme claims. Fans of the global hit The Crown will recognise the frosty relationship between the two women as Elizabeth II takes over following her fatheraposs early death in , aged just . But according to the documentary The Private Lives of the Windsors, her mother was deeply concerned about Philip marrying into the family and viewed him as the enemy. Her ill feeling to the Duke of Edinburgh was allegedly due to his pursuit of her daughter. The final episode of series, which airs next Monday on the Smithsonian Channel, claims the Queen Mother was used to getting her own way and was resentful when she had to let an outsider, Prince Philip, into her close circle because he challenged her authority as family matriarch. Historian and biographer Professor Jane Ridley says: The Queen Mother viewed him as rather an enemy and in fact one would see those early years as being a tug-of-war and a tussle for the ear of the Queen.

Before and after photographs of the top-secret military base in the Nevada desert show a large hangar has vanished.The mystery around the site has sparked rumours aliens and UFO have been captured there, as American authorities reveal almost nothing publicly about what its purpose is.Long-range photographs captured by private pilot Gabe Zeman offer a rare insight into the layout of one of the most enigmatic landmarks in the world. The pilot had permission to fly along the border of the base despite the airspace over Area  being tightly restricted.  He has flown over the area three times - enabling him to capture some curious changes at the site, according to The Sun.In one of Mr Zemanaposs photos taken this April, a new hangar appears to be under construction at one part of the Area  site. But just months later, the structure with a triangular sloped roof has vanished. The second photo taken this July shows a void at the site where the perhaps temporary hangar once stood. Zeman, who is an air traffic controller records his flights with a GoPro camera, and can be heard in his footage asking permission to fly along the border of the Area  airspace.  He took the incredible photos of Area  and other top secret installations on the Nevada Test and Training Range after receiving permission to fly through the airspace. He took the images while flying Cessna , after receiving permission from air traffic controllers to pass through the airspace last weekend because it was aposcoldapos, meaning no military flights were taking place.He told Mystery Wire that he has been incredibly careful during his flights not to cross the line into among the most heavily-restricted airspace in the world. He told the publication passing into the airspace would land a pilot in serious trouble - although he added he did not think the consequences would be anything dramatic like theyaposre going to shoot you down. In an April interview about the first time he flew over the airspace, Mr Zeman said he saw nothing of interest as he passed by the site- but added that it was thrilling to have such a close encounter with one a famed mystery spot. Iaposm not really seeing any activity, he said.  Itaposs just the runways and stuff and I think itaposs pretty cool anyway, just seeing that, you know, the place that everybody knows about, talks about, but you canapost really see. Only last year, thousands of alien fans plotted to aposStorm Area .apos The September event saw hordes flock to the dusty patch of desert after an internet joke took on a le of its own. The site has captured the popular imagination for decades, as extraterrestial conspiracy theories and science fiction added to its allure. The site deep in the desert has signs dotted around the base warning deadly force is authorised against trespassers. It wasnapost until , that the CIA even acknowledged Area  existed.

While the virus has been found in semen and faeces it is not yet clearcoronavirus can be transmitted through sex. The B.C. Centre for Disease Control in Canada has suggested lovers use aposglory holesapos as a way of intercourse with minimum physical contact. A aposglory holeapos is a hole cut into a wall that’s only large enough for a penis to slip through which means lovers can be in two separate rooms while having sex. Health officials are warning people thatthey have any symptoms of Covid-, have been in contact with someone who has the virus, or has been exposed to it, orthey have been told to self-isolate then they should refrain from sex. Using condoms, lubricant and dental dams can help to reduce any risks of contracting the virus during sex. But in addition they are recommending that lovers can try wearing a mask, refraining from kissing, using a condom, choose sexual positions that limit face-to-face contact and wash their entire body with soap and water beforehand as other ways of minimising any risks. According to an urban dictionary aposglory holesapos are usually used for having anonymous oral or penetrative sex but during the pandemic they can now help to reduce the risk of contracting coronavirus. The B.C. Centre for Disease Controlaposs website states: “Use barriers, like walls , that allow for sexual contact but prevent close face-to-face contact.In New York, health officials hinted about using aposglory holesapos but did not name them specfically.New York City health officials hinted at using glory holes in a recent three-page document without specically naming them.A document says: “Be creative with sexual positions and physical barriers, like walls, that allow sexual contact while preventing close face-to-face contact.  Other socially distant friendly sexual activities include masturbating in the same room as a lover or engaging in virtual sex online. Veerawat Manosutthi, a senior medical expert at the Thai Disease Control Department, has advised that anyone who has overcome coronavirus should avoid sex for  days, and has even warned against kissing. Speaking to Khaosod English, Veerawat said: “Those who believe themselves to be free of the virus should use condoms when having sex. Kissing should also be avoided as it is also known that it can spread through the mouth.” "},{"url":null,"title":"two children accidentally topple museums","story":"NewsTwo children knock over museums £, glass sculpture of Disney castle while playing chaseThe parents of two children who broke a £, glass blown sculpture modelled on Disneys iconic castle have apologised and promised to take responsibility for the repairsShareCommentsByLuke MatthewsAudience Writer:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news us-news video two-kids-destroy-k-glass-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:true,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:true,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news world-news two-children-accidentally-topple-museums-\"\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

Thataposs because two children who visited the Shanghai Museum of Glass broke a £, castle into pieces after chasing each other around the exhibition and climbing over the protective barrier. The Fantasy Castle is the worldaposs largest glass blown castle created by Spanish glassblower Miguel Arribas and is based on the iconic Cinderella Castle at the Walt Disney World Resort. The work weighs kg and is worth about £,, featuring spires made with -karat gold. It had taken the artist  hours to complete and used half a million glass loops, according to Manuel Arribas, co-found of the Arribas Brothers, a chain of glass and crystal shops at Disney Parks around the world. The castle had been presented to the museum in  to mark its fth anniversary but the venue announced at the weekend it had been damaged on May . It said two children visiting the museum had crossed through the belt barrier and bumped into the display while chasing one another, toppling the case and causing the castle to fall. The main spire was broken and other sections suffered ious degrees of damage - but the museum has not revealed the exact cost of the broken exhibit.The venue has contacted the artists to try and arrange for repair works, but they are unable to visit to China at present due to travel restrictions imposed as a result of the coronavirus crisis.Shanghai Museum of Glass urged visitors to follow the guidelines and refrain from running or crossing protective railings, and apologised to visitors who will not be able to see its collection in its entirety.

The season before last I had my hip surgery and missed the whole year, but last season I was fully fit for the whole season.“I got a run of games which was good and the next thing is I just need to maintain that myself and stay ready for whatever challenge is next.”Though he’s open to joining another side on these shores, the challenge for the Scottish Cup winner could be his first senior club in his home country.“I will not rule out anything north of the border. I would love an opportunity in England, of course, I have always said that,” he said.“When I first went up there at the start I was always of the mindset that I would like to have an opportunity in England just to see how I would go and what I could do.”Meekings’ decision to leave Dundee centred on his young family and, despite some online criticism surrounding his departure, he thanked the club’s fans for messages of support.#Unfortunately it is part of social media nowadays. I#ve always said it gives people a license to write what they want behind a screen,# he said of negative comments.#A lot of the fans have been positive and have been thankful and thoughtful with their comments afterwards as they understand the time that we are in. They have wished me well and I wish Dundee all the best for the future.#I thank the fans for their support over the last few seasons and I was honoured to be the captain of the club.#It wasn#t an easy decision to have to make but it was one I had to do purely on the decision of my family and that is the way that things have to be now.#He added: #I had every intention of staying had it been slightly dferent. But with the club having to make cuts – they have let go of Jimmy Nicholl the assistant manager, Cammy McDermid the sports scientist – there is cuts being made and I can completely understand that.#The football club needs to survive and Dundee put themselves first in looking after themselves which is completely respectful in the same way as I need to put my family first when it comes to making the decision about my le and our lives.#I think that anyone who thinks about it properly will understand and respect the decision I#ve made.

So,he’s only bringing in two or three new players, they have to work. Fair enough, take time to get it right but he needs to add some quality to the squad.Whether or not that happens, there are a number of players in the squad who will need to step up and play their part in the new season.As I said before, there are question marks across the squad but I also feel players like Jamie Robson and Liam Smith are types who could flourish in the top flight and excel.I’m looking forward to seeing how Louis Appere does with the step up in quality, too.You’ve also got players like Mark Reynolds and Nicky Clark who obviously have quality but are maybe the wrong side of .You need to find the right balance and, looking at the squad, it just feels a bit off right now.There have been a few niggles in pre-season to key players – keeping them fit will be massive because clearly to be successful, United will need Lawrence Shankland, Calum Butcher and Benjamin Siegrist to be fit and firing, no doubt.There is a lot to be positive about the squad at Tannadice after last season but I can’t help but think they will struggle in the top flight without some help.It was a surprise to see Andrew Nelson leave Dundee on Friday.I don’t know the story behind his departure but he’s the type of player I think needs the stability of being at one club for a few years.And I would have liked to have seen that happen for him at Dens Park.Because it is a gamble for a player his age to go looking for a new club.Nelson would no doubt have plenty of chances in James McPake’s first team next season.With finances at the club the way they are, bringing in lots of new players is unlikely.I’d expect the squad next campaign to be a tight one and that spells opportunity for a player like Nelson.The way he started out at Dundee with some big goals in the Premiership, there was a chance to be a success at the Dark Blues.It’s a shame the way it’s all ended for him and the club with the overall situation right now but I guess he feels like it was time to move on.A chance missed for both.The arbritration looking at Hearts and Partick Thistle’s relegation has begun and obviously may have an impact on Dundee United.All this should have been done and dusted, though – the new season kicks off in  days!It’s sad that it has come to this and clubs need to be defending themselves against other clubs.If there was proper leadership from the SPFL and they took control of things from the start we wouldn’t need this.After watching the FA Cup semi-finals at the weekend Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has a big decision to make at Man U.Following another big blunder, can he afford to stick with David De Gea or drop him tomorrow LEE WILKIE: Micky Mellon less of a gamble for Dundee United than Steve McClaren\" title\"#LEE WILKIE: Micky Mellon less of a gamble for Dundee United than Steve McClaren# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp lee-wilkie-micky-mellon-less-of-a-gamble-for-dundee-united-than-steve-mcclaren embed # secretWnjibuTys\" data-secret\"WnjibuTys\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"midweek joy for golfer david","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDavid Ronald took the honours in the first midweek stableford at Tarbert Golf Club, with a fantastic score of  points.He was on target to break  for the first time but finished with a double bogey for a , still a great score.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them.

But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy.

Guidelines remain to avoid touching surfaces or opening gates where possible, to follow signs and avoid coming into contact with farm workers where applicable, and to keep dogs on leads and avoid areas known to be busy. Pubs and restaurants without door space have also been allowed to reopen.

It is now one of the most beautul drives in the place, and as a drive it would be destroyed.#The line from Glasgow to Oban took  years to build and finally opened in , proving extremely popular with holidaymakers for many years. The proposed branch line from Dalmally to Inveraray was never built, despite plans to #hide# the railway from the duke’s view. A plan from  shows a proposed tunnel to carry the line through the duke’s policies near to the castle. This proposal, like many others, was defeated in the House of Lords.Instead, provision was made at Dalmally for a waiting room, the #Duke’s Room#, at Dalmally Station where visitors arriving by train could await the arrival of a carriage in comfort.This is just one of innumerable fascinating stories stored within the Argyll Papers, the family and estate archive of the Campbell family, dukes of Argyll.The Friends of the Argyll Papers was established to support the development of the archive and to promote its use and enjoyment by a wide audience.It has been described as one of the most important private archives in Britain, offering a rich resource for Scottish and British history from the th to the st centuries.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

An MOT test will check the general condition of a tyre as well as the amount of tread it has, so its important to give them a thorough looking over. Make sure theyre inflated to the correct pressure too.The legal minimum tyre tread depth in the UK is .mm throughout a continuous band in the middle of the tyre. Tread gauges are the best way to check the depth, but you can use a p piece too - put the coin into a groove and the outer rim of the p piece is obscured, the tyre has enough tread. If you can see the outer rim, its definitely time for some new rubber.NUMBER PLATEIt can be easy to forget to check the number plate, but its an area which is checked during the test. Ensure its the right colour and that its fully legible too. It must also be the right size, too.HEADLIGHTS AND INDICATORSHeadlights and indicators are crucial to remaining safe on the road, which is why theyre a key part of the MOT test. Ensure theyre all working, and dont forget to test the hazard lights too!BRAKE LIGHTSIf you want to let people know that youre slowing down, then brake lights are a key - and legal - must. One of the easiest ways to check them over is to reverse up to a reflective surface - such as a window or shiny garage door - then press the brake pedal and check in the rear-view mirror to ensure theyre working.SEATS AND SEAT BELTSFront seats should have a good range of motion, so slide them forward and back to make sure everything is moving freely and easily. Seat belts should be checked over properly too pull them in and out to check theyre operating correctly and give them a sharp tug as well to make sure that they react as they should doa crash were to occur.HORNWhile youre inside the car, test out the horn and make sure it works - this is something that testers will check straight away.SCREENWASHThe majority of the checks on this list are easy to work out, but checking the screenwash is something that many people forget to do. An MOT centre can fail a cartheres not enough screenwash in the bottle ndash so its crucial that you check to see its filled to the proper level.WINDSCREENAnd while were on the subject of being able to see out of a car properly, its a good time to check over the windscreen. Any damage larger than mm will result in a fail, so look out for any stone chips or cracks.WINDSCREEN WIPERSWhile youre checking over the windscreen, give the wipers a thorough look too. They should be able to effectively clear the screen, leaving no streaks or making a rubbing noise. If thats the case, replace them ndash its a two-minute job on the vast majority of cars.ENGINE FLUIDS AND LEVELSIts best to make sure your car has plenty of fuel in the tank before you put it into its MOT, and its possible that you could be turned away from the test centreit doesnt have enough petrol or diesel. The same goes for engine oil ndash so check the levels of this are correct too."},{"url":null,"title":"absolutely-vital-shop-local-save-high-streets","story":"The Scotland Loves Local campaign has launched across the country to encourage Scots to go back to their roots, think local first and support their local high streets safely and in line with public healthguidelines.The Coronaviruspandemic has hit high streets and local businesses hard - now is the time to support them to get back on their feet.

mouth covered or face a fine of up to pound.People with certain disabilities will be exempt.This comes after rules requiring people to wear face coverings on public transport became mandatory last month.Initially many experts and authorities, including the World Health Organisation , suggested face coverings were not effective in preventing the spread of Covid- but are now recommending wearing them in indoor spaces.ndash Has there been confusion over the new rules Yes, opposition MPs have said it needs to be claried whether customers have to wear face coverings in takeaways and sandwich shops in England.The criticism came after days of mixed messages with the Health Secretary and Boris Johnsonrsquos official spokesman contradicting each other on the matter.The Dailyreported early on Thursday that people using sandwich shops and takeaways will be required to wear a mask, and buying food from the counter and then sitting down to eat inside the shop will be banned.But the Government refused to confirm the report ahead of the formal announcement.ndash What does the science say about face coverings A report recently published by the Royal Society suggests that even basic homemade face coverings can reduce transmissionenough people wear them when in public.The study, based on mathematical modelling, showed thatan entire population wore face coverings that were only % effective, it would bring the R value, which is the number of people an infected inidual passes the virus on to, from . to under ., without the need for lockdowns.Another Royal Society report suggests the use of

emeritus professor of the epidemiology of infectious diseases at the University of Nottingham, said: ldquoLack of strong evidence of their effectiveness should not be considered a problem but the evidence is accumulating that they have a part to play in reducing transmission and also in protecting the wearer.In addition, there is also increased evidence which suggests that many people with the

He would arrive for a few months in the summer, then vanish until the following year.He was always mysterious as to where he came from and where he was going. He had an accent that some said was Irish, but it was mixed with a most definite local Scots dialect. He was an old man with an unkempt beard. He always wore a bonnet a certain way, and wild strands of white hair grew from the sides of it. While he still had most of his teeth, there was one visibly missing, which was revealed when he smiled. When people asked him his name he would be reluctant to say. People called him the Porridge Maker.His most treasured possession was his cooking pot. It was large and heavy and he would carry it on his back with the help of straps he had made. He tied the lid tightly and all his other possessions would be stored in the pot. It became a kind of rucksack as he travelled.He would walk for miles, humming to himself, singing and sometimes playing his penny whistle. Then he would choose a place to settle for the night, and unpack his pot, and start cooking. He would make an evening broth from whatever he had managed to acquire during his dayrsquos travel. Then under the canopy of the stars, or under the boughs of a treeit was raining, he would wrap himself up in the thick blanket that he used during the day as a kind of jacket.Every morning he would make porridge, and always a larger amount than he would need himself. This was the time when people would enquire as to his purpose and origins. Often it was the small children of the village whose curiosity would make them assemble round him and ask questions. Sometimes they would be shooed away by their parents, but often the older members of the community who had more time would engage him in conversation, and then sit with him.The Porridge Maker had tales and riddles, news from far-flung lands and memories of past deeds and events which made his company fascinating for old and young alike. Soon it became apparent why he would make more porridge than he needed: it was to share. He would share it from his one bowl, which he called his Porridge Quaich. It would be passed round in an almost religious ceremony.But to have a taste of his delicious porridge, a price had to be paid. A story or riddle must be told, a memory shared or some wisdom imparted. The Porridge Maker would listen carefully to everything said. This was one way he gained his vast knowledge of the world and of its stories.The other was, of course, in his travels. As he walked he would observe everything: the way the clouds formed, the song of the birds, the landscape and its curiosities, the way people behaved everything. Then he would just be, and allow his thoughts and observations to mingle. This was how new tales and riddles formed in his imagination.And so as he cooked his evening meal, he would tell stories to himself and whisper his riddles, and he would look forward to sharing them with whoever might come his way and sit by his fire.Then one day, someone recognised him.The Porridge Maker had settled himself away from the road by the River Tyne, downstream from Haddington. He had made a small fire and was cooking a trout he had secretly caught when an old man of similar age walked by, stopped, stared at him, and then made his way towards him.The Porridge Maker thought he was now in trouble. But the old man wasnrsquot interested in the fish. He studied the Porridge Makerrsquos features carefully, then he nodded with a grin.ldquoAye, sae it is ye! said the man with an accusing tone.ldquoAye, fir sure I am maist certainly me! replied the Porridge Maker.ldquoYe cannae bamboozle me, said the stranger with a triumphant mocking laughter, ldquoI thocht I kent ye by the way ye wear yer bonnet and by yer stooped shudder, but noo that Irsquove seen yer face I ken fir sure!ldquoAnd  asked the Porridge Maker, seemingly unfazed by this sudden attempt to unmask his identity.The stranger sat himself down and looked the Porridge Maker in the eye.ldquoI cannae mind yer exact name, he said, ldquobut I ken ye were a Jacobite.ldquoThose days are lang past noo, said the Porridge Maker, still keeping his calm.ldquoAye, they are, thankfully. And they hanged many orsquo the likes orsquo ye.ldquoThat they did, replied the Porridge Maker.ldquoYer a MacGregor, said the old man, ldquoI mind that, and ye hud blood oan yer haunds ater Prestonpans.The Porridge Maker said nothing. He just stared into his fire.ldquoYe sliced a manrsquos heid in twa by the wall.Suddenly the Porridge Maker looked up. ldquoHowrsquod ye ken that  he asked, now startled.ldquoBecause I wis there!The Porridge Maker now looked the man in the eye.The old man continued: ldquoYe were goanie dae the same tae me. I hud nae weapon sae I punched ye.ldquoAye, said the Porridge Maker, ldquoI remember that weel enough, revealing the gap in his teeth that was the result.The old man laughed.ldquoThat punch saved ma le, said the old man, ldquofir it gied me time tae run as ye stood like a stunned rabbit. But I saw ye ater, greetin like a bairn.The Porridge Maker was silent but pursed his lips and nodded.ldquoYe cudnae thole it cud ye  said the man accusingly.ldquoI wis a lad, and arsquo fired up with rage, said the Porridge Maker. ldquoHe wisnae the only one that day I killt. But I vowed he wud be the last Irsquod kill tae decorate anotherrsquos pride. He hud cried fir mercy sayin he had bairns, but I didnae understand his words till after Irsquod cut him.The old man laughed. ldquoSae much fir the great warrior race! Ye deserted after the battle, didnrsquot ye  Ye ran awa like a coward and cudnae gang hame. If the Redcoats hadnae caught ye, yer ain family wud huv disowned ye fir the coward that ye are!ldquoI did go hame after, but I found ma hoose burnt and ma we and bairns slain. Sae I hud nae family left after that time, said the Porridge Maker with a breaking voice.The old man bowed his head. ldquoAye, it wis a sair time richt enough. But the wages orsquo rebellion are unforgiving.ldquoDae ye ken the name orsquo the lad that I killt by ye  asked the Porridge Maker hopefully.The man was surprised by the question, and looked at the ground as he thought.ldquoWull I think, aye, it wis Wull. I mind he wis really feart, poor lad, he carsquod fir his mither as he died.The Porridge Maker lowered his head, reliving that moment he had tried so often to forget.Neither men had yet exchanged their names.ldquoYou hungry  asked the Porridge Maker, ldquofor ye can share whit I have ye huv earned it by sharing yer memory wi me.And so two men, who once had tried to kill each other, now shared a meal.ldquoWull, the Porridge Maker whispered as he ate.He finally had a name for the young lad hersquod slain all those years ago in  at Prestonpans.The deepest wounds of war are often those unseen, and the stories left out by military historians are the stories of lives traumatised and changed forever.Sadly, whatrsquos left of the Prestonpans battlefield site is now under threat by proposed new developments."},{"url":null,"title":"column-heyday-open-air-pools","story":"Open-air pool lidos in England are already open.If we were back in our former holiday heyday, we could offer a choice of three seaside lidos.Swimming lsquopondsrsquo at Port Seton, Dunbar and North Berwick once buzzed with summer sociability in the sun.For families, they offered entertainment, like galas, ing displays, water polo matches and midnight bathing.A fortnightrsquos lsquobucket-and-spadersquo seaside holiday drove the popularity of lidos between the wars.

An MOT test will check the general condition of a tyre as well as the amount of tread it has, so its important to give them a thorough looking over. Make sure theyre inflated to the correct pressure too.The legal minimum tyre tread depth in the UK is .mm throughout a continuous band in the middle of the tyre. Tread gauges are the best way to check the depth, but you can use a p piece too - put the coin into a groove and,the outer rim of the p piece is obscured the tyre has enough tread. If you can see the outer rim, its definitely time for some new rubber.NUMBER PLATEIt can be easy to forget to check the number plate, but its an area which is checked during the test. Ensure its the right colour and that its fully legible too. It must also be the right size, too.HEADLIGHTS AND INDICATORSHeadlights and indicators are crucial to remaining safe on the road, which is why theyre a key part of the MOT test. Ensure theyre all working, and dont forget to test the hazard lights too!BRAKE LIGHTSIf you want to let people know that youre slowing down, then brake lights are a key - and legal - must. One of the easiest ways to check them over is to reverse up to a reflective surface - such as a window or shiny garage door - then press the brake pedal and check in the rear-view mirror to ensure theyre working.SEATS AND SEAT BELTSFront seats should have a good range of motion, so slide them forward and back to make sure everything is moving freely and easily. Seat belts should be checked over properly too pull them in and out to check theyre operating correctly and give them a sharp tug as well to make sure that they react as they should doa crash were to occur.HORNWhile youre inside the car, test out the horn and make sure it works - this is something that testers will check straight away.SCREENWASHThe majority of the checks on this list are easy to work out, but checking the screenwash is something that many people forget to do. An MOT centre can fail a cartheres not enough screenwash in the bottle ndash so its crucial that you check to see its filled to the proper level.WINDSCREENAnd while were on the subject of being able to see out of a car properly, its a good time to check over the windscreen. Any damage larger than mm will result in a fail, so look out for any stone chips or cracks.WINDSCREEN WIPERSWhile youre checking over the windscreen, give the wipers a thorough look too. They should be able to effectively clear the screen, leaving no streaks or making a rubbing noise. If thats the case, replace them ndash its a two-minute job on the vast majority of cars.ENGINE FLUIDS AND LEVELSIts best to make sure your car has plenty of fuel in the tank before you put it into its MOT, and its possible that you could be turned away from the test centreit doesnt have enough petrol or diesel. The same goes for engine oil ndash so check the levels of this are correct too."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-school-return-child-psychologist-reveals-three-top-tips","story":"Schools across the country are set to open from August , with scientic advice published by the Scottish Government last week saying pupils should not have to physically distance when they go back.Face coverings should not generally be needed but staff should stay two metres away from children and other staff where possible.Despite the welcome , a leading teaching union has warned ofthe emotional trauma for children ing to school after a prolonged period off, and said a phasedwould be lsquovitalrsquo for their wellbeing.Alison Murphy, Secretary of the Edinburgh Educational Institute of Scotland local association, said: ldquoChildren will need to be run through lsquoThis is where you wash your handsrsquo, lsquoThis is your bit of the playgroundrsquo, lsquoThis is how the one-way system worksrsquo and so on.ldquoYou wonrsquot be able to do that per cent of pupils are in the building on the first day.ldquoIt would be chaos - it wouldnrsquot be safe.ldquoAnd therersquos the emotional trauma - theyrsquove been away from school for months.ldquoAn adult who had been off work for four months would be entitled to a phasedand for good reasons.Schools have been closed as a result of the virusThe online tutoring service MyTutor has enlisted the advice ofDr. Shreena Ghelani ndash a senior clinical psychologist ndash about how to handle theto school.Here are her three tips:Managing worry and anxietyIf you know your child might struggle with going back to school, try developing a mental toolbox of things they can do when they are worried at school.This might include a song to sing to themselves, visualising a calm place, practising breathing techniques and identying safe staff they can tellthey begin to feel nervous during the day.Speak to your children about the impact of CoronavirusLet children know that it is likely that other families may have been impacted by the virus,whether thatrsquos keyworking parents working hard, or family bereavements.Encourage your child to be patient and kindto other children.Let you child know what they might still be expected to do ndash not hug friends, wash their hands more often, or not share toys.Donrsquot rush to get back to normal too quicklyWhen school restarts in your area, you may find that children are more tired than usual by the extra demands and sensory stimulation placed on them.Ease them back in to their routine gently and allow enough space and time in a new schedule for any hiccups so that yoursquore not having to manage too many demands.When the time comes, yoursquoll find yoursquoll feel less stressedyou know there will be bumps in the road.You can find more tips and online tutoring at MyTutor."},{"url":null,"title":"plans-parking-north-berwicks-elcho-green-put-hold","story":"East Lothian Council announced several temporary changes to the town centre last week as part of its lsquoSpaces for Peoplersquo initiative, which aims to revive towns while helping people socially distance to prevent the spread of coronavirus.Among the changes was the temporary creation of long-stay car parking spaces on North Berwicks famous Elcho Green, which overlooks the iconic West Bay.The announcement of the plans for the car park has outraged many residents in the town, who have shared their objections through a petition set up on Saturday evening in opposition to the plans.

Irsquove looked out my monthly cinema pass in anticipation of re-opening around July .I appreciate not everyone feels this way, but Irsquom ready to start living again. Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus. Uncertainty permeates through every part of our lives now, and we must find ways to live with and even embrace thiswe are to make it through the tough months ahead.

If you have a shady corner, make sure you plant shade tolerant options, andyou have sun trap areas, select plants that will flourish there.\"Allens top plants for a tropical sensation...Trachycarpus fortunei - a really hardy palm , this will give your garden the exotic look and feel without the need to worry about whether it will survive through winter. They are rather slow growing, ultimately reaching a height of over m after - years.Canna - any type of canna will bring large juicy leaves and exotic looking flowers in pink, orange, yellow, white or red. Some have iegated leaves such as Canna Stuttgart or Phaison.Passlora caerulea - a hardy semi-evergreen climber with the most striking flowers. This vigorous plant will cover a wall or pergola in no time.Fatsia japonica - a medium-sized evergreen shrub with palmately-lobed leaves to cm in width, and small white flowers in clusters and small black fruits.Dahlia - extravagant and flamboyant flowers, plus they flower all summer long. For drama and colour, try Karma Chocwith dark red velvety flowers, or Edwins Sunsetwith beautul vivid red flowers that almost glow.Use decor and accessories...Blend your tropical-looking plants with exotic accessories and seating to create a holiday feel. Experts at Dobbies Garden Centresoffer five design tips to help you into the holiday mood.... Go totally tropicalFill patio containers with a selection of vibrant bedding or perennial cottage garden plants for an instant display of foliage and flower colour, including Cordyline australis Peko, along with potted palms such as Phoenix canariensis, Chamaerops humilisand Trachycarpus fortunei to add height and interest and look great in groups. Position pots behind garden furniture to create the illusion that they are planted in the ground.. Create a colour popBring a brilliant burst of sunshine and add some zing to your exterior space using an eclectic array of brightly coloured pots, mixing and matching flowers in contrasting shades for maximum impact. Fun accessories will quickly brighten patios or balconies. Choose pots in vibrant primary colours, which will really pop against white or neutral backdrops.. Bring the indoors outBrighten your garden getaway by bringing houseplants outside for the day. Adding your favourite indoor orchid to a bistro table will create a tropical centrepiece - just be sure tothem to their normal home later on to ensure they dont get exposed to too much direct sunlight.An outdoor rug will instantly transform your space and offers protection to patios and decking from sun cream spillages or melting ice creams. They also help to zone an area, adding a stylish decorative touch. Day beds and hanging egg chairs are the ultimate garden getaway luxuryyou have room.. Make it magicalFor atmospheric evenings, accessorise with a iety of lanterns, fairy lights and candles to enhance the mood - it is amazing how magical a space can look at twilight. A stylish lantern, or a solar-powered string of lights draped across trees and fences will stretch out the time spent outside. Use blankets, floor cushions and chunky knit throws to keep warm and curl up under the stars.. And when the sun sets...Take the chill out of cooler evenings by investing in a practical chiminea or fire pit for your patio, adding warmth and light to extend outdoor entertaining.And think about how you are going to protect your plants during the cooler months, RHS expert Allen advises. \"As many domestic gardeners do not have the time or space to bring plants inside over winter, it is essential to protect in situ. If focusing on the tropical look, select hardy options such as trachycarpus, fatsia, eucomis, tricyrtis, schefflera and zantedeschia, which will re-emerge after winter.\"If you want to have bananas or half-hardy palms, try wrapping them throughout the winter using horticultural fleece or hessian and fill the inside with straw for extra insulation,\" she adds."},{"url":null,"title":"books-richard-holloway-finding-spirituality-godless-world","story":"Richard Holloway, the former Primus - or leader - of the Scottish Episcopal Church, may, however, have written a book which lays the first few paving stones on the path to finding some sort of spiritual meaning in a world in which God has long ago died.I had my last flash of believing in God when I was about seven. My grandmother was ill and I remember kneeling and praying at the foot of my bed for her. But even then, as a child, I knew what I was doing was ridiculous. I wouldnrsquot have understood the words ldquointerventionary God in , but I knew innately that there was no great being in the sky who was going to answer my prayers and make my grandmother better. Only science could do that.My grandmother lost her own faith after the death of her husband, but shersquod instilled in me a love for both the stories of the Bible and the poetry of it. By  Irsquod read the Bible from cover to cover. Reading it on your own - with no minister or priest to guide, or misguide, you - is perhaps the surest path to atheism. The biblical God is a monster, a Bronze Age psychopath, and the stories of the Bible are patently just that - stories. The Bible contains truth only in the way that a fairytale contains truth: therersquos wisdom and teaching there, not history or fact.The positive lesson I took from it was this:Jesus really existed then he was one of the most remarkable humans to ever live and we should all try to live by his teachings. He was no God, just a great and wise human being.I spent my twenties sneering at and hating religion. By my thirties, as I found myself growing into fatherhood, I realised that while I still had contempt for religion and faith, the lack of meaning in my le - beyond the love of my children and family - was starting to trouble me.By my forties I understood that while atheism is factually, historically, scientically the only game in town, theres something about the human mind that requires more than pure reason alone. Reason does not provide meaning. It merely explains.Reason tells me God doesnrsquot exist. But then what  Shopping, spending, consumption, gyms, acquiring more money, ambition, work, aimless travel, TV as an analgesic for the soul hellip drink, drugs, food, sex, endless bitter and dark cynicism  What replaces God in a world where God is dead  What holds the centre together Irsquove just turned , and, like most of the world amid the pandemic, my thoughts have been tinged with intimations of mortality these last few months. Then along comes this octogenarian from Glasgow called Richard Holloway and he offers a speck of hope.This is no self-help book, incidentally. This isnrsquot New Age hokum, rather the working out of a manrsquos soul,such a thing exists. Itrsquos the story of Hollowayrsquos intellectual le, its trials, its failings, and how he has come to find spiritual meaning free from the dictum of religion.I struggle to define this book - Stories We Tell Ourselves: Making Meaning in a Meaningless Universe - beyond saying that it represents a first step toward a new form of spiritual thought. Holloway, once one of our nationrsquos leading religious figures, is now ldquoa Christian without God. He does not believe in the fairytales of religion - and he especially distrusts the ldquoruthless optimism of priests and ministers, and the cost they have wrought to human happiness - but he holds the Christian message as close to his heart as any man or woman still wearing the cloth of God.ldquoI follow Jesus, he says in closing his book, ldquoetsi deus non daretur. Or to translate the Latin, ldquoasGod were not there. Science has consigned God to the grave, but we can still live the ideals of Christianity without buying into the ludicrous myths of Adam and Eve and Noahrsquos Ark.What Holloway does most powerfully is dismiss certainty in all its forms - political as well as religious. People have died for certainties, and killed for certainties, whether its how a person prays or how much power a political party has. Today, those certainties are seen rightly as ghastly jokes, absurd crimes, like the war Jonathan Swt satirically imagined in Gulliverrsquos Travels which raged between those who opened their boiled egg from the bottom or the top.We can be certain of nothing, Holloway tells us, but doubt and love. Wersquore surrounded by ldquoruthless optimists on all sides politically - leavers, remainers, Yes, No, left, right - on it goes - others demanding we see the world through their eyes only. Holloway says to hell with that. Nobody knows anything when it comes to the decisions which shape the future - wersquore all taking shots in the dark. What matters is that we acknowledge our limitations, take others into consideration when we make our choices and try to hold a sense of love in our hearts for every living creature.Holloway speaks of ldquoresolute irresolution, the necessity of holding two opposing ideas in onersquos head at the same moment - God may be dead but the message of the man called Christ matters. Most of all, he says, we must not ldquoclose our account with reality. In other words, we must never shut our minds, and think we have found the answers because we havenrsquot and never will.This is a gospel of love, and doubt, that everyone can practice - especially atheists. For that Irsquom truly grateful to Holloway for codying what Irsquove innately felt throughout my le. Itrsquos brought a flicker of light into a darkened world. Holloway brings a message of spiritual hope for all - and for that, a few hundred years ago, this very wise and very kind man would have been burned to death at the stake. That makes him a hero in my eyes, and so and I say, God bless him."},{"url":null,"title":"cork-people-proud-show","story":"\"I feel I can do anything in front of the crew, which we have - theres not much of me that the crew hasnt seen!\" quips the Cork-born star, .In the BBC comedy, Murphy plays Conor MacSweeney, whos best friends with Jock OKeeffe, played by fellow Corkonian, Chris Walley, .Over the past two series - spin-offs from the  film of the same name - we have followed the two loveable rogues as they get themselves into all sorts of sticky situations.Particularly memorable storylines include the teenagers attempt to steal a giant tuna fish from the market in series one, and when they got expelled after stripping off in the classroom and peeing on Principal Walshs leg in series two.Now were getting a series three, in which we see the lads trying to make their way as young adults, with yet more questionable methods of making some money, all while Jock navigates being a new dad.One things for sure things wont go smoothly.Here, we chat to Walley and Murphy, plus Hilary Rose - who plays Conors stressed-out but loving mum, Mairead - to find out more.NEW CHAPTERIts an unconventional family set-up in The Young Offenders, which is set and filmed in Cork.A heart-warming episode in series one saw widower Maireadbecome a foster mum to Jock - whose mum is also dead - after he escapes his abusive, alcoholic dad.At the end of series two, Jocks girlfriend Siobhan - whose dad happens to be Principal Walsh, who is far from the biggest fan of Jock and Conor - gave birth to baby Star .The new addition to the family means Principal Walsh and his we Orla - whose other daughter Linda is going out with Conor - now have to engage more with Mairead, which hasnt always gone well in the past.\"Season three was interesting from a character point of view because Mairead really cuts loose and, at some stages, the lads are telling her to calm down!\" follows Rose, whos also from Cork, and married Peter Foott - who created The Young Offenders - since .As for the love story between her and Sergeant Healy, she teases \"season three kinda continues that on-again, off-again, will they, wont they vibe\".The main storyline for series two is how Jock is adjusting to everyday le with baby Star.\"Conor and Jock are still getting into their sticky situations but now theres just a baby there as well,\" reveals Walley.\"I think its just a major sht in their lives and theyre just trying to figure it out all together.\"PARENTING LESSONSTwins Nola and Penny Richardson shared the role of Star, and Walley says the babies were \"incredible\".\"I want one!\" exclaims Murphy, before quickly adding \"not right now\".Rose chimes in at this point, saying she has told the boys they are always welcome to babysit her kids .\"Theyre both amazing babysitters, but there was a time when Jake was very young where they bought him a nerf gun,\" she recalls, which sets them all off laughing, with her on-screen sons looking a little sheepish.\"I dunno, we were buying toys and we were like, This is what kids that age like!\" reasons Walley.\"There was some force off ityou shot it,\" he concedes. \"Theyre heavy-duty.\"\"That was a real Conor and Jock moment for the two of us,\" admits Murphy.Having Penny and Nola on set this series was definitely a learning curve for the young actors.\"I was terried of holding babies for fear I dropped them,\" confides Walley. \"By the end of the shoot, I just was inseparable.\"MEMORABLE MOMENTSAccording to Murphy, \"theres not a street in Cork city that we havent filmed on\".\"The Cork people are so proud of the show.\"Having crowds watching them film was something they \"had to get used to pretty quick.\"\"There was a great photo in the paper a few years ago, of us making the film there are about  people in the crew, no-ones watching us filming,\" notes Murphy.\"And then there was a photo of us making season , and there were just crowds of people watching.\"It was good, it was like doing a play every day, whenever we were filming outside in the city.\"One of the new episodes sees Jock, Conor and Mairead take a trip to Dublin.Whilst filming on a road in the Irish capital city, they reveal they were pulled over by Leo Varadkars entourage as he was driving past them in an unmarked executive car.The Irish politician was taoiseach at the time .\"There was a camera in the back seat, and we were mid-scene and we were like, What does this guy want  Were filming!\" says Rose.\"And eventually Alex put down the passenger window and was like Hey!, and next thing Leo Varadkar leaned forward!\"\"His driver was like, Great show!\" recalls Murphy. \"We were like, Do you like it [to Varadkar] And he went, I havent seen it!\"\"But he did say, Ive heard its great\", adds Rose.CHARACTER DEVELOPMENTThe biggest thing Rose has taken away from making The Young Offenders is the amazing relationships theyve formed with cast and crew .\"Its about getting the job done and doing the best that you can, but you have to remember as well, for actors, were really vulnerable in front of all the crew, so you kinda put your trust in them,\" she elaborates.\"If were doing emotional scenes, theyre witnessing it, theyre trying to support you.\"As for future series, Murphy points out the only issue could be that he and Walley dont exactly look  anymore.\"At some points in the script, Jock will go, We cant do that, were only , and we were like, Can we just not mention our age \" he continues, chuckling.\"As long as we look young, I guess well see what happens.

They are much more worth the investment. Its not worth planting bedding plants at this time of year,\" says the BBC Gardeners World regular.You can enjoy a riot of colour with late-summer flowering perennials in shades ranging from zingy yellows to scorching reds and burnt oranges, which will last into October.\"Theres a huge group of plants which are all from the States, but which we think of as common English cottage garden plants, flowering from mid-summer onwards,\" adds Klein.Here are some of her recommendations...ASTERS\"Michaelmas daisies start flowering as we go into August but then they will go right the way through,\" she says. \"Aster novi-belgii is a tough aster which never seems to get disease and is ideal.\"They can be planted in summer, where you have gaps left by early-flowering plants, and grow to around cm. They prefer sun or light shade and should be kept well watered in dry soils. They make good companions with other autumn-flowering plants, including Japanese anemones.HELENIUMS\"These plants, which are vaguely from the daisy family, are superb. If you keep on deadheading, they will flower right up to the end of September,\" says Klein. \"They are just starting to flower. My favourite is Helenium El Dorado, which produces great big golden flowers, and Sahins Early Flowerer. There are lots of traditional ones, including Moerheim Beauty with its dark, copper-red daisy-like flowers, which are also popular.\"When you deadhead, cut down to the next bud on the stem, which will then flower and you can get a show through to autumn. Lt and ide heleniums every few years, which will increase your stock, Klein adds.\"If you split them in the spring, they almost fall apart for you. We do that with ours, planting three little pieces at a time.\"RUDBECKIASRudbeckias, also known as coneflowers because their bright yellow petals hang down, emphasising the prominent dark central cone, are from the same group of North American daisies. \"Rudbeckia fulgida deemii or Goldsturm are both beautul,\" Klein enthuses.Goldsturm has such an abundance of flowers that it has an almost solid effect in the late summer border. Use the smaller ieties with fiery displays of crocosmias and red hot pokers in a border, or put them in a pot to add patio colour, around perhaps a burgundy cordyline. Taller types can be put at the back of a border, framed by late-flowering clematis.PERENNIAL SUNFLOWERThese helianthus are not like the traditional big-flowered annual we know and love, but they do make a statement and come back year after year, says Klein.\"My favourite is Lemon Queen. Its a big plant but even in a little garden, you can have a big plant for impact, that will flower into October and occasionally even further.\"It grows to around m tall, with coarse, deep green foliage and light yellow flowers cm wide, with pale yellow ray florets and a dark yellow central disk.CROCOSMIASAlso known as montbretia, crocosmias are one of the main features at the RHS Tatton show. They may have a reputation for being a bit invasive, but you can just pull up the cormsthey outgrow their space, she says.\"Id put crocosmias with any of the plants weve just mentioned. I have Crocosmia Lucer, which has just started to flower and it is taking over from big euphorbias.\"MISCANTHUSDont just consider colour when youre filling the gaps, because grasses come into their own in summer and beyond. \"Varieties like Miscanthus Flamingo are so useful because they look good now but they will have beautul plumes in September, and then you can leave them all winter for structure,\" says Klein.Many of these plants can be obtained from the nurseries who attend the RHS shows, including Bluebell Cottage Gardens , Morton Nursery , Daisy Roots , Hardys Cottage Garden Plantsand Burncoose Nurseries .For more late summer gardening inspiration, visit rhs.org.uk tattonathome"},{"url":null,"title":"recipe-mary-continis-cream-chicken-soup","story":"Come rain or shine, the beaches were packed from morning till night and our cafes and chip shops did a roaring trade.

It had been a day of torrential rain, with intermittent sun. The sky was darkening as we made our way between the rows, which were heavy with fat sweet rasps. When the rain began, I put up my hood, and picked on. The scent of wet leaves and trodden earth was intoxicating, a bouquet richer than a Barola. These bushes had been growing here long before our friends arrived,  years ago. They are kept company by apple and pear trees, redcurrant bushes, and plums that, when ripe, hang from the branches like ear-rings. Therersquos also a large bed of still-ripening strawberries. One year I watched a mouse, on tiptoe, nibbling a dangling berry.Irsquove rarely tasted better raspberries than the ones we collected, their flavour enhanced by the atmosphere of the garden where they grew. Being allowed access to this most beautul, out of the way corner reminds me a little of The Secret Garden. That book that made such an impression on me as a girl that I drove my parents nuts begging to be allowed to buy a derelict Victorian walled garden close by. I would climb onto the seat by the bus stop to look over its wall and plan how Irsquod clear it of weeds and shattered glass house and fill it with vegetables and flowers. Since Irsquod shown no desire to lt so much as a dandelion in our own back yard, I was told to dream on.The garden where we, and others, are invited to forage is a perfect complement to the fields and hills beyond. Flowerbeds, graceful trees and a croquet-style lawn coexist seamlessly with fruit and, previously, rows of vegetables too. When people picture the rural idyll, itrsquos often a rose-festooned house where hollyhocks run amok. Yet the true cottage garden was never chocolate-box pretty but a place where leeks and cabbages grew among primroses and poppies ndash more Mr McGregor than Vita Sackville-West. That is still the case. In one of my favourite Hoolet gardens, a formal square bed of roses encloses a profusion of succulent young lettuces, ready to lt for lunch.This is an artful nod to where all such cultivation began. Originally, humble countryside plots were essential sources of food there was no room for unproductive and time-consuming grass, or patios where clematis and wisteria rambled towards dormer windows, choking the gutters. Wholly utilitarian, they contained rectangular beds devoted to cabbages and potatoes and, weather permitting, caned trellises for fruit. These were beautul in their own way, but it was only when flowers escaped from hedgerows and colonised the margins and spaces between the plots that they gained nostalgic postcard charm.The plant collector, Major Lawrence Johnston, is responsible for redefining the cottage garden. In the early th century, when he and his mother moved into Hidcote Manor in the Cotswolds, he took the idea of a rural plot, edited its contents, and scaled it up. The result, with winding paths, artistic focal points, and teeming, colourful borders, had the appearance of being haphazard, random and accidental, when in fact it was rigorously planned. It sounds spectacular. Increasingly, though, Irsquom coming to think that outdoor spaces designed solely to please the eye are lacking in one vital ingredient: the kind you can put on a plate.Thanks in part to the generosity of neighbours, we too are starting to feed ourselves: redcurrants and blackcurrants, strawberries ndash still in relative infancy ndash rhubarb, carrots and herbs. Wersquore not in the league of those who can nurture asparagus Irsquom told it takes seven years for a first crop to appear. In fact, wersquore not in any league at all. After Alan dug up last yearrsquos potatoes, I replanted that bed with roses, honeysuckle and lavender. At one point in late spring, these new arrivals were suddenly swamped by a profusion of shaws, as the undetected, button-sized potatoes left buried in the winter sprouted into le. Following a striking display of flowers, we now have an unexpected crop of delicious spuds to keep us going for weeks. The satisfaction of filling your own larder is immense. Itrsquos at times like this that you realise keeping a cottage garden is a process of give and take.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Within weeks, entire sectors shut down as public health measures were introduced, as people across the country rapidly found themselves adapting to the ldquonew normal.As efforts are made to reopen the country, while keeping the virus at bay, businesses, and the livelihoods and jobs they support, are fighting for survival. The UK economy is expected to experience its sharpest downturn in  years, and the latest Fraser of Allander economic commentary estimates that Scotlandrsquos economy will take the best part of two years to rebound.Despite this grim outlook, Covid- has also shown peoplersquos ability to be resilient, innovative, and quickly adopt new ways of working. This is clear from the surge of interest Business Gateway advisers have had from iniduals starting up a business, despite the challenging climate.On the surface, this may seem counter-intuitive. However, a business that is started in a volatile financial climate is often flexible, agile, and able to withstand dficult market conditions. Additionally, with people making the most of their time at home, some are using the opportunity to develop a targeted and specic idea that has real potential.There are also trends which may present opportunities for businesses. Consumer habits have shted during lockdown ndash a recent survey by Deloitte Digital found that % of Scottish customers are favouring local businesses in their communities. There are also unprecedented levels of state support available for businesses that will create or protect jobs.Customersrsquo shopping habits may continue to change as home working becomes a more permanent trend. Greater volumes of people working away from cities and town centres will have an impact on how businesses reach customers. City centre premises may no longer be as attractive, and ecommerce, a growth area for many years, will accelerate further.It can be daunting to take the plunge and start your own businesses at the best of times, which is why external, neutral and specialist advice is vitally importantlyideas are to succeed in this uncertain and fluid environment. Business Gateway advisers across the country are working closely with business owners to help determine whether an idea is viable, identy gaps and ensure that businesses start on the strongest footing. DigitalBoost, the Scottish Governmentrsquos leading digital skills programme for businesses, delivered by Business Gateway, offers practical guidance and advice that helps businesses upskill in areas such as digital marketing strategy, online trading, cyber resilience, and data analytics.Of course, the impact of Covid- cannot be forgotten. Ensuring businesses operate in line with Scottish Government guidance on containing the virus will also be of paramount importance. Business Gateway has been working hand in hand with the Scottish Government and other enterprise agencies to ensure that this sector specic guidance is readily available to business owners.At a time where, like everyone, we ourselves are concerned about our families and our livelihoods, I have been heartened at the support people have shown for each other at this incredibly dficult time. It is this attitude that I believe makes endeavours such as starting a business more possible.

he was cleared of all  counts in March this year.Last month, the Scottish Government supplied hundreds of pages of documents to the committee on a newly created harassment policy it applied to Mr Salmond in early .These showed Ms Sturgeon and her office insisted the policy covered ldquoformer ministers as well as serving ones.Last week, the Scottish Government published much of the same material on its website in response to a freedom of informationrequest.In a letter to the Governmentrsquos top official, Permanent Secretary Leslie Evans, the Holyrood inquiry said it was ldquodeeply disappointed at the way the FoI material had been released.Convener Linda Fabiani said MSPs expected it to be ldquotreated as confidential until the parliament published it the following week.ldquoHad the Scottish Government checked when we intended to publish, it would have been possible for the Parliament and Scottish Government to co-ordinate accordingly and avoid these situations arising.Ms Fabiani then raised a concern about the FoI release stating that the documents - mostof them heavily redacted - were ldquoidentical to those given the month before to the committee.She said the committee did not expect its evidence to be redacted as heavily as an FoI, as FoI rules were ldquowider in scope than the basis for withholding information from parliament.She told Ms Evans: ldquoWe seek further clarication on the redactions.Ms Fabiani said the committee was particularly worried that material involving the ldquofree and frank exchange of views for the purpose of deliberation, which is commonly redacted before release to the public, had also been cut out of the committeersquos confidential evidence.She said: ldquoPlease confirm whether information has been redacted that would fall under this exemption before submitting the documents to the Committee.ldquoWe believe that it would not be appropriate to withhold information from the parliamentary inquiry on those grounds.ldquoWe therefore seek reassurance that the Scottish Government did not exclude any information that may be relevant to the Committee.Ms Fabiani also raised the Government messing up its FoI release, noting the  PDF files were put online then quickly removed again as some were not been properly redacted.She said: ldquoI find this concerning and would reiterate that the Committee will only publish the documentation you sent to us after making our own checks on the information previously supplied with reference to its agreed published statement.ldquoIt is clearly in everyonersquos interest that we have an understanding of the basis upon which you are making redactions to the documents you are sharing with the Committee and that the Committee is not put in a similar position in relation to the next tranche of documents that will be submitted to it.A Scottish Government spokesperson said:ldquoWe have received the committeersquos letter and will reply in due course.ldquoThe names of two civil servants should have been redacted from two separate items of correspondence in line with the committeersquos wishes.ldquoDue to an oversight this didnrsquot happen ndash and when this came to light the documents we posted were taken offline briefly to redact the two names concerned and the documents were then reinstated online.ldquoWe remain committed to working with the committee and we welcome the opportunity the parliamentary inquiry will bring to address issues which have been raised."},{"url":null,"title":"Opinion  Iain Macwhirter  So was the Russia report an attempt to taint the independence referendum ","story":"Itrsquos all there between the lines of yesterdayrsquos Russia Report. Though curiously, none of this Moscow gold ever found its way into my bank account. Perhaps I should head across and demand payment.At any rate, we were told by all news sources yesterday, that involvement of the Russians in the independence referendum was ldquoconfirmed by the report of the Commons Intelligence and Security Committee. The evidence lay in ldquoopen source commentary it said, which was ldquocredible.The UK Government scandalously ignored evidence of similar Russian involvement in the Brexit referendum, said MPs on the committee, because it didnrsquot want to know. Surprise, surprise.But how come the committee was so sure about Russkie meddling in the Indyref, about which the Government also apparently did not want to know  Why was the ldquoopen source commentary ldquoso compelling  After all, such commentary is just what people had been saying in published sources.There was no shortage of ldquoopen source commentary during Brexit from any number of commentators, such as the prolic Carole Cadwalladr in the Observer, who reported that senior Brexiters were in regular contact with Russian diplomats and business interests. Why did the committee disown all that The implication was that the true Indyref smoking gun was in the classied annex to yesterdayrsquos report. According to the former UK National Security Adviser, Sir Mark Lyell Grant, interviewed on BBC World At One, it was ldquowell known that the Russians were ldquoamplying social media messages during the  campaign. Well known by whom The published report refers only to claims about voting irregularities made after the  referendum and designed to discredit the result. It also referred obliquely to newspaper speculation about cybernat ldquoMcBots punting Russian propaganda.It rather looked asthe Labour and Conservative MPs on the committee were only able to agree on one thing: that the Russians were obviously all over the Scottish independence referendum and that the Government should have taken better note.According to the Labour MP, Kevan Jones, at yesterdayrsquos ISC press conference, the UK Government ignored the ldquoflashing lights from  and turned a blind eye to evidence that similar Russian ldquomeddling had occurred in the Brexit referendum in . Perhaps surprisingly, SNP MP Steward Hosie, who is also on the committee, took up the theme with alacrity. He chastised successive UK governments for not acting on known Russian involvement in the Scottish independence referendum: ldquoIt must have been clear that had they looked for similar evidence [in Brexit] it would have been extraordinarythey had not reached the same conclusions.Questioned later about this on BBC Radio Scotland, Mr Hosie said that he was only able to talk about what was in the unredacted report, not the secret annex. Thatrsquos all very well, but it leaves a nasty smell over the entire referendum campaign.I think we can all agree that the UK is ndash as the report put it ndash ldquoa top target for Russian security and intelligence services. But the activities of the IRA, the Internet Research Agency, which is assumed to be the perpetrator of these electoral dirty tricks, are almost incidental to the more serious activities of the Russian state. After all, it is widely assumed to have been conducting assassinations on UK soil using some of the most toxic agents known. This was against former KGB spies Alexander Litvinov and Sergei Skripal. These were terrorist actions and clearly a priority for the UKrsquos intelligence and security forces.But social media influencing is a rather dferent kettle of spooks. What I mainly recall from  were the widespread claims of vote-rigging and dirty tricks, not by the Kremlin but by MI. Many SNP supporters on Twitter believe the Alex Salmond sex case was orchestrated by the UK secret service.If, as the ISC committee recommended yesterday, MI spooks should now be actively investigating and judging social media posts during election campaigns, then yet more mistrust and paranoia will assuredly be the result. Why so sure  Because they are already doing this.It was revealed in  that the Institute for Statecraft, and its protege the Integrity Initiative, funded by the UK Foreign Office, was already battling Vladimir Putinrsquos social media meddling from the improbable location of a disused mill in Fe. The Integrity Initiative is all about countering ldquodisinformation and malign influence from Russia, which increasingly originates online.However, these hapless hacktivists strayed disastrously into domestic politics. The Integrity Initiative had to apologise to the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, for retweeting messages suggesting that he was one of Mr Putinrsquos ldquouseful idiots. Itrsquos not clear which of the institutersquos , tweets were alleging this, but we can guess.Ms Cadwalladr had claimed in  that senior members of the Labour Party including Jeremy Corbynrsquos communications director, Seumas Milne, were Russian patsies. ldquoMilnersquos support of Russia is like Faragersquos, she tweeted in December . ldquoTherersquos nothing hidden. Itrsquos completely overt.This is the problem with trying to fight a propaganda war on social media. Even more than conventional spying it is a hall of mirrors. Paranoia feeds paranoia. In calling for the intelligence services to start investigating election campaigns, the ISC committee is asking for something the spooks dearly want to avoid.Take Labourrsquos ldquoNHS for sale dossier, which became a major story in the  General Election campaign. This first appeared on the Reddit website. That websitersquos own security analysts claimed that, while the documents on Britainrsquos trade negotiations with the US were genuine, they were put into the public domain by Russian sources.Do we seriously want MI judging the veracity and origins of every election issue  Arguably, yesterdayrsquos ISC report was itself an exercise in political propaganda serving to taint the  referendum with Russian involvement.

These are the men who wield great power through the Sun, Mail, and the , and their propaganda skills are far superior to a few Russians in a back office.In the Scottish independence referendum, almost all the press was extremely hostile and in no way reflected the distribution of opinion among the public. But this was to some extent counter-balanced by the great peoples movement that grew, often on entirely personal initiatives, on the Yes side. They had only social media and personal contact and in their many thousands used it brilliantly. Any foreign interference on social media,it happened, was entirely superfluous. We did, of course, have some foreign interference ndash by President Obama, by Spanish politicians and some senior EU officials.No-one should ever take what any states security services produce at face value.

Irsquom sure Ian Murray and Murdo Fraser will welcome any such inquiry into this iniquity.GR Weir, Ochiltree.I FOUND that Iain Macwhirterrsquos article UKon the report on Russian interference in the sometimes clouded the main point.He jokingly suggests, in the context of the report, that since he was pro-independence for Scotland in  he might have expected some financial recognition from the Kremlin for his written articles. This acknowledges what most reasonably minded people take from the evidence emerging regarding the revelations about alleged Russian interference.I find it obvious that it is in the political interest of Russia to break apart the UK and hence weaken its strategic integral role in the world. The same argument applies to Brexit, as a Europe without the UK suits Russia. If Russia did in fact make any effective dference in the  result it must therefore have been to swell the Yes vote.What I expect has come out of this foul affair is thatthe old adage ldquoyou should not believe everything you read in the newspapers\" holds true, then it is very many times more true when the message is applied to the internet. The UK has a very long history of distrust and conflict with Russia and our alliance during the Second World War was perhaps something to be seen as an unusual blip in history.However, I find it telling that our UK Government, as some reports admit, \"took its eye off the ball in watching out for both dirty tricks from a foreign power and, I suggest, also did the same for the threat of a killer pandemic.Perhaps it is time the Westminster Government took stock of its elected role and remembered punctually in future when to lt the drawbridge.Bill Brown, Milngavie.IT seems that the Russians have been trying to influence voters in the UK by posting fake messages on social media. I do remember some ridiculous nonsense being circulated in the run-up to the  Scottish referendum. It was said that each voter in Scotland would be worth pound,they voted Yes. The figure had been arrived at by taking the estimated value of oil deposits in the North Sea and iding by the number of voters ndash aseach voter could extract the oil themselves. It was such drivel it must have come from a Russian agent.I hope that any inquiry into the distribution of misinformation at that time will uncover the source and also calculate how many people may have been duped into voting Yes by that phoney get-rich-quick fraud.Les Reid, Edinburgh EH.WITH the much-delayed and redacted report into Russian interference in two referendums finally published, I am reminded of our National Bard, who might have said \"We are bought and sold for Russian gold, such a parcel of rogues in a nation\"Alec Oattes, Ayr.Read more: Sturgeon urged to condemn Salmond for being in the pay of the Kremlin"},{"url":null,"title":"blaze-tears-farmhouse-castlemilk","story":"Large clouds of smoke can be seen in the sky as the blaze tears throughthe property on Revd MacAuley Road, next to Carmunnock Road.Emergencycrews rushed to the scene at around .pm and remain there as theywrestle the fire, which started in a derelict building.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Fire on farm in Castlemilk\",\"description\": \"Fire on farm in Castlemilk\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media qgzZFzzK poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests qgzZFzzK.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": A Scottish Fire and Rescure Service spokeswoman said: \"We received a call at around .pm today for a firein a derelict building.\"We mobilised four applicances to the scene and they remain there.\"There are no reports of any casualties.\"More to follow..."},{"url":null,"title":"queen-can-cant-lockdown-balmoral","story":"A Buckingham Palace spokesman said arrangements for the visit in early August ldquowill be in line with the relevant guidelines and advice.Heres what the Queen can and cant do in lockdown in Scotland.Visitors from two other households will be able to meet her at a time at Balmoral, under current Scottish Government rules, with a recommendation for a maximum of eight people at a time when inside.

Having such complete and well annotated genomes allowed us unprecedented insight into the genetic and evolutionary abilities seen in bats.Professor Emma Teeling of University College Dublin, co-founding director of BatK, added: ldquoGiven these exquisite bat genomes, we can now better understand how bats tolerate viruses, slow down ageing, and have evolved flight and echolocation.ldquoThese genomes are the tools needed to identy the genetic solutions evolved in bats that ultimately could be harnessed to alleviate human ageing and disease.To generate the bat genomes, the team used new technologies to sequence the batsrsquo DNA and developed new methods to assemble these pieces into the correct order and to identy the genes present.The team compared these bat genomes against  other mammals to locate bats within the mammalian tree of le. They found the strongest support for bats being most closely related to the group Ferreuungulata that consists of carnivores , pangolins, whales and ungulates .The team then systematically searched for gene dferences between bats and other mammals, identying regions of the genome that have evolved dferently in bats and the loss and gain of genes that may drive batsrsquo unique traits.Genome scans revealed changes in hearing genes that may contribute to echolocation, which bats use to hunt and navigate in complete darkness.The team also found evidence that batsrsquo ability to tolerate viruses is reflected in their genomes.The findings mark only the beginning of the teamrsquos work. The remaining -plus living bat species exhibit an incredible ersity in ecology, longevity, sensory perception and immunology, and numerous questions still remain regarding the genomic basis of these spectacular features.BatK aims to answer these questions as more and more bat genomes are sequenced, further uncovering the genetic basis of the animalsrsquo ldquosuperpowers.Senior author Professor Eugene Myers, Director of Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics, and the Center for Systems Biology, Dresden, Germany, said: ldquoThese bat genomes provide a superb foundation for experimentation and evolutionary studies of batsrsquo fascinating abilities and physiological properties.In April, it was announced Dr Vernes is to lead a pound.m study at the University of St Andrews on the way bats communicate with each other.It is hoped that by examining their vocalisations and comparing them with other mammals such as seals and dolphins, the study will shed new light on the evolution of human language."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : pmOrkney, Shetland and the Western Isles are to benefit from a £ million UK Government funding package, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced, tonight, Wednesday, ahead of a visit to Scotland.

Mr W. C. Howard, manager of Argo’s, suggested it at the first meeting of the Stromness and West Mainland Chamber of Commerce, in late June .The best time for it was the third week in July, to coincide with the Kirkwall monthly holiday and the Stromness Regatta, so it was opened by Provost George Robertson on July .Other than during the war, Stromness has always had to work hard to attract business. Provost Robertson said in his opening speech that the aim was “to keep Stromness very definitely on the shopping map” and he told an old Stromness story: “Said a business man to his neighbour, ‘How’s business the day, William ’ ‘Oh,’ replied he, ‘canna compleen, canna compleen – selt a Christian Herald, changed a penny and shawn a man whar the auld kirk is.#”The week was a resounding success. All the shops decorated their windows and offered prizes and discounts. About  flags filled the street, as everyone hung out what they could find. Merriman’s electrical shop, then half-way up Porteous Brae, hooked up loudspeakers to provide music for the passers-by.Even at such short notice, Stromness managed to get the “showies” to ert to the town. There was an amusement arcade in the Transit Shed, at the top of the North Pier, and the side-shows at the Market Green even included chairoplanes.The mystery bus tour was on Tuesday. Provost Robertson had suggested that the tour might take its passengers to “parts of the mainland you have never seen since you were last carted there to a Sunday School picnic ,  or  years ago”. He urged his audience to book but, of course, this didn’t happen and only one bus was laid on. Another five had to be hurriedly brought from Wishart’s Garage.On Wednesday there were sporting competitions at Ness, which culminated in a five-a-side hockey tournament. The men’s final, won by Dounby, was described in the Orkney Herald as being played “with a speed reminiscent of ice-hockey and an enthusiasm to win that might have been more appropriate on the battlefield”.The week also held the Stromness Regatta, a Swimming Gala, a Football Tournament, the County Sheepdog Trials and a Bring and Buy Sale in the North Kirk that raised £.The week ended, as it always has, with a fancy-dress parade. The -yard long procession was led by the Kirkwall City Pipe Band and followed by hundreds of excited spectators.  spectators lined the Market Green for the judging and presentation of prizes.In , the main attraction was the Wick Girls Pipe Band but there was plenty of home- grown entertainment. Nannie Gowans organised a concert by the youth of the town in the Town Hall. When her brother Johnnie was appointed Shopping Week organiser a few years later she ably assisted him. They are still remembered in Stromness for developing a bigger programme of events and bringing in big attractions, such as tightrope walkers, motorcycle display teams and the Globe of Death.There had not been enough time to organise the suggested art exhibition for the first Shopping Week but it was there in , organised by Stanley Cursiter, in the building now occupied by the Ell  Co Café.The Swimming Gala in the harbour included a water-polo match, “…in which it was dficult to know who was playing who” and a display of water-skiing but the big event was the March of Time cavalcade organised by the Young Farmers at the Market Green, showing how farming had developed over the centuries.“First of all came cultivation, beginning with the man with the spade and pick… We saw the genuine old wooden plough of our great-grandfathers…. The lovely and lovable Clydesdales drawing the long-boarded plough and the  tractor carrying its two-furrow at the tail and jogging along with a jaunty air.Sowing, harvesting, threshing and the farmhouse kitchen went through similar progressions, all with a commentary by JGS Flett from Harray. The final scene was the farmer in his feather bed “where he rests amid all possible blessings of State and personal luxury and indulgence.”The week ended with the parade, open air dancing and the first Shopping Week fireworks: a -minute display from the Inner Holm.Patricia Long is a tourist guide based in Stenness with a particular interest in social history.

The public are being encouraged to protect public health and our precious environment.The new Scottish Outdoor Access Code advice includes reminders to:Francesca Osowska, chief executive of Scottish Natural Heritage, said: “We very much want this love affair with Scotland’s great outdoors and nature to continue. But let’s not spoil it for others. We need be kind to nature and respectful to each other by clearing up after ourselves and taking all of our litter home with us. The scenes of abandoned campsites, burned out trees, human waste, as well as litter, are totally unacceptable and a blight on Scotland’s reputation.”Around half of the people surveyed said that they expect to take more visits to the outdoors after lockdown than before the crisis. It is also expected that many will replace cancelled trips abroad with holidays in Scotland this year, so you may arrive somewhere to find it busier than expected. The advice from Scottish Government is to have a back-up plan, andthis happens to you, move on and find somewhere quieter and safer.All of the latest COVID- guidance can be found on the Scottish Outdoor Access Code website. The website includes information about our rights and responsibilities when outdoors, as well as specic guides for a range of activities, from air and water sports, to hillwalking and wild camping.Francesca added: “If we all follow Scottish Government advice and the Scottish Outdoor Access code, we will be doing our bit to ensure that Scotland’s outdoors remains beautul and that COVID- restrictions can continue to be relaxed.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We want to help them keep it up.“These survey results and the enthusiastic response to the Make Space for Nature campaign gives us confidence that Scotland is well placed to reverse the decline in ersity of animal and plant species in Scotland.

their nose and mouth covered or face a fine of up to pound.People with certain disabilities will be exempt.This comes after rules requiring people to wear face coverings on public transport became mandatory last month.Initially many experts and authorities, including the World Health Organisation , suggested face coverings were not effective in preventing the spread of Covid- but are now recommending wearing them in indoor spaces.ndash Has there been confusion over the new rules Yes, opposition MPs have said it needs to be claried whether customers have to wear face coverings in takeaways and sandwich shops in England.The criticism came after days of mixed messages with the Health Secretary and Boris Johnsonrsquos official spokesman contradicting each other on the matter.The Dailyreported early on Thursday that people using sandwich shops and takeaways will be required to wear a mask, and buying food from the counter and then sitting down to eat inside the shop will be banned.But the Government refused to confirm the report ahead of the formal announcement.ndash What does the science say about face coverings A report recently published by the Royal Society suggests that even basic homemade face coverings can reduce transmissionenough people wear them when in public.The study, based on mathematical modelling, showed thatan entire population wore face coverings that were only % effective, it would bring the R value, which is the number of people an infected inidual passes the virus on to, from . to under ., without the need for lockdowns.Another Royal Society report suggests the use of cotton masks is associated with a % lower odds of infection in comparison to the no mask groups, when tested in a healthcare setting.Melinda Mills, Nuffield professor of sociology, at the University of Oxford, told a webinar: ldquoSo that should suggest that when yoursquore generally in the public that it should offer you some, not %, but it does offer you some protection.Meanwhile, another study which looked at coronavirus deaths across  countries found that nations which had policies favouring mask-wearing had lower death rates.In another piece of scientic research, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences last month, scientists calculated that wearing face coverings prevented more than , infections in Italy between April  and May , and more than , infections in New York City between April  and May . vw,vw,px, px\"People face a finethey do not wear face coverings in shops ndash What are the benefits to wearing them Experts say the risk of coronavirus transmission appears to be higher in poorly ventilated indoor spaces and wearing face coverings in small shops or enclosed shopping centres could help reduce the spread.Keith Neal, emeritus professor of the epidemiology of infectious diseases at the University of Nottingham, said: ldquoLack of strong evidence of their effectiveness should not be considered a problem but the evidence is accumulating that they have a part to play in reducing transmission and also in protecting the wearer.In addition, there is also increased evidence which suggests that many people with the virus who do not have symptoms can still be contagious.ndash What do people need to know about wearing masks Ideally the face coverings should be made of multilayer high quality cotton.Where possible they should be should be worn in indoor confined spaces and crowded spaces, especially where social distancing cannot be maintained.Japan follows the three Cs, closed spaces, crowded places, and close-contact settings.When wearing a face covering, it should cover the mouth and nose with no gaps. vw,vw,px, px\"Coverings have been mandatory on public transport since June ndash Are some face coverings better than others The Who advises a three-layer face covering in the community ndash the outer layer should be water resistant, the inner should be water absorbent and the mid-layer acts as a filter.It emphasises that a face covering alone cannot protect people from Covid-, and must be combined with social distancing of at least a metre and regular hand washing.The Government has said coverings can be made from scarves, bandanas or other fabric items, as long as they cover the mouth and nose.But scientists at the Leverhulme Centre, who studied dferent types of face coverings used by members of the public, say some coverings are not as effective as others, with loosely woven fabrics, such as scarves, shown to be the least effective.Prof Mills, director of the Leverhulme Centre, said: ldquoAttention must also be placed on how well it fits on the face it should loop around the ears or around the back of the neck for better coverage.What are the main messages about face coverings Prof Mills says cloth coverings are an effective way to protect the wearer and those around them.She says that face masks and coverings cannot be seen in isolation and are part of a package that involves hand hygiene and social distancing.Consistent and effective public messaging is vital, she concluded.copy -.

This is Litir ,. .Bha mi ag innse dhuibh mu Raibeart Armstrong à Siorrachd Pheairt a chuir faclair Gàidhlig ri chèile ann an ochd ceud deug, fichead ʼs a còig . Bha athair, air an robh Raibeart mar ainm cuideachd, na mhaighstir-sgoile anns a’ Cheannmhor aig ceann an ear Loch Tatha. An dèidh dha sgoil athar fhàgail, chaidh Raibeart don oilthigh, an toiseach ann an Dùn Èideann, agus an uair sin ann an Cill Rìmhinn. Thàinig e a-mach mar sgoilear air leth de Sheann Ghreugais agus Laidinn.Bha Armstrong a-nise deiseil airson a bhith na mhinistear, agus chaidh e cho fada ʼs gun do dh’fhoillsich e dà shearmon. Ge-tà, an àite a bhith a’ cur a-staigh airson a bhith na mhinistear paraiste, dh’fhalbh e a Lunnainn. Bha e airson sgoil a chur air dòigh, anns am biodh e ag oideachadh mic dhaoin-uaisle.Fhad ʼs a bha Raibeart ann an Lunnainn, chuala e gun robh Comunn Gàidhealach na h-Alba – The Highland Society of Scotland – am beachd faclair Gàidhlig a chur ri chèile. Bha iad air triùir sgoilearan fhastadh airson na h-obrach. Uill, bha ar laoch, Raibeart, dhen bheachd gun dèanadh esan faclair a cheart cho math, agus a cheart cho luath, riutha.Bha e trang leis an obair làitheil aige, agus cha robh cus ùine aige airson faclair a chur ri chèile. Ach, a dh’aindeoin sin, rinn e adhartas math. Ge-tà, nuair a bha e air a dhol cho fada ris an litir ‘M’, chaidh togalach an fhoillsicheir a losgadh gu làr. B’ fheudar do Raibeart an obair aige a thòiseachadh às ùr.Bha e gu math dìcheallach, agus chaidh am faclair aige fhoillseachadh ann an ochd ceud deug, fichead ʼs a còig . Agus ciamar a bha dol don triùir sgoilearan aig Comunn Gàidhealach na h-Alba  Obh obh … bha trì bliadhna eile gu bhith ann mus nochdadh am faclair acasan!Bha fèill air faclair Armstrong, a rèir choltais. Bha e gu math mòr. Bha còrr is mìle duilleag ann. Bha caibideil ann mu ghràmar na Gàidhlig. Agus b’ e a’ chiad fhaclair Gàidhlig a thug sùil air bunachas fhaclan.Sgrìobh an Literary Gazette gum bu chòir don a h-uile cànanaiche anns an Roinn Eòrpa lethbhreac fhaighinn, oir bha Armstrong air a shùil a thoirt air seachdad cànan, agus mar sin gun robh an obair aige airidh air moladh mòr.

It is a privilege to succeed a figure like Ian McCormack, who has made such a sterling contribution to journalism and to the communities served by the WHFP.“I would like to thank him and colleagues past and present for their support and encouragement over the years. I am grateful to the WHFP team for investing their faith in me to take on the editor’s role.“There is no doubt that this is a challenging time for newspapers, but an accurate and informed local media, committed to holding power to account, is still a very valuable thing.“It has been heartening to receive so many good wishes of support from the community and beyond during our absence from the shops.”WHFP Managing Director Paul Wood said: “We are delighted to appoint Keith as editor of the West Highland Free Press. Keith is an award-winning journalist, highly regarded among his peers and colleagues.“His in-depth knowledge of both his patch and what the Free Press means to Highland and Island le means the paper is in safe hands.”The WHFP’s new editor has collected several awards for news, feature and sports writing since he joined the publication as a journalist in .Keith is the current Highlands and Islands reporter and journalist of the year.A former pupil of Kyleakin Primary and Portree High School, Keith is a graduate of Glasgow University who has also worked for Royal Mail, Marine Harvest and for the Highlands and Islands Tourist Board.Originally from Kyleakin he now lives in Sleat with his partner Mary and their two children.Since the move online in April the WHFP’s website, www.whfp, has received close to , views.The team now hope to transfer some of that interest into paper sales, e-mail and print subscriptions and to generate the advertising needed to sustain the employee-owned business, which also publishes The Visitor, the popular tourism guide for the West Highlands and Skye. August the Free Press has launched an online survey in a bid to ask current, past and potential new readers for their thoughts on the newspaper."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3210341.jpg--.jpg?1593777277000\n","title":"buick pupils efforts earn school an eco flag honour","story":"Buick Memorial Primary School in Cullybackey has been awarded a prestigious Eco-Schools Green Flag by the environmental charity Keep Northern Ireland Beautul. The Eco-Schools Programme is the world’s largest Environmental Education programme and aims to make environmental awareness and action an intrinsic part of the le and ethos of a school. Its participatory approach and combination of learning and action makes it an ideal way for schools to begin improving the environments of schools and their local communities. Eco-Schools work through a simple seven-step process resulting in the programme becoming central to the schools ethos. Schools can choose from ten eco-topics ranging from litter and waste to energy, bioersity and transport to name a few. Eco-Schools work towards achieving awards - bronze, silver and the prestigious Green Flag.The internationally recognised Green Flag is this highest award given to Eco-Schools and symbolises excellence in the field of environmental activity. Over the past two years, pupils of Buick Memorial have been working hard on many initiatives in order to address their chosen topics of Waste, Litter and Bioersity. Together with Eco Coordinators Mrs Carleton and Miss Stirling, they have produced policies on printing, recycling and litter for staff and pupils within the school to follow. Their continued commitment to regular Cash for Clobber collections enabled the school to purchase a number of new bins for the playground. Thanks to Catherine Hunter, Mid and East Antrim Education Officer, the children were able to give each class a bin for food waste, allowing the Eco Club to produce compost for their many planting activities. A highlight of the Eco-School endeavours is the annual litter-pick with Cullybackey Community Partnership and thanks must be given in particular to Margaret Murphy who is always keen to help the children in any way she can. The school is extremely grateful to Cranswick Country Foods for providing a superb wooden structure for the ‘plastic bottle greenhouse’ project and to Barry Tapster, Mid and East Antrim Recycling Officer, for his guidance. This year has been exceptionally busy, with the introduction of a termly ‘Walking Week’ which the pupils and parents have strongly supported. The Eco Club have spent a lot of time tending to the school pond area building mini-beast and frog hotels, making bird feeders and planting flowers for pollinators amongst many other tasks. None of these opportunities would have run as smoothly were it not for the unwavering input from Mr Fleckand the dedication of Ms Harkin . The positive attitude and increased awareness of environmental issues is evident within the school from Nursery through to P and this Green Flag is a welcome acknowledgement of the children’s efforts.The International Eco-Schools Programme is operated in Northern Ireland by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul and is a free to enter programme.

This year, though, there was a real threat of #The Port# being the town that was all dressed up with nowhere to go.There had been no fanfare Easter weekend opening of family favourite Barry#s Amusements. The caravan parks were shut, hotels closed and apartments unavailable to visitors.Today there are still no screams of fright and delight, as the doors remain firmly shut on the famous old building that has attracted fun lovers through the decades. There#s no ride on the old ghost train. Copper coins will find a dferent home instead of the slots in the arcade.But where in the town the sparkle is starting to .The mums are back, tissues in hand to mop up dribbles of ice-cream from small faces. All the seats along the seafront are taken for a welcome breath of fresh north coast air. If anything, the town is busier than during last July#s Open. No golf to distract, no Barry#s to chuck p coins into those slots in the hope of winning a clatter of copper. Instead, visitors are nose to tail along the main street, and it#s come just in the nick of time for the shops and cafes.Andy Hill has been running Troggs Surf Shop since  and said Monday was one of the best he can remember.It#s incredibly busy. It#s all domestic custom, we#ve hardly seen a foreign tourist, he said.The beaches are very busy indeed. A lot of people were probably going stir crazy at home and just needed to see the ocean and get some salt water therapy.We#re selling an awful lot of body boards, surfboards and wetsuits. The beach is a natural asset that we have and it#s great to see people using it. Of course it#s a huge disappointment that Barry#s isn#t open, but people seem to be making the best of it, and thankfully the weather is helping.Monday was probably one of the busiest days I#ve ever had here. If everyone did holiday at home every year it would be a marvellous boost to the whole economy. Some will be quite surprised when they come here. A lot of visitors have been telling us what a brilliant time they#re having on the north coast.Along the street, Alice Rohdich presides over the family jewellers and souvenir shop, which has been in business since  and has never known a time like it.We#re missing the tourists from further afield, but we#re certainly making up for it with homegrown visitors, she said. The town has had to evolve this year. We can#t change what#s happening.We did invest in more Irish souvenirs this year as we#d expected more people from overseas on the back of the golf last year, but that hasn#t happened. But thankfully we#re getting our share of what#s going and we#re feeling much more positive. We would previously have had early morning and late evening trade, but now, with plenty of day trippers, the middle of the day is when most arrive. You can#t really visit Portrush without grabbing a stick of rock and Ann Lamont has been selling sweets and confectionery at Wilma#s just across from Barry#s.It has really picked up this last week, she said. We do sell some Irish souvenirs, but that#s not what people from Northern Ireland are after and that#s who we#ve had in the town.But they#re still able to get their sweets, buckets and spades.The weather has been good and usually, especially at nighttime, Barrys would be a big draw for us. Most of my family have worked in there at some stage.A few miles# drive along the Atlantic coast, Portstewart has always been known as a quieter seaside town than its neighbour, but it has reawakened with vigour over the past two weeks.There#s the usual crawl of traffic along the ocean front. Across the bay the sun glints once again off the cars lining the famous Strand. Orderly queues form outside the many ice-cream parlours. There are smiles again on faces as they take good of the fresh sea air. And customers are like a breath of fresh air, too, for the myriad of seafront shops.It#s great to have the doors open again and see people out and about again, said Siobhan Farthing at home and lestyle shop A Broader Picture.We#re obviously having to keep numbers down in the shop, but it#s such a relief to get the doors open again. There#s a real psychological boost to being by the sea and so many people have told us they#re delighted to be back.Missing out on their day by the seaside, though, were face coverings. Few and far between along the proms, it seems a decent face mask might be considered a hindrance to getting the full benefit of the sea air.

It might change people#s views about whether they might want to go to a particular geographical spot. It might be helpful for people who live in that area to be especially careful, he told the Belfast .I think everything should be transparent. But I don#t think they should release any personal details of the iniduals involved.The Belfast-born medic#s comments come after an outbreak of coronavirus cases was reported in Ballymena on Wednesday.Since May , there have  clusters across Northern Ireland, with a total of  cases linked to these small outbreaks, according to the Public Health Agency .Earlier this month a cluster of cases were also detected in Limavady and traced to a house party - where party-goers had used the same microphone - which led to a number of GAA clubs suspending activity.Crossgar in Co Down has also reported local spikes in cases recently.In a separate development, food producer Moy Park also confirmed that a very small number of its employees at its Ballymena site had tested positive.In a statement the company said it was engaging with the PHA and other government agencies by following advice and protocols.The iniduals affected have been self-isolating on full pay in line with our Covid sick pay scheme and we are in contact with them to ensure they have the support they require, it said.Meanwhile, a further nine people have tested positive for Covid- in Northern Ireland, the Department of Health said.There were no new deaths reported on Wednesday, leaving the death toll at .Dr Scally said the identication of geographical clusters would give the public greater confidence. I don#t think it does any harm, and I believe in transparency and there hasn#t been enough transparency with the Northern Ireland data as it is, he continued.The PHA has stated it will not release specic details about every incident that emerges, adding it could undermine people#s right to anonymity.However, Alliance MLA and Stormont Health Committee member Paula Bradshaw last night called on the body to disclose at least the location of larger-scale clusters.That#s what I#m asking the PHA to do, but obviously not whenever it#s a small size, say five cases or under, she said.It#s about allowing the people and the businesses in that locality to respond accordingly.She continued: The second part of that is that I#m asking the PHA what is it that they#re learning from the more and more clusters that are taking place.Are these in the food manufacturing setting, are these in care homes, leisure etc What setting it is, so the guidance, from the Department for Economy say, can be amended accordingly, for those relevant sections of business or otherwise.Ms Bradshaw added: Obviously the PHA is gathering more and more information and statistics and should be shared across the other parts of government so they can learn how the virus is moving through society.In response, the PHA said clusters of cases are to be expected as the pandemic continues.This is why the Test, Trace and Protect programme is in place to help ensure that people are tested when symptoms emerge, and their contacts traced quicklythey receive a positive result, to help prevent further spread, said a spokesperson.The PHA will not comment on inidual cases or go into the detail of every incident that emerges, as this could lead to people being identied, create stigma and focus attention on iniduals, families or groups, and therefore deter others with symptoms coming forward to be tested.The health organisation stressed that to date the majority of clusters have been managed effectively via the contact tracing programme. And where we need to advise or inform the public of any increased risk to public health we will do so in a timely manner, added the spokesperson.The Department of Health has supported the PHA#s position on the issue, adding identying clusters could be counterproductive in managing Covid-.PHA do not comment on inidual cases as this could lead to people being identied and deter others with symptoms coming forward to be tested. We would ask everyone to be mindful of this risk, said a spokesperson.The Department of Health emphasised that the public should not become complacent about the virus. We must be aware that Covid- is still a threat and we need everyone to play their part in helping to stop the virus spreading, they added.

The Irish News has reported that  clusters linked to  positive cases of the virus have been identied through contact tracing since May . Six of these clusters had more than five positive cases of Covid- associated with them. Alliance health spokesperson Paula Bradshaw said the nature of those clusters must be revealed. Earlier this month a cluster of Covid- cases was identied in Limavady, believed to be linked to a house party were a karaoke microphone was passed around.The PHA has confirmed that another cluster has been identied in Ballymena and they are monitoring developments. A spokesperson said the PHA is aware of a number of cases in the Ballymena area that may be associated with a cluster.A cluster is defined as two or more cases among Covid- deriving from the same place with the onset of the illness within  days.

The South Belfast MLA, who earlier this week cancelled a family holiday to Italy after confusion around travel guidance, said it was important to identy what was being learned from contact tracing. “Now it turns out that the recently publicised case near Limavady is one of sixteen since  May. The issue is we have not been informed about the nature of these clusters and, particularly, how they originated, Ms Bradshaw said. “A public health emergency needs public support and therefore good public information. That means the public must be fully informed about the types of behaviour which have proven particularly dangerous in terms of leading to super-spreading events.The Alliance MLA urged Health Minister Robin Swann to ensure the Public Health Agency publishes information about the nature of each cluster and what we can learn from it.A PHA spokesperson said clusters of cases were to be expected during the pandemic. The Public Health Agencywill not comment on inidual cases or go into the detail of every incident that emerges, as this could lead to people being identied, create stigma and focus attention on iniduals, families or groups, and therefore deter others with symptoms coming forward to be tested, the spokesperson said.To date the majority of clusters that have occurred have been managed effectively through the contact tracing programme, and where we need to advise or inform the public of any increased risk to public health we will do so in a timely manner.A Department of Health spokesperson said the contact, trace and protect approach had proved highly effective in preventing the further spread of Covid-.We must be aware that Covid- is still a threat and we need everyone to play their part in helping to stop the virus spreading, the spokesperson said.

The Belfasthas asked the PSNI several timesit will comment on whether it will enforce the wearing of face coveringsthey do become compulsory. However, it did not respond.Pete Boyle, the managing director of jewellery chain Argento - which has around  stores in Northern Ireland - said he would approve of the step. I am in favour. Anything that makes us a safer place to live and work has to be welcomed, he said.We want to be able to trade but not at the cost of going backwards.However, another traditional jeweller - who did not wish to be named - said they were concerned about the use of face coverings being exploited by shoplters, who would then be harder to identy.Peter Law, the owner of HF Law jewellers shop in Newcastle, Co Down, said he was undecided. I would say at the minute that around one in  people coming into the shop are wearing face coverings. They would tend to be older people or those with underlying health conditions. He said he was concerned about the policing of a rule, adding: At the moment, the way trade is, I can#t see any shop owner refusing to let someone in the door because they#re not wearing a face covering. Eugene Diamond, a newsagent in Ballymena, Co Antrim, said: I#m happy with face coveringsit makes for a safer environment for my customers and staff. I do encounter more people every day wearing them, especially older people.But on Wednesday, he tweeted about a familiar customer who was virtually unrecognisable while wearing both a mask and a hat. Tweeting a picture of the customer, Mr Diamond said: If I hadn#t already known this mask-wearing customer at am this morning, I would have been a little more startled. Mask-wearing will present new dangers for retailers so don#t be surprisedyour asked to remove your hat or hood... A new world for us all.In a joint statement on Tuesday, retail leaders Glyn Roberts, chief executive of Retail NI, and Simon Hamilton, head of Belfast Chamber, said that the mandatory wearing of masks could adversely affect trade and generate serious issues around enforcement.Speaking on Wednesday, Mr Roberts said the pair were not challenging the science which recommends the wearing of face coverings but said the issue required a sensitive approach. We#re not under any illusion about challenges ahead, not least with the prospect of a second wave.But we#re asking that the Executive approaches it slightly dferently and decide upon the unresolved issues around enforcement. Nobody has yet come up with a suggestion about how it#s policed.He said he wished to take a stand on the matter because of the importance of protecting workers as well as representing the interests of business owners.And he said the dilemma over face coverings was only an element of the challenges facing retail. I have talked to a number of firms across dferent sectors and obviously there are a iety of views but one thing is clear, whatever Executive decides, they need a comprehensive plan for high street rejuvenation, including getting workers back into offices.Whether masks are voluntary or mandatory, we#re at a very fragile stage of recovery and we do need to see a rejuvenation plan.On Wednesday, Lotus Property, which owns shopping destinations The Junction in Co Antrim and the Bouled in Co Down, said footfall had been strong since reopening in June. Chris Flynn, centre director at The Junction, added: Since reopening, our priority has been the safety of our colleagues and our customers...We are currently giving customers the option to purchase facemasks for all the family, should they feel more comfortable wearing these while shopping. We will be led by the NI Executive, however, as to whether the introduction of face coverings is to become mandatory and will adhere to any policy changes accordingly.Face coverings in shops become compulsory in England from tomorrow, and have been in Scotland since July . The Executive is due to meet today to discuss the further easing of Covid- restrictions but the wearing of face coverings and masks is not expected to be on the agenda for discussion. But a shop owner in Dumfries in Scotland has said he has found trade has fallen since they were introduced. Ian Edgar, of Edgars# Newsagents and Filled Rolls, said his turnover had fallen over the last  days. He said that anecdotally, other business were also feeling the effects. Other shops are also saying that they#re hearing from customers that they#d rather just shop online, and I#m also hearing that big shops have seen a big increase in Click and Collect as well as online shopping.

It was a late invitation so I hadn#t much time to buy a dress and I just couldn#t find anything. Eventually I saw this dress but it was quite expensive, over £. It fitted like a glove and I felt like a princess in it. As soon as I saw it, I knew it was meant to be and nothing  compared. My lovely parents splashed out and bought it for me, I was that desperate.At the formal my friend accidentally knocked over a candle and a flame flared up. Everyone jumped back and I caught my dress on something and ripped the netting.Later on I brought the dress to a dressmaker to have it repaired. She was to send away for some material to fix it but somehow time went by and I never picked it up. I lost touch with the dressmaker, so I suppose she eventually had a clear out and gave the dress to charity.She thought that was the end of it - until recently dropping into the Cancer Focus shop in Newtownstewart. There hanging up was my dress with a price tag of £ on it. Apparently it had just been donated, she explained.I recognised it straight away because the tear is still in it. I was totally amazed.Rachael was delighted to get the dress back to keep for its sentimental value. It#s still torn and damaged and it#s a size , so it doesn#t fit me anymore, but I love having it as a reminder of my granny, she added. She was very much one of a kind, she loved McDonald#s and drove a sporty Honda Civic! It#s her th anniversary this year.Belfast Most ReadLong lost formal dress of Northern Ireland woman found in charity shop m reasons to snub Michelle O#Neill: Northern Ireland can#t afford to lose visitors from GB, says tourism chiefNorthern Ireland couple secretly recorded woman during years of #unrelenting# harassment#Busier than The Open# after rush to resorts on north coastWhere were the  coronavirus clusters in Northern Ireland  PHA urged to reveal details,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Between  and , the victim was subjected to malicious reports, covert filming and a listening device, and her medical records were illegally accessed in a hospital.Alwyn Mageeand Marie Lindsayboth of Hillview Park, Enniskillen, admitted making  reports to police, the NSPCC and the victim#s workplace superiors.In addition, Magee abused his position as a member of staff at South West Acute Hospital to access confidential medical details of the victim and her family, and planted the listening device.Neither defendant appeared for sentencing, but the victim joined by video link from her solicitor#s office, with District Judge Eamon King remarking it was ironic she was present but her persecutors were not.Enniskillen Magistrates Court, sitting in Dungannon, heard the victim and Magee had a child together but separated in . He he had custody two weekends a month, and several afternoons a week.Harassment commenced the following year, with the victim hounded by both Magee and his partner, Lindsay.During this, he made  covert recordings, two of which involved him questioning the child on the victim#s movements.In , the victim discovered a listening device in the child#s schoolbag, which forensic examination established was activated by dialling a number to listen in. Calls were traced to Lindsay#s phone on  occasions, lasting a total of five hours  minutes.During interview Magee denied any knowledge of this until presented with telephone records. He and Lindsay maintained they were concerned for the child#s safety but it emerged he had custody on some of the dates the device activated.However, harassment was well under way long before this. Lindsay had anonymously contacted the NSPCC alleging the victim was physically and emotionally abusing the child, which was fully investigated and dismissed. An allegation of a fraud was also untrue, as were numerous reports to police.Lindsay fabricated complaints to the victim#s workplace manager, and during one stated she would let the community know.For several months in , Magee and Lindsay drove past the victim#s home at the same time every Sunday.A tablet owned by the defendants was found to contain recordings of the victim in her workplace.The offences specic to Magee, involved him accessing the personal medical records of the victim and her family, while he worked as a hospital laboratory assistant. The Western Trust launched an investigation and disciplinary proceedings, but Magee resigned before these were completed.The prosecutor referred the court to a heartfelt victim impact statement. She has had a particularly dficult time as a result of the defendants# actions.A defence solicitor stated his clients have expressed a desire to apologise for their behaviour.Judge King said: In all my years as a judge I have yet to hear such a catalogue of harassment by two iniduals against another person… it beggars belief. Prison is the only sentence and it#s on the cusp of immediate custody.Both were sentenced to five months imprisonment suspended for three years, and placed under Restraining Order for the same duration.

The test centre was set up at the Judges Road home of City of Derry Rugby Club in April. However, with the rugby club planning toto sporting action soon, a new base has to be found for the testing centre. The Department of Health which operates the local test centre and several others in Northern Ireland confirmed that the local testing centre will no longer be available for testing from the end of July. A Department of Health spokesperson said: “The testing site at City of Derry Rugby Club will no longer be available for testing from the end of July. googletag.cmd.push “Work is underway on behalf of the National Testing Programme to identy an alternative site and an announcement will be made in due course. Initially testing was restricted to health and social care workers, it then accepted key workers and their families who had symptoms and more recently any member of the public with symptoms. These tests can be booked via the Public Health Agency website. Many medical and disease control experts have said that testing and contact tracing is key to tackling the spread of COVID-. The Department has developed a COVID- ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ Strategy which sets out the public health approach to minimising COVID- transmission in the community in Northern Ireland. The key elements of the strategy are testing all people with symptoms of COVID-, contact tracing, providing information and advice on self-isolation, and support to enable people to self-isolate. googletag.cmd.push It says for ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ to work, each citizen in Northern Ireland has a very important role to play. “We must all prepare for the possibility of having to self-isolate and prepare to be tested in order to protect ourselves, our families and our communities. “Symptomatic members of the public are therefore encouraged to get tested early - this will be crucial in controlling the spread of the virus,” a spokesperson added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Coronavirus pandemic has been tough on local businesses and news that Eason closed in Foyleside came as a blow to the city centre.

Daragh McCauley is the owner of ine Hostages Coffee Company which is based at the top of Waterloo Street.

A refined menu at ine Hostages consists of grilled cheese toasties with a choice of good quality local meats and homemade ingredients as well as the best quality bread and baked goods. It was ‘slow going’ at the beginning but the pandemic came as a blow as the business was beginning to gain some traction. With a one-way system in operation they were able to successfully reopen once permission was granted. Mr McCauley believes the quality of coffee sourced from Bailies Coffee Roasters is second to none The most important ingredient is the ‘passion’  Hostages has for all of their products, he added. Anyone using Bailies products in the North West of the country will now be trained at the new Bishop Street premises. BROslashN will offer coffee and food throughout the day and sit-down meals in the evening complemented by craft beers and cocktails. They intend to support local as much as possible through suppliers and employing staff from the North West. “I’ve been working in coffee now for about four and a half years, I’m going to stay managing this shop but will work in BROslashN as well,” Mr McCauley explained. “We’re going to try and create as many jobs as we possibly can.

The first threat came in the rise of out of town shopping centres. I can remember the campaigns fought against them in Derry by local city centre retailers who argued it would suck the le out of the city centre. This battle to stop planning being granted for out of town centres was largely lost and we only have to look at Crescent Link to see the impact its had on retail footfall in the city centre. Then we had the advent of online retail which began nibbling at retail sales about  years ago. googletag.cmd.push This nibble has now become a feast. Prior to Covid-, online retail was certainly taking a big chunk out of disposable income. For anyone under  purchasing online from eBay Amazon and using PayPal was as normal as going up the town. Buying clothes, electronics, games etc on your phone for younger people was the norm rather than the exception. With Covid-, however, online retail has reached into every age group. With shops closed and fear of infection particularly amongst older people the rush online has been music to the ears of companies like Amazon. For Derry city, the problem is amplied. googletag.cmd.push Derry suffers from having an already dficult retail situation. We have the highest level of welfare dependency in the North and still rank the highest in any UK deprivation statistics. We also have the highest level of unemployment in the  council areas. This in turn means less disposable income for the local population so retailers have to compete for a smaller amount of money available. Our city centre is beautul but it really needs huge investment made. Carlisle Roadhas a few vacant sites and a number of vacant shops and really could benefit from some redevelopment.  There is a plethora of charity and pound shops which provide valuable employment and services to the most vulnerable but they also tell a story about our city and its spending power.  And when you see a landmark building like the Austin’s Building boarded up and the old Poundstretchers site on Bishop Street still not developed, it really doesnt bode well. And lets not even talk about the view from the Peace Bridge into Foyle Street which shows buildings with weeds growing out the windows. I could go on, but the city centre has been on a slow decline for the last  years and the financial crisis of  has really accelerated it. If there is not urgent action taken now and led by Derry and Strabane District Council, we might not have a city centre in . So how do we reimagine our city centre   Well one thing for sure is the recent announcement by DCSDC that a shortfall in their budget might have to be met with a -year double digits rates increase is not the answer. Such a move, in my opinion, would completely kill business owners operating in the city centre. And remember having a vibrant city centre is what drives tourism. It also drives student numbers. Students and tourists will only come to Derry is it is vibrant and safe. If we allow it to die then we kill tourism. We have to be very careful of what we do in the next  years. So, what could a post Covid- Derry city centre look like  For starters, I think we definitely need more outside space offered to shops and retailers. The whole vibe seems to be al fresco which is driven mainly by the belief that its harder to catch the virus outside. It also helps solve the capacity issue for many pubs restaurants etc. Of course, in continental Europe it rains a lot less but in Holland it rains  days a year and they have a lot more outside space use than us. Ive been to Liverpoola few times and they have as much rain as us but definitely more outside space.  I just hope council dont charge rates for this space. If we want people back to work and businesses generating profits to afford rates, we shouldnt overload their rates bills. I would also seriously look at taking traffic out of the city centre and creating a huge pedestrian zone from the top of Bishop Street straight down to the River Foyle. I would also pedestrianize from the bottom of Carlisle Road right up and including the whole of the Walled City.I would allow a bike lane. Post Covid-, people will want physical distance and what better way to do it than take traffic out all together from the city centre. Data from Living Streets suggests where the pedestrian experience has been improved, footfall has increased between  and %. Bear in mind there has been a % decline in footfall on the high street across the UK between  and . In Leicester for example, shop vacancy rates were five times higher on streets with higher levels of traffic and turnover in pedestrianised areas generally outperforms non pedestrian areas . Bear in mind that a report done by Sustrans titled ‘Bike Le ’ found that % of residents living in  UK citieswere keen to see more space made available on their high streets for people socialising cycling and walking. This was before Covid- and I would guess the % in now higher. Council government really need to look at the whole business rates issue and attempt to rebalance it. Some work is already being done on this and I know the Minister for Finance Connor Murphy is looking to launch something soon. Derry, however, should look at a scheme to encourage new businesses to take up space which includes a rates free period. We need to encourage new businesses to locate into the city centre. Ebrington is another exciting addition to the solution. We can expand the city centre across into Ebrington where there is plenty of outside space. We should also utilise the Guildhall Square on a permanent basis and its a perfect link to Ebrington. We really need to imagine a new city centre with many uses. We need to also develop more markets across the city. Markets bring football and offer small producers a change to sell their products. Covid offers many opportunities as well as challenges. During lockdown we saw a huge increase in the number of people working from home and living locally. Its likely that there will be less commuting to larger towns and cities so people will be spending more time in their immediate local area. Its up to us now to design a new city centre which meets the needs of people. The new high street city centre cant only be about retail. To think this way would be to ignore the clear trends in consumer behaviour and online retail. Sustans, an organisation which has researched this widely, said in a recent report: Re-establishing the role of the high streets as a hub for social connection and reinforcing and celebrating its roots and unique character could go a long way to encourage people to stay local and spend their money where they live. I would go further than that and suggest it could also attract the visitors and students Derry needs to become the vibrant city it aspires too. We need to reimagine our city centre. We have to repurpose large buildings for new uses and also consider housing provision as well. Public spaces like the Guildhall Squareneed remodelling to make more room for meeting, eating and retail.  All of this might mean changing rules in relation to the use of public space and licensing arrangements but we really have to change before our city centre dies. In summary, the current city centre isnt thriving and hasnt for  years. Consumer behaviour, out-of-town retail, online shopping and now Covid- have each had an impact. Its now time to tear the rule book up and imagine the city centre we want for the next  years and the reality is that it will be less about retail and more about making them somewhere where people want to be. It needs to be accessible fun and an exciting development. Lets hope our council appoint the right experts and design team who can hopefully create and enhance our city centre for social and civic use.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It is understood to be a player and the club moved by insisting all their players get tested. “We resume training on Wednesday night,” outlined senior hurling manager John ODwyer. “Only players who come back with a negative test will be permitted to train or to play in Saturdays game with Coleraine.” The former Derry camogie manager, who won back to back Ulster titles with the countys hurlers, feels the GAA should pull the pin on the season. “For the sake of five games, they should have forgot about it and started again in January. For us in Banagher, we did everything according to plan and it takes a lot of effort to go through with the procedures. “For us, there is just not enough gain.

Speculation was mounting over the feasibility of the club championships at the weekend, after  clubs suspended their senior activities following positive cases of Covid-. Banagher and Craigbane acted first, on Thursday night, before they were joined by Ardmore, Limavady, Drumsurn, Magilligan, Glack, Foreglen, Claudy and Drum followed suit. Drum have extended their cessation of activities until Monday, July . “This is a matter for the organising committee, in this instance Derry GAA, to manage as they see fit,” said Alan Milton, the GAAs Director of Communications, while also saying it was discussed with counties on a conference call last week. googletag.cmd.push The GAA has ed to games activity on the principle of opt-in added Declan Woods, Ulster GAAs PRO. “Given the uncertainties that exist around Covid-, each county has been asked to draft Competition Rules to deal with potential scenarios.” Derry have indicated that their championships, starting with Saturdays hurling clash of Banagher and Coleraine will go ahead. Games will he played as scheduled,” a Derry board spokesperson told the County Derry Post. With no movement away from the scheduled date anda club cannot fulfill a fixture due to issues surrounding Covid-, the game will be awarded to the opposition team without any further penalty being imposed. googletag.cmd.push Of the  clubs who stood down at the weekend, Banagher were advised one of their members has been confirmed as positive for the virus. It is understood to be a player and the club moved by insisting all their players get tested. “We resume training on Wednesday night,” outlined senior hurling manager John ODwyer. “Only players who come back with a negative test will be permitted to train or to play in Saturdays game with Coleraine.” The former Derry camogie manager, who won back to back Ulster titles with the countys hurlers, feels the GAA should pull the pin on the season. “For the sake of five games, they should have forgot about it and started again in January. For us in Banagher, we did everything according to plan and it takes a lot of effort to go through with the procedures. “For us, there is just not enough gain. If I wasnt the manager, I would be nowhere near it. Someone at a higher level shouldve made the decision to call off the season.” Grab this weeks County Derry Post for previews of this weekends hurling games. RELATEDThis weeks fixtures.

In a statement, they said: Testing and contact tracing is being conducted to identy people who may be potentially affected to help prevent any further spread. With lockdown restrictions being eased this type of occurrence is to be expected, which is why the Test, Trace and Protect programme is in place. At present anyone who tests positive for COVID- in Northern Ireland will be contacted by the contact tracing team to be given advice on what to do about managing symptoms and of the need to self-isolate to prevent any wider spread of the virus. googletag.cmd.push They will also be asked who they have been in contact with so that we can follow up with those iniduals to give them advice to help prevent the further spread of infection. Contact tracing is an established method to help prevent the further spread of infections such as COVID-, and we are using this approach to target potential clusters which could spark new outbreaks. Limavady councillor, James McCorkell, appealed for people not to panic, and to co-operate with the contact tracing teamthey are contacted. This highlights the fact that we are by no means over this troubling time and people must take this serious when out and about, he said. googletag.cmd.push I would ask that people dont panic - the Test Trace  Protect system is there to help identy these pockets that will inevitably flare up whilst we continue to go through this pandemic. I would appeal for people to cooperate with the Contact Tracing Team, should they be contacted, as this will help get any clusters under control on the area. Please also ensure you know the symptoms of covid- and take every precaution when out and about to social distance and follow at the guidance the Government has asked us to follow. If the team identies a potential cluster or outbreak this will be reported through the PHA’s normal outbreak management channels and the appropriate infection control advice actions carried out. PHA will continue to monitor all cases of COVID-, look for trends and linked cases and where we need to advise or inform the public of any increased risk to public health we will do so in a timely manner. We will not comment on inidual cases as this could lead to people being identied and deter others with symptoms coming forward to be tested. We would ask everyone to be mindful of this risk. This virus has the potential to make its presence felt in any district. Everyone should act on the basis that it might potentially be in their neighbourhood right now. That’s why following the public health advice on regular hand washing and maintaining a social distance of two metres remains vitally important. We must be aware that COVID- is still a threat and we need everyone to play their part in helping to stop the virus spreading.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It comes after a motion, proposed by Deputy Chair, Meta Graham, at the council’s monthly meeting, received unanimous support. Cllr Graham wanted to publicly convey the council’s thanks to the workers who worked tirelessly outside the spotlight during the pandemic. “We all clapped deservedly week after week for our remarkable and brave NHS to show our support and to thank them for the sacrices they made during this dficult time,” she said. googletag.cmd.push “However, I think our thanks and appreciation need to be extended further to include all of those who are sometimes overlooked and quite often taken for granted. Cllr Meta Graham proposed the motion. “We all need to pause and remember that while we may not have had everything we wanted during this crisis, thanks to the work of these dedicated workers, we certainly had everything we needed. “This gesture is a small token of our gratitude, appreciation and thanks to all those who have so selflessly kept Mid Ulster going over the last  months, often at considerable risk to themselves. We owe you all a great debt.” googletag.cmd.push Farmers, factory workers, delivery drivers, lorry drivers, postal workers, retail workers, the PSNI, the NIFRS, small local shops, council staff, volunteers and community groups were among those included by Cllr Graham.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The -year-old passed away at his family home in the seaside town on Saturday night, causing widespread shock throughout the community. Fr Ciaran Dallat, who has known the McQuillan family for a number of years, told the congregation to treasure their memories of the popular young man. “You can rejoice in the  years that Michael has been with us,” he said. “Smicko’, for the lads over there, and wee Michael for most of his family, had a great way of gathering people around him. googletag.cmd.push “I know, in the midst of the fun, there was devilment, but wasn’t that what you liked about him  You didn’t know what was coming next, sometimes. “Each of you have your own stories and I’m sure most of the memories you had were good, but suddenly, in the space of a few days, they have become treasured.” Michael in action for his club, Eoghan Rua. Michael was a dual player for local GAA club Eoghan Rua, who have organised a memory box full of photographs and notes to be presented to his family. Fr Dallat said the support of the GAA community had ‘meant so much’ to Michael’s family. googletag.cmd.push “It’s obvious there just how much sport, and the lads and lassies involved, meant to him,” he said. “It meant so much to Margaret, Paul and Joseph this week, just to have them standing alongside them. “That’s what they were doing out there, just standing alongside people who they love and care for and saying, ‘we don’t know what to do here, but we’re going to stand alongside you anyway’. “That, in itself, is beautul, and it’s because Michael gathered people around him.” Michael’s ability to gather people around him formed a central part of Fr Dallat’s homily, and he spoke of how he was always able to make those around him feel ‘important’. “We have been blessed. It has been a joy to know him,” he told the congregation. “You only had to pass through the house over the last few days to see the love that this wee man has engendered in the time he has been with us. Eoghan Rua have arranged for a memory box to be presented to Michaels family. “Michael had some experience as a classroom assistant in Downpatrick, and the children loved him. He had an ability with children to gather them around and make them feel important. “The same is true here in Portstewart. It wasn’t only his peers he knew how to take care of and bring into the centre of the craic, but that was a gt as well.” Fr Dallat concluded by asking those who loved him to remember Michael for the joy he brought to others. “There are photographs and there are memories, but unfortunately, he won’t bound back into the house once more, looking for money to put petrol in the car for the next bit of the journey,” he said. “He was a man, who though small in stature, always dreamed big. He was someone who drew the love out of others. “Whatever name you have known him by, think for a moment about your favourite memory and thank God for the smile he has put on your face and for the love he has put in your heart.”   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Last year, the Education Authorityproposed discontinuing Groarty Controlled Integrated Primary School because of the low number of pupils at the school. Groarty is the only integrated school on Derrys cityside. The proposal has now been agreed to by the Minister of Education Peter Weir. It had originally been proposed that the school would close at the end of August . However, the closure date has been extended to August . Mr Weir said: Having weighed up all the information, including the fact that  of the  pupils will be exiting P, with no new intake for - or September , it is clear that unfortunately the school is not sustainable, and that provision for any pupils in an integrated setting can be made where in the city. googletag.cmd.push The school has been a part of the local community for over  years. It attained integrated status in . A final decision regarding its closure was expected to be made by the department and Mr Weir at the beginning of this year. However, the decision was delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic. The number of pupils at the school has fluctuated over time but has not risen above  in the past ten years. Ahead of the   school year - before proposals were announced to close -  pupils enrolled. Following that decision, numerous parents took the decision to transfer their children to other schools which was reflected in enrolment figures of just  for the   school year. googletag.cmd.push The EA proposed closing Groarty Integrated Primary School, situated on the Coshquin Road, at the end of August . Parents were ‘devastated’ when first informed of the plans on April , . Schoolchildren from the school then hand delivered letters to then education chief, Derek Baker, when he visited Derry’s Guildhall imploring him to reconsider. The school has a capacity for  pupils and it was anticipated that by transforming from a controlled primary school to a controlled integrated primary school in  that numbers were going to swell. A consultation received  objections from amongst others the Board of Governors, staff, parents, a local resident and the Northern Ireland Council for Integrated Education. Points include the fact it is the only integrated primary school in the cityside and considerable distance to the other one, Oakgrove IPS, in the Waterside. The school caters for children with special needs and has a strong shared educational programme with Gaelscoil na Daroacuteige. The case was also made that housing developments are planned for the area which could improve numbers. However, the EA says that other schools close to Groarty, such as Irish Medium School Gaelscoil na Daroacuteige and Catholic Maintained Schools St Eithne’s and Holy Family have many unfilled places. The EA argues that the school ‘does not operate within its in-year budget’, the school’s enrolment falls ‘well short’ of the Sustainable Schools Policy criteria for primary schools, set at  pupils for a rural school and  pupils for an urban school.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

SDLP Councillor Shauna Cusack said young people have been holding parties and lighting fires at the former Foyle College site at Northland Road. Cllr Cusack said: This is a large site which unfortunately is very easily accessed. It is due to be the site for the new Ardnashee school with an estimated date of Spring  for the works to commence. We all know what happened with the old building when it had to be demolished last year following an arson attack and it seems the site has again become a magnet for anti social behaviour. googletag.cmd.push Cllr Cusack said that in recent weekslocal residents have reported large numbers of youths trying to access the site with drink. They have set up palettes for seating within the trees at the periphery of the site and can be heard partying into the early hours causing sleepless nights for the residents. The PSNI and the Council Community Safety Wardens have been in attendance and have witnessed evidence of drug taking also. This latest incident, which we all feared shows how these gatherings can escalate and get out of control engendering both themselves, others and surrounding property. I have been speaking with the authorities and directly with the Education Authority at the end of last week who had committed to removing materials and investigate private security to monitor the private site. googletag.cmd.push Meanwhile, I would ask parents and the public to play their part and either talk to your child about this area or report any trespass you see. While the obvious activities of underage drinking, drugs and now arson are very worrying we cannot forget the silent killer of Covid being transmitted when unmonitored crowds gather.

Three Mid Ulster District Council arts facilities will be lit up this weekend in recognition of the district’s frontline workers’ efforts during the Covid- pandemic. The Bridewell, Magherafelt, Ranfurly House, Dungannon and The Burnavon in Cookstown will light up red and white, the council colours, over the weekend. It comes after a motion, proposed by Deputy Chair, Meta Graham, at the council’s monthly meeting, received unanimous support. Cllr Graham wanted to publicly convey the council’s thanks to the workers who worked tirelessly outside the spotlight during the pandemic. “We all clapped deservedly week after week for our remarkable and brave NHS to show our support and to thank them for the sacrices they made during this dficult time,” she said. googletag.cmd.push “However, I think our thanks and appreciation need to be extended further to include all of those who are sometimes overlooked and quite often taken for granted. “We all need to pause and remember that while we may not have had everything we wanted during this crisis, thanks to the work of these dedicated workers, we certainly had everything we needed. “This gesture is a small token of our gratitude, appreciation and thanks to all those who have so selflessly kept Mid Ulster going over the last  months, often at considerable risk to themselves. We owe you all a great debt.” googletag.cmd.push Farmers, factory workers, delivery drivers, lorry drivers, postal workers, retail workers, the PSNI, the NIFRS, small local shops, council staff, volunteers and community groups were among those included by Cllr Graham.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In the cargo hold, mess halls and exercise areas were also added.Entering service near the end of the war, the Georgetown Victory and  other Victory troopships were given the task of transporting the troops home as part of Operation Magic Carpet. The vessel was operated by the American Export Lines.The ship departed Sydney with , troops steaming to Glasgow, stopping for water and fuel at Fremantle in Australia, Colombo in Sri Lanka and Aden in Yemen via the Suez Canal.On April , , just before midnight, the ship ran aground hard, at near top speed,  yards south of Killard Point.All of the servicemen aboard were rescued by leboats and breeches buoy to a tug started at about am.William said local people can remember some men wading ashore through heavy fuel oil from the stricken vessel to be cared for in nearby homes. The Cloughey and Newcastle leboats were also launched to help.Winter storms subsequently broke the wreck into two parts with all remaining portable gear not already taken by looters removed and the ship abandoned. The ship sections were salvaged in  and consigned to a breakerrsquos yard at Troon in Scotland.With his resplendent model now complete, William could be forgiven for sitting back on his laurels.

They bind communities together, mitigate against isolation and provide something close to an essential service. It is unthinkable that they would be allowed to collapse.Mr OrsquoToole, who is a former Downing Street press officer, says he also favours a tax on the internet giants.ldquoA number of months ago, I wrote to the Executive to ask them to initiate work on my action plan, which includes a rates holiday for local newspapers, prioritising local media in advertising spend, committing to a poundm journalism fund and to press the British Government to institute a digital information levy on social media giants such as Facebook and Google, he said.The MLA added: ldquoI welcomed the opportunity to engage with the finance minister where I pressed upon him the importance of committing to act to save this vital industry.

We had the most beautul Art Deco Vaudeville theatre for celebrities, actors and directors to view their work. So I always loved it and knew I wanted to create something like that when it came todesigning the cinema, explained Jacqueline.Jacqueline reeled in her professional interior design skills, repurposing household items and getting inspiration from the dance showrsquos judgesrsquo table for her home cinema.She said: ldquoTony and I moved back home from London and built our home where we had a basement constructed. But it became a storage area and the kids were sitting more or less in the middle of it.ldquoWe drove up to Belfast and got wadding to line the walls. When we ran out of wadding, we just used old duvets. We covered the wadding with red velvet. That made the room soundproof.ldquoWe are cocooned watching a movie and a massive thunder storm would pass without us even hearing it. Tony did the building work by and the kids helped. We called them the film crew.ldquoI also got gold paint and mixed that with glitter to give the old-style feel of the movie room. We made a bar thatrsquos inspired by the judgesrsquo  table on Strictly Come Dancing. I was watching the show one night and thought Irsquod like to make something like that.The Art Deco-style columns were Billy bookcases from Ikea that we painted. I had a mirror bought for me that needed a place to hang it and we put that in the bar where it really suits. A relative bought us a popcorn machine for added authenticity.She said that from creating the mood board for the project to when it was completed took four weeks, but it really was not used until lockdown.ldquoBefore the Covid- restrictions, the cinema was something we had started and used a bit. When lockdown came and the cinemas closed, the kids were never out of our cinema, she said.ldquoThe kids can go in there and watch their Netflix and Disney Plus mdash we have Sky, Netflix and every other movie and plus channel going now during lockdown so we can get the newly released movies as they are streamed.ldquoNow therersquos so much satisfaction with it.

He was a principled man who helped everyone, regardless of their politics and always stood up for what he believed to be right.A passionate defender of the Ballynahinch electoral area, he lobbied hard to secure investment and was a key player in the drive to secure a new bypass around the market town.Mr Toman made a signicant contribution to the district and a number of organisations, including Loughinisland GAC. He was the clubrsquos former cultural officer and treasurer.Leading the tributes to her friend and former council colleague, Lady Ritchie said the community of Loughinisland and further afield had lost a man of ldquoimmeasurable integrity and the epitome of hard work and resilience.

At that early stage of his le, Patsy was in a hurry and, above all, he was super efficient to get the job done. His attention to detail was legendary.Lady Ritchie said that she next met Mr Toman at a meeting of the SDLPrsquos Down District Executive in Dundrum in June .ldquoPatsy obviously knew who I was because he asked meI was still in Belfast.

He was a member of Ballynahinch Credit Union, Magherlegan Pipe Band, the Monday Club in Drumaness and Loughinisland GAC, as well as numerous organisations associated with the former Down Council.

He always stood solidly with the families in their fight for justice and truth, she continued.Lady Ritchie said Mr Toman was involved in the politics of the SDLP for a long time and was a founder member and chairman of the partyrsquos Drumaness branch.He was elected to Down Council in  and subsequently re-elected in , , ,  and  and while he retired from elected politics in , he remained active in the community.ldquoPatsy was a stalwart on the East Border Region Committee and the Ards Down Rural Partnership, continued Lady Ritchie.ldquoI fought many elections with him and he kept driving everyone to go the extra mile to achieve better representation.

Such was the loyalty and bond between Patsy and myself that whenever I was ill with breast cancer, both he and his we Anne arranged a special Mass for me the day before my surgery. I will never forget that and I am eternally grateful to Patsy and Anne for their personal support to me during my political and personal le, she added.She added: ldquoPatsy was an extremely loyal inidual a family man who cherished his we, children and grandchildren.

would not have the buffer we have now.\"Itrsquos fortuitous that at that time I resisted, because I didnrsquot want to be in a position where we would not have finances available to respond to an emergency.\"I didnrsquot know that the coronavirus was going to hit us, but clearly it is having an effect.\"Wersquore not collecting business rates because wersquove given lots of businesses a payment holiday and wersquove also issued a considerable number of grants to businesses.\"We have paid out more than pound million in grants to businesses, which we will get back from Welsh

money either.\"Wersquore also paying out grants to charities and amateur sports clubs.\"\"Covid- is also having an effect on the council tax relief scheme,\" Cllr Moore said. \"The Government currently provides money to help people on low incomes claim a discount.\"The level of funding was set prior to this pandemic and the call on this funding is already increasing.\"This may not be sustainable and we may have to fund it ourselves.\"Applications for that fund have gone up immensely since the covid- situation.\"The Welsh Local Government Association believe there could be a

upgrade our IT facilities and expenditure on waste and recycling is also rising.\"Wersquove had to increase our investment in IT because a considerable number of staff are now working from home.\"Originally, we thought we were going to get all of that back, but now wersquove been told wersquore only going to get  per cent.\"Thatrsquos an expense we didnrsquot anticipate and itrsquos an expense we will have to absorb.\"The other added expenditure is due to people being out of work or furloughed.\"We have seen increases in applications for universal credit and thatrsquos going to have an impact on us in terms of the ability to collect rents and council tax.\"Exactly what that impact will be is unclear.ldquoDespite that, we are continuing to run services, as far as possible and we have seen a massive increase in areas such as recycling and waste.The other area of increased spending is in social services, which normally spends around  per cent of our budget.\"That is going to go up dramatically because people are getting frailer and succumbing to covid- and we are also supporting people in care homes and providing PPE for our staff and the care homes.Overall the virus is having a massive impact on the council and the community.\"The exact extent of this impact is very dficult to estimate, but we will continue to support the community until it is defeated.\"He added:

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityCross Common bridge in Dinas Powys was closed off to drivers in February , after a new access road was built and the safety of the old bridge was questioned.The council abandoned the bridge and put up red and white plastic barriers to stop traffic driving over it.In August last year, the council promised to begin the work to remove the bridge that October mdash after delays in finding a specialist contractor.Now, with the bridge still there a year later, Plaid Cymru community councillors are demanding the council act, and either remove the bridge or turn it into a footpath and clear the debris and plastic barriers.Cllr Chris Franks said: ldquoFor three years, the Vale has said this bridge has got to go. If theyrsquore going to do it, theyrsquove got to get on with it. These ugly barriers are so frustrating, and thousands of people see it.ldquoThey did some excavations and just left the spoil heap. Itrsquos a vast improvement now, but even cleaned up itrsquos still a mess.Jean Webber, who lives nearby on Llwyn Derwen, said she has witnessed a lot of fly-tippers dumping rubbish at the bridge, like fridges, freezers and buildersrsquo rubbish. She said: ldquoI think this end of Dinas has been forgotten. [The council] seems to concentrate on the other end.ldquoI walk past here every day. It wouldnrsquot be so badthey just walled it off. I never complain, but this is just appalling.The council has now promised work will begin to remove the bridge next month, and blamed coronavirus for the most recent delay. The new timetable is to finish the job by this October.A Vale of Glamorgan council spokesperson said: ldquoUnfortunately, the contractor originally appointed to remove the bridge withdrew from the project after agreement couldnrsquot be reached on a claim for additional costs due to the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoThat meant a new contractor had to be found, a process that added to the delay caused by the pandemic itself, which for a period prevented work of this type being carried out.ldquoThe council has now successfully appointed a new contractor and received an indication that work is expected to start in mid-August. It is anticipated the work will be completed by the end of October.But both Cllr Franks and Ms Webber raised doubts about the new timetable. Cllr Franks said: ldquoWe are always told it will start in six to eight weeks. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityUnder the new rules, people will need to have their nose and mouth covered or face a fine of up to pound.People with certain disabilities will be exempt.This comes after rules requiring people to wear face coverings on public transport became mandatory last month.Initially many experts and authorities, including the World Health Organisation , suggested face coverings were not effective in preventing the spread of Covid- but are now recommending wearing them in indoor spaces.ndash Has there been confusion over the new rules Yes, opposition MPs have said it needs to be claried whether customers have to wear face coverings in takeaways and sandwich shops in England.The criticism came after days of mixed messages with the Health Secretary and Boris Johnsonrsquos official spokesman contradicting each other on the matter.The Dailyreported early on Thursday that people using sandwich shops and takeaways will be required to wear a mask, and buying food from the counter and then sitting down to eat inside the shop will be banned.But the Government refused to confirm the report ahead of the formal announcement.ndash What does the science say about face coverings A report recently published by the Royal Society suggests that even basic homemade face coverings can reduce transmissionenough people wear them when in public.The study, based on mathematical modelling, showed thatan entire population wore face coverings that were only % effective, it would bring the R value, which is the number of people an infected inidual passes the virus on to, from . to under ., without the need for lockdowns.Another Royal Society report suggests the use of cotton masks is associated with a % lower odds of infection in comparison to the no mask groups, when tested in a healthcare setting.Melinda Mills, Nuffield professor of sociology, at the University of Oxford, told a webinar: ldquoSo that should suggest that when yoursquore generally in the public that it should offer you some, not %, but it does offer you some protection.Meanwhile, another study which looked at coronavirus deaths across  countries found that nations which had policies favouring mask-wearing had lower death rates.In another piece of scientic research, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences last month, scientists calculated that wearing face coverings prevented more than , infections in Italy between April  and May , and more than , infections in New York City between April  and May . vw,vw,px, px\"People face a finethey do not wear face coverings in shops ndash What are the benefits to wearing them Experts say the risk of coronavirus transmission appears to be higher in poorly ventilated indoor spaces and wearing face coverings in small shops or enclosed shopping centres could help reduce the spread.Keith Neal, emeritus professor of the epidemiology of infectious diseases at the University of Nottingham, said: ldquoLack of strong evidence of their effectiveness should not be considered a problem but the evidence is accumulating that they have a part to play in reducing transmission and also in protecting the wearer.In addition, there is also increased evidence which suggests that many people with the virus who do not have symptoms can still be contagious.ndash What do people need to know about wearing masks Ideally the face coverings should be made of multilayer high quality cotton.Where possible they should be should be worn in indoor confined spaces and crowded spaces, especially where social distancing cannot be maintained.Japan follows the three Cs, closed spaces, crowded places, and close-contact settings.When wearing a face covering, it should cover the mouth and nose with no gaps. vw,vw,px, px\"Coverings have been mandatory on public transport since June ndash Are some face coverings better than others The Who advises a three-layer face covering in the community ndash the outer layer should be water resistant, the inner should be water absorbent and the mid-layer acts as a filter.It emphasises that a face covering alone cannot protect people from Covid-, and must be combined with social distancing of at least a metre and regular hand washing.The Government has said coverings can be made from scarves, bandanas or other fabric items, as long as they cover the mouth and nose.But scientists at the Leverhulme Centre, who studied dferent types of face coverings used by members of the public, say some coverings are not as effective as others, with loosely woven fabrics, such as scarves, shown to be the least effective.Prof Mills, director of the Leverhulme Centre, said: ldquoAttention must also be placed on how well it fits on the face it should loop around the ears or around the back of the neck for better coverage.What are the main messages about face coverings Prof Mills says cloth coverings are an effective way to protect the wearer and those around them.She says that face masks and coverings cannot be seen in isolation and are part of a package that involves hand hygiene and social distancing.Consistent and effective public messaging is vital, she concluded..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: What you need to know about face coverings
