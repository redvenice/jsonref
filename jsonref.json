He took it up when he was forced to give up polo in 1971 due to an arthritic wrist.         Wood Farm (pictured), an unassuming cottage on the edge of the Sandringham Estate close to the Norfolk coastline, is where the Duke has been whiling away his days since retiring\u0027He terrified his guests. Once, he took someone on his carriage and told him, \u0027Horses get used to the way they normally go and usually they\u0027d turn right here. I\u0027m going to make them turn left – and they won\u0027t like it.\u0027\u0027He was right. The guest was thrown from the carriage, while Prince Philip was thrown the other way. After they were rescued and safely in the back of a Land Rover, the Duke simply turned to him and quipped, \u0027See what I mean?\u0027\u0027I\u0027ve seen him do it and it looks terrifying but his former private secretary says it\u0027s relaxation for him.\u0027If you\u0027re doing it at speed and going around obstacles, you have to concentrate so hard you don\u0027t have time to think about anything else. That\u0027s the point of it for him, I think.\u0027Penny and the Duke \u0027get on very well together\u0027, he added.\u0027I\u0027ve seen them all together – the Queen, Prince Philip and Penny – at Windsor and she stays at the castle. They spend a lot of time in each other\u0027s company.\u0027Wood Farm was once the home of the so-called Lost Prince – Prince John, the youngest son of George V and Queen Mary.His tragic story was turned into an Emmy award-winning 2003 BBC drama.The Prince, who had epilepsy and learning difficulties, was sent to live in the cottage with his nanny to shield him from the public gaze, but he regularly saw his grandmother, Queen Alexandra, who was living at Sandringham. He died in 1919 aged just 13.Wood Farm had been occupied by a tenant until it was turned back into a Royal residence.Mr Vickers added: \u0027Wood Farm is more practical than opening up Sandringham. It\u0027s not tiny, but it\u0027s a normal house that anyone could live in. It\u0027s very un-Royal.\u0027Just, perhaps, the way the Duke likes it."},{"url":null,"title":"Wallaby captured zoo staff rehoused wildlife park","story":"Share this article \u0027As this animal was not too far from Taunton, our concern was that it would be attacked by dogs or become a road casualty.\u0027As they can be as heavy as a small Roe Deer, hitting one in the car could - as well as being fatal for the wallaby - potentially cause serious damage to the vehicle, and a possible crash.\u0027         Watcha!

A bet is a commercial arrangement between two willing parties and there is no statutory right to bet.\u0027In the same way that a customer can decide whether or not they wish to place a bet, a gambling business is also free to decide who they accept bets from, and on what terms, to manage their business and financial liabilities, just as an insurance company may do when setting premiums. \u0027Accordingly, any restrictions that Bet365 may place on customer accounts are fully compliant with both legislation and regulation, in accordance with published terms and conditions and impact a very small minority of customers.\u0027Contrary to your suggestion, Bet365 does not consider it pioneered a risk-management process which has been evident in the land-based gambling sector and other sectors for decades.\u0027Ms Coates is the founder of Bet365.  She became convinced online gambling would soon replace traditional betting shops and convinced her brother John to support her plans.She founded the online gambling company in the early 2000s after spotting the potential of internet betting to revolutionise the industry.Ms Coates has been credited with turning a modest family business into a global firm raking in millions, being seen as a \u0027local girl done good\u0027, creating more than 3,000 jobs in her native Stoke-on-Trent when the huge Bet365 HQ was built.Ms Coates owns around half of the shares in the company, according to Forbes, which places her 244th in the list of the world\u0027s billionaires, with a net worth of £9.3 billion.Gamblers placed £64.5 billion in bets with the company over the financial year, nearly a quarter up on the year before, Bet365\u0027s accounts show."},{"url":null,"title":"Hes purrpetrator Cheeky cat caught taste testing biscuits pet stores display","story":"Share this article Carlos casually tries the cookies on sale, licking them to his heart\u0027s content.Jessica said: \u0027Carlos, the store cat, was eating cookies that are clearly not his.\u0027He is being a product tester apparently, even though he has his own cookie under the register, but that\u0027s not good enough.\u0027He lives in Chowhound and likes testing all of the cat beds and cookies.\u0027I understand him, I too like mooching other people\u0027s snacks!\u0027                 \u0027He is being a product tester apparently, even though he has his own cookie under the register, but that\u0027s not good enough,\u0027 said filmer Jessica"},{"url":null,"title":"Ex Thomas Cook staff say struggling claim benefits","story":"Share this article Betty Knight, who worked as cabin crew for 12 years, said her application for JSA was repeatedly denied, although she has now received five weeks of benefits.She told the BBC: \u0027I\u0027ve worked hard.

We take a closer look at his workFelipe Dana’s work in 2019 has taken him all over the world, covering big news stories like the elections in Spain, conflict in Syria, the crisis in Hong Kong, and to Rwanda, Greenland and Algeria to focus on environmental stories. He has regularly featured in our 20 Photos of the Week series and in our daily highlights photography galleries.We asked Dana about his year as a news photographer, his favourite assignments and images.“2019 was a busy and difficult year in many parts of the world, with political turmoil and massive protests in nearly every continent, never-ending conflicts in the Middle East, the plight of migrants and the climate crisis. With all this happening across the globe, it was an intense year to be a news photographer but that’s also when our job becomes most important.”“I covered a great variety of stories in 2019, starting with the ultra-right in Ukraine. I then went to Syria to cover war in the last territory held by Islamic State.”In February the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces recaptured Isis’s final stronghold. Hundreds of people were evacuated from Baghuz in eastern Syria.“It’s very hard for me to pick one favourite, single image, but one that strikes me was taken in Syria when I was following the mass evacuations out of the last territory still held by Islamic State militants. There was a screening area in the middle of the desert and that night men, women and children were gathering there, all sitting on the ground. I spotted this woman holding her baby after she was screened by the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, it was extremely dark but there was just enough light from a nearby military vehicle. The lighting reflected the dramatic moment she was in.”A year and a half after Isis was declared defeated in Iraq, a battle continues between surviving members of the group waging an insurgency and the security forces who are relying on intelligence operations, raids and searches for sleeper cells to stamp them out.Dana went to Madrid in June to cover the all-English Champions League final won by Liverpool.“Although I work mostly shooting features and news stories, a big part of the life of an agency photographer is to shoot sports, so often I’ll help in events like the Champions, World Cup and Olympics.”Felipe visited Albania in June for a feature on the Vjosa River. Rivers are a crucial part of the global water cycle. They act like nature’s arteries, carrying energy and nutrients across vast landscapes, providing water for drinking, food production and industry.“I spent a few weeks traveling in Albania, documenting one of Europe’s last wild rivers, the Vjosa, where the government has set in motion plans to dam the river and its tributaries to generate electricity for one of Europe’s poorest countries and many locals are fighting that project. I was surprised to learn how few large rivers still run free and how much a dam can impact the local ecosystem.”Dana travelled to Greenland in August and followed a NYU team of scientists who are tracking the climate emergency in Greenland. “After Albania, I went to Greenland where I followed the work of scientists who are trying to understand the alarmingly rapid melting of the ice. I only had a few days there but the country is so beautiful I decided to make use of the very long days and photograph throughout the night in a unique and bright evening light. It only gets dark for a few hours at that time of the year. The size of the icebergs is really humbling. As amazing as some of them may look in the pictures, I still felt like the photos didn’t do them justice.”“I went to Rwanda to the Volcanoes national park where the world’s longest-running gorilla study takes place. It is a beautiful country. I felt extremely lucky to see the stunning mountain gorillas in person. After reaching the park’s entrance in 4x4 cars, we followed local guides up the mountain, reaching an altitude as high as 4,000 metres. I was amazed how the guides and trackers could distinguish between each gorilla within the groups they followed. Their skill came in very handy when I had to identify the animals by name in my captions.”“The money that built this school comes from tourism,” says Fabien Uwimana, a French and English teacher. “More children today can go to school.”Dana spent time in Hong Kong covering the pro-democracy protests. We published a gallery of Felipe’s projected and layered portraits of the protesters in October.“I also joined the AP team in Hong Kong covering the non-stop protests that are packing the streets almost every day for months now. Although I’m used to covering these kinds of protests, I was impressed by how determined and tireless they are. I was also surprised by how much they appreciated the work of the free press and were actually worried about our safety during the clashes.

The comic book’s suspicion of power and its veneration of persistent kindness now seem an odd fit for DC, which appears to be hellbent on breaking down Watchmen into a sort of paste that it can smear on everything from prequels and sequels the creators never wanted, to a themed toaster (sold out years ago, sorry). The company’s repeated failure to wring anything entertaining or clever from Watchmen might forgivably strike the book’s author and artist, and their partisans, as somewhat gratifying.But as Damon Lindelof’s HBO spinoff shows, a solid Watchmen adaptation is possible. The first series, which ended last week, still hasn’t been renewed for a second, probably because of Lindelof’s own reluctance to be part of it. But this adaptation succeeds by hitting many of the themes of the graphic novel while reproducing almost nothing of its plot – unlike Zack Snyder’s straightforward 2009 film, which slavishly reproduced the plot and misunderstood all the themes. Lindelof’s series features a prestige drama – a-show-within-a-show, in much the same way that the book contained a-comic-within-a-comic – that pays backhanded tribute to Snyder’s movie, with sneery dialogue, ostentatiously cartoonish costumes, lots of slo-mo and gouts of nearly fluorescent blood. By comparison, Lindelof’s world is muted, its emotional arcs elliptical, its careful and complex set-dressing deceptively drab. It manages to achieve something Moore and Gibbons did in the comic: thoroughly imagine a convincing science-fiction world in which daily life is very similar to our own, just slightly off centre.Every writer and director who has taken on Watchmen has tried to make Moore’s dazzling script their own. This often fails, partly because Moore and Gibbons simply seem to be better read than many of their imitators Watchmen is filled with literary allusions, from Edgar Allan Poe to Genesis. Also, for all that Watchmen draws inspiration from old superheroes, it is a wonderfully prescient book about the deceptions of the American dream. This is something that Lindelof’s show, with its depictions of the Ku Klux Klan and the Tulsa Race Massacre, seems to understand, too.Perhaps that anti-authoritarian streak is why the book engenders such odd loyalties from devotees, and such antagonism to DC for allowing prequels, sequels and adaptations to happen without the consent of Moore and Gibbons. As I researched this article I did my best to avoid paying DC for the privilege I bought the Before Watchmen prequels and the movie secondhand, and watched the TV show on someone else’s subscription. I did buy copies of Doomsday Clock, Geoff Johns and Gary Frank’s sequel series, in which Rorschach meets Batman, and I felt bad about it. The aggregated effect of all these ancillary works is one of sheer scale: the Snyder movie is almost three hours long and comes in multiple, even more punitive director’s cut editions Doomsday Clock is just as long as Watchmen and Before Watchmen runs to 37 issues.For decades, there was a general feeling among artists and writers that it would be crossing a picket line to write more Watchmen comics. DC has seen to it that the rights from Watchmen – and other works – never revert to the creators, who are presumably still making the same royalties they started getting in 1988. For many years, a sense of responsibility for this extended fairly high up the organisational chart at DC Comics. But when the company became a subsidiary of DC Entertainment in 2009, much of the compunction around taking further Watchmen-branded products away from Moore and Gibbons, who would almost certainly veto them, vanished.It did not vanish from the creative community. DC executives Jim Lee and Dan DiDio approached director and comic-book writer Kevin Smith about a prequels project in 2010. “I said, ‘Awesome, is Alan Moore doing it?’ and they were like: ‘Of course not,’” Smith told me two years later. “And I said, ‘Wow, you guys have a lot of balls.’” Smith knew the score: “All over the internet they’d be like, ‘First he made Cop Out and then he shit all over Alan Moore’s legacy!’” At the time, Lee and DiDio would only say: “It’s our responsibility as publishers to find new ways to keep all of our characters relevant.”The Before Watchmen comics were roundly criticised for being soulless undertakings. Their most enthusiastic defender was J Michael Straczynski, who wrote the Nite Owl, Moloch, and Dr Manhattan prequels. He said Moore and Gibbons’s contract was simply what happened to young artists. “Did Alan Moore get screwed on his contract? Of course. Lots of people get screwed, but we still have Spider-Man and lots of other heroes.”Straczynski was correct about the industry’s cruelty. In 1938, Jerry Seigel and Joe Shuster were paid $130 (about $2,300 today) for the rights to Superman. They later tried to sue DC for more money, and were simply fired. Siegel was at one point found sleeping on a park bench by a police officer Shuster died deep in debt, though the then smaller, more shame-able DC eventually gave the men an annual stipend.“Given that Superman had been rebranded as exemplifying Truth, Justice and the American Way,” Moore once wrote of the treatment of Seigel and Shuster, in an essay for Occupy Comics, “it seems ironic that the first two of these qualities had been so casually dispensed with, while to judge from the behaviour of the nascent comics industry it would appear that their interpretation of ‘the American Way’ had little to distinguish it from any other forms of spineless underhand deception, larceny or bullying.”Lindelof was aware of the case against making his Watchmen TV show, and even asked Moore for his blessing – which he did not get. (Gibbons did approve, however.) His Watchmen, like the prequels and sequels commissioned by DC, contains true heroism, a moving call to inidual action and a happy ending (give or take), thanks to the heroes who catch the bad guys at the end. By contrast, the book’s hapless costumed characters either fail to stop disaster or have a personal hand in bringing it about. If they learn a lesson, it’s that the only worthwhile pursuit is not justice but the anodyne, laborious pleasure of love and companionship. Lindelof’s show has a firm morality, but it is a morality consistent with the values of a corporate behemoth that is invested in selling Watchmen toasters.HBO’s Watchmen, like all prestige television today, flatters the audience. It asks us to imagine a better world and then congratulates us for doing so. But it also addresses the primary problem of American moral ideals, which is the bone-deep conviction of our own innocence, and the commitment to preserving that innocence by ignoring the constant presence of white supremacy. That any show will do that work is valuable. But because anything derived from the Watchmen comic is serving the aim of DC Entertainment to profit from work created by a writer who strenuously objects to its exploitation, the decision to watch the show remains a moral question all fans will have to wrestle with when a second season is, inevitably, announced."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56d8535b2c6556cb74f3ddda5fff8ad39e8b4926/0_320_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1480f101a398dbb39bd7dcd450c36585","title":"fewer people visit uk shops on last saturday before christmas","story":"With some retailers accepting online orders as late as Christmas Eve, shoppers now have many more choices about the way they shop and often hang on for last-minute bargains.The lower turnout on Saturday, traditionally one of the busiest shopping days of the year, came despite a flurry of discounts from retailers in an effort to tempt bargain hunters after a difficult trading year.Industry experts said the plethora of promotions on offer since November, and particularly over the Black Friday discount period at the end of November, meant many had spent their money early or were unexcited by further price cuts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d2b47ad28d1db03767f38e50710d70826449d1c/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d39b9c9844d9f3341fc7c207a7f04fd","title":"tech worker activism 2019 what we learned","story":"Our database of collective actions challenges the mainstream media narrative. Here are our eight key insightsIn the past year, tech worker mobilization has reached unprecedented levels. Kickstarter employees sought union recognition from their company. Amazon workers led a cross tech-industry walkout to support the global climate strike. Googlers grappled with unionization, fought against increasing corporate hostility, and challenged their company’s unethical partnerships. Even Chinese tech workers have joined in, with the viral 996.icu campaign that demanded more reasonable working hours.We documented all the collective actions in the tech industry in a publicly accessible online database and analyzed the results. What we learned challenges many mainstream media narratives about the tech workers’ movement. Here are our eight most important insights.There were more than a hundred publicly reported actions in 2019, some involving thousands of people. This is almost triple the number of actions we saw in 2018 and nine times the number in 2017.Mainstream media coverage of the tech workers’ movement has often focused on white-collar professionals – software engineers, data scientists, designers, program managers and other workers with high-paying desk jobs – such as the “Thanksgiving Four”, who were allegedly fired by Google as retaliation for their organizing efforts.This year, Amazon warehouse workers in Sacramento circulated a petition to reinstate two fired workers – and succeeded. Whole Foods workers denounced their parent company’s ties to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). A protest caravan of rideshare employees drove roughly 600 miles across California to drum up support for the AB5 bill, which entitles gig workers to greater employee benefits.Thousands of Instacart workers in the US went on strike to protest reduced earnings. Delivery workers across the Atlantic, including Deliveroo workers in the UK and Foodora workers in Norway, found creative ways to make their voices heard. Uber Eats delivery staff even managed to unionize in Japan.It’s been argued that the tech worker movement has been fueled by employee concern for moral or ethical issues as opposed to more “traditional” organizing concerns, such as higher wages and improved working conditions. But this characterization of the movement is a result of focusing on only the most privileged group. The data for less privileged tech workers tells a different story.The methods of protest used by the two groups also differed. Full-timewhite-collar workers sent open letters to management as their core strategy, while more precarious groups went on strike or walked off the job.Ultimately, concerns about exploitation of vulnerable populations underlie actions by both groups. In the case of many less privileged tech workers, whether they are blue-collar or contract workers, they happen to be the subject of this exploitation. Movements such as the Fight for 15 have argued that the struggle for living wages, decent working conditions, and basic benefits such as health insurance is an ethical dilemma for our society.Contractors have faced similar challenges within companies. When Google contract workers in Pittsburgh voted to unionize this year, they drew attention to the inequalities that exist even within white-collar roles.Failing to include gig workers, such as rideshare workers, delivery workers, or contract workers, as part of the tech worker movement reinforces stereotypes of who counts as an employee and undermines the potential for worker solidarity across the industry.The companies with the greatest number of reported actions from 2006 to 2019 were Amazon and Google. When grouped together, the rideshare companies Uber, Lyft, and Bolt followed, with 20 actions total.Whereas Amazon and the rideshare companies were mainly targets of actions by less privileged workers, Google and Microsoft were targeted by full-timewhite-collar employees.It’s a common tactic for bosses to pit workers against each other in order to maintain control. Privileged tech workers must help to dismantle such isions. Tech workers across the industry must learn to recognize the precariousness of contractors compared with full-time company employees, blue-collar compared with white-collar workers, and undocumented workers and visa holders compared with citizens.We began to see solidarity among different types of tech workers this year. In July, engineers from Amazon HQ flew out to Shakopee, Minnesota, to support their warehouse co-workers on their Prime Day strike. Earlier in the year, nearly a thousand Google workers signed a letter objecting to the tech company’s treatment of temporary contractors, in what organizers are calling a “historical coalition” between the company’s full-time employees and temps, vendors and contractors.Unions and activist networks such as Tech Workers Coalition and Silicon Valley Rising have helped lead the charge in bringing some of these groups together. Other actions have simply been the result of iniduals looking critically at the working conditions of those employed in the same workspace.When we expand our definition of who counts as a tech worker, we get a true sense of the scale of this movement and its potential to incite real change – if tech workers can band together.Nataliya Nedzhvetskaya is a graduate student in sociology at the University of California at BerkeleyJS Tan is a volunteer with the Tech Workers Coalition.

They have been joined by the non-famous telling tales of wild swimming, of discovering nature, of dying and nearly dying. And to this can be added the genres of creative non-fiction, autofiction, and personal essays – terms that were once barely used. Throughout the 2010s, readers have been drawn more than ever to the ordinary voice, and writers have increasingly turned to their own lives for material.Internet ubiquity has bred creativity. It has encouraged us to perform: to use our life material for effect. It’s not a coincidence that the rise of blog posts and Reddit threads has aligned with the rise of autofiction – where the author self-consciously feeds details from their life into the construct of a novel.In 2012, came Sheila Heti’s How Should a Person Be?, containing fictionalised versions of herself and her friends, including the artist Margaux Williamson. Ben Lerner’s Leaving the Atocha Station (2011), the first in his autofictional trilogy, followed an unreliable narrator, Adam Gordon, who tests the boundaries of truth and performance – at one point, he lies about his mother being dead, then fears that he will have somehow caused her demise by doing so. This inquisitive line-crossing, saying things to see what happens, encapsulates the 2010s all on its own. In this decade the spread of misinformation has risen to new heights, with rumours being passed on through retweets, and the president of the United States branding any facts that don’t suit him “fake news”.Elif Batuman’s autobiographical novel The Idiot (2017) repurposed material she had explored in her 2010 memoir The Possessed to create a completely different book. Karl Ove Knausgård’s many-volumed, decade-ning My Struggle details how much milk he likes on his cereal. Rachel Cusk, Tao Lin, Édouard Louis, Tom Malmquist, Maggie Nelson, recent translations of Annie Ernaux – the list goes on. I don’t even know how to categorise Meena Kandasamy’s latest, Exquisite Cadavers (2019), which reserves a space in the margin where she processes the main text as it progresses. Autofiction existed before 2010, but this decade, it has proliferated.In 2016, Oxford Dictionaries chose “post-truth” as the word of the year. In 2017, Collins Dictionary chose “fake news” (in 2013, it was “selfie”). In a time of distrust, personal testimony feels more reliable than statements from once-respected institutions. First-person exposés and undercover accounts have been bestsellers: from James Bloodworth’s exposure of low-wage Britain in Hired (2018), Adam Kay’s tale about the realities of being a junior doctor in This is Going to Hurt (2017), which has sold more than 1m copies, to an anonymous assessment of the justice system by the Secret Barrister (Stories of the Law and How It’s Broken, 2018). Tales from prison officers, teachers, carers have all followed.The end of this decade also brought the rise of unknown voices through the #MeToo movement, where personal testimonies unveiled a landscape of abuse. Books followed, including Know My Name (2019) by Chanel Miller, about her experience of sexual assault and extremely public court case. Not That Bad (2018), an anthology about rape and sexual assault edited by Roxane Gay, set voices known and unknown side by side: what they had to say, not who they were, mattered. People in positions of power have failed to act, so those who don’t have a platform have had to build their own instead.It could be easy to label the 2010s as the decade of cultural narcissism, but that is too simplistic. On a recent trip to the UK, Lerner spoke about his choice to write autofiction not out of passion for the genre, but out of an aversion to the “great American novel”, where the highest goal is to achieve a state of universality through a supposedly omniscient voice that believes it encompasses all experience. Lerner’s form is born of kindness. It admits that he, as a white man, can only write what he knows, that he cannot presume to know what he has not lived. Lerner’s autofiction still has a universality, but it has achieved that from a specific standpoint – himself – which has broadened over the decade: in the last of his trilogy, The Topeka School (2019), he widens the scope to his parents’ perspectives, too.This decade has not just been about finding our own voices, but about letting more voices in. Lerner’s comment is a nod to our ersifying publishing landscape – which, albeit slowly, is progressing. It was fitting for the decade to end with Bernardine Evaristo being recognised with the Booker prize. But it is telling that – in an age in which there are so many voices clamouring for our attention, and where we are still learning which ones to prioritise – she had to share it.• Rebecca Watson’s first novel, little scratch, will be published by Faber \u0026amp Faber in July 2020"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d04c420d4ab4c5444fe7b2cc08d1838dc60e3693/0_88_5220_3133/master/5220.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba4e4b9e3dbbf09f2f630af6cbf3557a","title":"periodofreflection social media","story":"Our lives are increasingly dictated by the frantic pace of social media it’s time to reclaim the space to slow down and thinkHe didn’t get to nationalise the railways or dish out free broadband, but right at the year’s end Jeremy Corbyn made one undeniable contribution to politics, culture and human understanding. In the wee hours of 13 December, as the scale of Labour’s drubbing became clear, he said he would be stepping down after the start of a “process of reflection”. Online, this phrase was combined with another P-word Corbyn had used in the same speech, and yet another viral sensation was born: #PeriodOfReflection was rapidly everywhere, and its use became more and more ironic as the noise around the contest to be Labour leader increased. The apogee of absurdity probably arrived last Wednesday, in the mid-afternoon, when #CorbynwasRight was the number one hashtag on Twitter, and calm and introspection seemed very far away indeed.Five days on, with hats flying into the ring and cliches already extending into the distance (the need to “reconnect”, the imperative to stay “radical”), the idea of a quiet interlude and the chance to think deep thoughts about the politics of the left does look like something of a joke. But the reasons run deeper than the loud speculation about whether it will be Keir Starmer, Rebecca Long-Bailey, Emily Thornberry, Lisa Nandy or Jess Phillips, and into one of the most vexing questions of our time: whether our current means of communication and discourse allow us any space to reflect on anything at all.At which point, an unlikely segue, away from politics, into the creative arts. The 21st century’s closing-down of spaces for thought and reflection hit me like a hammer back in February, with the untimely death of the English musician Mark Hollis: among the noted passings-on of this year, his gave me the most pause for thought, something in keeping with his art. The chief creative force behind the band-cum-project Talk Talk, Hollis had moved from making fast-paced, glossy music that sounded like the very embodiment of the early to mid-80s, into stuff that was built on space and quiet. “Before you play two notes,” he once said, “learn how to play one note, and don’t play one note unless you’ve got a reason to play it.”To my mind, his group’s masterpiece is the 1988 album Spirit of Eden, a recorded period of reflection that lasts just over 41 minutes. If I want to think, this is the record I put on. Its first piece, The Rainbow, begins with the faintest of chords, the merest hint of piano and a couple of other instruments that contribute the most sparse of sounds, punctuated by stretches of silence. There are no drums until nearly the third minute Hollis’s voice – his first line is, “Oh yeah, the world’s turned upside down” – arrives at 3:29. The fact that Hollis had effectively retired from music in 1998 was held to be of a piece with such creations: he had gradually filled his music so full of space that there was eventually nowhere to go but complete silence, and the longest period of reflection any celebrated musician has probably ever registered.Even at the time, Spirit of Eden, its follow-up Laughing Stock, and Hollis’s only solo album sat well apart from the rest of popular music. But now, they sound like creations from another universe. The most successful 21st-century music tends to be intentionally huge-sounding, and devoid of much light and shade: thanks to a ubiquitous production technique called dynamic range compression that has been the “in” thing for more than a decade, even the quiet bits are now loud. At the same time, the tyranny of streaming and the necessity of grabbing listeners’ attention as quickly as possible mean that composers and musicians are now in a permanent hurry, and desperate to hit us with the catchiest, crassest aspects of their songs. In 2017, researchers at Ohio State University discovered that the length of the average song intro had come down from 20 seconds in the 1980s to just five seconds. Among the other celebrated musicians who died this year was Marie Fredriksson, of the Swedish duo Roxette. By way of pointing to the future, that band’s 1995 greatest hits collection was titled Don’t Bore Us – Get to the Chorus!Music only reflects the way we live. Thumbs that endlessly jab at smartphones attest to the fact that for millions – billions? – of us, stepping back from the endless fray is now unthinkable. Come off Twitter or Facebook for a few weeks, then tentatively go back on, and you may find yourself seemingly tweeting and posting into the void, as the algorithms at work put you in a kind of temporary exile, proving that online silence is a punishable offence. We all know the questions we silently ask our friends and acquaintances if they go quiet: why haven’t you replied to my direct message? Couldn’t you even have liked my post? Why on earth did you unfollow me?At the risk of sounding hopelessly old, I would argue that changes in other human habits have pushed us in much the same direction. It was undoubtedly good for our health, but the transformation of smoking into the preserve of pariahs has taken away one of the last things that allowed people in industrial societies to be temporarily alone with their thoughts. Whatever the downsides that have led increasing numbers of young people to leave booze alone, the moderate use of alcohol at least creates the opportunity for a slowing of our mental processes and exchange with others free of at least some inhibitions the modern ubiquity of coffee, by contrast, highlights the fact that the most acceptable thing to be is uptight and hyperactive. More and more, a question hangs over the social, economic and cultural model we have created for ourselves: how are you meant to get a handle on a world of automation and online everything when their frantic rhythms so consume you, making any kind of critical distance impossible?An answer may lie in that ine calm that, if you are fortunate, begins to take hold some time on Christmas Eve, and can be extended for the best part of a week. If that is going to happen, you have to switch off your phone, perhaps put on some appropriate music – Spirit of Eden, Brian Eno’s ambient triumph Music for Airports, or something more seasonal – and allow yourself to think. Otherwise what wins? Only unrestrained technocapitalism, whose cacophonous din gets louder every year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fdf047225bc55052d768602db0d444014571642/0_140_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a37872245d67152be1179457fcba6215","title":"uk statistic decade productivity government","story":"As the nation puts it feet up for Christmas after a long, hard decade what lesson should it draw?I can see your eyes starting to glaze over already, but bear with me. It’s the most important boring statistic that you have never heard of, which is why the Royal Statistical Society has today decided to name it the UK Statistic of the Decade. Productivity is broadly the measure of how efficiently an economy creates goods and services. It is the key to every country’s long-term prosperity, and high productivity growth means a bigger economic pie, allowing for higher wage growth and more money for public services. There’s a good argument that many of the tensions and issues we have faced in the UK in the past decade would have been eased with the prosperity that comes from more productivity growth.Part of the problem with productivity is there is no silver bullet, and many competing views on the solutions. For example, the Bank of England’s chief economist, Andy Haldane, thinks that the issue is a “long tail” of unproductive companies that are not as good as their best peers. Others have argued that in fact our most productive companies and sectors, such as banking and pharmaceuticals, have started to run out of steam. The government has recognised this is contested territory, and to its credit, through the Economic and Social Research Council, is investing £32m over five years in a new Productivity Institute to develop the policy evidence. But policymakers need to act now. There are several bear traps the new government must avoid. First, it should not just default to working with sexy tech sectors, but also focus upon improving the productivity of industries such as catering, retail and care, which employ millions of low-paid workers. This will need investment in training and skills, which in turn requires putting money into the Cinderella that is further education.These industries also need the development of better career pathways, coupled with the automation of low-skill tasks. This could help to shift these industries from being low wage, low skill and high turnover – and would enable people who are working hard in often precarious roles to receive real wage growth.Second, the government needs to remember that the public sector makes up around a fifth of the economy, and so it’s important to improve productivity in hospitals and defence, for example, even though it can be hard to measure. The government is talking about civil service reform, but it will need new strategies to improve it that go beyond New Labour targets and coalition-style austerity. The most fruitful gains could come from two things: improving leadership, and strengthening the use of data in the public sector.Local authorities such as Glasgow and Bristol are showing the way in using citizen data-powered approaches to improve their services, such as integrated social transport, and we can learn lessons from outside the UK – for example Barcelona, which is combining data use with protection of privacy.Finally, and most importantly, the government needs to focus interventions outside the capital and the home counties. UK productivity is one of the most geographically unequal in the OECD. Researcher Tom Forth has shown that Manchester and Birmingham are less productive than similar-sized cities in other countries, and that a key part of the explanation is weaker public transport infrastructure, especially buses. The government needs to invest in regional infrastructure, skills and innovation, and this needs more devolved decision-making. It would be a departure from traditional policy dictated from Westminster, but the signals are good, with mooted infrastructure spend in the Midlands and the north, and the Queen’s speech talking about giving “communities more control over how investment is spent”. The Johnson government has the opportunity to push this to establish its one-nation credentials with many of its first-time voters. But watch out for the Treasury pushing back and reverting to its default approach, getting a quick return by concentrating on London and the south-east.So enjoy an unproductive Christmas. But come the new year, the government must do what is needed to ensure we don’t have another unproductive decade.• Hetan Shah is executive director of the Royal Statistical Society"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5c35dbcb65f4632c63a880d6108b960f605ced8/771_0_3188_1913/master/3188.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ca36816897ef0ba2c61c19f6037958f","title":"net zero carbon neighbourhood to be built in south wales","story":"Residents of Parc Hadau in Pontardawe will generate more clean energy than they can useOne of the world’s first net zero carbon neighbourhoods will be constructed in Wales after Neath Port Talbot council approved the development of 35 homes able to generate more clean energy than they use.Development of the £8m project in Pontardawe in south Wales is expected to begin this spring. The residents of Parc Hadau will pay no energy bills because the development will use a mixture of renewable energy technologies to generate enough clean electricity to power its homes over the year.The two-, three- and four-bedroom homes will be equipped with solar panels and energy-storing batteries, ground-source heat pumps and innovative ventilation systems.Sero Homes, which was founded in Wales two years ago, said Parc Hadau would provide high-quality, affordable housing through long-term index-linked leases. It will also be the first scheme to meet the UK Green Building Council’s (UKGBC) definition of net zero carbon by tracking the development’s energy use and carbon emissions in real time.When Parc Hadau needs to draw on electricity from the grid, such as on cold winter nights, Sero will measure the carbon intensity of the imported electricity and later export enough clean energy in return to balance the overall carbon emissions.James Williams, the managing director of Sero Homes, said: “The principles underpinning our vision for housing are simple – people’s homes should minimise the harm done to our planet and they shouldn’t cost the earth to run.”The 11 two-bed homes, 22 three-bed homes and two four-bed homes will not be available for sale on the open market. Instead, Sero plans to offer the properties on long-term, index-linked leases to provide residents with security, without the large deposits needed to get on to the property ladder.“The current housing market is failing to achieve this, and Parc Hadau will bring to life, at scale, this vision for better homes for future generations,” Williams said.The Parc Hadau project comes almost seven years after the Treasury scrapped a policy that called for all new homes to be carbon neutral from 2016.The policy, first put forward in 2006 by the then chancellor, Gordon Brown, would have ensured that all new homes from 2016 would generate as much renewable energy as they would use in heating, hot water, lighting and ventilation.The Labour party’s recent election manifesto recommitted the party to net zero carbon housing, with a pledge to make all new homes carbon neutral by 2022.“The climate change agenda may have gathered pace in recent years and months, but the answers to these huge challenges are needed right now,” Williams said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04a6ee13b04452ec7b996cabc2dc60d85c7125f9/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3fa658ad563f91105cd0a59e90199fb2","title":"best movie moments 2019","story":"From an awkward scene with a knife to an A-lister’s comeback with the sounds of Fiona Apple,  writers pick their favourite big screen bits of the yearIn Ford v Ferrari (AKA Le Mans 66), Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) has been tasked by the Man in the guise of Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) to build a racer that can beat those rotten eye-talians who think they are better than us. Shelby can do it, but he needs Letts to get off his back with the rules and regs and let his genius soar! (Ayn Rand would love this movie.) After some comedic business, Ford winds up in the test vehicle alone with Shelby, who zooms him through sphincter-clenching turns at incredible speeds. When he slams the brakes, Ford sobs.At first you think the scene is just to mock the unmanliness of this pencil-pushing suit. Then it changes. Shelby’s velocity has so rattled Ford’s emotions he explodes in grief that his late father can’t see his name on such a powerhouse, and in deep sadness that he’s not a man of vision himself. He recognizes in Shelby everything he isn’t, and it floods out his eyes and nose. It is a weirdly tender moment, reminding us that even comedic baddies in a dad film are people, too. JHJennifer Lopez’s dazzling pole dance caused a ripple of gasps around the screening room where I saw Lorene Scafaria’s clever con movie Hustlers. It’s not just that J-Lo looks so great for her, or anyone else’s, age. And it’s not just that the moves required for this dance are so demanding, she later released a YouTube video of the rehearsals in which she gazed horrorstruck at her own bruised thighs. It’s mostly that it’s a very old-school star move: the flaunting of talent, professionalism and charisma that we associate with a routine by say, Fred Astaire. But also, Ramona is the film’s central enigma and this moment, her first appearance, sums up the movie.Her gymnastic display inspires something more tangible than mere lust: admiration (from an overawed Constance Wu), and financial reward. Ramona hugs those dollar bills close to her heart as she strides off stage. The choice of song, Fiona Apple’s Criminal, is as prophetic as her payoff line is prescient: “Doesn’t money make you horny?” PHA quote from Toni Morrison, some grainy analog establishing shots of the Coachella grounds, and then: it is time. The camera dollies up to a drum majorette who taps out a count, mean-mugs for a moment, and then blows her whistle to summon the demi-deity known as Beyoncé Knowles-Carter. The director of photography’s choreography works in perfect tandem with the dancers’ as one continuous shot pulls forward while they twirl out of the way to reveal Queen B, so resplendent and regal that both the nickname and the crowd’s slavering idol-worship of her instantly make sense.To the strains of a HBCU-styled marching band, she strides down a catwalk to the stage with one foot in front of the other to maximize the swing of her hips. She might as well be walking on water, so supremely in command of this massive spectacle that she reminds us why we talk about pop stars in religious terms. CBAs rapturous as the reception might have been for Noah Baumbach’s shattering orce saga Marriage Story on the festival circuit this fall, no one could have predicted its instant virality earlier this month when it landed on Netflix. But while Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson’s devastating argument became its most memed moment, it’s the lighter, yet still astute, set piece involving a court-appointed evaluator that made the biggest impression on me.It’s a perfectly calibrated sequence of awkwardness with Driver’s theatre director Charlie painfully determined to show that he’s a stable parent but knowing, as his soon-to-be-orced wife says earlier on, that outside observation “on any given day” would reveal flawed parenting. This tension lingers throughout as he tries to bury his instinctive reaction to his son’s gentle insolence while trying, unsuccessfully, to seek some humanity or humour from the unknowable visitor Nancy Katz, played hysterically by the standup comic Martha Katz. I’m not sure if another line has amused me this year quite as much as Charlie’s son asking him to “do the thing with the knife” over dinner in front of an understandably suspect Nancy and silently raging Charlie. Uncomfortably brushing it off, he eventually decides to explain his trick but it goes horribly, stomach-churningly wrong and he ends up bleeding profusely while trying, yet again, to pretend everything is fine. It’s gruesomely, outrageously funny and a reminder of Baumbach’s ability to make drastic yet effortless tonal switches. BLAt a graduation eve party in Booksmart, one of the most criminally underseen movies of the year, shy overachiever Amy (Kaitlyn Dever) sits on the floor in a crowded room, sloshing through the end of her drink and admiring an overconfident theater friend belt out Alanis Morissette’s You Oughta Know on a karaoke mic. Amy, out for two years but inexperienced, spends most of the film careening from confident and brash, in the presence of best friend Molly (Beanie Feldstein), to tongue-tied in front of Ryan (Victoria Ruesga), her crush of two years when Ryan hands her the mic halfway through the song, the sound cuts out a fever pitch of nerves. But then Amy crushes it, nailing the song’s ending and revealing to her classmates that, low-key, she can sing.When Claire Denis’s desolately beautiful science-fiction nightmare High Life premiered at the Toronto film festival, “the fuckbox scene” became a brief but intense meme for the few on film Twitter who had seen it: in a film that was hard to describe and distil as a whole, it was the salacious detail singled out to pique others’ interest. That’s a reductive way to tease a film prickling with so many layers of philosophical and sensual detail, but once seen in context, it’s also an entirely indelible image: Juliette Binoche, nude and scar-torn, entering a space-borne masturbation chamber, straddling a dildo seat and riding it until, as Lil Nas X might say, she can’t no more. Performed with abandon by Binoche and shot with visceral candour by Denis – making a tensing, thrashing map of the actor’s back alone – it’s one of the most extraordinary sex scenes in modern cinema: an expression of female erotic autonomy that outlasts any early quips about it in the memory. GLAri Aster’s Midsommar is a portrait of how a toxic relationship quietly, but surely, unravels. At first it’s subtle: Florence Pugh’s Dani frets that she overburdens boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor) with her own drama and mental health issues, and that her need for emotional support is unattractive. When her whole family dies suddenly, she’s desperate to hold on to Christian. She appeases. She apologizes. She stifles her cries after Christian and his friends subtly pressure her into taking shrooms, as specters of her dead sister haunt her.The whole film is about Dani feeling silenced and invalidated by a man who views himself as the saddled victim. That’s why it’s so weirdly refreshing when, in Midsommar’s terrifying climax, the Hårga women embrace Dani for who she is, cupping her face and encouraging her to sob as loudly as she wants. Crouched on the floor, they cry as one, and as their wails reach a communal crescendo, you see Dani finally finding some measure of healing. Sure, it’s a crazy Swedish cult, but there Dani finally finds someone who actually acknowledges her agony. GSThe quiet sentimentality of Lulu Wang’s charming sleeper hit shines brightest for me in a scene where twentysomething Billi (played by Oscar-buzzed Awkwafina) and her grandmother, Nai Nai, practice tai chi outside.Nai Nai coaches her granddaughter through some of the movements, lightly nagging Billi about practicing tai chi everyday in that cute, but kind of annoying, manner family members are known for. It’s obvious Billi has no plans of practicing tai chi after this scene and doesn’t deem it particularly useful. Then Nai Nai proudly and confidently credits the martial art for her continuing good health, a big smile on her face. Thing is: Billi’s grandmother has terminal lung cancer but does not know it. So Billi performs the tai chi movements with a renewed energy, owed to the strange mixture of guilt, sadness and stress she feels over the secret illness. She pushes out bad energy and inhales good, yelling out an awkward, meek “Hai!”An hour later, at the end of the film, we see Billi walking down the streets of south Williamsburg. She’s still upset over her grandmother’s cancer and visibly overwhelmed and stressed. Out of nowhere, she stops in the street, takes a deep breath and yells out a loud, reverberating “Hai!” The circularity of the moment – Billi going from disinterest in tai chi to seeking relief through it – highlights how our families can arm us with specific tools to handle the stressors of life. It reminds me of the hours me and my late grandmother would spend putting together 1,000-piece puzzles. As a kid, I was confident I would never take part in such a boring, odious activity as an adult. Today, it’s my favorite pastime. AWGenerally speaking, scenes in which lovers kiss and make up following an infraction are joyful affairs. They come at the close of a movie, following heart-rending misunderstandings that have left a happy ending in jeopardy. That’s not the case in The Souvenir. After months of casual, incremental borrowing to fund his heroin habit, Anthony (Tom Burke) stages a robbery at the flat of young girlfriend Julie (Honor Swinton Byrne). This is purely to bankroll smack – not the luxe trip to Venice they embark on soon after, which she pays for, and during which she twigs what he’s done.When they return to London, Julie asks and Anthony admits. But he’s not sorry. He’s wounded she has brought it up – his abhorrent behaviour compounded by this cavalier attitude. You’re shocked, and relieved – surely she’ll give him the boot?And she quietly forgives him. Anthony’s arrogance and obfuscation, his hurt words about only doing what he needs to, in a world she wouldn’t understand, which he’s protecting her from, fall on appalling open ears. Blame is smoothly shifted. Repentant Julie strokes his foot and forgets her heirlooms.Joanna Hogg shoots the confrontation in one static shot the couple sitting opposite in armchairs, until Julie bridges the gap. The viewer knew the truth would out – and assumed it would be a bigger scene. That it’s not moves the relationship into new territory. You can no longer underestimate Anthony’s actions – or his hold over Julie. The moment she reaches out in supplication is the chilling heart of a fairly scary film. CSIgnore the whys (the film-makers did) basically, it’s Keanu Reeves versus a bunch of faceless goons in a surprisingly tooled-up antiques shop, and for me, one of the most exhilaratingly gruesome action scenes in recent memory.It starts with a few gunmen, easily dispatched, but things really kick off when Reeves and an opponent realise they are in a corridor of glass cases packed with all manner of bladed weapons. So much glass-smashing, knife-throwing, shooting, stabbing, punching, kicking, grunting and limb-twisting ensues, you can barely keep track. It is brilliantly choreographed and executed, but what’s so great is how messy it all looks. And painful. Nobody is neatly killed. Knives miss their targets. The deaths get ever-more cartoonishly horrendous. And the scene ends with a flourish: the last, wounded assailant sits groaning in the foreground from way back down the corridor Reeves hurls a final axe, which, of course, hits its target – in the side of the head. The first time I watched this scene I laughed out loud in horror and admiration, which was kind of awkward as I was sitting on a crowded plane. SRPainfully clean-living as I am, I have never understood why so many films I like feature the consumption of heroin. Christiane F, Trainspotting, The Souvenir, Permanent Midnight – and of course, the champ: Requiem for a Dream. Now we can add another to the list: Pedro Almodóvar’s autobiographical reverie Pain and Glory. Now, most films posit heroin as a one-way ticket to the morgue, or at least to total social dysfunction for Almodóvar, though, it seems to be the next best thing to an after-dinner mint. His alter ego Salvador (Antonio Banderas) appears to handle it all with remarkable ease, using it to soothe his emotional worries and act as a vehicle for remembrance. Experiencers of the real thing may have a different view, but I presume Almodóvar knows what he’s talking about. It’s quite the eye-opener. APSydney Pollack’s “lost” concert movie Amazing Grace was finally brought out this year – showing the live filming in 1972 of Aretha Franklin’s gospel album of that name at New Temple Missionary Baptist church in Watts, Los Angeles. Franklin’s calm and restraint at the centre of this boiling cauldron of musical energy is compelling. The most startling moment involves her father, the Rev CL Franklin, who addresses the congregation and then, while Aretha is actually singing, he rushes forward to mop her brow. Was this the sort of thing he used to do when she was a little girl? Is it touching that he does it now? Or weirdly dysfunctional and coercive? Either way, it is a compelling image in a remarkable film.

Hooper admitted that he had barely finished the film, which cost $100m, before its New York premiere last week. said the effects used in the film would “haunt viewers for a generation”, while Rolling Stone said the film “easily scores as the bottom of the 2019 barrel”. The New York Times review said “a doctoral thesis could be written on how this misfire sputtered into existence”. US entertainment website the Ringer said the film was almost “an accidental masterpiece: not the Christmas blockbuster we need, but the one that we deserve” but adding that it was “too boring to get so performatively worked up about”.At screenings, “an agog silence dominated in London and New York cinemas, as critics struggled to process the images which had gone before,” according to the ’s film editor, Catherine Shoard, who pointed out that the sexualisation of the human felines in Cats made its U certificate surprising.Some of its stars mounted a defence. Jason Derulo, who plays Rum Tum Tugger, told TMZ that “reviews don’t matter,” and that “at the end of the day, the people are going to go see it, there’s going to be a deportation to another dimension.“When it came out on Broadway, it was the same thing. People were like: ‘What is this? This is something totally different.’ Any time that you defy the rules there’s going to be some pushback, obviously. It’s an incredible piece of art done by some of the best people in the world.”Universal did not respond to a request for comment from the ."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f9ede263c037f123697c02d475172365c32925d/650_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9601cb82f29f537de244dd46627123b3","title":"have you seen cats tell us what you think","story":"We want to know what you think of the film Cats.

Apparently set shortly after Captain America: Civil War, this also has meaty roles for Rachel Weisz and Florence Pugh, and is directed by Cate Shortland.Patty Jenkins follows up her smash-hit movie with this sequel which – as it says on the tin – is set in 1984. Gal Gadot is back as the Amazonian demigod, taking on feline nasty Cheetah (Kristen Wiig) and super-rich businessman Maxwell Lord (Pedro Pascal).A Suicide Squad spinoff built around the success of Margot Robbie’s Harley Quinn character, here leading a crew of femme vigilantes to protect a young girl from horrible crime boss Black Mask (Ewan McGregor).Angelina Jolie makes her MCU debut in a battle-for-the-ages saga: she’s one of the godlike alien beings (along with Richard Madden, Salma Hayek and Kumail Nanjiani) who protect humanity during the millennia-long conflict with the Deviants.After the slightly unexpected success of Tom Hardy’s alien-symbiote story, the Sony Marvel series was up and running.

One of my Twitter field reporters, Piya Sengupta, agrees: “Where I am from, this would be rare. Meat preparations are generally in a sauce to begin with. Leftovers might involve changing the gravy a bit, but you seldom have relatively plain cooked meat to cover with sauce to reuse.”In short, this will always be a very British kind of Indian-ish curry: a true fusion of culinary, if not festive traditions. It should be fairly quick and easy to make, too, and not require much in the way of fresh ingredients, fridge space being at a premium at this time of year. Using up other likely leftovers will score extra bonus points. So what’s the best way to make it?Most retro of all, as far as my guests are concerned, is the fruit content – as well as chutney, the sauce boasts apple and sultanas, the last of which, in conjunction with curry powder, instantly transports us back a couple of culinary decades. Not in a bad way, you understand this is pure nostalgic pleasure, but we agree we’d like something a little bit zingier to shake our palates out of their festive comfort blankets.One Tweeter, Richard Doxon, tells me that he made an “amazing” Anjum Anand turkey curry in 2010, but, tragically, the relevant copy of Sainsbury’s magazine disappeared into the recycling bin along with the recipe. Thanks to the magic of social media, however, he has now been reunited with it – and I get to try it for the first time. Anand prefaces this “flavourful but not spicy” curry by noting that roughly a fifth of Kerala’s population celebrates Christmas, though she admits turkey doesn’t tend to feature on the menu there. It is indeed flavourful, featuring a masala made from fennel seeds, peppercorns, cinnamon, cardamom and cloves, as well as mustard seeds, curry leaves, garlic, fresh ginger, turmeric and coriander, all in a coconut milk and tomato gravy, so it seems a shame to dilute these wonderfully aromatic ingredients with a pint of coconut milk at the end. Because the meat is necessarily just heated through, rather than cooked in the gravy as usual, this kind of curry does need a bit of extra help, whether by reducing the sauce or by adding extra seasoning or stock a few chillies, as Anand suggests in her introduction, wouldn’t be unwelcome, either, though, of course, this depends on who you’re serving it to.The other standout winner of our taste test comes from my colleague Meera Sodha, who describes her turkey curry with shredded brussels sprouts, caramelised onions and ginger as “more interesting than your traditional bubble and squeak … warming, spicy, healthy and tasty”. Leaving aside the vexed question of whether food has to be interesting to be enjoyable, she’s right: the cinnamon, cloves, ginger and nutmeg taste pleasingly festive and work brilliantly with the sweetness of the slow-cooked onions. It’s a wake-up for the tastebuds all right, but more like a stir-fry than the others: as one tester says: “Maybe this is me being a bit basic, but it would be nice to have some gravy.” Roast turkey breast can tend towards the dry, however skilfully it’s been prepared, so unless you’re lucky enough to have just dark meat left, a generous sauce is a good thing here.It strikes me, looking at the five curries lined up on the table, that what’s lacking is a tomato-based number of the kind we generally favour at home, albeit with the help of a jar of curry paste rather than Raymond Blanc (and before you carp, he’s been in the UK far longer than I’ve been alive, so if Mary Berry is allowed to make turkey curries, so is he).Blanc’s recipe starts with onion and garlic softened in large amounts of butter (so far, so French, I admit), but is then livened up with ginger, red chilli and more of the spices used by Anand and Sodha, as well as coriander and cumin. Most importantly, however, his tomato gravy is slow simmered before the meat is added, which means that it has an intense flavour all of its own enough, along with Sodha’s version, to convince us that tomato should play a large part in this particular recipe – if you’ve done Christmas right, you should have already eaten enough beige sauce to last a lifetime, or perhaps just the next 11 months of it.Though culinary traditions are among the most sacred and subjective of all festive matters, if you don’t have a favourite recipe for turkey curry, then this one, richly tomatoey and aromatic, yet creamy enough to have wide appeal, may well be the thing to give your leftovers a new lease of life. The sweet spices used by so many of the recipes above feel apt for the time of year, while the mild chilli heat can be adjusted to taste, depending on your audience. You can even make the base up to the end of the third step in the method several days in advance, then add the turkey, vegetables and dairy when reheating. Not only does this use up roast meat, but any sprouts or other greens you may have hanging around, as well as that half-jug of cream that’s been making eyes at you from the fridge for days. In fact, in the spirit of goodwill to all men, you could even add grapes from the cheeseboard.

Some then dust their drained spuds in flour or even semolina (*hard stares La Lawson*) to help them crisp up, but there’s no real need: so long as they go into very hot oil, they’ll go crunchy enough anyway.But enough of the culinary slebs, already: before we all reach for the Aunt Bessie’s, let’s ask some folk who actually make roasties for a living. According to Steven Smith, chefowner of The Freemason’s Arms in Wiswell, Lancashire, “When you think about it, the best part of a roastie is the bit submerged in fat, because it’s really crisp but stays all fluffy inside the bits that aren’t under oil often dry out and go rock-hard.”These days, Smith doesn’t actually “roast” his potatoes at all he deep-fries them. While that’s perhaps a bit much for the home cook – and the uncharitable among us may well be asking, “Isn’t that a chip, then?” – Smith does this because it ensures consistency he’s clearly on to something, too, because his pub is always up near the top of the annual Top 50 Gastropubs list. Anyway, he says, the cooking medium isn’t as pivotal as letting the spuds dry out properly first. “We put ours uncovered in the fridge overnight, to give them time to lose all the moisture they pick up in boiling.”Nathan Richardson, head chef at the award-winning Guinea Grill in Mayfair, agrees with an overnight dry, but “if that’s not possible, give them at least an hour to cool and dry before roasting”. This guy makes 200-plus portions each and every Sunday, so knows his way around a roastie better than most. “And give them a shake to rough up the edges only once they are cool, or you’ll risk destroying them entirely and ending up with roast mash.”As for the fat you use, take a leaf out of Delia’s book and match it to what you’re serving. Richardson uses dripping – “Why waste money on duck or goose fat when you can get a block of dripping for less than a pound?” – as befits a man who runs a kitchen famed for its steak, but whatever you use, he says, “It has to be smoking hot before the spuds go in, because it coats them better and prevents sticking.”It’s the finishing touches, however, that really set the professionals apart: Richardson dusts his roast spuds in dried thyme, rosemary, salt and white pepper, all ground to a fine powder, while Smith tosses his first in browned salted butter flavoured with garlic, thyme and rosemary before seasoning with yet more salt, rosemary and thyme.Finally, as everyone knows, the golden rule is always to make way more than you think you need, because few mouthfuls are more pleasurable than a leftover roastie straight from the fridge. “If I had my way,” Richardson says, “I’d avoid eating them with roast dinner at all. They’d make the perfect bar snack if only I could guarantee people wouldn’t ask me to heat them up.”• Do you have a culinary dilemma?

That run stretches back to October 2010, although it is even longer – September 1999 – since they were victorious at Anfield but he is hoping to kickstart his reign with a memorable win on 5 January.“I know how much the supporters of this club want to beat Liverpool and we don’t have long to wait to put the matter to the test,” Ancelotti said. “I would not describe a trip to Anfield as mission impossible, nothing is impossible in football.”That attitude is exactly what Everton fans want to hear, though Ancelotti’s ambition of taking Everton “into the top positions in the Premier League” may be described as bordering on the unachievable, especially in the four and a half years of his contract.“This season we simply want to be nearer the top of the table than the bottom, though this is an ambitious club and the long term goal is to be competitive in Europe as well as the Premier League.“We have to try to play attractive football, the fact the club is building a new stadium is a sign they have a clear idea of where they want to be and I’d like to be here when the ground is opened.”Ancelotti played down the possibility of bringing in free-agent Zlatan Ibrahimovic as one of his first signings. The striker was with Ancelotti at Paris Saint-Germain and speculation has persisted he might turn up at Everton for a last hurrah in the Premier League, though at 38 age is against him.“Zlatan is a good friend of mine, fortunately I have trained a lot of good players,” Ancelotti said. “He has finished his career in the USA and I don’t know what his next idea is, I’ll have to call him. If he wants to come to Liverpool to enjoy the city he can come but not to play.”Though Ancelotti is undoubtedly the most successful and famous manager Everton have ever recruited, he is keen to dispel the notion he has only ever worked with elite clubs. “I managed Parma in Italy and they are not a top team,” he said. “I am attracted to teams with ambition, that was what took me to PSG, and I get the same feeling here.“Everton want to improve and I want to help them. I want to bring happiness to the supporters. I know there have been a lot of times when this club didn’t win but I am sure we are going to be able to improve quickly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d074162fd5967fa6ee2c855b94409f728e059995/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fbe2553fdef803c363b5646d7fda2352","title":"premier league 10 talking points weekends action","story":"Leicester’s title hopes are fading, Danny Ings makes his England case and John McGinn’s absence is a huge blow for VillaAt this rate there is every chance two of the Premier League’s deadliest English strikers will not be part of Gareth Southgate’s squad at Euro 2020. Jamie Vardy is unlikely to be tempted out of international retirement and then there is Danny Ings, the Southampton striker who took his tally to 13 goals for the season with a double. Harry Kane, Marcus Rashford, Tammy Abraham and Callum Wilson may be ahead of Ings in the pecking order but seven goals from his past seven games means it is impossible to ignore the 27-year-old’s credentials for a recall. Ings’s only cap came against Lithuania four years ago under Roy Hodgson, when the striker was at Liverpool. “He is a typical No 9 in the box,” said the Saints manager, Ralph Hasenhüttl. “With his technique, there are not a lot of strikers who are better than him.” Ben FisherAston Villa’s misery over perhaps their most dispiriting defeat of the season was compounded on Sunday by the news that John McGinn suffered an ankle fracture during Saturday’s loss at home to Southampton and could be out for some time. The Scotland midfielder was forced off after only eight minutes after appearing to get his studs caught in the turf, and Villa suffered in his absence as Saints romped to a 3-1 win. Along with Jack Grealish, McGinn is Villa’s most reliable creative talent and it means the likes of Wesley, Trézéguet and Conor Hourihane need to step up for their upcoming festive fixtures against Norwich and Watford, both of which Dean Smith’s side need to win and require dynamic attacking performances, not least because Villa’s defence continues to look flaky. Tom DaviesIt was the match with the fewest shots in Premier League history, and it felt like it. That is not to say Bournemouth v Burnley did not have its plus points, such as the physical commitment of two well-drilled sides, but what there was only served to shut down goal opportunities further. For Bournemouth this was an immediate concern, with the home side taking more risks for no reward and ultimately another defeat, their sixth in seven matches. But it’s also a longer-term worry. After Watford, Bournemouth have scored the fewest goals in the ision. The underlying stats suggest that total is not unfair. Last season Eddie Howe’s side made hay time and again through the combination of Callum Wilson and Ryan Fraser but that spark has not come back. The team look short on ideas and attacking alternatives they need to find some, and quickly. Paul MacInnesNot long before Roberto Firmino was scoring for Liverpool in the Club World Cup final, the closest thing Sheffield United have to the Brazilian was missing a sitter at Brighton. But, as ever, David McGoldrick made a big contribution to his team’s victory. His intelligence, dynamism and finesse make him a key factor in their rise up the table. And one of these days he will score his first Premier League goal. “The roof will come off when he does,” Chris Wilder said. “He makes us play, he makes us tick. Out of possession, in possession, he’s a really good player. Another one we got who was going nowhere and he’s absolutely fantastic for us. The majority of fans know what the game is about … and if he was a pretender our punters would have definitely found him out and isolated him. And he isn’t. The roof will come off when he scores. It’s coming.” Paul Doyle“There’s no point kidding ourselves,” Duncan Ferguson said, “we are at the wrong end of the table.” Carlo Ancelotti is known as a lover of the finer things in life, not just in football, and the immediate worry as a new era dawns is that despite fielding Richarlison, Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Cenk Tosun and Moise Kean in the same game Everton went 90 minutes without a shot on target. The new manager is likely to want to spend in January, so where should he start? Another striker would only add to an already long list, when a lack of creativity might be the real problem. André Gomes is injured and Alex Iwobi limped off early against Arsenal, while Gylfi Sigurdsson does not look fully recovered from his spell on the sidelines. Ferguson has shown there is spirit, it is now up to Ancelotti to try to introduce a little sophistication. Paul WilsonLeicester have played four away games against last season’s top six and from them they have taken only one point. It’s true that they might have got a draw at Liverpool but they were poor against an uninspiring Manchester United at Old Trafford and they were well-beaten by Manchester City. The positive is that they have got four of their toughest games out of the way in the first half of the season – and they did beat Tottenham and Arsenal (if they can really be classed as a ‘big six’ side any more) at home. But this result should perhaps serve as a check to expectations about them. They are not – yet – a side equipped for a serious title challenge and, just because their form through the autumn suggested something extraordinary might be possible, a top-four finish would still represent a remarkable achievement. Jonathan WilsonCold statistics said Miguel Almirón had failed to score and contributed one assist since his £21m move from Atlanta last January but those numbers failed – spectacularly – to highlight how very good the Paraguay playmaker is. Against Palace, amid joyous scenes rarely witnessed at St James’ Park in recent times, he finally broke his duck, volleying the winner against visitors let down by Wilfried Zaha’s habit of sulking whenever colleagues failed to give him the ball. In contrast, Almirón is an ultimate team player who blends high-calibre nutmegs and talent‑laden first touches with serious elbow grease. “Miggy’s bloody good,” said Newcastle’s manager, Steve Bruce. “He’s a great pro, popular. Physically he’s huge in what he does for the team, his running, so you want him to succeed. He’s a joy to work with. I’d break down the door to get another player as good as him.” Louise TaylorOne week ago Wolves had Tottenham on the ropes but failed to land the finishing blow. This time it was Daniel Farke’s turn to rue his team’s missed opportunities. “Should be three or four goals,” he said, sighing. He was correct. Norwich dominated Wolves in the first half thanks in large part to the most astonishing first-half performance from Emi Buendía. But Wolves weathered the storm, taking advantage of rare poor finishing from Teemu Pukki to drag themselves back into the match. Adama Traoré continues to be relentless and the goalkeeper Rui Patrício kept them in it but their collective spirit was most impressive. Setbacks are inevitable in an exhausting season and it is how Wolves react that will decide how high they can finish. The fortitude Nuno Espírito Santo’s team have shown this season is encouraging. Tumaini CarayolJosé Mourinho cannot do much about the inidual mistakes that resulted in Chelsea’s two goals – apart from replace those who committed them in January. What is more achievable in the short term is ensuring Tottenham are better in possession of the ball and can keep it. With Eric Dier and Moussa Sissoko occupying the centre of the park, it is unlikely they are going to utilise the ball with requisite speed and incisiveness for Spurs to threaten top opposition such as Chelsea. With Harry Winks and Christian Eriksen settled on the bench, Spurs’ midfield watched as Chelsea popped the ball around and through them to open up the lead, while the hosts mainly wasted what little of the ball they saw. Having forward players with the talent of Lucas Moura, Son Heung-min, Dele Alli and Harry Kane is pointless if they are given so few sightings of the ball. Will UnwinOnce Paul Pogba was introduced, Manchester United became a different proposition. Or at least in attack their defence were still being pulled apart by opponents who had scored only nine previous goals this season. During the first half, United’s forwards received little service from a midfield where Scott McTominay and Fred were being dominated. Jesse Lingard missed the sole chance, chipping over rather than placing or powering past Ben Foster. It was the latest demonstration of a player struggling badly since his heady World Cup summer of 2018. Pogba replaced Lingard with United two down and 34 minutes left to play, and soon created space, angles and danger. But can that really be seen as a positive for United when Pogba’s future remains opaque? Without him, United are bereft of creativity unless the opposition allow them to counterattack.

And because of that, because there are so many, it’s getting progressively harder to figure out what these letters stand for, an exception being the N-word, the original initial word. Others, though, aren’t so easy, especially when they’re written rather than spoken.Take the B-word. The first time I read it, I went through the alphabet in my head, thinking Bisexual? Blind? Brexit? Bitch, I was told, is what it stands for.This is what’s called “gendered language”, and should be replaced with the same word you’d use for a man: asshole, as in, “That Kellyanne person I saw on TV is a real asshole.” In front of children you might say “A-hole”, but that doesn’t make this the A-word: that’s a television show about autism.The abovementioned C-word can be used for a vagina, cancer, someone of Chinese origin, or, new to me and, apparently, that woman in London, commitment. Fail at it, and you might be in for what many fundamentalist websites refer to as the D-word: orce. Fundamentalists have also laid claim to the E-word: evolution.The G-word is gypsy. Gay people have the F-word – faggot – and are now toying with the H-word. This stands for homosexual, which was perfectly acceptable a few years ago, but is now considered a slur, just as “gay” will eventually be, now that we’ve rebranded and are presently queer, which used to be the Q-word but was reclaimed. Perhaps we can donate it to the Quakers, a handful of whom might have been referred to at one time or other as “Quakes” and are still not over it.So many of the words people object to are just shortened versions of the original. It’s fine to say that someone is Japanese, but lop off the last two syllables and it becomes hurtful – the J-word. Ditto Pakistani. Trans is an acceptable abbreviation of transgender, but jazz it up with an added Y and it becomes the T-word.The first time I went to Sydney I was struck by the way Australians abbreviate things. It was January, “Jan”, they called it. That’s summer there, and at an outdoor market I saw a sign reading “fresh strawbs”. It made the word so ugly. What do people do with the time they saved by not saying “erries?”, I wondered.Most rebrandings go in the opposite direction and become longer rather than shorter. One-syllable black sprouted into seven-syllable African American. Homeless person is now a “person experiencing homelessness”. Handicapped – another H-word – doubled its length with physically disabled. The R-word changes so frequently I honestly don’t know what it is now, though I bet it’s a real mouthful for those who used to be called the R-word. I recently spoke to someone who works for a non-profit, and was advised to no longer say two-syllable “felon” or “convict”. The new term is “justice-involved inidual”. I’ve seen the I-word used to mean “immigrant” and, by our president, who seems to hate them, “impeachment”. The K-word is taken, used as it was by the KKK against Jewish people. I first heard the L-word on a podcast hosted by a sex columnist. A polyamorous woman phoned to say she’d been seeing a man outside her marriage. “I established boundaries right from the start,” she said. “This was to be about sex, with no emotional attachment.” The relationship had been going on for months, swimmingly, until he used the L-word. I was listening to the podcast in the bathtub, and thought, lesbian? That’s still OK, isn’t it?“Love,” the woman said, bitterly. “He told me he loved me.”The host was sympathetic. “That piece of shit!”“Honestly?” I said to my bath water. “Love is the L-word?” I thought of the man she’d been sleeping with outside her marriage, the one being vilified, and couldn’t help but feel bad for him. The woman wanted it to be all about her C-word, while he was thinking commitment.• If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine’s letters page, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78dac2e5668e18b55c179a5d88ec312393a3bdaa/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=17d07f42ca5a78b25da19806e8c343ab","title":"gloria steinem meets gloria allred prince andrew","story":"The feminist activist and the US attorney trade notes on the president, Prince Andrew and abortion, then and nowGloria Steinem, 85, is a feminist icon, in trademark black leather trousers and turtleneck top, hair streaked blond and back straight as a ballerina’s. Gloria Allred, sitting beside her on a green velvet couch, is, at 78, small and ferocious, one of the best-known attorneys in the world, with a four-decade history of defending women’s rights and an avowed “fangirl” of Steinem. We are in Steinem’s house on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, where the women have convened to talk about recent high-profile cases brought by women – many of them represented by Allred – against Harvey Weinstein, Jeffrey Epstein and Bill Cosby, as well as the forthcoming US presidential election, attacks on abortion legislature, and the history of women’s rights in the US.The women’s careers exist, to some degree, in tandem, with Steinem’s decades-long work as an activist changing public consciousness that Allred may then convert into victories in court. Hers has been a controversial career, defending victims of sexual harassment in class action suits, and going after powerful men in a way that has occasioned accusations of publicity-seeking. When a high-profile story breaks featuring allegations of sexual misconduct against celebrated men, Allred’s name is often not far behind. But she has also won victories in hundreds of unglamorous suits that represent the grunt-work of legal activism. In 2004, Allred successfully filed the first lawsuit in California challenging the state’s ban on same-sex marriage in 2008, she secured a $15m payout for 200 women in an anti-age discrimination suit against a giant electronics chain. This month, she won a sexual harassment case against Alki David, a billionaire accused of harassing a former employee. And so it goes on.The styles of the lawyer and the activist couldn’t be more different. Steinem is softly spoken, unsurprised by anything at this point, and very much gives an impression of occupying her own astral plane. Last month she released a new collection of quotes and essays, The Truth Will Set You Free, But First It Will Piss You Off. Allred is sharp, energetic and poised always to pounce or defend. On the subject of her daughter, Lisa Bloom, a lawyer criticised for defending Weinstein, she says, “I let Lisa, who has a different law firm from mine, speak for herself. And she has spoken for herself, and continues to do so, and I’m very proud that she does.” Where Steinem and Allred meet is in their history of successfully prosecuting a feminist agenda, and their ability to retain a sense of humour about it.Gloria Steinem Bill Cosby and Jeffrey Epstein had town houses across from each other just two and a half blocks from here. While Epstein was alive, I thought we should have a street demonstration between the two houses – cordon off the blocks and say, we’re taking back the streets!GS But after he was no longer here, it didn’t seem... seemly.GA We’re still pursuing his estate. Last week, our legal team filed three lawsuits on behalf of our clients who alleged that they were underaged girls when they were sexually victimised by Mr Epstein, and at least two of them were sex trafficked by him.GS In his plane? Not that it matters.GA No. These are serious cases, and we filed them in New York. There’s a wonderful new law in New York that provides for adult victims of child sexual abuse – you have a one-year window to file lawsuits against the accused. Now, many of the victims of Jeffrey Epstein, who perhaps would have been barred by previous laws from having access to the courts, are filing law suits.GS And the case just got moved from Florida to here that was also crucial, because there were a lot of cases that, due to the corruption of the Florida system, had not been pursued.GA You’re very right. It’s really important to them, very empowering to them, to know that they can still seek justice, even though he is deceased.GA Thank you! It is clear to me that Gloria – I’m going to call you Gloria number one –GA Well, not for that reason, but Gloria has been in it longer than anybody I know, and with more vision, and more activism. I call her the Philosopher of the Movement. I’m more like the soldier on the battlefield.GS You’re the grand legal strategist!GS You’re the person who makes the system in which we live responsible. The rest of us are protesting against the system, but it’s not the same as getting justice.GA I think both are absolutely necessary, because what you do has an impact on the court of public opinion – to create a climate in which change is possible, probable, and will happen. Because unless the public knows what is wrong, what is happening to women, there would be no need for legislators to correct that wrong by passing new laws.So it’s been a progression. And I think only with the populist cases you have brought, and the #MeToo movement, has it become a majority consciousness that it’s wrong. Because otherwise it was blamed on the victim. What were you wearing, why were you there, what did you say, what did you drink, etc?GA Well, the reason that we have laws against sexual harassment, is because sexual harassment is considered a form of sex discrimination – it’s the denial of equal employment opportunity. And that is the law of our land, that women are entitled to enjoy equal employment opportunity sexual harassment interferes with that enjoyment. It places a woman in a no-win situation: does she go along with it, and then he may get tired of her, and then she loses her job? Or does she not go along with it, and then he goes into ego-shock and she loses her job?GS It turns work into prostitution in order to continue to get paid you have to put up with this unwanted sexual attention.But actually the first case after the passage of the law was a man against a woman, in California. Remember that? It was the employee of an executive woman who she was requiring to go to bed with her, and she won the case.GA Well we’ve had a case that’s similar, many years ago, representing a man against a woman boss. He was employed at a very large grocery chain in southern California, and the jury found that he was not sexually harassed. However, they also decided that he was retaliated against for protesting against the sexual harassment and was awarded, I believe, $16m.In any event, we’ve always said that of course men are also entitled to protection from sexual harassment.GS I’m happy to say that what we haven’t had yet is the case of a woman against a woman.GS Never mind. Forget I said it.GA Let me put it this way: we settled those cases confidentially, so we haven’t tried them. Most cases are settled confidentially. And this is true not just of our cases – most cases are settled prior to going to trial.This week we represented a woman who was sexually harassed, she alleged, by Alki David, the billionaire, in the work place, and the jury found in favour of us for $8.25m for our client Mahim Khan, and then awarded $50m in punitive damages against Mr David – which are damages to punish the accused for conduct that shocks the conscience of the community.The point is, it’s accountability, it’s empowerment of women, and it’s a very exciting time in the #MeToo movement.GS But I still don’t think we have a popular understanding of why we have this problem: because we live in a patriarchy, and by definition that means men control women’s bodies as the means of reproduction. Before Europeans showed up here, the systems were matrilineal not patriarchal, and rape and sexual assault were virtually unknown, because power was equal. So it’s comforting to me to realise that it’s not human nature, that it wasn’t always this way – and it won’t always be this way.Some reporters have said, “She silenced her clients.” So let me try to be concise and clear: I stand by the fact that every woman, and every man, has a right to choose whether she wishes to enter into a confidential settlement, by which she will be compensated and make that wrongdoer accountable to her. And it is her choice. It’s a voluntary process and I am very disturbed by anyone who wants to take away that choice. Not everyone wants their mother, their sister, their brother, their community to know they were raped, sexually abused as a child, sexually assaulted, whatever. Some people think it might hurt them in their next job if they were known to have sued someone in their career path. And let me put one last line on that no confidential settlement can prohibit a victim from going to the police, asking that criminal charges be filed against that same perpetrator. They can still do that. What’s more, they can still testify in someone else’s civil lawsuit, if they are subpoenaed.GS They can’t initiate that suit –GA They can’t file a lawsuit themselves, but through the confidential settlement they’re saying I don’t want to file a lawsuit, I just want to resolve this now. I want to be able to get a settlement, which may be as much as, or more than they would get going through three or four years of litigation. Using words like “hush money”, or that an attorney silenced them – it’s voluntary, they can say no.In the Kavanaugh case, I think the accuser was much more believed and Kavanaugh was much more disbelieved, but the votes were already there, because that’s the nature of the people who were sitting in Congress. The public consciousness is evolving, and part of the reason why is because of Gloria and other leaders of the feminist movement. It wouldn’t have happened if there was no speaking out.GS It’s always that way, with racism, with sexism, with antisemitism: it’s perceived as natural, inevitable and justified, until people stand up and say, wait, this is unjust. When I was growing up in the east side of Toledo, if a woman was beaten up by her husband they said, what did she do wrong? And the goal of the cops was to get the couple back together again.GA I hate to say it, but sometimes people still say that.GS But now we have laws. We didn’t even have a term for it. There was nothing. So it’s a process. Consciousness comes first then describing it in terms of personal experience then describing it in terms that enter into the law then prosecuting.GA I’d definitely be interested in taking Ms Maxwell’s deposition in a civil law suit. I’ve also been saying Prince Andrew needs to voluntarily come forward and speak to the FBI. He’s got to do this without conditions, without delays. Because he did stay with Epstein in his New York home in Palm Beach in the Virgin Islands. He has information. GS If we didn’t have wombs, we’d be fine. It all stems from that. The definition of patriarchy is controlling reproduction. And it becomes even more important when there’s race and racism, because in order to maintain racial separation and racism, you have to control reproduction. So those two things are always intertwined. There’s no such thing as trying to uproot racism without also uprooting sexism, and vice versa.GA The issue of reproductive rights and who controls a woman’s body is so essential now, because it is being challenged. There are a lot of legislators all over the world who are still trying to control women’s bodies.GS In the southern states it’s still very connected to racism. The white nationalists are very upset that white women are not having as many children as women of colour and therefore hastening the day when we will no longer be a majority white country. As if that mattered. But it matters to them.GA I was a person who had to have an abortion prior to Roe v Wade. Women like me had to go to people who gave back-alley abortions, who were not licensed health care providers, and I haemorrhaged and almost died – some did die, from illegal abortions. I had to be taken to a hospital with a 106-degree fever, packed in ice, and the nurse told me – and this was after getting pregnant from a rape in Mexico – the nurse told me, “Well, I hope this will teach you a lesson.”So I said, many years later, it did teach me a lesson: that abortion should be safe, legal, affordable and available. This is a key issue and you, Gloria, started to speak about this in, what, the 60s?GA I’ve heard that there are some cemeteries near convents in which foetuses have been discovered. It may be that some nuns have gotten pregnant.GS We have seen a wave of disclosure about sexual abuse of children by priests. We haven’t yet seen nuns, and that’s going to be huge.GA Yes. I predict that could happen. I represented a woman in the 80s. She wanted to be a nun, she was 16 years old, very religious, and we alleged that she was sexually abused by seven Catholic priests and had a baby by one of them. It’s a long story, but I pursued the church for 23 years, and ultimately we were able to get her a great settlement. By litigating our case, it raised consciousness.GS Well, the fact that the church imposes celibacy is ridiculous. And as Catholic historians will tell you, it’s because the church didn’t want to share whatever the priest was going to inherit with the family. That’s where the requirement of celibacy came from.GA I’ve read that. They wanted them to leave their property to the church, not to their children.GA We cannot tolerate four more years of Donald Trump. It has been a catastrophe, and I’m actually very conservative in my use of that word. But this is a catastrophe for the country. He has packed the federal courts with judges who are incompetent and not qualified, and in many cases these people have extreme rightwing views. And of course, because there’s a senate majority, the Democrats can’t stop it. But the chronic lying the shame he has brought on the country the damage worldwide. The very anti-women policies of this administration the roll back of civil rights for minorities, the Latinos and how they’ve been attacked.GS He was not elected president.GS He has made us woke, that is his only good purpose. He has shown us everything that’s wrong with the country at a high level.Also, he has helped us to get rid of the electoral college. At least 14 states have already rejected the electoral college, which you can do by constitutional amendment but it’s a very long process. So what’s happening is that states are voting to give their electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote. And at a certain point that makes the electoral college academic.GA That is very interesting.GS Because the electoral college was a requirement of the slave states in the first place.GA And of course Hillary Clinton won three million more votes than Donald Trump, popular votes. The only other good point for those of us who want a different administration, is that it has really mobilised so many of us.GS Because I travel so much, I see that. I’ve never seen the degree of activism, ever, in my life.GS People who didn’t even vote before are now running for office. It’s amazing.GA We are going to see, in the coming year, more women being brave. We have the Harvey Weinstein trial starting on 6 January. I feel that, both in the political arena and in the judicial arena, women want to be constructive. They want to help to empower women and make sure men are accountable, politically or in the courts. 2020 will be a good year for women – and we should mention it’s the hundredth anniversary of suffrage in this country. So we will see a lot of activism reminding everyone that women had to fight to win the right to vote, just like in the UK with the Pankhursts – my mother’s from England. We want people to get out and use the vote.I’m sure, Gloria, you’re going to be involved in that effort.GA We want Gloria leading the charge to vote!GS Voting is a very local, regional, door-to-door process. So each of us has to say: not only am I going to vote, I am going to sit with my neighbour’s kids while they vote. I’m going to make sure everybody in my block votes. We don’t exist if we don’t vote!• If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine’s letters page, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4b67a7e0802daa5993a5648506349403e951b5d/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e603343b9d3c7cd58b0cb92be6302af3","title":"worst trends decade ranked 2010s","story":"From social media trends to TV reboots and ugly shoes, the trends of the 2010s were full of questionable ideas and purchasesIt’s a truth universally acknowledged that everyone loves horoscopes except straight white dudes and me. But can we all just admit it’s a drag? Mercury being in retrograde is not why you were late to work this morning.You may have thought we were long past the days when magazines had “resident astrologers” but astrology has been growing in popularity over the last decade, hitting peak superstition in the last few years.People give varied explanations for their rise. Some say young people, bereft of hope, are turning to spirituality to feel good again. The result? People now post flatshare adverts excluding people based on their star-sign we’re not far from birth charts being used in interviews and can we all please stop slut-shaming Sagittariuses? (I mean it! Zodiac-shaming is a thing!)In the next decade, let’s put horoscope back in the dark ages where they belong. PNIn Shirley Jackson’s 1948 short story The Lottery, the inhabitants of a small town gather every year to randomly stone someone to death. If only Jackson had known about Twitter. It’s much more efficient.One recent Twitter pile-on started when a woman in South Dakota questioned the literary merit of a young adult (YA) novel her alma mater had considered assigning as student reading. The book’s outraged author – and her friends, successful writers who ought to know better – spurred her fans into a mob, which hounded her onetime critic into hiding.It seems fitting that the worst online witch-hunts often involve the YA literary community. After all, many YA novels are set in sinister, near-future dystopias, so readers feel naturally at home on Twitter.But today’s stone-throwers are often tomorrow’s targets. Does that never occur to them? Or, to paraphrase Winston Churchill, do they feed others to a crocodile, hoping it eats them last? JOCStyle-wise, we made some weird calls in the 2010s. It was the decade of fast fashion, of festival wear, of the forehead donut (you didn’t forget the forehead donut, did you?). Yet throughout, the trend we truly, most consistently went ham for was ugly shoes.We may have been losing our minds, but at least we were supporting our arches. Oh yes, our feet were comfortable in the 2010s – but at what cost? AMIt is one of the bleaker ironies of the decade that even as trust in technology companies plummeted, tens of millions of Americans invited Google, Apple, Amazon and Facebook to install always-on listening devices in their homes.A quarter of US adults now have a “smart speaker” in their homes, a truly astonishing example of our collective willingness to trade privacy for marginal convenience. (Is finding out the weather in the morning without picking up your phone really worth the risk that a contractor for Amazon is currently judging whether or not your girlfriend is faking her orgasm?)And that’s just the surveillance that consumers are subjecting themselves, too. The other half of the equation is the vast network of smart doorbells and security cameras that homeowners are increasingly training on unsuspecting neighbors, pedestrians, delivery people, and trick-or-treaters. Thanks to Amazon’s aggressive courting of law enforcement agencies, Ring users are being deputized into a deeply dystopian public-private spying partnership.The unexamined life may not be worth living, but the un-surveilled life certainly is. Do yourself a favor and start the 2020s by dumbing down your home. JCWThe inventors of the Instant Pot are geniuses. They took ye olde pressure cooker, one of the least sexy kitchen appliances of all time, stuck the word instant on it, and presented it as some kind of revolutionary new product. There’s now one in basically every millennial kitchen, including mine.Within about five minutes of buying it, I realised I’d been had. There’s nothing “instant” or simple about it at all. The thing has about 90 buttons on it and is vastly more complicated that cooking food the old-fashioned way. “But you can make yoghurt in it!” its acolytes roar. Yep, if you have 12 hours to spare you can. You can also just buy yoghurt from the shop. And don’t even get me started on its “oatmeal” setting.If you need a bulky and expensive gadget to make porridge, you and the Instant Pot deserve each other. AMLike a sweat-wicking, four-way-stretch plague, athleisure spread across the world in the 2010s. A style trend for people who want to suggest they are just about to do 90 minutes of hot yoga on a bike but are too lazy for buttons, no brunch is now complete without a posse of unathletic poseurs trussed up like gaudy sausages in eye-popping hi-tech fabrics.Where did it start? Some blame yoga – and why not? – but people have been doing yoga for 2,500 years without $138 Inner Expanse Lululemon leggings and a $52 Free to Be Serene bra. Will it ever end? No. Athleisure respects neither age, physique nor gender – Lululemon plans to double its mens sales by 2023 and Under Armour has firmly established itself as the premier fashion brand for men who prefer to look like giant toddlers.But athleisure does get one thing right. By sending confused signals – simultaneously screaming “I am going to the gym” and “I have given up” – it’s the perfect uniform for our age of anxiety. DRThis decade of self-optimization has terrorized us with a myriad of trends meant to bring us to the best version of ourselves. Perhaps none is more insidious than the trend of “clean eating”, whose amorphous contours leave adherents constantly in search of virtuous new super foods, usually hawked by some better version of ourselves vlogging their dinner to their followers.The truth is you will never eat “clean” enough. You will only be caught in a spiral of perpetually more extreme diets, eliminating more and more foods that don’t make the cut, until you find yourself evangelizing the benefits of eating only raw beef or bananas.In 2020, unsubscribe from the madness, settle back with a glass of wine and allow yourself a few chips. It will induce more happiness than the most virtuous acai bowl. JGIf you haven’t cocked your head slightly to the left, wine glass in hand, clinking glasses in a cheers motion, back and forth on repeat, did you even drink said wine? Is your kid even cute without that cat filter on their face?If you have had to ask yourself these questions, you’re not alone. Face filters weren’t made in the last decade – people have been taking sepia-toned photos since the beginning of being alternative – but the 2010s was the decade in which face filters ruined everything, including your self-worth (some cameras automatically blur over your imperfections when you try to take a selfie).Mystery over the ageing process has also gone out the window – if you want to know whether bae is a keeper in 2019, just whack their photo into FaceApp. At least we have worked out some of life’s most pressing questions, like: I wonder what I’d look like as a man. PNNo one asked for a Full House reboot starring suburban moms with first world problems like Aunt Becky. Not even the Olsen twins would touch that dumpster fire of a TV show with a 10ft pole.The idea of rebooting your favorite show or movie is nice in theory, but this decade we have seen the negative effects of clinging to nostalgia in flops like this year’s Charlie’s Angels and 2014’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (yikes).Live-action Disney movies could have been incredible had they not matched the animated films frame by frame. I felt like I paid $17.50 to watch the Animal Planet version of The Lion King in a theater. Likewise, 2019’s Aladdin was a cringeworthy crossover of Bollywood and B-roll footage from Homeland (Arabs and Indians are not interchangeable, Hollywood).I still carry a torch for Ethan Craft, so I haven’t quite ruled out Lizzie McGuire 2.0. Yet I fear if it’s anything like the Gilmore Girls reboot, A Year in the Life, I will walk away confused, disappointed and questioning my taste in television.The wise baboon called Rafiki once said: “It doesn’t matter. It’s in the past.” And that’s exactly where these series and movies should stay. ESViral tourism is a great example of how Instagram has completely warped our collective sense of reality. Thanks to the rise of travel influencers, we now have too many people flocking to the same beauty spots in places such as Arizona, Iceland, Thailand and California – sometimes with disastrous and destructive consequences.Tourist hotspots have always been a thing – there are photos of the Victorians posing in front of the pyramids. But there’s still something profoundly sad about how specific and repetitive holiday pictures have become, with many taken in the exact same place, at the same angle and with similar filters. And if you have ever been to any of these places where nature has gone viral, you’ll notice that many visitors spend more time experiencing the place through their phones than not. What’s the point? MBA brief glance through the decade’s films show we have had more than a passing interest in cults. But joining an actual cult has downsides: alienation from loved ones, orgies, poverty, ingestion of strong hallucinogens and even mass murder (although, in fairnesss, some of those could be seen as upsides).So it’s perhaps no surprise that many of us decided to join a more palatable form of cult, in the form of specialised exercise classes. CrossFit, SoulCycle and, most recently, Peloton offered the charismatic leaders, creepy evangelism and clean living of certain cults – and, if we’re going deeper, a belief system in society’s where religion is on the decline – without the bit where you have to kill people (having a heart attack on a stationary bike doesn’t count).Instead, save your money and go for a run. Or join an actual cult – they’re free! TLThis decade’s social media challenges have always had strange, masochistic elements to them, whether it’s the deceptively hard cinnamon challenge, the potentially fatal fainting challenge or the truly messed up Tide Pod challenge (and who can forget the Momo challenge?).There were altruistic offshoots like 2014’s ALS ice bucket challenge, which was arguably the biggest of them all. It did a lot of good, but unfortunately it was something of a Pandora’s box, as it was the first to get the attention so many celebrities – leading to some of the most painful name-dropping and showing off of the decade.Without the ice bucket challenge, there probably wouldn’t have been this year’s bottle-cap challenge, which wasn’t raising awareness of anything – you just had to kick the cap off a bottle. It was entertaining the first couple of times, but it quickly became a highly competitive clout-off for celebs, reaching an obscenely luxe nadir when Kendall Jenner posted it while riding a jet ski against a soft pink sunset, captioned: “you asked for it @haileybieber…”” MBHere’s a dumb thing to spend a lot of money on: water, but with bubbles. Seltzer water used to be a treat now it feels like a human right – two of my former workplaces provided it free of charge in unlimited quantities.That leaves us with the most important flavor of seltzer there is: late capitalism.

He commutes a long way to work each day and as we have two young children, we are considering moving to the town where he works. Property there is more expensive, but the schools are good and the children would benefit from seeing more of their father during the week. Ideally we would like to make a step up and buy a detached family home, which in the area we want (where there’s a school we like) would cost about £725,000. We would need to borrow £325,000 to do this. I am a stay-at-home mum but my husband earns £48,000 per year plus about £8,000 in commission.I have heard about mortgages where you can borrow more than the typical 3.5 times annual income which we would probably need to apply for. We feel we can afford to stretch our finances to take on the extra borrowing as we have no other debts or loans and have some savings in the bank. We could accommodate the repayments in our monthly household budget. Can you please advise us on how to access these type of mortgages, where do we find them and how can we maximise our chances of being approved for the mortgage loan?XFBut the main hurdle in getting any kind of mortgage is showing that you can afford it and also that you could continue to afford it if interest rates went up. The fact that you have no other debts and money in the bank will definitely help as does the fact that childcare costs are not a drain on your finances. But whether those things will guarantee that you’ll secure the mortgage you want is quite another matter. Because you are looking to borrow in a pretty niche part of the mortgage market, it would make sense to use a specialist mortgage adviser who can knows which lenders – some of whom may not deal directly with the public – will look favourably on your situation and so can help tailor your mortgage application accordingly.

She has so far remained silent since the election.Others who could stand include the Wigan MP Lisa Nandy, Tottenham MP David Lammy, and home affairs committee chair Yvette Cooper. Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, had been tipped as a candidate but will reportedly stand instead for deputy leader, on an unofficial joint ticket with Long-Bailey.The inquiry, styled as “an independent commission to learn the lessons of the 2019 Labour general election campaign”, is separate from any of the leadership campaigns, and hopes to involve groups within Labour such as the Corbyn-backing Momentum and the centre-right Progress faction.Panel members will take evidence from defeated candidates in seats lost by the party, and from those in target constituencies. The inquiry will also hold focus groups and “listening events” with the public in seats that were lost speak to organisers, councillors and activists carry out a survey of party members, and analyse election data.Organised jointly by LabourList, the independent news website focused on party issues, other panel members include LabourList editor Sienna Rodgers, James Meadway, a former adviser to McDonnell, Marcus Roberts from the polling organisation YouGov, representatives from Common Knowledge, a workers’ co-operative, and others yet to be announced.The aim is to “take a balanced view of what happened in the campaign, aiming to bring the Labour movement together so that it can come to a collective view of what needs to change to make the party electable again”, according to a statement announcing the plan.Powell, the Manchester Central MP, said: “We have lost the last four elections and we all have to accept that our offers to the country have been insufficient.“We should have taken the time to understand our losses previously. It’s now profoundly important for the future of our party and country that we take a real and meaningful look at why we have fallen short.“This inquiry gives us the opportunity to listen to members, candidates and the public and I hope our whole movement takes it in the spirit it is offered and takes part.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/711c11429e39ce49167131b214b088d22ad8da83/0_28_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=382273fc2cab431cbef9d60ad466e717","title":"a tale of two cities londons rich and poor in tower hamlets","story":"Canary Wharf’s corporate towers look down on food banks in ‘borough of contrasts’ Jane and Noel have never met. They probably never will, even though they go about their lives within sight of each other.Jane is a 30-year-old mother of five. On the Thursday before Christmas, Jane walked through the pouring rain to a food bank in a Salvation Army church in Poplar, east London. She is unemployed and has had her benefits stopped as she waits to be transferred on to the government’s “simplified” universal credit system. She won’t get her first payment until 20 January.Noel Quinn is the interim chief executive of HSBC. He spent his Thursday morning running one of the world biggest banks from his office on the top floor of HSBC’s global headquarters in adjacent Canary Wharf. Quinn is the frontrunner to be appointed permanent CEO. His predecessor, John Flint, was paid £4.6m last year, and was in line to collect a maximum of £11.9m this year.The panoramic view from Quinn’s luxurious office suite takes in the Salvation Army church, where Jane is telling her life story to case workers at the First Love Foundation food bank as other volunteers pack up bags of food to help her through the next month with no money coming in. She turned down some of the more expensive foods on offer, saying: “There are people more in need of it than me, save it for them.”Jane, who recently had a miscarriage and suffered years of domestic abuse, is living in a two-bedroom flat. “The two little ones are in with me,” she says. “The boys share the other room, and my eldest daughter is on a pull-out bed in the lounge.” Her daughter suffers from congenital incontinence, and hasn’t had a dry night in a decade.The father of her 10- and nine-year-old boys took his own a month after the younger boy was born. Jane says he was struggling with self-esteem issues because he thought he couldn’t properly provide for his family. The father of her youngest two children subjected her to years of domestic abuse, and stole child support income to feed his heroin and crack cocaine addiction. He is now in jail.The local authority, Tower Hamlets, began public law outline (PLO) proceedings, the start of the formal process to consider taking her children into care. She fought back, and has kept custody of them, but social workers still make regular assessments.When Jane is switched over to universal credit she is likely to be hit by the benefit cap and see the total she receives fall by £346 a month. Jane will also be hit by the two-child limit on child benefits. She is already struggling to pay her rent and is thousands of pounds in arrears.She is on the council’s waiting list for a four-bedroom home, but has been told to expect a 14-year wait. More than 20,000 families are on the waiting list in Tower Hamlets – almost one in six of all households in the borough. A more realistic option, for Jane and others with larger families, is to arrange a housing swap with a council outside London.Jane had stopped eating in order to scratch together enough money to feed her children. It shows. She is painfully thin and has lost several of her teeth, a sign of malnutrition. “I go without food,” she tells Denise Bentley, the co-founder and chief executive of the First Love Foundation. “You’ve got to sacrifice to ensure your children don’t go hungry.”Jane tells Bentley that she has gone for weeks at a time only eating bread, because it momentarily makes her feel full. More than 3,500 bankers – mostly working in Canary Wharf or the City of London – are paid more than £850,000 a year, according to data published by the European Banking Authority (EBA). Thirty bankers were paid more than £8.5m and one asset manager collected £35m. HSBC said it supports community investment programmes across the UK, including the East London Business Alliance and Cardboard Citizens, which are based in Tower Hamlets. It did not state how much money or time it contributes. Barclays said its staff volunteer for the First Love Foundation and had donated 50,000 food items.The First Love Foundation provides food to 150 people in crisis every month. An additional 200 people will receive a cardboard box Christmas hamper and presents for children. “But our mission is to not have any more clients to feed,” Bentley says. “We want to solve the underlying problems that have led people into crisis.” Most of the problems, she says, are caused by the introduction of universal credit and public spending cuts. At the centre, clients are given help and support with housing and ensuring they are getting all the benefits they are entitled to.Rachel Blake, the Labour deputy mayor of Tower Hamlets, says the crisis facing Jane and thousands of others in the borough and across the county is due to “the Conservative government’s decade of austerity and cuts”.“The benefit system is completely and totally broken, and we have a housing crisis,” she says. “Universal credit should be scrapped, now.”Blake says the council is “taking a stand for our residents” and has pumped £6.6m into a “tackling poverty fund” supporting 834 people with housing payments and with cash to help those struggling with the five-week wait to switch to universal credit.“The food banks are papering over the cracks, but residents should not be reliant on the kindness of strangers,” Blake says. “We need a social security system that works for everyone.“We know we are a borough of contrasts,” she says when asked about the proximity of the global banking headquarters to the food bank. “The characterisation of London being wealthy doesn’t ring true to our residents – the inequalities could not be starker.”Jane hasn’t really considered the gleaming towers of Canary Wharf that are literally casting shadows over the food bank as she makes her way home with a trolley full of food. “I know they must be making a lot of money up there, but they must have worked very hard to get there and have good qualifications,” she says. “Good luck to them, I say. Merry Christmas.”The First Love Foundation has been overwhelmed with long-life foods, but financial donations can be made here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc418fcc6822f4f1957f59fda176e8dd6bcd141b/53_25_3253_1953/master/3253.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7967d91c41e9035d73c229786743ee7","title":"jawdropping moments 2019 england win cricket world cup","story":"The finish combined drama and terror, outrageous reversals of fortune and the utter confusion of a dead heat after a dead heatFive months on I can still remember all of it. But never all of it at once. It returns, instead, in fickle flashes and brief bolts. Martin Guptill knocks the ball to midwicket and scampers for a run. England need 15 to win off four balls. The sunlight is golden and glorious. Ben Stokes slides desperately for his ground, bat outstretched. New Zealand win the toss and bat. Jason Roy gathers the ball. The sunlight is golden and glorious. I want to vomit.Anyone who tells you the 2019 World Cup final was the greatest game of cricket played has probably not seen enough cricket. It is forgotten now what a drab spectacle it was for the most part: played on a terrible, sticky Lord’s pitch producing two tortuously low scores. But in one important sense it was utterly unsurpassable: the sheer, bewildering theatre of two teams wrestling each other on the narrowest, most hazardous of precipices.So, in my mind at least, the World Cup final does not appear as a linear narrative, because it makes no sense as a linear narrative. In a way it makes no sense at all. Now, with hindsight, we can rationalise it with numbers and awards and packaged videos but no scorecard or montage will ever quite capture the drama or the terror, the outrageous reversals of fortune, the utter confusion of a game whose defining character was a lurching, teetering chaos.Consider, by way of example, those last three overs: the final over of England’s regular innings, and the two Super Overs bowled by Trent Boult and Jofra Archer. Has a game of cricket packed so much simple, logic‑defying turbulence into 18 (legal) deliveries? In those three overs, ning around 40 minutes, the initiative changed hands – depending on your interpretation – at least four or five times. The Stokes six over midwicket. The stunning ricochet off his bat for four overthrows. The run-outs of Adil Rashid and Mark Wood. Jos Buttler’s four off the final ball of the Super Over. Jimmy Neesham’s towering six into the Mound Stand, reducing New Zealand’s target to seven off four balls.This was a place cricket had never been before. The rhythms of one‑day cricket generally militate against the tight finish: either the run-rate spirals out of control or the chasing team saunter to their target against a demoralised attack. In tennis the alternation of service games generates an innate cut and thrust that over time tends towards the protracted and epic. Cricket, on the other hand, is a game of purple patches and dominant streaks, where the team with the initiative generally cement it.Which is why, to seasoned observers of the game, this particular finish felt so unorthodox, so unreasonable, so thoroughly beyond the realms of the possible. We all know, or at least we think we do, that a team requiring 15 off the last four balls does not win and certainly not a team addled by four decades of existential angst and the pressure of home advantage. England mess it up again: this was a tale we all knew off by heart and this base note of fatalism inflected everything that followed.But in the other camp, a different song was playing. The Black Caps fall gallantly short again: this has been the refrain of New Zealand cricket since its inception and as Stokes chipped away at their advantage, first through brute force and then through blind luck, this was the parallel analysis swiftly being assembled. We all know, or at least we think we do, that a team requiring 16 off six balls doesn’t win, certainly not on this surface, against a bowler of Archer’s boundless skill and steel-plated nerve.Then came Neesham’s brilliant, shocking six. Then two more runs (via a misfield), then two more. Suddenly New Zealand needed three off two, or possibly two off two, because even in the press box nobody could quite be sure of the rules. For a vast number at Lord’s that evening only England’s celebrations on taking the final wicket ultimately gave the game away. A dead heat at the end of a dead heat, the biggest prize of all decided by a rule nobody knew in advance. Only cricket has the power to mess with you like this.Perhaps it should have ended as a tie: Eoin Morgan and Kane Williamson awkwardly clasping the trophy, an image that would have been beamed around the world. Then again, perhaps the recent Turner Prize and Booker Prize backlashes teach us something about our abhorrence of an unsatisfactory fudge. Sharing the trophy would have suited the moment but not the wider context: nobody goes into a contest wanting or expecting the spoils to be shared. However cruel, however irrational, it felt right for somebody to win and somebody to lose.Still, has any triumph felt simultaneously so predestined and so precarious? England winning the World Cup felt like such a logical culmination of what had come before it: the nadir, the four-year plan, the renaissance, the crisis of faith (and it’s forgotten, in the aftermath of the Sri Lanka and Australia defeats, just how close their campaign came to disaster). Yet when you watch the tape back, you still feel as if Roy’s going to fumble it, that Stokes is going to get out. It all just feels so crazily fragile, like the evanescent memory of something you still can’t quite believe happened."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58c52b5a058f5f876985370e83c13080f2d5b9fb/0_138_5754_3453/master/5754.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5bbe723aeeaa2e8353b57435f7f7e48e","title":"rugby cricket stop the tour peter hain apartheid south africa","story":"Hain, the former Labour cabinet minister who sits in the House of Lords, looks out of his Millbank office on a cold but sunlit December morning. The Houses of Parliament are just across the road and here, in the heart of the British political establishment, his white South African accent remains clear as he reflects on demonstrations that dented apartheid. Hain was 19 in 1969 when he confronted white South Africans in the sporting arena to highlight the brutal injustice of apartheid. He became a despised figure in his home country and among conservative British society.“It was startling but I soon realised it came with the territory,” Hain says. “There was no social media in 1969, so it came in different forms of a vicious kind. It started with letters written in green ink and led to direct threats to kill me.”A new film called Stop the Tour, a powerful documentary by the director Louis Myles, captures the impact of the protests. It also explains how Hain’s motivation was to block the South Africa cricket tour of England in 1970 – and how the touring Springbok rugby team became a dress rehearsal of vehement anti-apartheid protests from early November 1969 to late January 1970.I was an eight-year-old boy living near Johannesburg when that tour ended and it was the first time I realised the outside world hated South Africa. Our white suburban lives were shaped by racism and privilege and it needed the sports protests and eventual boycotts to force boys like me to wonder what was wrong with our country.Hain was a bogeyman in white South Africa and so, 50 years on, with our shared background and enduring love of sport, it feels evocative we should meet a month after the Springboks won the 2019 Rugby World Cup with a black captain, an Afrikaans coach and a truly mixed team picked on merit.The 1969 protests marked a seminal moment in the rise of the anti-apartheid movement in Britain. It needed another 25 years for Nelson Mandela, who was a friend of Hain’s parents, to become South Africa’s first democratically elected president. But the global struggle against apartheid gained impetus from Hain’s actions.“It was decisive,” Hain says. “When the anti-apartheid struggle was only on the news pages it could be dismissed by white South Africans but when you stopped their rugby and cricket teams it hit them right in the gut. They were shunned by the rest of the world politically but their cricket and rugby teams were feted in sports stadia around the world. I was cricket-mad and a real Graeme Pollock fan – but I knew sport was the one arena where we could expose white South Africans.”Hain’s critics condemned him for mixing “sport and politics”. Yet sport, like everything else under apartheid, was deeply political. “My brother and I were football-mad youngsters although we went to Pretoria Boys High – a rugby-playing school,” Hain says. “Our local team was Arcadia Shepherds. We supported Arcs every Saturday they were at home. My mom and dad would somtimes come with us and we’d go to the ground with black friends involved in the anti-apartheid struggle. Then we’d separate because there were white and black sections. The black section was vociferous and full of the most partisan cheerleaders for the all-white Arcadia Shepherds.“In 1962, they brought in a proclamation to ban black spectators from white stadia. But these guys shinned up trees overlooking the grounds, so they could see the game. The police used alsatian dogs to pull them down and they were dragged away screaming in agony, with blood pouring from their arms and legs – just because they wanted to watch their football team. The horror of it burnt deep into my memory. So the idea of politics not being mixed with South African sport was a complete absurdity. Yet we were repeatedly accused of bringing politics into sport.”Hain’s parents were arrested for their work against apartheid and served with banning orders – a Kafkaesque sentence where they were effectively under house arrest. Rather than being frightened, Hain’s family circumstances forged in him “a determination not to be beaten, a determination to keep fighting the cause in whatever way I could. This meant supporting my incredibly courageous parents.”When his father’s political work cost him his job in 1966, the Hains were forced into exile in England. “None of us wanted to go. We were leaving our friends and never coming back. That was the pain of it. We went to England by boat and sailed past Robben Island. The Cape rollers threw the boat all over the place and I remember looking at Robben Island and thinking, ‘What can it possibly be like for Mandela and his comrades?’ They were only two years into their prison sentence and I was just 16.”Three years later, in London, Hain resolved to lead direct action against South Africa’s cricket tour of England in 1970. He had been galvanised by the South African government’s refusal to allow the England team to tour in 1968 – because they called up Basil D’Oliveira as a replacement. D’Oliveira had been born in Cape Town and classified as a “Coloured” who could not play cricket in white areas. He left South Africa and forged a new life as a cricketer in England.“Having been barred from South Africa because they included a ‘non-white’ player in D’Oliveira the English cricket authorities issued an invitation to the South Africans three months later to tour in the summer of 1970. I was outraged and issued a statement saying we’ll stop this tour by direct action.“Then we realised the rugby tour was happening and decided to use it as a dummy run. From the opening match, which was switched from Oxford to Twickenham at the last minute in an attempt to defend the ground against demonstrations, we made huge news. That continued through the 25-match tour from Manchester, Leicester, Edinburgh, Swansea, Dublin, wherever the Springboks were due to play. We mobilised local anti-apartheid groups which gave it an enormous power.”Hain and the South African cricket historian, Andre Odendaal, have written a book about that campaign called Pitch Battles: Protest, Play and Prejudice which will be published next May. The resonance of his work against apartheid is felt even more acutely this week as the first Test of England’s cricket tour of South Africa begins on Boxing Day. And memories of the Springboks winning the Rugby World Cup are still so vivid. How did that victory make Hain feel – exactly 50 years on from his 1969 campaign?“We can’t say that it healed the nation but it was much more significant than 1995 – when Mandela wore the Springbok jersey. Very few blacks supported the Springboks in 1995. By 2019 the whole nation supported them. But it’s a struggle unfulfilled. As a boy, Siya Kolisi, the World Cup-winning captain, went to bed starving in his black township. He was plucked out of that abject poverty because of his rugby potential. Huge change is still needed in South Africa. You’ve got to constantly press for it. So there is unfinished business in South Africa.”Hain’s home is now in Britain and he smiles when I ask him what his 19-year-old self would have made of him being Lord Hain with an office deep in Westminster? “He might say, ‘What happened to you?’ My answer to the 19-year-old me is that I’m still really him. I continued the same struggle, for the same values, in different settings.“I always replied, saying, ‘Thank you very much but please understand the values that motivated me to speak out against corruption today are exactly the same values of integrity, morality, justice and equality that motivated me to stop the 1970 cricket tour. I hope that, in the end, they agreed.”Stop the Tour is on BT Sport 2, Saturday 28 December, 7.30pm.

And it is not the first time they have proved themselves incapable of sustaining it. Brilliance and defeat. It is one sure sign of a collective in turmoil, knowing they should be in a better place than they are but consistently freezing just as they threaten to attain it. And then the sight of their equable director of rugby, Geordan Murphy, who in his day represented the very definition of coolness above a storm, dissolving into a finger-pointing fury with one of Welford Road’s own further hints at a meltdown in Leicester’s core. Which will out, the brilliance of the personnel or the unprecedented pressures of life at the bottom with a team like Saracens in pursuit? These are strange times. Michael Aylwin“Christmas is cancelled” was how Dai Young summed up his feelings after watching Wasps throw away a 17-point lead against Harlequins, and it was hard not to sympathise. He has been at the club since 2011 and it clearly hurts him deeply to see Wasps so lacklustre for large spells in their festive fixture in front of a bumper crowd. With one win from six matches, Wasps are now in a similar boat to Leicester. A side who have won the Premiership title six times are now nervously looking over their shoulder because in all likelihood Saracens, now up to -13 points, will catch both of them. They meet each other in the middle of February, when internationals will be focusing on the Six Nations, and tantalisingly in early May. Worcester and London Irish can still get dragged into it, but already those two fixtures are looking significant. Gerard MeagherNext Sunday, the Premiership will see its biggest match of the season so far when Saracens visit Exeter, and not just because it involves the sides that have contested the last two play-off finals at Twickenham. The Chiefs have been the most vocal of the champions’ critics following their fine and points deduction for breaching the salary cap regulations, and there are unlikely to be any seasonal greetings from the hosts. Exeter have won the last three Premiership matches between the sides at the ground but, with Sarries set on survival rather than the play-offs, they have little scope for error, still 17 points adrift at the bottom. All the more so because they face being without at least 12 players for all or part of the Six Nations during which six matches will be played. Fairness does not end with the salary cap. A play-off for the bottom four? Paul ReesLouis Rees-Zammit turned in a performance for Gloucester against Worcester that has everyone on both sides of the Severn talking. Rees-Zammit scored two tries and set up another as he continued to add to his burgeoning reputation in Gloucester’s 36-3 win. He is quick, very quick, and big enough for senior rugby too, despite being not turning 19 until February. He is also Welsh, as he pointed out on social media after the match, and while he could in theory qualify to play for England in future on residency grounds, his destiny is in red rather than white. The question now is whether Wayne Pivac will pick him for the Six Nations. Pivac spoke of how he wanted to make better use of Wales’s exiles programme recently. What better way to do so than include Rees-Zammit when he names his squad in the new year? GMNorthampton lost their place at the top of the Premiership following their sixth defeat at Sale in their past seven league visits. Exeter and Gloucester are the only visiting teams to have won in the league at the AJ Bell Stadium in 2019 and with Saracens battling at the other end of the table, the Sharks are aiming for a top-four finish. “I think we’ve got a squad to operate at the top end of the ision,” said their director of rugby, Steve Diamond. “The top four at Christmas was always a target. We go to Bath next and who knows where we can be in the next fortnight.” Diamond is used to operating on a budget some way below the salary cap, but not this season when, for example, he has to keep four international wings happy. Paul ReesIt was only last month that London Irish were hammering Leicester 36-11 and making a bit of a statement about their Premiership potential this season. If they serve up any more turkeys like their 38-10 home defeat to Bath, however, they will be swiftly dragged back down into the dogfight at the bottom of the table, with Saturday’s game at Worcester suddenly assuming extra significance. It does not help that their All Black wing, Waisake Naholo, will not be back from New Zealand – where he is attending the birth of his first child – until the middle of January. On top of that, Ireland international Paddy Jackson has now pulled a hamstring. The club’s director of rugby, Declan Kidney, has been around long enough to know one bad day is not necessarily the end of the world but, equally, Irish are now finding the Premiership is relentlessly tough. “With the way the league has gone so far, everybody is beating everybody,” said Kidney. “Worcester will be hurting, they had a similar result to ourselves and will have an extra day’s turnaround and home advantage. It will be a big challenge but we knew every game would be this year.” Robert Kitson"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75156406c766f3aee2496d97303ef99312f544b9/0_93_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a24a26f14ac2d38294237d43dcd089cd","title":"finger flickin good subbuteo through the ages in pictures","story":"With Father Christmas’ visit imminent, no doubt many a christmas list he received will have featured Fifa 20 but in yesteryear it was Subbuteo that was the must-have football game for youngsters across the country"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eee5543a72e359a6c65881722593599b8bd24b1b/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41bbe5d903d51f944ff70f2cd6cbf227","title":"ten years black twitter watchdog","story":"From Black Lives Matter to #OscarsSoWhite, the decade would not have been the same without black voices on social mediaThere is power in numbers. No internet subsection displayed this fact better than Black Twitter, which touched nearly every sphere of American culture and politics this decade.In the 2010s Black Twitter become a cultural force to be reckoned with. It promoted Black Lives Matter and raised awareness around the tragic deaths of Sandra Bland and Eric Garner through hashtags such as #SayHerName and #ICantBreathe. Its anger over Kevin Hart’s homophobic tweets pressured him to drop out as a host for the 2018 Oscars ceremony. It pressured Pepsi to retract and apologize for a Kendall Jenner-fronted commercial accused of co-opting the Black Lives Matter movement. It created hundreds of delightfully viral moments such as “eyebrows on fleek”. And it helped a wild 180-tweet thread – in which a stripper recounts an adventure-filled road trip to Florida – become an A24-produced, feature-length film.“I would absolutely say this decade wouldn’t be the same without Black Twitter,” says the UVA professor Meredith D Clark, who is currently writing a book on the internet subsection. “But I also think it was a continuation of our larger relationship with black American communities. Black culture has been actively mined for hundreds of years for influences on mainstream American culture.”The thrill and intrigue of scrolling through Black Twitter often crossed cultural and racial lines. “At the risk of getting randomly harshed on by the Internet, I cannot keep quiet about my obsession with Late Night Black People Twitter, an obsession I know some of you other white people share, because it is awesome,” Choire Sicha wrote for The Awl in 2010, before “Black Twitter” had become the accepted moniker.Defining Black Twitter continues to be difficult. The meaning is slightly amorphous, but it refers to a particular collective of black identities and voices on Twitter taking part in collective, culturally specific jokes and dialogues that affect the community – from discussing colorism to dishing out jokes about common “black mom” phrases.The Georgia Tech professor André Brock says Black Twitter allowed mainstream, white culture an unprecedented glimpse at how black people talk and joke among each other. “It was one of the first spaces that white people could see how creative black people are with our discourse, and how we used a technology that wasn’t originally designed for us.”One of the first viral Black Twitter moments of the decade came in response to the documentary Kony 2012, a 30-minute YouTube film that looked at the kidnappings of Ugandan children by a guerrilla group and efforts to find them. The video received over 120m views in only five days and redefined what “virality” meant, with donations towards the cause quickly surging.However, members of Black Twitter were some of the first to criticize Invisible Children, the charity behind the film, for its sources of funding and misleading reporting. The critiques were surprisingly nuanced for a social media space, some citing the call for donations as another incident of “slacktivism”, a term used for low scale, “feel-good” displays of charity. Invisible Children’s campaign quickly faded in popularity, and the charity later struggled to survive after its viral moment.This would be the power of Black Twitter over the course of the decade – a diligent, occasionally merciless watchdog for problematic behavior.Calling out cultural appropriation was a chief focus of the space in the early 2010s. Celebrities such as Taylor Swift, Katy Perry, Kendall Jenner and Miley Cyrus were critiqued (and roasted) for adopting traditionally black hairstyles andor dances. Its ability to prevent major business deals would also be flexed. In 2013, Black Twitter’s outrage was largely responsible for corporations ending their affiliations with chef Paula Deen after she admitted to using the n-word. Later, a juror from the 2013 George Zimmerman trial lost out on a major book deal when Black Twitter voiced disapproval. Users were able to directly put pressure on the juror’s literary agent, Sharlene Martin. “You know that the stains from blood money don’t wash off, right?” one user wrote at the time.Here are just some of the celebrities and companies Black Twitter “cancelled” this decade: Roseanne, Pepsi, Meghan McCain, Gucci, Don Lemon, Iggy Azalea, Karamo Brown, Jeffree Star, Jussie Smollett, Kevin Hart, Kanye West, TI, Jay-Z, the NFL, Gina Rodriguez, Emma Stone, Scarlett Johansson, Chris Brown, Matt Damon.Brock says the litany of “cancellations” that occurred on Black Twitter this decade were not simply rooted in anger and outrage, as media outlets frequently depicted them. They were moments of catharsis. “People who have been affronted or hurt or wounded finally had a voice to make gatekeepers take notice,” he says.Clark says the subsection is not a monolith, but actually composed of numerous, small personal communities and networks, which then band together “when an incendiary event or something that triggers discussion occurs”.Clark argues the term Black Twitter often led to racial biases (ie, depictions of the group as an “angry mob”) during media coverage. “Whenever you put ‘black’ in front of anything, people think it’s deviant from what’s mainstream. I think that led to a lot of confusion for folks who were outside of Black Twitter. The term doesn’t necessarily signal the cultural richness we found within the space.”Black Twitter has its roots in the low-tech forums and blogs of the early aughts.Brock says, prior to 2010, black-centric blogs would try to pressure mainstream media into covering underreported topics, like 2006’s Jena Six case (which saw activists protesting the excessive charges six black boys faced for beating a white classmate). Lipstick Alley, BlackPlanet, OkayPlayer, Crunk and Disorderly – these sites were digital watering holes for early black internet users. However, their presence was nowhere near the scale or visibility of Black Twitter. “Blogs couldn’t talk back to media in real time the same way Twitter can,” Brock says. “That ability to talk back to corporations and media, and for the talk back to be visible is what distinguishes Black Twitter from previous incidents of black communities online.”During the 2010s, Black Twitter would prevent the tragic deaths of Trayvon Martin, Tamir Rice, Sandra Bland and too many others from being glossed over by news outlets. It proved the power of a hashtag through well-crafted digital campaigns. One study found that the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter was used over 1.7m times in the three weeks following a grand jury’s decision not to indict the cop who killed Michael Brown.However, there were downsides to the immense attention.April Reign, who started the popular #OscarsSoWhite campaign, says media companies often surveilled the space, looking for ways to report on the black community without actually engaging with it. “It’s hard when you see someone who is having a profound discussion about a particular issue, and a media outlet will extract all these tweets and put a sentence at the end and call it an article,” she says. “That person got paid for ‘writing the story’ and the media outlet got paid through advertising dollars for someone else’s tweets. The person who wrote the tweets never sees a dime.”This would be a frequent problem throughout the decade, brands adopting popular phrases and jokes born in the space for advertisements. At 16, Kayla Newman had her “eyebrows on fleek” saying popularized through a re-circulated Vine video and became slang for “flawless” and “perfection”. Kayla’s unique saying was used by brands like Domino’s, Ihop and Denny’s in advertising – without her ever seeing a dime.“I gave the world a word,” Kayla Newman told the writer Doreen St Felix in 2015. “I can’t explain the feeling. At the moment I haven’t gotten any endorsements or received any payment. I feel that I should be compensated. But I also feel that good things happen to those who wait.”There would be numerous occasions where Black Twitter’s lexicon provided new terms for popular culture: “thot”, “bae”, “cuffing season”, “throwing shade”, “lit”, “turnt up”. The exchanges were fun (even if they were often misused by white people), until companies began using the slang to sell T-shirts and other miscellaneous products online.Of course, there were also major winners from the space. For the lucky, success on Black Twitter could be monetized. Lil Nas X – who broke boundaries as an out gay, black man in rap and country – mastered the arts of memes, retweets and follows to make his song Old Town Road an unexpected viral hit. Lil Nas X was allegedly able to go from running a Nicki Minaj stan account, under the handle @NasMaraj, to Grammy-nominated artist. (Lil Nas X has not confirmed running @NasMaraj, despite reporting, urls and time stamps strongly suggesting he did.)Meanwhile, the social media accounts of fast-food chains like Popeyes and Wendy’s connected with audiences – and sold product – through lifting phrases and slang from black and gay communities on Twitter.As 2019 comes to an end, the power of Black Twitter is being demonstrated through the 2020 presidential campaigns. Joe Biden’s story about CornPop, a racially charged pool confrontation in the 60s, provided the basis for numerous memes. Kamala Harris’ virality on Black Twitter was so strong that Maya Rudolph, while impersonating Harris on SNL, joked “Mama needs a GIF!” to boost her poll numbers. And conversations about reparations – once thought of as a far-fetched, in-group topic – were held by major candidates.Brock believes the outsized influence and visibility of Black Twitter will continue through the 2020s. “As much as people complain about Twitter, it has a mindshare wildly out of proportion with its user base,” he explains. “I don’t see a service that offers that same level of access, distribution, and open conversation on the horizon.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/575e85cac409e4b23a0cbb45d0ebe050ef37232e/176_5_3085_1853/master/3085.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=482e3495d7b481b6819d1e5878ab7338","title":"christmas new years day boxing day swim run to join in","story":"These bracing swims, runs and games, many on Boxing Day or New Year’s Day, are the perfect kick-start after festive indulgences – with live music and fancy dress, tooWhat better way to shake off indulgences of New Year’s Eve than donning your Santa suit and having a little dip in the ocean.

You have to be from Kirkwall to take part but hundreds of people watch, following the ruck, or just drinking in the pubs. To win, the Uppies, those supposedly born south of the cathedral, have to touch a wall in the southern part of town with the ba’ (a cork-filled leather ball) while the Doonies (born to the north of the church) have to hurl or kick the ba’ into Kirkwall Bay, to the north.

Our writer takes his two-year-old behind the scenes at the studio seeking to capture its furry magicHas a tiger come to tea at the Lupus film studios? No, but an equally disruptive guest has turned up. There are dozens of people beavering away on each floor of this smart London townhouse – animators, producers, artists – when my two-year-old daughter Romy arrives for a sneak preview of what they’re working on: an animated version of Judith Kerr’s beloved children’s book, The Tiger Who Came to Tea, which turned 50 last year.Providing a rampaging toddler doesn’t accidentally unplug all their computers, the animated story of Sophie, Mummy and the unexpected stripy visitor who eats and drinks them out of house and home will air on Channel 4 on Christmas Eve. But rogue two-year-olds are not all the team has had to contend with.Three months ago, says producer Ruth Fielding, the colouring process was proving so time-consuming she doubted they had the money or time to finish it. The swift recruitment of 20 students from Middlesex University solved that problem. There was also trouble over a scene from the book that shows the tiger picking up a teapot and pouring scalding hot tea straight into his mouth. “We had to add a line for Mummy that says, ‘Be careful, it’s a bit ... hot!’” says Fielding. “It makes for a comedic moment, but it was actually borne out of Channel 4 worrying that it could be classed as imitable behaviour.”There was also, more sadly, the death of the story’s creator, aged 95, in May. Kerr had been very involved: advising on the script, approving the cast, even chipping in on the precise shade of red used for Sophie’s coat. And, before all this, Lupus first had to convince Kerr they were the right people to bring her story – which has sold more than 5m copies – to the screen. The hand-drawn aesthetic that made their version of We’re Going on a Bear Hunt such a treat helped their case, while the fact that Kerr was allowed to weigh in on the film was doubtless another factor.“Initially, there were a few more lines for the tiger,” says Robin Shaw, the director. “She wasn’t having any of it – and she was bang on. The Tiger only says two things in the book, but you don’t ever feel he’s lacking in presence or character. The minute you put words in his mouth, he becomes someone else.”Shaw hit it off with Kerr: they’d talk endlessly about pencils, lines, the use of perspective. He remembers telling her how clever it was that the Tiger’s eyes are always perfectly aligned with the vanishing points and the focus of the page.“And she said, ‘Oooh, really? I didn’t realise I’d done that.’” says Shaw laughing. “It was all natural for her.”Was it hard to carry on after she died? “Of course it was sad she wouldn’t be there to see it finished. But, in a strange way, it was motivating– it made us want to do an even better job.”It’s time to take a tour of the building. Romy has been temporarily distracted by a tea party the team have put on for her, so I sneak out with line producer Adam Jackson-Nocher. He shows me a vast storyboard pinned along the corridor, with each panel colour-coded to show where they’re all at. It’s head-spinning stuff. There are 20,000 inidual drawings – all needing sketching, tidying, colouring and finessing – to make this 24-minute film. Technology plays a part – a nifty brush has been designed to paint instant furry tiger stripes – but for the most part it’s drawn by hand.The team talk me through a scene where the “camera” is looking down from the ceiling, spinning around as buns tumble towards the table. Computer-generated animation would speed things up here, but it would also give everything a consistent “correct” look – and that is not how Kerr drew the book. Entire kitchen units would change or even disappear with a turn of the page, depending on how Kerr wanted things to look.To make this charming inconsistency work, an 80-strong team had to draw under strict guidance, each fully understanding not just how the tiger should look but how he moved and what sort of character he was. “He’s the Roger Moore of tigers,” shouts Shaw from across the room. I laugh but it turns out he’s serious: “He breezes in, affects everyone’s life, manages to get exactly what he wants, then breezes out again leaving everyone feeling kind of used but happy with that. He’s a seducer, a charmer. He’ll only do something if he wants to, and will only give something if it looks like he might get something in return. Completely selfish, but in the nicest possible way.”It’s time to test the magic, so we head back to the tea party room for a screening. Things get off to an unpromising start when I walk in to find Romy ignoring the biscuits and fruit juice in favour of playing with the office’s fancy Fortnum and Mason china tea set. I clench my teeth as she bashes the delicate cups together.Then – just as I’m cursing myself for breaking the golden “never-bring-your-child-to-work-unless-you-absolutely-have-to” rule – the screen catches her attention. Seeing the characters she’s grown to love come to life mesmerises her, even though many have still to be coloured in. Occasionally, they disappear altogether, to be replaced by handwritten notes. Despite this, it’s clear the story hasn’t lost any of the warmth of Kerr’s original. The tiger retains the slight edge of menace that makes him so captivating, and there’s excellent casting in the voices of David Oyelowo (Tiger), Tamsin Greig (Mummy) and Benedict Cumberbatch (Daddy).To turn this very short story into nearly half an hour of animation has involved a bit of licence, most notably the addition of a glorious musical interlude sung by Robbie Williams, who fell in love with the book after reading it to his daughter, Teddy. Again, Kerr had an input into this musical passage, suggesting that its references to such foods as pizza were replaced by more traditionally British items, such as ice cream and chocolate cake.Most people who have read The Tiger Who Came to Tea will have a favourite illustration. For many, it’s the evening scene after Daddy comes home and, realising there’s no food left in the house, takes Sophie and Mummy out to a cafe. Sophie is dressed in her nightie, coat and wellies, but just behind her sits a stripy, ginger cat in the glow of the street lights. For Fielding, one of the animation’s key illustrations isn’t actually part of the story – instead, it features on the inside sleeve of some versions of the book. It shows Sophie and the tiger drinking lemonade together through straws.“There was a bit of a eureka moment when we were writing the script because we realised that Sophie could imagine what it would be like if the tiger stayed for ever. So she recreates him going to school and sitting on her bed, then comes to the realisation that actually it would be ridiculous – you can’t have a tiger at home. Judith responded really well to this idea, meaning we’re not confined to the four walls of the house.”Indeed, if the book itself is about one thing then it’s imagination. The huge amount of white space on almost every page invites readers to let their own minds run free. Perhaps this is why the story lends itself to so many different readings, from feminist ones (is the Tiger the male of the house who does no housework?) to Michael Rosen’s notion that the stripy visitor is an intruding Gestapo officer. (Kerr grew up in Germany but the family fled to Switzerland and then Britain as the Nazis closed in.)When we first read the book to Romy, my wife was pregnant with our second child and it was hard to avoid the metaphor: here comes a new guest to upend the nice time you had planned with Mummy. But Kerr always insisted the story be taken at face value, that it’s about a child’s most wonderful fantasies. Romy’s reaction is testament to that – and ever since she’s seen the tiger slinking around the screen she hasn’t stopped wanting him to come for tea.• The Tiger Who Came to Tea is on Channel 4 on Christmas Eve at 7.30pm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c8c9634bec4faccc8ded3c09512fface660f067/0_350_4189_2515/master/4189.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db8be99b21ea877244c0eaceb01e3719","title":"kneel how the whole world bowed down to fleabag and her hot priest","story":"There was no escaping Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s comedy this year. It transformed our porn habits, sent gin-in-a-tin sales soaring ... and then the Catholic church weighed in‘It’ll pass,” Hot Priest told Fleabag after she declared her love for him in the show’s finale. We will never know if she got over him – its creator, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, recently said she has no idea where the character is now and has ruled out making another series. Meanwhile, the Fleabag phenomenon has intensified like a desperately needy crush (very Fleabag) since the show concluded in April.If, unlike Taylor Swift, you failed to score tickets, there was the National Theatre live broadcast: outside London, Letchworth Garden City’s Broadway cinema attracted the biggest audience, hosting 810 fans across three of its four screens. The cinema’s manager, Jason Valentine, can’t speculate on why Letchworth residents are so Fleabag-obsessed, but he did say that their subsidised ticket price includes a free glass of wine, which strikes me as a very Fleabag reason to go out.To coincide with the publication of Fleabag: The Scriptures in November – a book collecting the original play and series scripts – Waterstones Piccadilly recreated the character’s guinea pig cafe. (The show’s US distributor, Amazon, staged a similar one in Los Angeles.) And if you had squeezed every nuance out of the show, play and scripts, an otherwise faithful French TV adaptation, Mouche, added some Gallic wrinkles, such as its heroine masturbating to socialist politician Benoît Hamon instead of Barack Obama.The Quakers made hay of Fleabag’s visit to a meeting in season two, and even the Catholic church is keen to get in on the phenomenon. “The big questions of faith and the real-life evidence that people can love God to the extent that they dedicate their lives to his service in apostolic celibacy, forgoing marriage and family, are of perennial interest,” says Brenden Thompson, the CEO of Catholic Voices. “Fleabag knows about this hunger in the human heart and soul, which yearns for a perfect, infinite love. This knowledge contributes to her success.”But the more pressing question in this heathen age was whether Fleabag was problematic: was the priest abusive? Was it just for posh girls? Did Waller-Bridge, descended from barons, actually understand privilege? Was she classist to spoof Love Island on Saturday Night Live and wear designer duds on public transport in a Vogue photoshoot? Actually, the more pressing question was the enraged scream of “ANOTHER ARTICLE ABOUT THIS?” from beneath every  article on Fleabag, second only to Beyoncé when it comes to riling commenters.But there was no escape elsewhere: everything was Fleabag now. The BBC drama Back to Life, Tim Minchin’s Upright, the plays Me and My and Narcissist in the Mirror were all apparently “the new Fleabag” This Way Up and GameFace were absolutely not the new Fleabag.Any time Waller-Bridge has expressed the faintest regret about ending the show, as she did after it won three Emmys in September, fans reacted as if a beloved boyband had teased a reunion. So you can perhaps understand why she has decided to move on: she co-wrote the new Bond film, No Time to Die, and is executive-producing and starring in Run, the forthcoming HBO series from the Fleabag theatre director Vicky Jones. But will the public move on with her? First, we have Christmas to get through, a season for which Fleabag might be the ultimate patron saint.Bring on the drunken bad decisions and awkward family get-togethers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0e4f28bbec813deb2cf0490ec68451498399ffc/0_213_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34642483399e2acba69ae969406a969e","title":"seattle youth detention opening new facility","story":"New multimillion-dollar detention facility set to open in county that has committed both ideologically and financially to eliminating youth incarcerationWhen Armand Karim, 16, was arrested in connection with a robbery and transported to the Youth Services Center’s detention facility in Seattle, he was put in a holding cell for about two hours, given a cold lunch and then taken into a separate room to strip, so law enforcement could search him.For the next week and a half, Karim lived at the facility in his own small room that included a sink, toilet and a bed. He says he remembers the spiders and webs in the shower and the feeling of consistently being cold, but it was the sitting around all day that really stuck with him.“It was mentally exhausting,” he said of the experience last year. “There’s nothing in there for me to use to better myself or skills to practice. You just sit there and kind of feel depressed.”Seattle is gearing up to open a new $242m Children and Family Justice Center, which will replace this decades-old Youth Services Center, located mere yards away. It will include a 92,000 sq ft juvenile detention center, with 112 secure beds, and a 137,000 sq ft courthouse, equipped with 10 courtrooms.Between its extensive natural light, outdoor space and medical services, it’s clear the new space will be a major upgrade to the current complex, which has become known for its unreliable heating and cooling systems, mold and brown water.But in the seven years since residents voted in favor of a property tax to fund the new complex, the trend in the US has largely been to move away from youth detention. With extensive research showing not only that long-term youth incarceration can increase rates of re-offending, but also young people’s innate ability to reform if given the chance, states have begun to hone in on rehabilitation and restorative practices when it comes to juvenile justice.Last year, King county, which includes Seattle, took a big step in that direction as well. Officials released “The Road Map to Zero Youth Detention,” a strategic plan detailing the need to transition away from detaining children. It references the disproportionate representation of young people of color in the county’s juvenile justice system and the fact that there is little connection between youth incarceration and the amount of crime in the area. Officials also proposed a $4m investment to implement the plan.The county is now left with the difficult task of attempting to reconcile two seemingly competing visions for the area’s juvenile justice future: a new multimillion- dollar detention facility in a county that has committed both ideologically and financially to eliminating youth incarceration.King county Council Chair Rod Dembowski described it as putting a square peg in a round hole.Over the past decade, King county has dramatically reduced the number of young people held in the Youth Services Center’s detention facility. In 2006, the average daily population was 105 people, and by the first half of 2019 that number had dipped to 41.The new complex is set to open later this month, but for years it has faced a wide array of pushback from the community. There have been protests on city streets, in council meetings and even outside the home of King county executive Dow Constantine.Last year, The No New Youth Jail Coalition, which has helped to lead this pushback, sent a letter to Constantine demanding a moratorium on the construction of the facility. It described King County’s policing and imprisonment systems as being “racially targeted” and used to “criminalize poverty”.A group called End the Prison Industrial Complex (EPIC) filed several lawsuits over the center. In December 2018, the Washington state supreme court ruled against one key lawsuit.Judge Judy Ramseyer, chief judge at King County Juvenile Court, said it’s important to remember that this is not an eitheror situation. The county needs the whole continuum of services – a detention facility, rehabilitation and restorative practices and everything in between – so each young person is treated appropriately based on their inidual circumstances.She explained that the new detention facility is only for young people who have been arrested and are waiting on the adjudication of their crime (if they’re sentenced to confinement, they’re sent to a state institution). And of those young people eligible for the facility, only a small minority are actually placed there, citing the fact that in the first eight months of 2019, about 500 children had charges pending against them in King county, but there were only a few dozen people in the facility on a daily basis. But that doesn’t mean it isn’t needed, she said.“If there’s a 14-year-old that’s shooting at people, the reality is that if that kid’s back on the street right after that, that 14-year-old is at risk,” said Ramseyer. “So for the time being we need to figure out what’s going on and sometimes detention is used to kind of stop whatever the activity is and give us a few days or a week or two weeks, whatever the amount of time is, to figure out, ‘OK how can the community safely deal with this young person.’”Eric Trupin, a psychologist who runs the mental health program in the detention center, agreed that there are situations where children do need to be detained, but said the new facility could have reduced its number of detention beds much more than it did (It will have 100 fewer detention beds than the previous complex). It then could have used that space for other much needed programs, including as a shelter for homeless youth.The facility will include a gym, a library, classrooms and medical and dental services. It will also have 32 non-secure beds, which will be used for alternative youth programs, explained Ramseyer. She said one program that will make use of this space will be the Family Intervention and Restorative Services (FIRS), which gives young people arrested for family violence incidents time away from the home and counseling before being reunited.It looks like Karim, now 17, won’t be returning to this or any other youth detention center. Recently, a judge opted to give him one-year probation in lieu of confinement.He’s already made some key progress on his life outside the juvenile justice system since being transferred out of the detention facility and into house arrest about a year ago. He was able to take advantage of a number of local programs for young people with similar pasts and start getting his associate degree and receive help with employment.But when asked whether he wished he could have avoided the detention facility altogether, he paused for a long time and said he wasn’t sure, since the experience felt like a “wakeup call”.“Had I not met all those people in there and heard their stories, I don’t know,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3df093759b10d1d0f167dabc1e082aa2c82505e/0_200_2344_1407/master/2344.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=292d0f92de1577fc230e642996187a9b","title":"board games books and brand new clothes a guide to christmas shopping in your local charity shop","story":"They’re the cornerstone of every high street – guaranteed to have an eclectic mix of everything from clothes to homeware. Here are the top Christmas gifts to look out for when you next pop in to a thrift shopAs shopping, and living, sustainably becomes a focus for more and more people, this Christmas is the perfect time to turn to your local charity shops for your festive shopping. Not only will you give what you buy a new lease of life, you’ll support your local economy and share the benefits of shopping secondhand. To give you some inspiration, we’ve rounded up the best gifts you can expect to find in your local charity shop.Winter warmersFrom oversized turtlenecks in fun primary colours to neat cardigans and always-appropriate V-necks, charity shops are a goldmine for knitwear, particularly around the time wardrobes are being cleared to make way for (carefully pre-specified) Christmas gifts. Let their castoffs become your festive finds. You’ll save pounds compared with what you would spend on a new item and you’re more likely to find something unique, so your giftee won’t have to worry about running into someone else wearing the same thing.Board gamesChristmas wouldn’t be Christmas without a good board game to bring everyone together or, indeed, ide them … Monopoly and Scrabble are mainstays in most charity shops but there’s plenty others to suit everyone. Take your pick from the likes of Risk, Trivial Pursuit and Cluedo, as well as a plethora of TV- and film-themed games and the latest releases.Bestselling booksAlongside some wonderfully weird 1970s recipe books, you’ll find scores of bestselling titles on charity shop bookshelves. Zadie Smith, Margaret Atwood, Philip Pullman and John Grisham are all regulars, and you’ll find plenty of new authors such as Sally Rooney and David Chariandy too. While some titles may be a few years old, it’s not unusual to find the latest must-read on the shelves, and keep your eyes peeled for signed editions for an extra-special touch.Chintzy chinaFrom cocktails served in teacups to unusual teapots becoming a major home decor trend, the popularity of chintzy, vintage china is on the rise. You’ll discover shelves worth of it in almost any charity shop you walk into. It’s the perfect gift for someone who likes their homeware kitsch. Why not use a floral teacup as a holder for a homemade candle?Classic recordsWith vinyl records increasing in popularity, why not make a beeline for your nearest charity shop as they have plenty on offer. As digital formats took over, people turned to charity shops to free up their once-straining shelves and, because vinyl was donated in such abundance, many charity shops sell records for as little as 25p. You can expect to find everything from classical and krautrock to electronica and soul.Brand-new clothesWe all know someone who’s a little squeamish about the idea of secondhand clothes. But luckily for thrifty gift-givers, charity shops are not only stocked with vintage finds and pre-loved pieces, they’re also home to a huge amount of brand-new, unworn clothes. A quick rifle through the rails of your local charity shop will reveal a whole host of clothes with the original tags still attached. You’ll find everything from bold, printed T-shirts and floaty maxi dresses to jeans and shirts. There’s an abundance of high street labels waiting to be found and, if you’re lucky, you might just stumble across a designer piece.Vintage sewing patternsMore than a million people have taken up sewing over the past few years, with sales of sewing patterns soaring. However, with some patterns costing as much as we’re used to paying for a fully finished garment, the prices involved can be off-putting. To keep the crafty person in your life stitching, have a rifle through the baskets of vintage sewing patterns you often find tucked away underneath shelves. Selling for as little as 50p, you could buy enough to keep them busy until next Christmas.Statement jewelleryYou don’t have to go to an expensive boutique to find the perfect piece of jewellery – there’s plenty to be found in charity shops and they won’t break the bank. Take your pick from delicate vintage brooches, strings of pearls (likely faux, but you never know), oversized earrings, watches and cufflinks. The shelves are full to bursting with an assortment of jewellery that will suit everyone from your best friend to your grandma.Toiletry gift setsOnce a reasonably priced option for a secret Santa, toiletry gift sets seem to get more and more expensive each year. Rather than splashing out, see what’s on offer in your local charity shop. While some people may be worried about buying lotions and potions secondhand, charity shops are very savvy with their stock. Anything opened doesn’t make the shelves and many branches keep high street gift guides from the last couple of years in stock so they can cross-check whether a set is in date or not.Show your high street some loveWhy not seek out the personal touch with your Christmas shopping this year and join Visa in supporting local independent businesses across the country because #WhereYouShopMatters"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b08e67d45c554e1416a0d05e20f37399801fb0de/2810_672_2638_1583/master/2638.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=641c6a1f2409434d9c09472aa8a21693","title":"weve become like a little family of shops we look out for one another","story":"For Karen Harvey, her shop Hoos is fulfilling a lifelong passion for Scandi design while also breathing welcome new life into her local area, writes  Malcolm Jack “I often get people coming in and asking me what the name of the shop means,” smiles Karen Harvey, founder and owner of Hoos. “Everyone thinks it’s Danish or something.

A mixture of professional and personal circumstances led her back to her native Glasgow a few years ago, where she decided to take an entirely new career direction.“I’ve always had an interest in interiors and design, even though that’s not my background at all,” Harvey explains. “Scandinavian design has always been my sort of personal aesthetic, so when I was thinking: ‘OK, what brands do I want to do?’ they were the only ones for me.” She leased small premises on, at that time, a dilapidated stretch of Great Western Road, just off the west end of Glasgow’s central artery Byres Road, and with the support of her architect partner Bill, cleverly transformed the compact space into an immaculately laid out, bright and inviting oasis of select hard and soft furnishings, cool kitchen and tableware, lush green house plants, stylish rainwear, handmade fashion accessories and other assorted pretty things.Starting a new business in a new sector would be a daunting challenge for anyone, but Harvey took it in her stride. “I had to go to Copenhagen and be interviewed by some of the brands, because they’re very particular about what kind of shops they’re going in to,” Harvey reveals. She evidently impressed, because Hoos has become one of the few stockists in the UK for a host of hip makers such as Hay, Normann Copenhagen and Skagerak, to name just a few. “Most of my jewellery is by Glasgow School of Art graduates,” Harvey explains. “We also do textiles by Scottish makers. You’re not going to find these kinds of things in any other store either.”Business is going strong for Hoos, as it helps lead a local high street revival. Harvey is passionate about fostering a thriving community along Great Western Road, which has seen a host of great vintners, victuallers, boutiques, bookshops, bakers and cafes breathe new life into a historic strip of retail premises. She’s involved with Love Great Western Road, a Business Improvement District (BID) proposal encouraging local businesses to work collectively for a brighter, more prosperous commercial future. “It’s helped us to get to know one another,” Harvey says of BID. “We’ve become like a little family of shops – we look out for one another.”As well as local retailers pulling together to support each other, they all rely on their customers doing the same. By reminding people #WhereYouShopMatters, Visa is championing local, independent retailers to help restore richly deserved focus and footfall to our high streets. Not only because our high streets are at the heart of our communities, but also because great independent traders can offer unique and enriching retail experiences, where staff take a hands-on approach to helping you select special things for yourself and for the important people in your life. Shops like Hoos are working hard to not only redefine what it means to be a small, independent trader in the digital age, but also help revitalise our high streets for a new generation, and they deserve to be shouted about for it.“I’m really encouraged by Visa’s #WhereYouShopMatters initiative,” says Hoos’s Karen Harvey, “because it brings businesses like ours to people’s attention. Particularly among younger people, who I think are the ones who increasingly do most of their shopping online. If it brings Hoos to their attention for maybe the first time, obviously that’s fab. And then they’ll come to Great Western Road more often and see all the other fabulous shops too.”Here are some of Harvey’s top tips for great Christmas shopping experiences in her local area:Love and Squalor“A small shop just past Kelvinbridge. Rebecca is the owner and she sells clothes that she handmakes herself. So it’s like going back to how it used to be many years ago. She also buys in things such as wonderful socks and lovely Irish scarves, blankets and candles. It’s just a really nice experience going in there.”427 Great Western Road, Kelvinbridge, G4 9JACottonrake Bakery“A fabulous independent bakery, doing wonderful bread, cakes and bakes. In the run-up to Christmas they do all kinds of special things such as Christmas jams and other nice little presents. We feel extremely lucky to have them nearby.”497 Great Western Road, G12 8HLPaulin Watches“Everyone loves a watch – particularly a handmade one. Paulin’s designs are beautiful. They’re a young, independent company and they sell lots of other handmade things such as risograph prints by local artists.”407 Great Western Road, G4 9JAShow your high street some loveWhy not seek out the personal touch with your Christmas shopping this year and join Visa in supporting local independent businesses across the country because #WhereYouShopMatters"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71f2c9a26f832b9957df0f178b0e25d1a45f8cdd/418_2114_3422_2053/master/3422.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09930e09e9b7d6674f8445610cfea1b4","title":"the more festive the better how the high street becomes a special place at christmas","story":"Shopping takes on a new life at Christmas as the high street is transformed – as shoppers profess to having a little more goodwill than on your average Saturday and independent stores become the top destinationsAt the risk of sounding incredibly basic, I’ll confess: after the Christmas music, the decor is my favourite part of the festive season. While I’m next to useless when it comes to putting up my own decorations, I’m drawn like a moth to the flame to any household, restaurant, market or shop that has put in the extra effort. The more fake snow, twinkling lights and jingling bells, the better.In the car-centric Toronto suburb where I grew up, most of my youthful Christmas shopping was confined to the local mega-malls, which were unfailingly packed with overheated shoppers from Black Friday through to Boxing Day, so moving to the UK has been something of a revelation. No mall Santa, however rosy-cheeked, can really compete with the quaint holiday market in my boyfriend’s Lancashire hometown, or Kew Gardens’ festive trail of lights.That’s why you’re likely to find me gawping at the garlands over Regent Street when they’re illuminated later this month. The first major high street in London to adopt the practice of street-long decoration, Regent Street has been doing its Christmas light display since 1954, after a reporter described London as “drab” during the holiday season. Oxford Street followed suit soon after, in 1959, and by the end of the 1960s, high streets across Britain were invested in the new tradition. In fact, many cities now make an event of the day the lights are switched on, complete with fair rides, pantos and celebrities of varying degrees of fame.These spectacles aren’t just about dazzling onlookers. In Christmas and the British: A Modern History, historian Martin Johnes explains that light displays “gave 20th-century Christmas shopping a sense of occasion that differentiated it from the wider shopping experience that had become so embedded in everyday life”. More than just setting a mood, high street Christmas decorations make shopping less of a chore. If we have to endure the hordes each season, why not do it somewhere we don’t only tolerate, but enjoy?It’s not only the busy high streets following this logic. The coloured lights strung by volunteers in the tiny Cornish fishing village of Mousehole, all funded by donations, attract some 30,000 tourists a year to the benefit of local businesses. And for the last three years, Broadway Road in the Cotswolds has hosted late-night shopping evenings in December, with local stores staying open until 8:30pm so shoppers can stock up on gifts and take in a mix of performances in a cheerful environment. A friend of mine who worked at a Broadway Road hair salon recalls the time her team dolled up Three Wise Women and had them ride down the street on camels.Partial to a late-night browse myself, I usually venture to Mount Street in Mayfair to watch the lights get switched on, and spend the rest of the night wandering through the boutiques, sipping complimentary champagne and stuffing my face with mince pies to a medley of choristers and fashionable DJs. You can get the same buzz on many high streets in December, when independent shops stay open late and a holly wreath (or cup of mulled wine) is always close by.For all my talk about the high street at Christmas, I’m not one of those people who sorts out their list early. I pick up inspiration over the course of the year, and then do most of my shopping in the two weeks before the big day. That period, when the excitement around Christmas is reaching its peak, is when I feel most energised and most excited to take part in any Christmas-related activity, whether it’s ice-skating, eating Serrano ham at a friend’s flat or having one final night out before everyone goes home for the holidays. And in those instances, as with the shops, the more festive the environment, the better.Show your high street some loveWhy not seek out the personal touch with your Christmas shopping this year and join Visa in supporting local independent businesses across the country because #WhereYouShopMatters"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8476130bad66214c9f06743a1bade8a0530631f/464_103_2536_1521/master/2536.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a286e0bde6adc4d22232a70eabb42086","title":"croatian president to face leftist former pm in second round run off","story":"Incumbent Kolinda Grabar Kitarović comes second to Zoran Milanović after losing votes to rightwing singer Miroslav ŠkoroCroatia’s conservative president will face a liberal former prime minister in a runoff election in early January after no candidate won an outright majority in a first round of voting on Sunday, near-complete results showed.The vote was held just days before Croatia takes over the European Union presidency for the first time. The governing conservatives are hoping to to keep their grip on power ahead of assuming the EU chairmanship.Some 3.8 million voters in the EU’s newest member country chose from among 11 candidates in Sunday’s election, but only the top three finishers were considered serious contenders.Milanović and Grabar Kitarović now will face each other in a second round of voting on 5 January.Although the incumbent finished second, analysts said Grabar Kitarović could be considered a favourite in the runoff because other right-leaning challengers would no longer be in contention.Addressing supporters, Grabar Kitarović called for all those on the right to unite behind her candidacy in the second round. She described the first round as a 10-on-one battle.Milanović called for a civilised contest rather than a battle, referring to traditionally deep isions in Croatia between the political left and right. “We are going to the second round, not a war,” he said. “Let the better one of us win and I believe I am better.”Croatia’s presidency is largely ceremonial. The office holder formally commands the army and represents the country abroad. But retaining the post is important for the ruling Croatian Democratic Union party, known as HDZ, as Croatia prepares for its six-month term in the EU presidency. The job will include overseeing Britain’s departure from the bloc, expected to take place on 31 January, and the start of post-Brexit trade talks.Grabar Kitarović started off her campaign looking strong but her position weakened after a series of gaffes. The 51-year-old incumbent is known for flirting with the extreme right while seeking also to portray herself as a people’s president.Milanović promised during the campaign to turn Croatia into a normal, tolerant country.Although Croatia has recovered since the devastating 1991-95 war that followed the breakup of former Yugoslavia, it is still is one of the poorest nations in the EU and corruption is regarded as widespread.Critics blasted the government for setting the election date three days before Christmas, a time when many people travel abroad. The governing HDZ party, they said, counted on the support from Croats who live abroad and normally flock home for the holidays.Analysts said the strong showing by the rightwing Skoro party signalled that the governing HDZ had lost some support among party followers ahead of a parliamentary election set for next year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42a1725b881d96453917440909b4685ca86e7ac4/40_0_1363_818/master/1363.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db5a1bb0144a46de65ca31de5f5ca05c","title":"pfa calls for uk government inquiry into racism in football","story":"Government ready to act ‘if required’ after calls for inquiry in wake of incident at SpursDowning Street has said the football authorities need to do more to tackle racism in the game after calls for a government inquiry and more comprehensive sanctions in response to an alleged racist incident during a match between Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea on Sunday.Boris Johnson’s official spokesman said the government was monitoring the authorities’ response and was ready to take further steps “if required”.“Racism of any kind has no place in football or anywhere else and we must confront this vile behaviour,” he said. “Clearly there remains more work to be done by the football authorities in tackling this issue and we are committed to working with them on this to stamp it out.The spokesman added: “The FA, Premier League and English Football League have significantly stepped up their efforts, but we expect them to continue to prioritise this issue and to consult with both players and supporter groups, and we will be monitoring how the football authorities implement their plans through the season.”No 10’s comments were echoed by Priti Patel, the home secretary, who said: “Those found guilty of a racially aggravated offence under the Public Order Act can face a sentence of both six months in prison and a 10-year ban from attending all football matches.“We fully expect the entire football community to work with the authorities to bring the perpetrators to justice so we can stamp this evil out of our national game.” Earlier, the Professional Footballers’ Association (PFA) said: “Once again, a Premier League fixture has been tainted by abuse from the stands towards players. We believe that the time has come for all governing bodies to unite collectively to end this abuse.“The PFA calls for a government inquiry into racism and the rise in hate crime within football and immediate and urgent action from an all-party group at the Department of Culture, Media and Sport to address this urgent issue.”It was reported that the sports minister, Nigel Adams, would speak to Tottenham Hotspur about the abuse on Monday.The game on Sunday was paused after the Chelsea defender Antonio Rüdiger was allegedly targeted with racist abuse by a section of the crowd.The referee Anthony Taylor stopped the game during the second half when an object was thrown at Chelsea’s goalkeeper, Kepa Arrizabalaga, and Rüdiger indicated that a supporter had shouted a monkey chant at him. César Azipilicueta, the Chelsea captain, brought the incident to the referee’s attention, who asked for an announcement to be broadcast to the crowd. The announcement over the PA system at the Tottenham stadium told the crowd that “racist behaviour is interfering with the game”. It was repeated twice, though it is understood that only one allegation of racism was made.The incident at the Tottenham ground was the latest of several racist incidents to mar English football over the past 12 months. The Manchester derby sparked a furore after a City fan appeared to make a monkey gesture at United’s player Fred, while on the same day a League Two game between Scunthorpe and Forest Green Rovers was halted after allegations of racist abuse. In October an FA Cup tie between Haringey Borough and Yeovil was replayed after racist abuse from the crowd.Kick It Out’s George Starkey-Midha echoed the PFA’s call for the government to take action. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “It’s imperative on everyone involved in football, on the government, or anyone in any kind of position of authority, to begin to take this far more seriously and look at how we can begin to make inroads, because clearly you’ve now got a situation where every single week there seems to be another incident and it’s a serious, serious problem.”Starkey-Midha said there needed to be “far more robust” reporting procedures and “far more comprehensive sanctions”, including within football, to respond to racism. When asked if the PFA was accurate when warning of the “blatant racism that is currently rife in the UK”, Starkey-Midha replied: “Yes, absolutely. I think it’s undeniable that racism is still a very serious problem in this country.”He added: ““I think people like to look abroad to Italy, Russia and Bulgaria when incidents happen there and I think we’re right to criticise when we see it, but there are serious levels of racism in this country still too. Unless we wake up to that fact, we won’t tackle it properly.”The former cabinet minister David Mellor called for fans to do more to root out racism at football matches in Britain. Mellor told PA Media: “Fans cannot escape responsibility for clearing racism out of the game. Somebody must know who this idiot or these idiots are.“Fans cannot just pass by on the other side of the road, they must stand up and be counted otherwise we will be on a slippery slope and it will lead to matches being abandoned, stadiums being closed and games being played behind closed doors.”Mellor, who presented BBC radio’s 606 football phone-in programme for nine years, added: “What we cannot do is take issue with racism when British teams play in eastern Europe and then ignore incidents over here. Fans cannot be morally neutral about this.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4123188.1577046156!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"emergency brexit inspection tents in rosslare cost 120 000","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRosslare Europort: Tents were erected ahead of each Brexit deadline this year for use as emergency inspection accommodation in case of a no-deal scenario. Photograph: Niall CarsonPA Wire Temporary emergency marquees for Brexit checks which never happened have been put up and taken down a number of times over the last year at Rosslare Europort at a cost of more than €120,000.The  has learned that tents were erected ahead of each Brexit deadline this year for use as emergency inspection accommodation in case of a no-deal scenario, as permanent infrastructure has not yet been built.The marquees were originally intended to be installed to cover the ramifications of a potential no-deal scenario in March. They were first put up in anticipation of the March and April 2019 deadlines, and remained in place until June 11th.They were then dismantled as the OPW had no use for them ahead of a new Brexit deadline in October.They were then reinstalled on the October 21st, 2019 in preparation for the October 31st deadline.“They are likely to remain on site until the threat of a no deal passes, or if any changes are indicated following the British elections. On completion of the final phase of development of the new border control post on the site, expected by the end of January 2020, the marquees will be dismantled and returned,” a spokesman for the OPW said.According to the Government’s Brexit Contingency Plan, published in July 2019, infrastructure at ports was due to be “refined” and “improved” after the first deadline passed in March.It said that “permanent state inspection facilities will be constructed on a site adjacent to the existing port”.“This facility will accommodate inspection bays for SPS (sanitary and phytosanitary) and food safety checks as well as a number of Revenue turnout sheds. The site will also include office accommodation, a documentary and public office, driver welfare facilities, two documentary and identity check facilities” and parking for 35 HGVs, the contingency plan states.Permanent infrastructureIn response to queries about the cost of the tents, a spokesman for the OPW said that “interim infrastructure was put in place at Rosslare Europort to prepare for a possible no-deal Brexit on 29 March 2019. In the period afforded by subsequent Brexit extensions, this has been enhanced incrementally since then. Permanent infrastructure will be put in place to apply the additional customs, SPS and health checks and controls on a long-term basis”.The OPW said the marquees had a “dual purpose for department staff training requirements and for use as emergency inspection accommodation for use in case of a no-deal Brexit”.The agency says it has already paid €110,400, excluding VAT, for the hire of the marquees with an indicative monthly rate of €27,600, excluding VAT.“The cost of their dismantling, removal from site and reinstallation in October 2019 was €8,500. We were not charged while the marquees were off-site.”A source has told The  that a large fence was also installed and removed at the site. The OPW said the costs for this are not available at this time.“The purpose of the moveable fencing was for site ision and security. Portions of the site were handed over to the client departments for training purposes as they became available. The moveable fencing is necessary to enable our main contractor to proceed with construction works safely, in parallel with department staff training and movements adjacent.“Given the area in question is an active construction site, moveable fencing is in place for the duration of the works for the safety and security of all parties.“The costs for fencing are incorporated into the main contract for the building of the border control post and will be available once the works are complete.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Only Canada comes close to the UK experience, with a threefold increase in average property prices.\u0026nbspHouse prices in the UK have also risen substantially faster than incomes. Average house prices are now almost twice as high relative to a measure of average household disposable income as they were 40 years ago.Andrew Bailey faces a host of challenges as next Bank of England chiefChronic undersupply of housing in the UK has frequently been blamed for pushing up prices but David Miles and Victoria Monro at the Bank of England found this has not been a significant driver.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The researchers compared house prices which have risen sharply with rents which have remained relatively stable compared to incomes.They conclude that if the main cause of rising prices was not enough properties then rents would also have increased sharply but this has not happened.According to the Bank, UK homeowners currently have a record £1.6 trillion of outstanding home loans. Consumers must pass stress tests that estimate whether they could afford rising monthly mortgage payments in the event that interest rates go up.The new research suggests that, despite these tests, the property market would be vulnerable to sustained interest rate increases.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In exchange for a payment, whether in cash, supplies or services, a TV show or a film would prominently display a brand-name product.Then there was virtual product placement. Products or logos would be inserted into a show during editing, thanks to computer-generated imagery.Now, with the rise of Netflix and other streaming platforms, the practice of working brands into shows and films is likely to get more sophisticated. In the near future, according to marketing executives who have had discussions with streaming companies, the products that appear on screen may depend on who is watching.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn other words, a viewer known to be a whiskey drinker could see a billboard for a liquor brand in the background of a scene, while a teetotaler watching the same scene might see a billboard for a fizzy water company.Streaming services could also drop in brand-name products based on when a show is being watched. Someone who watches a streaming show in the morning could see a carton of orange juice within a character’s reach, while a different viewer watching the same thing in the afternoon could see a can of soda.Created with Sketch.The 40 best films of the decade Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.140 40.

With every click of the remote, viewers tell the services something about themselves, information that can be used to determine which products might appeal to them.This supercharged version of digital product placement is being developed at a time when the marketing business — which bet big on TV commercials for decades — needs new tricks to grab the attention of ad-hating cord-cutters.Beringer, the head of Mirriad, said the current digital product placement technology has been successful enough to suggest that a bespoke version is a logical next step.“Viewers have been educated to look away from advertising,” he said. “But we’re putting something in that contextually makes sense. If you do it well, and it’s not annoying, it can work.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some of the data is collected by the platforms themselves, others by outside data companies. And now streaming services are mulling how to make use of that information to create tailored product placements.“Just like there’s no reason that all viewers of a program need to see the same advertisement, there’s no reason that they all need see the same brand integration or crossover campaign,” said David Schweidel, a marketing professor at Emory University.Streaming platforms are trying out other advertising innovations, too. Hulu, a platform controlled by the Walt Disney Company, has ads that appear when a viewer hits the pause button. Last week, it rolled out specialised ads for people who are bingeing on three or more episodes of a show, with commercials for Kellogg’s, Maker’s Mark and Georgia-Pacific.This year, Walmart-owned streaming service Vudu enabled so-called shoppable ads on internet-connected televisions. With a click of the remote on the words “Add to Cart,” customers are able to drop an advertised product into their Walmart queue.On the Roku Channel, a streaming channel on the company’s digital media player, viewers can click on certain commercials to request an email or text with details about the product on display.

One of his gang members slaps a painting with his hands that are covered in red paint, but in the next shot, the handprints have disappeared from the artwork.Rick Dalton, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, flies back to Hollywood on a Boeing 747. But it would have been a 707. The film was set in 1969 and the 747 went into service in January 1970.Dustin Hoffman’s character drives in the wrong direction across the Bay Bridge in San Francisco on his way to Berkeley, California. He is travelling on the top deck of the bridge for traffic going from  California to San Francisco.There is a continuity issue at breakfast when Julia Roberts’s character takes a bite out of a croissant. She’s in the hotel room with her co-star Richard Gere, but when the camera pans back to her, it transforms into a pancake. Then when she takes a second bite out of the pancake, there is only one bite mark in it.529 North by Northwest (1959)One of the children playing an extra in Alfred Hitchcock’s film covers his ears a few seconds before Eva Marie Saint’s character unexpectedly fires a gun at Cary Grant’s character in the Mount Rushmore cafeteria.Bullet holes can be seen in the walls of the apartment where John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson’s characters go to get a briefcase, but it’s before the shoot-out has happened.729 Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003)John Connors Cessna’s plane numbers keep changing in the film. When he is in the hanger on the runway it is N3035C, but once it’s flying, the numbers change to N3413F.829 The Wizard of Oz (1939)Judy Garland isn’t wearing her iconic ruby red slippers in the scene where the trees pelt Dorothy and the Scarecrow with apples. Instead, she can be seen wearing plain black shoes.The baby that Bradley Cooper holds while adapting to civilian life after the Iraqi War is plastic. In fact, it looked so fake, even he admitted it was “nuts”.When computer expert David Levinson, played by Jeff Goldblum, is throwing a tantrum in the hanger housing the captured alien craft, he knocks over a bin that is labelled “Art Dept”. Clearly, a set designer left it there by mistake.1129 The Fast and the Furious (2001)In a scene when Jesse and Tran race, Tran is wearing a shirt with sleeves, but in the next shot he’s in a tank top. Didn’t anybody notice when they edited it?1229  Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 (2011)We were always told that Harry Potter had his mother’s blue eyes. But when we see Lily Potter as a child, she has brown eyes. As a group of stormtroopers enter a control room, one of them accidentally bangs his head on a door. The actor responsible, Laurie Good, couldn’t believe it made it into the final film.  1429 Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003)There is a crew member wearing a cowboy hat and looking out to sea behind Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow on the pirate ship. 1529 Quantum of Solace (2008)A street cleaner behind Daniel Craig’s James Bond is pretending to sweep the road but is holding his broom several inches off the ground.1629 10 Things I Hate About You (1999)When Bianca accidentally shoots a gym teacher with an arrow, an extra, who is playing a student, runs off to get urgent help – but once she thinks she is out of shot, she stops and looks back at the camera.There is a modern car in the background of a big battle scene. Considering the film is set in the 13th century, it’s hard to imagine how it stayed in the final cut. Leonardo DiCaprio accidentally cut his hand while filming a scene in which he slams his hand on the table and breaks a glass. But rather than shout “cut”, he carried on in character. Tarantino liked it so much that he kept it in the film.Many of the mistakes are related to the film’s 1990s time period. These include computers using a wrongly dated version of Windows and Carol Danvers’s memories being jogged by a Nirvana song that wasn’t out until after she left Earth. Toby McGuire’s Spider-Man saves Kirsten Dunst’s Mary Jane from a group of attackers. He throws them through a set of windows before he kisses her upside down in the rain. But during their romantic embrace, the windows behind her are perfectly intact. As Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) dies one rainy evening, he releases a dove into a clear, blue sky. It is a lovely symbolic act but slightly dampened by this continuity error. Ridley Scott finally fixed this and other mistakes with his 2007 Final Cut.John Carpenter’s slasher film starring Jamie Lee Curtis was set in the fictional town of Haddonfield, Illinois, but all the cars have Californian number plates and there are shots of palm trees, as the film was shot in Southern California.At the end of the cult film, Data tells news reporters that the octopus was really scary, but this actually refers to a deleted scene.

In another scene, a phone’s broken screen suddenly appears fixed.“Consumers are so much more empowered today to flip the dial, to change the channel, and many of the things they could switch to don’t have advertising at all,” said Scott Rosenberg, a senior vice president at Roku. “It’s incumbent on platforms and apps that are ad-supported to work harder at how they put ads in front of the consumer.”Virtual product placement companies like Mirriad and its rival Ryff said they are talking with streaming services about using data to customize product placements to viewers. Mirriad and Ryff would not name their potential partners.Product placement is appealing to streaming services because it allows them to work with companies without interrupting a show with commercials. Hulu, which comes in a low-cost ad-supported version and also has a commercial-free option for subscribers willing to pay more, said that so-called brand integrations on its platform have been far more effective than 30-second commercials at raising viewers’ interest in products.Some skeptics say virtual product placements based on viewer preferences may turn out to be one of those innovations that does not catch on. A few well-placed TV commercials and billboards are likely to reach the same number of people with less trouble, said Joe Maceda, an executive at the media agency Mindshare.“It’s hard to know if the juice is worth the squeeze,” he said.The possibilities of inidualised product placement were on display in Bandersnatch,\u0026nbspan extended installment of the Netflix series Black Mirror,\u0026nbspa speculative fiction show that specialises in horrifying tales of invasive technologies and exploitative digital companies.Bandersnatch was interactive. Viewers determined how the story, set in 1980s Britain, unfolded by clicking on choices presented to them at various forks in the narrative road. Early on, the film asked viewers to choose between two breakfast cereals, Sugar Puffs or Frosties. Their selection determined which one would appear in a commercial shown on a TV set in the background of a scene later in the film.The most hilarious product placements in cinemaSugar Puffs and Frosties were not included as part of an ad, Netflix said, but rather as a way for the Black Mirror\u0026nbspcreators to enhance the film’s 1980s setting. Netflix was not paid by the cereal companies.But all those remotes clicking on one cereal or the other provided Netflix with data on its subscribers’ preferences. Reed Hastings, Netflix chief executive, cited Bandersnatch\u0026nbspduring a webcast timed to an earnings report this year. Holding up two boxes of cereal, he announced that 73 per cent of Bandersnatch viewers had selected Kellogg’s Frosties.The other executives on the webcast chuckled.“The most critical data point of the quarter!” joked Spencer Wang, a vice president.Netflix, which does not run commercials, said it would not use the information it had gleaned from Bandersnatch,\u0026nbspsaying in a statement that “the privacy of our members is a top priority.”But marketing executives like Ricky Ray Butler, chief executive of product placement company Branded Entertainment Network, are enthusiastic about the possibility of inserting brand-name products into streaming shows based on data generated by interactive programming. Actually being able to do so, he said, may still be a long way off.“The world’s not ready for it yet,” he said. “We’re just at the tip of the iceberg.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

APTaking Harry Belafonte’s 1956 hit “Mary’s Boy Child” and singing it in medley with new song “Oh My Lord”, Boney M’s No 1 hit combined Christmas carol-like harmonies with Euro disco, steel drums and a reggae sensibility. It might sound disastrous – but somehow it works. AP“He’s gone2,000 milesIs very far,” sings Chrissie Hynde, above a twanging guitar riff in “2,000 Miles”, her serpentine melody stretching each syllable into several. You could easily assume it’s about two separated lovers, but it was actually written for the band’s original guitar player, James Honeyman-Scott, who died of a drug overdose a year earlier at the age of 25. The song is desperately bleak – as is the case with all the best Christmas songs – but with a note of festive hopefulness too. “The children were singingHe’ll be back at Christmas time.” AP418 15) Rockin\u0027 Around the Christmas Tree – Brenda LeeBrenda Lee was just 13 years old when she made herself a rockabilly legend thanks to the recording of this party classic. It always reminds me of scenes in The Santa Clause (one of the best ever Christmas films) where the jaunty number was heavily featured, along with seminal holiday movie Home Alone. RO518 14) Let it Snow! Let it Snow! Let it Snow! – Dean MartinFew Christmas songs are as cosy as this one. Dean Martin’s smooth, rich voice is as warming as a good glass of whisky paired with sweeping, romantic strings and a chirpy flute, “Let it Snow!” conjures up images of stockings hanging up over the chimney, a Christmas tree glinting with baubles, and a frost-tinted window with snow falling outside. RO618 13) Walking in the Air – The Snowman  Peter AutyThough Aled Jones tends to get the credit for this haunting masterpiece, it is actually the voice of choirboy Peter Auty that appears in the climactic scene of the wordless 1982 animation The Snowman. He wasn’t credited though, and when his voice broke and Jones’s version reached number five in the UK charts, he was almost written out of history. In truth, though, whichever version you hear, the song’s sweeping grandeur is goosebumps-inducing. AP718 12) Peace on Earth Little Drummer Boy – David Bowie Bing CrosbyRecorded for Bing Crosby’s TV special Merrie Olde Christmas, and framed around a strange scripted exchange of banter between the two, this mash-up only came about because Bowie hated the song, “Little Drummer Boy”, that he had been asked on the show to sing. So songwriters Ian Fraser and Larry Grossman, alongside the show’s scriptwriter, cobbled together “Peace on Earth” to serve as a counterpoint, while Crosby performed the intended song. They recorded the resulting medley after less than an hour of rehearsal, and five weeks later, Crosby died. AP“Eartha Kitt is the sexiest woman in the world. You don’t write Christmas songs that are sexy. How are we going to do that?”This Mel Torme composition was originally written, according to Torme, with Bob Wells as a mind-over-matter attempt to stay cool during a stifling summer day in 1945. It’s one of Cole’s most enduring hits, and one of the most beloved of all Christmas songs. RO1018 9) I Believe in Father Christmas – Greg LakeThis Mel Torme composition was originally written, according to Torme, with Bob Wells as a mind-over-matter attempt to stay cool during a stifling summer day in 1945. It’s one of Cole’s most enduring hits, and one of the most beloved of all Christmas songs. RO1118 8) It\u0027s the Most Wonderful Time of the Year – Andy WilliamsAndy Williams’ classic brings to mind the kind of big, brash Christmas’s you see in American films – lots of presents, blazing fireplaces and a huge feast – but also plays heavily on the importance of spending time with your loved ones. It consistently appears in the top 10s of Christmas song rankings, and more than 50 years in, the 1963 staple shows no signs of wearing out. RO1218 7) \u0027Stop the Cavalry – Jona LewieIt was “just another anti-war song” until Jona Lewie threw a kazoo into the mix. The English singer-songwriter never intended “Stop the Cavalry” to become a Christmas single, but the festive mention in the line “I wish I was at home for Christmas”, along with the addition of a Salvation Army brass band and tubular bell, was enough to convince listeners.1318 6) Driving Home for Christmas – Chris ReaIn 1978, Rea thought it was all over. His record contract was done, and his manager had just told him he was quitting. Rea wanted to get home from London’s Abbey Road studios to Middlesborough, but his record company wouldn’t pay for a ticket.Sinatra’s version of this classic Christmas song opens on his isolated vocals before gradually introducing the swooning choir and tender strings section. And the lyrics: “Have yourself a merry little ChristmasMake the Yuletide gay  From now on your troubles will be miles awayHere we are as in olden daysHappy golden days of yoreFaithful friends who are dear to us  Gather near to us once more.” RO1518 4) All I Want for Christmas is You – Mariah CareyGeorge Michael wrote, performed, produced and played every single instrument on this song, where the narrator looks back with sadness on a past relationship. As with “Fairytale of New York”, you have an upbeat, cheerful rhythm and chirpy instrumentation, against the melancholy of unrequited love in the lyrics, with the suggestion that it was given away too hastily (“This year, to save me from tearsI’ll give it to someone special”). RO1718 2) Fairytale of New York – The PoguesSome of the best songs combine uplifting instrumentation that contrasts with lyrics that can be downright miserable, and such is the case for “Fairytale of New York”. It has none of the sickly sweet sentimentality of Mariah Carey’s “All I Want For Christmas Is You” or Wham!’s “Last Christmas”.Richard (Dick) Smith was suffering from tuberculosis, an illness which had plagued him since a child, from his bed in a sanatorium in Philadelphia. Gazing longingly out of his window at the snow, he wrote a poem describing all the things he would do when he was well again. He was inspired by the views of people playing in the park across the street from his family home on Church Street, where he’d lived with his mother, brother and two sisters. His father had died when he was a child. 118 18) Happy Xmas (War is Over) – John Lennon and Yoko OnoThere’s a caveat to the optimistic message of the song’s title. “War is over,” sing a choir of children over festive tambourines, but only, they add, “If you want it.” Having analysed the success of his previous single, “Imagine,” the former Beatle noted, “Now I understand what you have to do: Put your political message across with a little honey.” On this, an anti-Vietnam war protest song wrapped up in sleigh bells, strings and an anthemic melody, he does just that. APTaking Harry Belafonte’s 1956 hit “Mary’s Boy Child” and singing it in medley with new song “Oh My Lord”, Boney M’s No 1 hit combined Christmas carol-like harmonies with Euro disco, steel drums and a reggae sensibility. It might sound disastrous – but somehow it works. AP“He’s gone2,000 milesIs very far,” sings Chrissie Hynde, above a twanging guitar riff in “2,000 Miles”, her serpentine melody stretching each syllable into several. You could easily assume it’s about two separated lovers, but it was actually written for the band’s original guitar player, James Honeyman-Scott, who died of a drug overdose a year earlier at the age of 25. The song is desperately bleak – as is the case with all the best Christmas songs – but with a note of festive hopefulness too. “The children were singingHe’ll be back at Christmas time.” AP418 15) Rockin\u0027 Around the Christmas Tree – Brenda LeeBrenda Lee was just 13 years old when she made herself a rockabilly legend thanks to the recording of this party classic. It always reminds me of scenes in The Santa Clause (one of the best ever Christmas films) where the jaunty number was heavily featured, along with seminal holiday movie Home Alone. RO518 14) Let it Snow! Let it Snow! Let it Snow! – Dean MartinFew Christmas songs are as cosy as this one. Dean Martin’s smooth, rich voice is as warming as a good glass of whisky paired with sweeping, romantic strings and a chirpy flute, “Let it Snow!” conjures up images of stockings hanging up over the chimney, a Christmas tree glinting with baubles, and a frost-tinted window with snow falling outside. RO618 13) Walking in the Air – The Snowman  Peter AutyThough Aled Jones tends to get the credit for this haunting masterpiece, it is actually the voice of choirboy Peter Auty that appears in the climactic scene of the wordless 1982 animation The Snowman. He wasn’t credited though, and when his voice broke and Jones’s version reached number five in the UK charts, he was almost written out of history. In truth, though, whichever version you hear, the song’s sweeping grandeur is goosebumps-inducing. AP718 12) Peace on Earth Little Drummer Boy – David Bowie Bing CrosbyRecorded for Bing Crosby’s TV special Merrie Olde Christmas, and framed around a strange scripted exchange of banter between the two, this mash-up only came about because Bowie hated the song, “Little Drummer Boy”, that he had been asked on the show to sing. So songwriters Ian Fraser and Larry Grossman, alongside the show’s scriptwriter, cobbled together “Peace on Earth” to serve as a counterpoint, while Crosby performed the intended song. They recorded the resulting medley after less than an hour of rehearsal, and five weeks later, Crosby died. AP“Eartha Kitt is the sexiest woman in the world. You don’t write Christmas songs that are sexy. How are we going to do that?”This Mel Torme composition was originally written, according to Torme, with Bob Wells as a mind-over-matter attempt to stay cool during a stifling summer day in 1945. It’s one of Cole’s most enduring hits, and one of the most beloved of all Christmas songs. RO1018 9) I Believe in Father Christmas – Greg LakeThis Mel Torme composition was originally written, according to Torme, with Bob Wells as a mind-over-matter attempt to stay cool during a stifling summer day in 1945. It’s one of Cole’s most enduring hits, and one of the most beloved of all Christmas songs. RO1118 8) It\u0027s the Most Wonderful Time of the Year – Andy WilliamsAndy Williams’ classic brings to mind the kind of big, brash Christmas’s you see in American films – lots of presents, blazing fireplaces and a huge feast – but also plays heavily on the importance of spending time with your loved ones. It consistently appears in the top 10s of Christmas song rankings, and more than 50 years in, the 1963 staple shows no signs of wearing out. RO1218 7) \u0027Stop the Cavalry – Jona LewieIt was “just another anti-war song” until Jona Lewie threw a kazoo into the mix.

His father had died when he was a child. Another card says: “It turned out that a lot of the relief money was used by Ethiopia’s military dictatorship, which made the famine worse by poisoning their enemies’ farms.”The author of the cards added a final, wry observation on the lyrics of the song: “Incidentally, the people of Ethiopia probably did know it was Christmas – it’s one of the oldest Christian nations in the world.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

previously warned that leaving the EU without a deal could “compromise” vital research projects and lead to a mass exodus of world-leading academics and researchers.A recent analysis from the Russell Group, a body of 24 prestigious universities,\u0026nbspfound that Brexit uncertainty had prompted talented EU academics to leave science departments in the UK.\u0026nbspIn August, Boris Johnson announced that there would be no cap on elite researchers from across the globe coming to the UK after Brexit – as long as they are endorsed by recognised British bodies.Now the Home Office has set out plans for the fellowships – which will rise with immediate effect.Ms Patel said: “We want to make sure the UK continues to be at the forefront of innovation, so we need an immigration system that attracts the sharpest minds from around the globe.“As part of this ambitious plan, we are taking decisive action today to boost the number of top scientists and elite researchers who can benefit from fast-tracked entry into the UK.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is still not clear whether it was the result of a genuine fallout or a more friendly jibe.Mr Zuckerberg\u0027s Twitter account is hardly used at all, despite having more than 400,000 followers. While he used it throughout 2009 to write about new\u0026nbsp features, the only post since was a 2012 message that linked out to a post on his official Facebook page.Mark Zuckerberg followed one new person on Twitter this yearMr Zuckerberg followed only one user of the site through the whole year – in another unexplained, unusual interaction. But that happened at the beginning of the year and is not thought to be related to any of the new events.\u0026nbspSome have speculated that the goat – and perhaps all of the events – are in reference to a strange exchange between the two billionaires at the beginning of the year.In January, Mr Dorsey claimed that Mr Zuckerberg had served one of the animals as part of a meal, during a year when he was only eating food he had killed.Mr Dorsey said that Zuckerberg is a “very, very smart businessman,” and then he went on to say: “He made goat for me for dinner. He killed the goat.”The Twitter boss then clarified that Mr Zuckerberg did not kill the goat in front of him but “killed it before” their meal.“I guess he kills it,” he said. “He kills it with a laser gun and then the knife. Then they send it to the butcher.”Mr Dorsey\u0026nbspthen corrected himself to make clear it was probably a stun gun, and went on to suggest that he did not eat the goat because it was cold.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Only Canada comes close to the UK experience, with a threefold increase in average property prices.\u0026nbspHouse prices in the UK have also risen substantially faster than incomes. Average house prices are now almost twice as high relative to a measure of average household disposable income as they were 40 years ago.Andrew Bailey faces a host of challenges as next Bank of England chiefChronic undersupply of housing in the UK has frequently been blamed for pushing up prices but David Miles and Victoria Monro at the Bank of England found this has not been a significant driver.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The researchers compared house prices which have risen sharply with rents which have remained relatively stable compared to incomes.They conclude that if the main cause of rising prices was not enough properties then rents would also have increased sharply but this has not happened.According to the Bank, UK homeowners currently have a record £1.6 trillion of outstanding home loans. Consumers must pass stress tests that estimate whether they could afford rising monthly mortgage payments in the event that interest rates go up.The new research suggests that, despite these tests, the property market would be vulnerable to sustained interest rate increases.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They made the decision to flee the fighting for the safety and relative calm of Rwanda. They were made to feel very welcome by the host community. Sarah is enrolled in class, three years behind where she should be, due to conflict, and she really enjoys her schooling. GS Gasaka school, run by Education Above All Foundation and UNHCR, is providing her the environment to allow her to dream one day of becoming an accountant so she can help her family live a better life.Nakato 19, was born and raised in Yumbe, Uganda. A graduate from Aruma High School, she has aspirations of becoming a journalist. She is actively involved in a movement called “Raise up and Talk” to help empower the younger generation to share their experiences and stories as a form of therapy, to help process the trauma from a life in conflict. Forestal, nine, is in second grade at Marescot School, Haiti. The school is funded through the partnership between non-profit buildOn Haiti, and Educate A Child (EAC), who have constructed 58 schools, as well as training 959 teachers. Forestal explains how she was given up by her father after the death of her mother. She now lives with her auntie as a “restavek” (child in domestic servitude) where she performs chores around the house for at least two hours a day including laundry, sweeping and mopping floors. She can only recall seeing her father once in her entire life. “It was only for one day, but it was really great, we had so much fun,” she says. Forestal hopes that she can see him again – but he lives and works in Port Au Prince, more than three hours away by car.Furaha, six, attends Buremba Primary School. She is a member of the Batwa “Pygmy” tribe, forced out of their native home in the Bwindi Forest to make way for a national park protected as a Unesco World Heritage Site. She lives in Kitahurira settlement camp, about 2.5km and a three-hour walk from her school. The construction of schools and training of teachers in remote areas of challenging geography ensures those hardest to reach have a right to education. Building Tomorrow Uganda through its partnership with Education Above All Foundation has enrolled 53,373 out-of-school children back into quality primary education in Uganda.Niyosenga,12, arrived from Kiyiri, DRC, in 2016. Her mother was killed in the fierce fighting which swept through towns and villages. She made the journey with her father and grandmother to the relative safe haven of Uganda to join the 1.2 million refugees. Niyosenga remained out of education in DRC until the age of nine as the long walk to school was too dangerous with roads closed by police or rebel militia.To help pay for Niyosenga’s school fees her father grows maize while her grandmother, 72, weaves baskets.Jasme, 10, is enrolled at a buildOn school in Perigny. Her two brothers and three sisters all attend the same school. Unlike the reported 300,000 restavek children that live away from their biological parents, Jasme lives with her family.Esperence, 10, goes to Perigny school. Seated on a bench at the end of a long dark corridor, overcome with emotion, he explains how he was given up by his biological parents at the age of eight. He now lives with his auntie and is a restavek child. The term restavek comes from the French rester avec, to stay with. Discussing the work around the house he has to complete as part of his daily chores, he explains: “I can never go out and play with my friends as my house family always call me back inside to do more jobs.”Yean, six, lives in Phnom Penh. Yean’s mother, a widow, feels helpless as she simply cannot earn enough to support her family. Today, Yean lives with her 80-year-old grandmother Khzm Men in Sensok 5, a settlement in the village of Kohmouta on the outskirts of Phnom Penh. The settlement was relocated from one of the capital’s inner city slums areas. Yean attends public school on the periphery of the settlement but due to the informal school fees system in Cambodia, she is forced to consider dropping out due to lack of funds. Yean is desperate to continue her education to fulfil her dreams of becoming a nurse, but without assistance her dreams seem out of reach.Charles, 16, lived with his mother and father in DRC. The Marekera family were forced to leave because their son was persecuted for being an albino. His father was repeatedly beaten after refusing to sell Charles to witchdoctors, who believe teeth, fingers and eyes brought good luck to those who bought their body parts. The transition for Charles arriving in Uganda from DRC has left him with large gaps in his education. Leaving as a senior in secondary school, he now finds himself back in primary school – and facing a similar stigma as an albino in Uganda. His long walks to school are interrupted by strangers attempting to lure him away to profit from the sale of his body parts. Charles explained: “I will never feel safe, however my safety now is less important to me than getting an education. I am determined to get my diploma and have a job where I can help protect the rights of other albinos.”Athar, 21, a beneficiary of Al Fakhoora, a programme of the Education Above All Foundation, was the youngest member to join the writers’ association, aged 14. She stressed the importance of explaining what is happening to the Palestinian people. Five years ago the conflict changed her life forever. She said: “The house was full of our relatives, suddenly everything went dark. I tried to get out of the house, I felt a pain in my leg and there was so much blood. I lost consciousness and woke in the ambulance. Hospitals ran out of anaesthetic so doctors stitched injuries I sustained without it, it was incredibly painful. I heard the news that my father was killed. Losing him was incredibly difficult for me as we were so close.” As a child, Athar had dreamt of becoming a writer or a poet. She said: “My father was my inspiration, encouraging me to write, since his death I have struggled to write anything. For me education is like food or fuel, an energy that gives me power to keep going.”Moza was born and raised east of the Tigris river that ides the city of Mosul. Her parents and five siblings have lived in a two-room concrete dwelling for 10 years. Farhan, Moza’s father, works as a labourer carrying blocks on construction sites across the city. He is in need of a hernia operation, which will cost £200, and finds work extremely difficult. He can’t afford six months off work to recover. The family income is only £62 per month, which barely covers bills. They are forced to take credit from shops to be able to eat. Moza is due to enrol back into schooling. However, at present, she cares for her mother who suffers respiratory problems due to a lodged bullet in her lung after being caught in crossfire during the conflict. She doesn’t know what to expect as she has never set foot in a classroom. Two years beyond the normal enrolment age of six, she still has great dreams of working with NGOs to help residents displaced from the city.Jonas, 12, was born in a village situated on the shores of Lake Victoria. He now lives with his father, a fisherman, and his step-mother a farmer. Jonas enrolled into an Educate A Child (EAC) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT) partnership in 2017. GMT conducted a survey reaching out to the community to help identify out-of-school children in the region. The survey identified more than 20,000. Jonas was one of those and set foot into a classroom for the first time at the age of 10. The mandatory age for school enrolment is seven, however his family’s lack of available funds meant he could not enrol into school. Also childhood illnesses, easily treated by relatively inexpensive medicines, meant he spent a huge part of his childhood unwell as his father could not afford treatment. When asked what it was like to take his first steps into a classroom, he replied: “It was incredibly exciting, and now it is even more exciting as there is a good chance I will go to secondary school.”Ali, nine, a Syrian refugee family from Deir ez-Zur district in eastern Syria arrived in Lebanon in 2011. They fled their home with several neighbours by bus toward a safer haven in Lebanon at the outbreak of civil war, which tore through their country. Heavy shelling bombarded their bus and the remainder of their journey had to be made on foot. Nine-year old Ali Ahmed’s father, an agricultural labourer explained that life in Lebanon was hard as they struggle to pay basic bills such as food and rent. As with most Syrian refugees, they are in debt to their landlords and to local shops owners. The collective family income is barely enough to cover any of their bills. Ali, one of the family’s 10 children, attends school 10km from home and dreams, one day, to be able to return home with his family to Syria.Chacha, 12, was born and raised in a small village in northwestern Tanzania, where he lives with his mother and two siblings. He has never set foot in a classroom and is one of a reported 1.89 million out-of-school children in the country today. Chacha works seven days per week scavenging gold mining sites, digging up rocks containing gold-residue. To avoid being captured or shot by mining and government police for trespass, he works under the cover of darkness, 6pm to 6am. The rocks he finds, he sells to middle men, for approximately £1.50 per shift, who crush them to extract the gold. He explained: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my family. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.” The money Chacha earns he uses to purchase clothes for himself and his siblings, the remainder he gives to his mother to contribute to food costs. When he returns home from his 12-hour shift, he tends to the family cattle.Owen, 16, has been enrolled in Buremba Primary School since 2007 and is one of eight siblings. Now in older years at school, he must pay more money. His parents are peasant farmers and work the land digging and picking tea, this means they must work most days to be able to keep up the payments. Buremba School is one of 60 new schools constructed under the Building Tomorrow and Educate A Child programme in Uganda.Afat, 12, left his home in Deir ez-Zor, Syria six years ago, forced out by the civil war which displaced millions of people, in his case to the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon. He is one of the thousands of Syrian refugee children sat in doorways of Lebanon’s many tents, shelters and makeshift homes dreaming of an education. Instead, he works 11 hours a day collecting scrap metal which he sells for around £2.50. He knows he has a right to education, but he is concerned to help provide for his family. He dreams of one day being able to return home to Syria with his family, to a better life.Mamoke, 10, has never been to school. Abandoned by her biological parents along with her eight siblings, she now lives with her grandmother in the village of Kuriyah. She grazes cattle six hours a day for her grandmother in return for her keep. She was registered for school but never enrolled. Her grandmother and  is unable to afford the voluntary parental contribution fees. Mamoke describes her household as poor, her grandmother unable to provide more than one meal per day for her. Mamoke added: “There are many days where we do not eat at all.” She dreams of becoming a teacher, if she was able to go to school, so she can help others in her current situation.Ikiriza, 5, Kamwenge District, Uganda. Ikiriza who is five years old lives in a small house with his nine brothers and sisters. His parents can’t afford school tuition fees for all the children, leaving Ikiriza with little choice but to fund his own education by working weekends carrying plastic jerry cans of water from the lake for various households of the neighbourhood in Kamwenge district. For this, he earns the equivalent of 5 US cents a day, which helps contribute towards his school fees at Bisozi Primary. He dreams of one day becoming a doctor so that he can help his father who suffers from ill health.Rami, six, lives at Beach Camp, on the sea front amongst the heart of the fishing community al-Shati in the northern Gaza Strip. Rami walks amongst the rubble of shelled buildings, a reminder of past and present conflicts. Restriction to employment and travel have meant many Palestinians are confined in Gaza. Some bright lights still shine as Rami attends grade P1 in school and dreams of becoming a footballer one day.Abdul 10, with his gaze to the floor, wrapped in blankets, huddles by the family stove. His father, Muhammad, emerges from the black of the adjoining room clutching an armful of medical documents written in French, a language he cannot read. His son is two years overdue a heart operation that would save his life. Srey, three, lives in a small dark room with her parents, siblings and relatives. A total of eight people live in a cramped, damp space in a makeshift barn of corrugated metal on the edge of the railroad tracks in the urban slums. The CYMCA Facility drop-in centre, funded in partnership between EAA and Aide et Action, provides emergency education to around 80 children in the area.Joender, six, from Maracaibo in Venezuela arrived in Ipiales, Colombia, after a 33-day journey mainly on foot. He is one of 3.5 million Venezuelan refugees that have left their homes following a catastrophic economic meltdown of his country leaving its citizens starving with no access to food, employment, medical services or education. He holds a packet of crackers, a kind donation from one of the many generous Colombians offering support to the Venezuelan people.Kennedy, 13, displaced to Uganda. He is another statistic of the 2.3 million South Sudanese refugees that fled the outbreak of civil war. Uganda alone shouldering 800,000 refugees. Kennedy was denied a normal childhood and instead became a witness to violence, torture and death in war. Not surprisingly, Kennedy’s family were unwilling to send him to school with threat of armed attack, abduction or recruitment by militias. On arrival in Uganda, Kennedy was still held back from attending school and fulfilling his dream of becoming a doctor. His parents were simply unable to afford the cost of a pair of shoes required for enrolment.“The canvas Billingham bags which carry the tools of my trade. They have sat beside me in the dust of countries around the world listening with me to every word of every story. I feel torn staring at them, joy at returning to my loved ones and the heartache of those I had to leave behind. Now they sit on the polished floor of my room, zipped up and lined up. I need them closer, to feel their weight on my shoulders again, I need to be away.….”David, 13, arrived in Uganda in July 2016 fleeing the civil war that broke out in South Sudan. He arrived with his mother and father and his eight brothers and sisters after two days of walking. He recalls seeing many dead bodies lining the sides of the tracks that led to Uganda’s northern border. The family were fearful of abduction by rebel groups or becoming caught in crossfire between the government and militia groups.

He holds his father’s hand as they both huddle\u0026nbspby the stove for warmth. He has the haunting stare of a boy who knows he is\u0026nbspgoing to die, an expression that cuts through the paraffin haze of the dark room as temperatures fall below zero. Mohammed, his father, gaunt from grief, explains\u0026nbsphis son is two years overdue for an operation that could save his life.\u0026nbspWith no means to finance it, he raises\u0026nbsphis hands to the sky in hope that his prayers would be answered.\u0026nbspI remember waiting to see my doctor as a child.

He was offloaded with his family from a galvanised lorry like cattle, after a 33-day journey, mostly on foot, where they were forced to beg for food to survive.

But she nonetheless still dreams that somehow she could become a teacher to help others like her with no access to education. I didn\u0027t have a choice.\u0026nbspI had to go to school. Mamoke didn’t have a choice, but that was because the right of education was unavailable to her. I realise I have taken so much\u0026nbspfor granted in my life. Children around the world live with no access to healthcare, displaced from their home, going to sleep hungry, growing up in conflict and with no\u0026nbspeducation.I did not choose my career any more than I chose my life. It chose me, and it is the greatest privilege, a blessing and a burden in the same breath. I\u0026nbspwill continue to hold the world to account, hoping\u0026nbspit will eventually force the changes that will create better choices for those who deserve them.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And then he also didn’t notice when the car span round and hit the front of his lorry again.And finally he didn’t notice when he was ­actually pushing the car SIDEWAYS along the busy dual carriageway.The man in the Golf was presumably leaning on his horn as hard as he was leaning on his brakes. Everyone in every other car on the road was also leaning on their horn and gesticulating.But still, chummy in the cab kept rolling along. I have spoken to lorry drivers about how this could be possible and they say that in the Daf truck that our friend was driving, it isn’t.They say that in a Volvo you sit so high up, your view of the road ahead is obscured by clouds and solar flares. But the seating ­position in a Daf is ­famously low down.So he MUST have noticed that instead of a teddy tied to his radiator grille, he had a full-sized Golf. Me though  I have another suggestion.Yes, the Golf’s tyres would have been making a right old din buthe’d had the radio on, maybe he didn’t hear them.And sure, it takes quite of lot of effort to push a Golf sideways along the road. But the engine in that Daf is designed to haul tonnes, and at the time of the incident no trailer was attached.Now that I’m a farmer, I understand the problem here. All my neighbouring farmers say that my new tractor is far too large.To which I say that tractors are like penises. And therefore cannot be too large. They also say the  horsepower it develops is too much.And on that, I sort of know what they mean. In a less powerful tractor you can sense when the ground is soft or the load is too heavy.But in mine, I just sit there listening to the radio, not noticing that my cultivator on the back has become entangled in a hedge and is ripping the whole thing out of the ground.Once, I turned round after I’d done a nice straight line across a field, to find I’d been pulling a whole postcode behind me.There were houses, schools and even a ­couple of churches in the mountain of mud I’d been dragging along.If I somehow hit a Volkswagen in my tractor, and I couldn’t see it out of the window, I definitely wouldn’t notice.Any more than I’d noticea baby wren landed on the roof. I’m sure that for the Golf driver on the A, it must have been a pretty scary moment. I sympathise with him.But I also sympathise with the lorry driver who set off to work as a man and arrived as an internet sensation with no one to sympathise with him except me and an eye-witness called Ellie Goulding.WE were told on Wednesday that Australia had endured its hottest day EVER.But that’s not strictly accurate. Yes, the average temperature across the whole of the country was .Cand that’s pretty toasty.But several million years ago, the world was around ten times hotter than that.And back in the days when rock was still liquid and the continents were sorting themselves out, temperatures hovered round the clock at around ,C.So when scientists say Australia has had its hottest day ever, what they mean is: “Australia has had its ­hottest day since records began.”Which in geological time is about . of a second.Hmmm. I wonder what would have happenedan Argie businessman had been topped in London Big headlines in Buenos Aires, for sure. And maybe a fleet heading off to the Falklands again.WHEREVER my late mother is right now, she’ll be very happy, because Nicky Henson has died. She adored him.He was best known as the lothario from Fawlty Towers, but she loved him best for his stage performance in Noises Off.She loved him so much, in fact, thatmemory serves, she went to see him every night for about a year.However, I will be saying to my children on Christmas morning: “Sorry, kids, I’ve got you nothing.”Because it was so sweaty and horrid in there, I walked through the door, turned round and walked straight out again.IF you are wondering what to watch on TV over Christmas, may I suggest The Last Ship, on Amazon Prime.The executive producer is Michael Bay, which means everything blows up all the time.It features a really cool destroyer, some really bad baddies and some really cool goodies who say: “Secure the perimeter” every five minutes.Best of all, though, it stars the incomparable Rhona Mitra, whose work, and face, I’ve admired for years.THE Labourites squabbling over who will be their next party leader are all saying they’ll keep Jeremy Corbyn’s policies alive.This is excellent news because, in five years, we will get yet another chance to keep them out of Downing Street.SO, there’s a -year-old man in Norway who’s won  elite games of chess on the trot and is now the World Champion.That’s pretty impressive, but for Magnus Carlsen it’s just an aside, because in his local football league he’s a bit of a star as well.In fact, last time out, he scored  goals. At two, he could solve -piece jigsaw puzzles. By five he could recall the size, population and flag of every country on Earth.And by  he’d become a chess grandmaster. You’d imagine, then, that with such a mind he could do anything with his le. Unwrap the secrets of cold fusion.Conquer the problems of faster-than-light travel. Work out how you can open the wrapping of a Gillette razor using only your hands. But no.Instead, Magnus turned his attention to fantasy football, where, inevitably, he’s thrashed seven million other players to become the best in the world.As I write, he’s about to beat the all-time record of  undefeated games. And why did he do this, when he could have achieved so much more Well, it might have something to do with the fact he’s Norwegian. The Norse don’t like to make a fuss.They don’t like to stand out. Which is why, in the country’s entire history, all they’ve ever invented is the cheese kne.Except Diane Abbott and Jeremy Corbyn.

But not quite.Even we, though, didn’t dare to dream that a proper Brexit — no customs union, no single market, fully taking back control — would pass by a thumping margin under a Boris Johnson Government beginning five years in power.The Remainer wreckers are gone. Yet, incredibly, Brexit was STILL opposed by the twitching corpse of the Labour Party in a last, spiteful two-fingered gesture to its former voters.What don’t these MPs get  They bet the house on a “people’s vote” and lost. And yet they still witter on about second referendums, customs unions or otherwise tying ourselves to the EU.One voice seemed to speak sense. “We recognise the clear message from the public,” said Jeremy Corbyn. “We have to respect that and move on.”Then, ridiculously, he led his rabble through the lobby to vote against Brexit one last time.A historic day, with Labour yet again on the wrong side of it. And for Corbyn, a dismal end to his inglorious week of sullen silence and door-slamming petulance.WE’RE confused.One minute Corbyn takes responsibility for his defeat. The next he blames hostility from “billionaire Press barons”.He cannot grasp a simple reality about The Sun. If we fear a wannabe Government will wreck the economy and destroy our readers’ jobs, we oppose it.But the Left think anyone not devoted to socialist purity must have corrupt motives. And for these zealots the answer is an even more left-wing leader. Maybe contender Clive Lewis, who makes Corbyn look like Norman Tebbit.Unless they grow out of this, they will spend their lives in impotent opposition.IT is high time to end voter fraud, using compulsory photo ID. We are delighted the Tories aim to do it.The Left always protests it is so rare it is not worth the fuss. Whatever could they be worried about  Surely not that the poorest will be deprived of their vote, since photo IDs will be free. What other motive could they have There is a wealth of first-hand or anecdotal evidence of people voting multiple times in dferent constituencies, stealing someone ’s vote, voting by post AND in person and so on.Conviction rates are low only because the system is so wide open it is hard to spot and catch offenders. But this is a serious crime meriting jail every time.And when so many routine tasks now require ID, one as vital to our democracy as casting your ballot certainly should.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Because who wants to sit there being sold to Those were simpler days.So much has changed, including a new profession coming into existence: The influencer.The problem with influencers is that it’s impossible to tell whether they are enthusiastically mentioning products because they love them or because they are being paid to.Eventhey really love a certain cream or tea, when money changes hands, the water is muddied.We like to believe people would only promote products that make their lives better.But the clue is in the name. Anyone whose job title is “influencer” is being paid to sway their followers into buying things they otherwise would not.As a result, we don’t know who to trust.This was illustrated this week by Lauren Goodger being caught on camera for a BBC show agreeing to promote a drink containing hydrogen cyanide.The reality TV star was secretly filmed during a meeting where she was asked to promote a fake diet drink named Cyanora — said to contain the deadly chemical hydrogen cyanide — on Instagram.It was part of an investigation by the documentary into whether celebrities consume the products which they are paid to promote.The alacrity with which Goodger agreed to promote this fake product was alarming.Similarly worrying, to demonstrate her willingness to promote a product she had never tried, she talked about how she promoted another product, Skinny Coffee, which in January she claimed helped her lose lb in three weeks.“I never tried Skinny Coffee,” she admitted.To drive the point home, she added: “I’ve even had my own friends message me, ‘Laur, can you get me some of that Skinny Coffee, does it work ’ . . . I’m like, ‘Do you not know this by now ’ And they’re actually going and buying it and I’m like, ‘You know how this works’.”At least she is honest. When she doesn’t realise she is being recorded.By way of explanation, a representative for Goodger said: “Lauren was asked to . . . appear in an advert for a new water.“There was no mention of what the water contained before the meeting. The money on the table was quite a large sum.”Goodger herself said: “As with any audition, you people-please and say what they want to hear.“They asked me, ‘Would I promote the drink without using it ’ In the heat of the moment, I said yes and also said I hadn’t tried Skinny Coffee — in the hope of getting the job.“I would never promote anything on my Instagram that I don’t feel is right for my followers and that I haven’t used. The sit-down meeting after the audition was filmed undercover without my knowledge.”So I guess we take this to mean that had she known she was being filmed, she wouldn’t have been so up-front about the real role of an influencer.It is easy to forget that influencers are paid to promote products.Even those who start off promising to recommend only things they like are probably susceptible,the price is right. Andthat is the case, how can we believe anything is a genuine endorsement So, who can we trust  Let’s start with ourselves. Instead of handing our likes and values over to be decided by so-called influencers, we should remember our own sense of self and what we like and dislike.And let’s go back to another thing from the good old days: Trusting real friends instead of Instagram ones.FALLON SHERROCK made history this week as the first woman to beat a man at the PDC World Darts Championships.She was so surprised to beat Ted Evetts - at Alexandra Palace on Tuesday she wept tears of joy, saying: “I have proved we can play the men and we can beat them!”Fallon, , who until four years ago was a professional hairdresser, first picked up darts at the age of .She later added: “I can’t believe what I achieved. I’m so happy.I always had the game but us women have never had the opportunity to prove it.”Very true. But isn’t it mad  There is no reason why a woman can’t play darts as well as a man.But it also needs people to stop treating it like a service for plasters, reassurance and insignicant ailments.Take the man on C’s  Hours In AE who turned up at hospital with a stf neck.Issuing fines to time-wasters is the only way people will start to realise how valuable our NHS is – and how we need to treat it with the respect it deserves or risk losing it.I AM pleased the judge’s decision to impose two le sentences on “Black Cab Rapist” John Worboys could see him die behind bars.Mrs Justice Gowan handed Worboys, , a minimum term of six years for attacking four women and he will have no chance of parole before .Worboys, one of Britain’s worst sexual predators, now goes by the name John Derek Radford and has been in jail since  for abusing  other victims.It is believed he plied more than  women with drink laced with sedatives from a “rape kit” kept in his cab.The judge told him he may never be released, branding him “still dangerous”.For once, in this case le really does mean le. It is likely he will die in prison.And just think: Last year, the idiots on the Parole Board were actually going to let him out.PHOTOS of Beyonce at rapper Diddy’s th birthday party are jaw-dropping.She looked a million dollars in that dress .But also, who knew Alexis Carrington’s  Dynasty fashion was back  I guess we do now.JUSTIN Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, has been on the receiving end of some unfair bashing of late.Firstly he was accused by some of being a “leftie Remainer”. Then others called him a Tory. Obviously he can’t be both.To be called a racist by voices on the Left for defending the Chief Rabbi was outrageous.The Archbishop was criticised when he effectively backed the Chief Rabbi’s comments about the Labour leadership’s record on anti-Semitism with a tweet highlighting the “deep sense of insecurity and fear felt by many British Jews”.Welby has done some great stuff lately, including going to ebola zones against all advice.Not only that, his voice is vital at this time of year as the country needs to come together post-election and at the start of a new decade.He was right to defend the Chief Rabbi and we should come together to support him as the leader of the Church of England.It is a tad violent, but it is great.Ben Hardy plays a guy who is an expert in extreme sport parkour .I met Ben when I was on ITV’s Lorraine this week.He is a lovely man and a great actor.I ADMIRE Sharon Osborne’s honesty about what she has done to look the way she does.Namely, she has spent £, on a facelt, tummy tuck, eye lt, abdominoplasty, liposuction and Botox, breast surgery, vaginal cosmetic surgery, and lost more than lb after gastric surgery.In the past, she has said: “There’s not much I haven’t had tweaked, stretched, peeled, lasered, veneered, enhanced or removed altogether.”Live and let live, I always say. Clearly Sharon is happy with the work she has had done and she looks great.Some people, we would say, grow old gracefully.

Decades of seeing the innocent robbed of their lives while the guilty were free to grow old.Years of knowing that those who planned the slaughter were lucky recipients of one of Tony Blair’s “letters of comfort” — meaning that under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, known ­terrorists would never be prosecuted.And so got away with murder. Until this week.Mrs Justice Yip ruled in the High Court that the IRA’s John Downey was an “active participant” and “knowingly involved” in the Hyde Park slaughter.“We’ve got justice,” says Sarahjane Young, who was four years old when she watched from the window of her nursery as her -year-old father, Corporal Jeffrey Young, was blown up. “We can call John Downey what he really is at last — a terrorist ­murderer.”The images of that terrible carnage are seared into the memory of anyone old enough to remember.The broken bodies of seven dead horses strewn across the park. The crumpled row of cars destroyed by a lb nail bomb that was built to tear apart flesh and blood and ­families, designed to break hearts and lives and inflict unimaginable human misery.And the heartbreakingly smiling faces of the dead seen earlier as they posed proudly in their Household Caly unorms.Lieutenant Anthony Daly, . ­Corporal Roy Bright, . And two teenagers who were already men.Trooper Simon Tipper, , just back from his honeymoon. And ­Lance Corporal Jeffrey Young, also , whose tiny daughter Sarahjane watched her daddy ride by, and then watched him die.John Downey’s fingerprints were found on car park tickets for the vehicle containing the nail bomb. So why has it taken so long to bring the guilty man to justice Because the families of the victims were forced to take out a civil action after the courts failed them.Criminal proceedings against Downey collapsed at the Old Bailey in  because he was one of  IRA members who secretly received one of Tony Blair’s “letters of comfort”.Blair bought peace with the IRA by assuring the men of violence they were no longer wanted for crimes committed during the Troubles.It is a bitter truth that you make peace with your enemies and not your friends. But for far too long the peace brokered by Blair has seemed wickedly, unforgivably one-sided.Hundreds of IRA men were free to live their lives while it took until THIS THURSDAY for Boris Johnson to promise in the Queen’s Speech that former veterans of the British Army who served in the Troubles would finally be free from witch hunts.That Downey has been brought to book at long last is thanks to the fierce determination of the bereaved families and to the generosity of the public, including Sun readers who raised £, to help fund their cause.“I want to thank all of you,” says Mark Tipper, brother of -year-old Trooper Simon Tipper. “You have no idea what this day means to all of us. My brother can sleep easy at last.”The verdict paves the way for the families to pursue Downey— currently on remand in Northern ­Ireland for the murder of two ­soldiers at Enniskillen — for damages of up to half a million pounds. But their success is inevitably tinged with bitter regret.Because it is a shameful stain on our justice system that the families of murdered soldiers were forced to wait  long years for justice.And it is a disgrace that these families were refused legal aid four times while Downey was awarded £, of taxpayers’ money to defend himself against criminal proceedings.And it is mind-boggling — is it not  — that the Labour Party just went into a General Election led by Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell, two failed politicians who have never made any secret of their ­puerile hero worship of the IRA.McDonnell had a plaque commemorating the “martyrs” of the IRA and INLA on the wall of his constituency office.In , Corbyn caused outrage when he invited Gerry Adams and other members of Sinn Fein to Westminster when there was still blood on the streets of Brighton after the IRA bombed the Grand Hotel.If Labour is ever again going to be a serious opposition party — let alone worthy of government — then the party must never again chose leaders who have spent their careers licking the boots of terrorists.And isn’t it a national disgrace that Tony Blair never sent his “letters of comfort” to OUR boys We all love Sir Paul. But when it comes to Christmas records, give me Bing Crosby, Noddy Holder or The Pogues.In fact, give me anybody but the man who thought “simply having a wonderful Christmastime!” sums up the magic of the season.SUDDENLY the national paralysis is over.You can feel it in the air. You can see it in Boris Johnson’s grin – especially when Jeremy Corbyn is by his side.How quickly the world moves on. How suddenly the new day breaks. How abruptly a catchphrase passes its best-by date.John Bercow’s “ORDER! ORDER!” seems as quaintly ancient as Larry Grayson’s “Oooh, shut that door!” or Dick Emery’s “Oooh, you are awful – but I like you!”Bercow is reduced to bellowing “ORDER! ORDER!” to the baffled viewers of Italian TV.He has even been spied shouting his hackneyed catchphrase at his fellow travellers on a south London bus.It seems like only last week that Bercow took enormous preening delight in bellowing, “ORDER! ORDER!” at the mother of all Parliaments.Now yesterday’s Speaker is shouting it on the number  to Catford.He should have borrowed one of Ken Livingstone’s newts.IT has been a bad year for boxing when your favourite fistic moment is Kate Beckinsale demonstrating her stf right cross for Women’s Health magazine.At the start of , it seemed inevitable that Anthony Joshua, Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder would have a series of fights to match the glory days of Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier and George Foreman.They somehow all avoided each other.With the Fury-Wilder rematch allegedly about to be announced for February, perhaps  will be better for boxing.Andit’s not – well, fight fans have always got Kate Beckinsale’s right hander.AFTER Mathew Horne’s late-night trolling of the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg, I am giving the Gavin  Stacey Christmas special a miss.You can watch performers you don’t care for.For example, I can’t stand Benedict Cumberbatch – the eco-activist who advertises cars in China – but I will watch Cumberbatch in Sam Mendes’ World War One film  next year because it sounds unmissable.But Gavin, Stacey and Mathew  I can live without it.Horne tweeted: “I really wish I loved myself as much as you, Laura . . . your ‘journalism’ knows no bounds . . . Resign, you disingenuous plopcarpet.”And plenty more of the same spiteful, semi-literate garbage.It is mind-blowing how totally lost these right-on Rada revolutionaries are when someone doesn’t write them a script.And voters really, REALLY don’t like it.EVERY one of the candidates who Hugh Grant campaigned for at the General Election lost. Lib Dem, Labour, male, female, anti-Brexit or . . .  actually, they were all anti-Brexit.It didn’t work – just as Steve Coogan telling Brexit supporters that we are ignorant did not make us rush out to vote to stop Brexit.I have come to believe that luvvie endorsements are totally counter-productive.They quite literally have the opposite effect that the smug, self-important thespians hope.The public take one look at Grant and Coogan – then vote exactly the opposite way. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently, or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, evenyou stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Paymentsyour payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free. You can find your nearest one on the Trussel Trust website.Jo said: Now we know what it is like to live on nothing, we have got used to going without.We have sold everything that we can possibly sell to keep ourselves going, but we just dont know how long we can last like this.At the minute, it looks like we will just be having sandwiches this Christmas, because we cant afford anything  after making sure that our kids have presents and are well cared for.This comes as another young family were forced into debt and had to rely on handouts after having a five-week wait to receive Universal Credit.A spokesperson for North East Lincolnshire Council said: We are in contact with Centre and have met a number of times to explain that we need to make up for the loss of the sports pitch.We have explained this position several times and what we’re doing to try and resolve it.The Council is supportive of the farm, and as landlord would be agreeable to the proposal.However, any sub-lease or change of use is subject to the necessary permissions and whilst we are doing our utmost to resolve the situation, there is a process to follow when someone wants to change the use of a sports field.We are working with Sport England to try to resolve this to allow their objection to the plans to be lted.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work. We want the government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Join our Universal Credit Facebook group or email UniversalCredit@the-sun to share your story.

It will have done the main thing that it was put in power to do within two months of taking office.The danger for the Tories is that their new electoral ­coalition was held together by a desire to Get Brexit Done and fear of Jeremy Corbyn, and both of those issues will soon be resolved.As the party’s campaign director, Isaac Levido, pointed out to Tory MPs on Wednesday afternoon, Brexit and Corbyn won this election for the Tories and both of them will be gone by the time of the next ­election, so the Tories have to deliver for their new voters or risk defeat.No  is acutely ­conscious of this risk. They know they need a new glue for their coalition — and fast.At Political Cabinet on Tuesday morning, this point was rammed home to ministers by both the PM and Levido.Levido, a clear-sighted Australian, warned the assembled secretaries of state that the Tories have “not won the domestic policy fight” yet.He stressed that this election had been about Getting Brexit Done more than any other issue.Tory support among Leave voters went from  per cent in  to  per cent, and that was key to the victory.Ministers were told that the party’s polling showed the positive things voters associated with the Tories were about sorting Brexit, while the negative things about Labour were to do with Corbyn or Brexit.Levido was clear that voters were backing the Tories to finish Brexit — not because they had suddenly become Conservatives. Another danger for the Tories is that Labour’s fundamental brand is nowhere near as damaged as many at Westminster think.With Corbyn gone and Brexit removed as an issue, the party may well be able to bounce back much faster than expected.Levido pointed out that the Tories’ own polling of  marginal seats had seen the gap between the two parties narrow to just four points in the aftermath of the manestos, as Labour briefly succeeded in turning the conversation away from Brexit.Boris Johnson and the Tory campaign pushed Brexit back to the top of the agenda.Levido was clear that for this reason the election could not be seen as a categorical rejection of Labour’s policies. The challenge for the Tories is to move fast to deliver change, so that people do not feel tempted to go back to Labour again.Do this right and, over the next decade, Darlington, West Bromwich and Wrexham will become Tory heartlands. Get it wrong and these places will turn red once again.Boris told cabinet ministers that voters needed to see and feel change in their local AE and on their roads and high streets.He said there needed to be a clear reduction in homelessness and voters must know that they and their family have a better chance of owning a home. This election made the Tories a national party again.Now they must show these new voters that their cares are Conservative concerns — and that the party knows how to fix the problems. They must deliver for the whole nation.WHERE is the geographical centre of the new Tory party  Well, before the election it was Buckinghamshire.Now it is South Yorkshire, where the Tories hold three seats – Rother Valley, Don Valley and Penistone And Stocksbridge.James Cleverly, the ebullient Tory chairman, has relished telling colleagues this fact. I understand that to reflect this new reality, the Tories are planning to move a large chunk of their party headquarters up north.The thinking is that by getting a chunk of the party operation out of London and into the North, it will make the party less London-centric and more attuned to the concerns of the rest of the country.BORIS JOHNSON is determined that next year must not be as dominated by Brexit as this year has been. He told Cabinet this week that once the UK leaves the EU on January , they should stop talking about Brexit.The PM argued that while the EU would try to create new clf edges and fresh moments of drama, the Government should resist being drawn into this dynamic.He argued that ministers should instead approach it as a normal trade negotiation rather than as some epoch-defining event.I am told that as part of the Government’s effort to de-dramatise things, they intend to resist going to Brussels for every negotiation – something which only adds to the tension and drama.I understand they want negotiations on both sides of the Channel rather than the UK always looking like a supplicant in heading to Europe to be told what it can and cannot have.As part of the effort to lower the profile of these trade talks, I am informed that David Frost – Boris’s understated but effective EU sherpa – will carry on conducting the negotiations.Frost, who is trusted totally by the PM and his inner circle, secured the changes to the withdrawal agreement that made it acceptable to Tory MPs. Having Frost conduct the negotiations rather than a cabinet minister will make them less likely to dominate the news.But there is no getting away from the importance of these talks to the UK. The deal will be the first trade deal the nation has done in -odd years and will be hugely important in determining the future economic direction of this country.The Tories calculate that, for his part, Sir Keir Starmer, the strongest Shadow Cabinet advocate of a second referendum, would deepen Labour’s problem in Leave-voting seats.The only candidate currently causing some concern is Jess Phillips – regarded as the high-risk, high-reward option for Labour.But given her low standing with the Corbyn-backing membership, she is not currently looking like a top- tier candidate.WHEN two or three ministers are gathered together, they start to nervously whisper about the February reshuffle.It is expected that this reshuffle will be big and coincide with the changes to Whitehall that Boris Johnson is keen to introduce. He wants to create some new departments, merge others and even shutter some.Boris’s old allies, though, are warning against a shake-up that sees too many of them replaced.One confidant of this group tells me Boris’s new support base in the party is “a mile wide and an inch deep” and that he needs to keep close those who have been loyal to him through thick and thin.One person who is certain to be rewarded in the reshuffle is Brandon Lewis, the Security Minister.Johnson’s team were impressed by his work during the campaign and want to use him more in the media.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Trussell Trust, the charity that oversees a network of foodbanks across the country, is predicting record numbers will visit foodbanks this month. New data released shows December was the busiest month for foodbanks last year - and that trend is expected to be mirrored this year. And new figures showing demand in Birmingham, West Midlands has rocketed by %. Jane Haynes , politics  people editor at Birmingham Live met the people in crisis who desperately rely on Sparkhill Foodbank in Birmingham.Young mum Courtney, , is one of hundreds people across Birmingham in the West Midlands to visit a foodbank. She has to take three buses and travelled for more than an hour to get to Sparkhill Foodbank with her toddler son after running out of food. Cash she set aside for food shopping has to be spent on electricity to heat the freezing cold council flat she lives in, after her little lad fell ill. She said: Usually I donapost have the heating on much, itaposs electric heaters so itaposs really expensive. But my babyaposs not been well, so Iaposve had to keep it on for longer than I should have. She also revealed how the extra cost of feeding the meter has wiped her out of an extra £, and sheaposs got two weeks to wait until her next benefits payment. “That’s all my money, gone. The flat is so cold. I was worried about my baby, heaposs been poorly. I couldnapost let him get cold. I had to have the heating on constantly. “If it was just me I’d manage, I don’t mind going without food. But I’ve got him to think of.”  Nadia is another person who is forced to visit a foodbank who is financially struggling. Despite the extra expense, she runs a car so she can get her kids to three dferent schools across the other side of the city from her temporary home. She said: If I didnapost drive them there is no way they would make it into school on time. Itaposs the only way. Education is really important - I donapost want them to miss school just because we are struggling. Sheaposs also terried that when the schools break up for Christmas her children will no longer get the free breakfasts and lunches provided at school. Itaposs really hard. Some people have no idea, she said. Sitting nearby is Tina. Pain is etched on her face as she confides that she’s too ashamed to let her teenage kids, aged  and , know that their food is coming from the foodbank.  “I don’t want them to know how bad it’s got, I don’t want them to worry. But I honestly don’t know what  to do, or where  to go. It’s so hard.” Jodie is a young mum of six, and when her relationship with their dad broke down in October she found her benefits were slashed almost before her partner’s retreating back had disappeared. “As soon as I told the benefits people what had happened that was it, my benefits were cut right back to a single claim. It’s a dference of £, a month. I’ve still got the same bills, same rent, and arrears but no money.”  Her six kids, boys and girls aged four to , share a room in the two bed council flat the family have lived for a decade. “We got the flat when we just had two kids. I’ve been asking for a bigger house but the council kept saying they have nothing and tell us to keep bidding.” The are not alone in their despair. During a two hour visit to Sparkhill Foodbank, there’s a steady stream of people needing help. There are hugs, smiles, prayers and sympathy, and tea by the load, as foodbank boss Les Allen, his assistant Emma Gowers and a team of dedicated volunteers work hard to raise spirits and give help.  They will feed around  people this week during the four hours they are open. There will be be more than this next week, people driven to seek help by the cold and Christmas. “The colder it gets the more people we see,” says Les.Itaposs a despairing situation.

They were all excited because the pilot had done the whole pretending Santa had landed on the plane and was guiding us in. There were just no explanations, it was absolutely appalling. Annette Williams, from London, was travelling with her sister and two young nieces as a Christmas treat. She said: This was not a business trip that can be rescheduled next week, this was a once in a letime trip for families that may never be able to be repeated. There were elderly grandparents on board, children who still believe in Santa, but will not next year, and a truly heartbreaking family where this trip represented a hope to make Christmas special after the untimely death of a father of two small children. There was a lack of plan B to get food supplies on board. I believe it was only due to the patience and ability of the many parents on board who played games with the children and who ensured they held their anger that this did not turn into a much tenser situation on board. All credit to those people- zero marks to Jet and Canterbury. Another mother, who wished to remain anonymous, forked out over £ for the trip. She said: They have ruined Christmas. My children were absolutely devastated.  And to be offered a stale roll or charged for some chocolate was just disgraceful. There was no duty of care at all and to be quite frankyou canapost look after your passengers you shouldnapost be doing this at all. A spokesman for Canterbury Travel said: We are desperately sorry and apologise profusely to all our clients who missed out on their dream trip which sadly turned into an ordeal due to unexpected weather conditions. But safety is paramount. The authorities closed the airport after the previous inbound plane landed and reported dangerously runway conditions with snow falling on ice which affected the braking of landing aircraft. As a result, our passengers were erted to another airport as efforts were made to de-ice the runway instead of turning back for home and disappointing the families on board.

As a result, we’ve told our children not to expect much at Christmas in the way of expensive presents. However, I know when we go to my parents’ house, they’ll make a huge fuss of them, buy lots of gts, and so will my brother and his we – in fact, their kids will no doubt show up with iPhones and games consoles, and so on.   I feel embarrassed by our situation and I know the whole thing will stress my husband out, too. He’s quite a proud guy and I know my brother winds him up sometimes because he’s quite flash. Do you think I should speak to my parents in advance and ask them to tone down the present giving  I’m especially worried about our kids seeing their cousins with expensive things from their parents, when we can’t do the same for them. It’s the first time I haven’t looked forward to Christmas and it’s ruining the thought of the holidays for me. Coleen says The whole point of Christmasis to be kind and enjoy the chance to spend some time with the people we love. Having said that, I obviously know the pressure of pester power from children. Look, I don’t think you should stop your mum and dad spoiling the kidsthey can do it – that’s what grandparents are for and it should take some pressure off you. I think it’s good you’ve explained to your kids that money is tight – ­understanding the value of things and why you can’t always get what you want is an important le lesson. My nieces went through a similar thing when their parents split up and my sister told them to expect one present that Christmas. And of course the rest of the family pitched in and spoiled them.

Now you are getting over a .The rush used to begin at the beginning of November. The most Iaposve had is probably about  in a day, especially at this time of year because itaposs Christmas and Hermes have taken on a lot more companies. Danni usually covers Llantwit Major but her jobs can sometimes take her as far as the lighthouse in Nash Point or over to St Athan. As someone with both an under active thyroid and hemochromatosis - a disorder which affects the amount of iron in your body - it does take it toll. She said: It makes me really really tired but I get on with it. I like speaking to people, meeting animals - especially dogs, Dannii laughs.  Iaposm always fatigued but once I get out Iaposm happy to do it. Iaposm just generally a people person. Especially the elderly, they can get a bit lonely so when you come they like to have a chat. Iaposm  and I grew up here. My dad is deputy mayor so a lot of people know me anyway so they just message to askthey can pick something up. I live at a cross roads sopeople are not at home I put that a parcel is with their neighbour and say itaposs at my house so they can come and collect it. Danni has since urged people not to slate delivery drivers who deliver their post.She said: We try to help people out as much as possible but what really annoys me is people slating us on Facebook .People donapost realise what we go though, itaposs taxing on my car, on my body. Go on Facebook but just ask who your local Hermes driver is for the area. Donapost slate us. But a lot of people say thank you and are really appreciative. The amount that will askIaposm freezing and say come in for a cup of tea. They do respect you but you have the random ones [who donapost]. Writing on on Facebook, Dannii said: So over six days I have delivered  parcels and thataposs not including collections. Taken up most of my day, time away from family too.I am very grateful I have a job but please understand that over  parcels a day in this freezing, horrible weather is a task and a half.

Every detail of the Duke of Edinburghaposs le had been scheduled, monitored and directed. Under constant scrutiny as the husband of Queen Elizabeth II, his le has been dedicated to public service. But since the Duke of Edinburgh withdrew from public le two and a half years ago, he has become somewhat of a recluse, shutting himself away in a farmhouse. He lives alone in Wood Farm on Sandringham estate after transforming it into a private retreat. There he enjoys his time tucked away from the other royals, reading, painting watercolours and having friends to stay. A friend of the royal said the Queen feels the Duke has earned himself a ‘proper retirement’ after being aposon dutyapos since the pair married in .They told the Daily Mail : “She knows him too well —he was still at the centre of royal le he’d feel he had to be involved. “Being at Wood Farm means he’s not too far away, but far enough to be able to relax.” However, the Prince has suffered a few setbacks after he narrowly escaped a car crash in January.  Despite escaping the collision unscathed - when his Land Rover Freelander flipped after hitting a vehicle carrying two women and a baby - it has impacted him in other ways. Days after the incident, he jumped straight back behind the wheel but was forced to give up his driving freedoms after a public outcry. Now he can only drive alone around the royal estates but must be accompanied by a driver everywhere . A courtier said: It meanshe wants to go anywhere he is dependent on somebody , and things canapost be as spontaneous as he likes.

Andrew Page, , was ing with friends off the coast of Bundaberg in Queensland, Australia, when he failed to suface. Rescue workers spent days searching a -mile area of water and coast land, but the search was called off on November . Three weeks after the rescue operation ended, a human leg washed up on a beach  miles south of Elliott Heads - where Andrew had first vanished. Forensic analysis confirmed last night the leg belonged to Mr Page, and fears are now growing he may have been attacked by a shark. His heartbroken parents, Robert and Colleen, said they were not able to confirm the exact cause of death, but said their son belonged to the ocean, reports News. They said: An experienced free-er and spear fisherman, Drew’s heart belonged to the ocean. He used to say his gills were drying up whenever he was away from the water for too long. “We take small comfort in knowing that he will never have to feel that again. They said Andrew was taught to e by his father and had been ing since the age of eight. His parents added: Drew had an inspiring love of le and contagious excitement for adventure.  He was well known for his kind-heartedness and bubbly personality. In October, two British men were attacked by a shark while snorkeling in the Great Barrier Reef. Alistair Raddon, , from Southampton, lost his foot while swimming off Hook Island in eastern Auatralia.  Danny Maggs , , from Plymouth, also suffered lacerations to his right calf in attack. The pair had been swimming at a popular tourist spot on the Whitsunday Islands chain.

Robyn Bryant was  weeks pregnant with her first daughter when doctors told her to prepare for a very demanding time. Despite being given the option to terminate the pregnancy on several occasions Robyn remained determined to carry on. I didnapost know what the outcome was going to be but eventhe chances of survival were slim I was going to let nature take its course, she told Wales Online . It was an incredibly scary time. Robyn and her partner James Dury, from  Treorchy , Rhondda, found out that their unborn daughter Hallie was measuring small at a private gender scan. They picked up that Hallieaposs femur was a bit short and that she wasnapost growing how she should have been, said Robyn, . She was around two weeks behind. At the -week scan it was discovered that Hallie was measuring even further behind than predicted and Robyn was sent for a number of dferent tests. But all of them came back clear leaving the parents worried and confused as to what could be wrong with their unborn baby. When we first got told she was small we didnapost realise how serious it could be, she added. I only realised when I went for the foetal medicine appointment that it was likely the baby had an extra chromosome. I was very upset. Doctors told her that Hallie was likely to have skeletal dysplasia, the medical term for dwarfism where the arms and legs are short.  She was advised to go for for an amniocentesis, a test to check whether a baby has a genetic or chromosomal condition. I knew there was a risk of having a miscarriage with the test so I avoided it at first, said Robyn who also has a five-year-old son called Oliver. I kept booking it and cancelling it. But after further scans showed that Hallie had a number of complications, including a fused kidney, Robyn decided to go ahead with the test. I went to have the test but everything came back clear, she said. I wouldnapost say it was a relief because I would have loved and cared for her no matter what happened. But we just wanted to know what was wrong so we could sort out what care she might have needed. I lost my dad at that time too so I was a bit of a mess, she admitted. The week before Hallie was delivered she was weighing g, with a % leeway either side. If she was under g at birth the doctors said there was nothing they could have done for her as the equipment would have been too big. Robyn was taken back into hospital at  weeks, three months before her actual due date on January , . We were put onto a machine and monitors showed blips in Hallieaposs heartbeat so I was taken for an emergency caesarean, Robyn said.  They took me up to the delivery suite where they put me on an IV because they thought I was dehydrated but in reality Hallie was in distress. I was given so much emotional support before the delivery. I really opened up to the midwe. Robyn said she was completely overjoyed when Hallie was brought into the world crying and screaming on October , , weighing g, or lb oz. I just remember crying happy tears.

In his car crash Newsnight interview Andrew said he could not have been having sex with his accuser, Virginia Giuffre, the night she claims the pair had an encounter - because he was at Pizza Express with daughter Princess Beatrice.  During the pantomime when Washee’s brother Aladdin is turned into a prince by the Genie of the lamp so he can marry Princess Jasmine, Davro says: “Prince and royalty  You know what that means...we’ll be able to eat in Pizza Express in Woking with no sweat ! The scandal-hit Duke of York has faced criticism and calls to co-operate with the FBI after the interview about his paedophile pal Jeffrey Epstein and claims he had sex with a -year-old trafficking victim. The billionaire’s “sex slave” Virginia Giuffre, has claimed she was ordered to have sex with the Duke after being trafficked to London on board the Americanaposs private jet. Once in the capital, she says she went to Tramp with the Prince, Epstein and British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell. Giuffre, now , claims she danced with the Andrew who sweated profusely at the time before ing to Maxwellaposs house where they had sex.  The prince has “categorically” denied any sexual contact with Ms Giuffre - formerly Virginia Roberts - and has said he has no recollection of ever meeting her. He told BBC Newsnightaposs Emily Maitlis he remembers aposweirdly distinctlyapos eating with his daughter at a Pizza Express in Woking, as it was a rare visit. He says: I was with the children and Iaposd taken Beatrice to a Pizza Express in Woking for a party at I suppose sort of pm or pm in the afternoon. And then because the Duchess was away, we have a simple rule in the family that when one is away the other one is there.  The Duke then adds: Going to Pizza Express in Woking is an unusual thing for me to do, a very unusual thing for me to do. Iaposve never been...Iaposve only been to Woking a couple of times and I remember it weirdly distinctly. After his admission the restaurant was bombarded with fake review, many making reference to the allegations surrounding the prince. During the interview earlier this month Andrew, who afterwards sensationally quit public le aposfor the foreseeable futureapos  due to his links with disgraced Epstein, denied having sex with Miss Giuffre saying he is in the clear because he can’t sweat. Andrew said a condition from the Falklands War meant he was medically unable to perspire.

Philip was flown to King Edward VII’s hospital in Marylebone, Central London, which has been treating members of the royal family for decades, on Friday for what was described by Buckingham Palace as a precautionary measure. The Queen did not change her schedule and left Buckingham Palace for Norfolk by train, to begin her traditional festive break at her private Sandringham estate, where the duke spends much of his time since retiring from public duties. The Monarch hopes her husband will still be able to join the rest of the Royal Family for their festivities later in the week. However, a traditional shoot on Saturday was cancelled and the Queen did not visit her horses at the Sandringham stud.  The -year-old Duke is said to be in good spirits, and is even joking with doctors at the hospital. Meanwhile, the Queen put on a brave face smiling and waving at well-wishers on Sunday. It was business as usual for the -year-old monarch, who greeted  onlookers as she arrived at church for Sunday service on the ,-acre Sandringham estate in Norfolk.

Alison Taylor must live with the problem until well into the New Year. Hull City Council wrongly recorded that repairs had been completed - when in fact they have not even begun. Hull Live report that the -year-old had both a plasterer and a joiner at her home but both only measured up. That, it appears, was registered as job done by officials. So Alison, who suffers with gastroparesis, a chronic and incurable illness that means her stomach is often unable to digest food, faces an awful Christmas. Iaposm back and forth to hospital a lot - the last thing I need is this from the council, she said. Iaposve got so much going on with my health and itaposs been an absolute nightmare. Itaposs a constant battle. A  council  spokeswoman apologised for the error that had been made and said it had made arrangements for the repairs to be carried out in the new year.  Alison had wanted to have her home redecorated before Christmas so first complained about the damp in October in order to have the repairs made in time. She only moved into the property in Waveney Street in March, having originally been told she would be moving from her old home in January. The delay, she was told, was so the house could be freshly redecorated, including having new carpets fitted, before she moved in. But she said the new furnishings, which she has only just finished paying for, had to be ripped out within eight weeks after being destroyed by the damp in the walls. It seems like they moved me from one  bad house  into somewhere thataposs full of damp, she said.  When I first moved in I was told  the house  was perfect because I had to wait an extra two or three months to move in. It was freshly decorated with a new carpet fitted. But Iaposve had to throw loads of furniture away. It had just been redecorated and the carpet was totally destroyed. Alison said she and her carer had contacted the council in October because of the severe damp in her kitchen and living room walls and a joiner was booked in to come and remove and replace one of the units. A plasterer also came to measure up the walls, she said, but said he would have to speak to someone before carrying out the work because the damp would just cause even more damage within a matter of weeks.

Chloe Haines, , of High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, caused the Jet flight to be erted back to Stansted Airport on June . The alert also caused an RAF response which triggered a sonic boom near a built up area. The jets, from RAF Coningsby, Lincolnshire were dispatched to intercept the plane, causing a loud sonic boom, heard for miles around Essex and Cambridgeshire. She appeared before Chelmsford Crown Court today where she pleaded guilty to endangering the safety of an aircraft and to assaulting cabin crew member Charley Coombe.  The court heard she had to be restrained by cabin crew and fellow flyers during the dramatic Jet flight to Turkey. The woman repeatedly wiped tears from her eyes as she stood behind the re-enforced glass in the dock of courtroom one. Judge Charles Gratwicke adjourned sentencing until next month but warned Haines All sentencing options remain open”. But Oliver Saxby QC, for Haines, said the troubled young woman was now engaged in an Alcoholics Anonymous program. He also revealed that less than three weeks before the mid-flight drama on June  this year, Haines had been hit with a community punishment for offences but on the ground. He said: “She is a troubled young person with a number of serious issues. “ days before this occurred, she had been sentenced to a community order for not dissimilar offences. “There was a loss of composure and loss of control.” He asked for a pre-sentence report from the probation service, which Judge Gratwicke agreed to.  Haines also denied a charge of being drunk but Mr Saxby told the court ‘There is no question she was drunk, but the charge of endangering an aircraft was the ‘more serious alternativeapos. An earlier hearing at Chelmsford Magistratesapos Court heard how Haines got up after the flight tried to open doors screaming “Iaposm going to f***ing kill everyone, you are all going to f***ing die”. During the fracas she scratched cabin crew member Charley Coombe as she was brought under control. Prosecutor Katharine Houghton told the earlier hearing how Haines stood up shortly after take off and threatened cabin crew. She said: “She was told to sit back down, she appeared intoxicated and told cabin crew to ‘f*** off’ and then tried to open the flight door and emergency exit door. “She was restrained by cabin crew and passengers but was shouting ‘Iaposm going to f**king kill everyone, you are all going to f**king die’.”  Judge Gratwicke ordered that Haines not to travel from a UK airport as part of her bail conditions. They added: “This court needs to know far more about you. “It was a serious offence and, indeed, all sentencing options remain open.” "},{"url":null,"title":"young boy gets fright life","story":"NewsYoung boy gets fright of his le as tiger attempts to eat him at zooA young boy was given quite a scare when a large tiger charged at him at Dublin Zoo in the Republic of Ireland only to be thwarted inches away by a sheet of glassShareCommentsByMilo Boyd:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video young-boy-gets-fright-le-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news young-boy-gets-fright-le-\"\" to FREE daily email alerts from mirror - daily newsSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Bulgarian born Baba Vanga has been dubbed the aposNostradamus of the Balkansapos for her predictions. Despite dying  years ago, those with a keen interest in mysticism continue to revere Babaaposs work, which some claim looks forward to  - the year she believed the universe will end. Right before her death at the age of  she made a series of predictions for the year . The most startling revelation is that Vladamir Putin and Donald Trumpaposs lives are in danger. The Russian president could reach the end of his mortal coil thanks to an assassination attempt made from within the Kremlin. Almost as dramatically, the US president will fall ill with a mysterious illness which will leave him deaf and with a brain tumour. Those with long memories may remember Baba foretold that Putin and Trumpaposs lives would be in danger last year, suggesting some kind of cosmic rollover.  Another recurrent theme in her predictions has been the destruction of Asia. Baba foresaw that “a big wave will cover the shore and people will disappear underwater” in what some interpreted as the destruction of Thailand by a huge tsunami in . The outlook in  is equally as bleak, with more tsunamis and earthquakes scheduled to hit the continent. A meteorite is also predicted to fall on Russia.  Perhaps the most ominous prediction of the clairvoyant was that the European continent could reach the end of its existence at the hands of Muslim extremists The Bulgarian suggested that extremists would use an arsenal of chemical weapons against Europeans”. Supporters of Baba are keen to emphasise how spot on she has been, with % accurate a phrase that regularly crops up in fan forums. According to baba-vanga, the figure is drawn from research conducted by Professor Georgi Lozanov - a former director of the Bulgarian Institute of Suggestology. Others point to her past successes as proof that she had foresight beyond that of a typical human.  In  she guessed that America would be hit by two apossteel birdsapos in a terror attack, in what was later interpreted as a reference to  . She said: Horror, horror! The American brothers will fall after being attacked by the steel birds. The wolves will be howling in a bush, and innocent blood will be gushing. Babaaposs big breakthrough had come a year earlier however, when she accurately predicted the sinking of Russian submarine the Kursk. Before cancelling Christmas and ordering a nuclear bunker however, readers should know that some questions remain around Baba and her predictions - some of which have been proved to be way off the mark.  Her prophecy that Europe would cease to exist by  was clearly wrong, unless seen through an incredibly generous Brexiteer lense. Babaaposs suggestion that the  FIFA World Cup final would be played between two teams beginning with the letter aposbapos was equally wrong. The nuclear war pencilled in for the years  to  also failed to materialise. Perhaps more damning is the seemingly non-existent nature of her prophecies. While Baba may have spoken or written down her predictions in Bulgarian, no credible version is available to view. According to a  Washington Post investigation, the few prophecies that can be traced back to their origins appear to come from Russian social media. When Bulgarian newspaper  Chasa interviewed Babaaposs neighbours, they said she had never predicted  , the sinking of the Kursk or the big war.

Funds raised go towards the peace building work of the Peace Pledge Union, who are unashamedly against wars and the causes of wars.On Tuesday November  and Thursday November  we will be selling white poppies from the foyer of the Lochgilphead Co-op.Bob Dixon, MinardSir,I agree with the points made by Robert MacIntyre in last week#s edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser, when he says that the proposed education cuts are #madness#.This madness is being forced on councils by the SNP government and its Green Party allies at Holyrood, who for years have been voting for Scottish Government budgets which force councils to make cuts.Unless the SNP and the Greens change course and stop cutting the money they give to councils, this madness will continue.I hope that Mr MacIntyre, a former SNP councillor, will write to the leaders of the SNP and the Greens and demand they give councils enough money to stop these mad cuts.Councillor Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll and ButeDear AileenWe are responding to your recent consultation about the council budget.Whilst we are very sympathetic to the dficulties that all public bodies, including the Scottish Government, have faced as a result of a decade of austerity it is only fair to point out that this was imposed not by the Scottish Parliament, but by Westminster.The truth is that overall the Scottish Government has maintained the overall funding for local government, as a share of the overall budget, at around  per cent.Councils have, once again, the option of raising additional funds by increasing the council tax, something they have sought for a long while.The inidual share of the total funding allocated to councils is decided by COSLA, using a needs-based formula. Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"negotiating the modern world","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhy is it so hard to negotiate the modern world That is the question asked by Dame Helen Mirren in the Radio Times.

Last year the SNP councillors supported the administration’s budget, this year there were only slight dferences between the administration’s budget and the SNP’s one.It would be great to see our MP and MSP work with the council to make the case to the Scottish Government for more money for Argyll and Bute. COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each. Also the bands sold tickets along with their merchandise to give an extra £ approx to the cause.

Well done to all who were there and supported the whole event.Dan and crew, Mojo organisersSir,Among the many concerns caused by you-know-what is the very real fear that hospitals and high street pharmacies will run out of vital medical supplies which would normally arrive from factories in Malta, Hungary and Poland.So why are generic medicines not made in Lochgilphead, in Campbeltown and in Rothesay  After all, calcium supplement tablets are made in Galashiels by a Japanese brewery company.Glasgow Health Board built a brand new wee factory on the Western Infirmary Glasgow University campus  years to manufacture some but not all of their requirements. Not only did this save a great deal of money but the board  also earned considerable extra income by selling their products to other health boards, including Dumbarton and Argyll.All in all, the costs of building and equipping the Hillhead factory proved to be a very sound investment indeed.Duncan I Macdougall, TarbertSir,I write following last week#s open letter by SNP politicians Mike Russell and Brendan O#Hara in which they attempted to evade responsibility for the budget problems facing Argyll and Bute Council.These comments display extraordinary hypocrisy, revealing how out-of-touch these SNP politicians are with the realities of the challenges facing Argyll and Bute Council.The financial pressures on this council are a direct consequence of the repeated unfair financial settlements imposed on the council by the SNP government over the last  years.Brendan O#Hara should get on the phone to Nicola Sturgeon and demand a fair deal for Argyll and Bute instead of blaming everyone .Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters human impact on climate change then and now","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHuman activity from the industrial revolution onwards is causing global warming which,not halted, will have catastrophic consequences.Now scientists suggest that human activity several centuries earlier also caused climate change*.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban.

Freddie Paterson came forward to take the penalty but put his shot past the post.The game started flowing from end to end and Freddie Paterson made amends for his earlier miss when he found the back of the net on  minutes.

The games were well contested, and the Argyll boys could have won both games. Two lapses of concentration against Lomond let them in for easy tries and only two points separated the teams in the Shawlands game at the end, when SAS had been in the lead for large parts of the match.The whole team thought it was important to finish the group with a good home win.The boys set out their stall early at MacRae Park when a contested ruck ended with a good turnover from SAS number seven McLean and a great pass out to winger Gritten from number eight McColl-Smith, who then released MacKay. The full back ran  yards to score under the posts and then convert his own try.SAS were next on the score sheet when Captain Donald Self went over the whitewash. MacKay converted and SAS were  –  up.Some good play from both teams was making for a great game, enjoyed by a large home crowd. Pupils were given the chance to watch the game and they made their voices heard and, spurred on by the crowd, Euan MacArthur was next on the score sheet and once again MacKay converted the try.The first half finished - to the home team.The second half started with Boclair coming back at SAS and, after some good running, they pulled a try back.SAS found themselves under sustained pressure and soon Boclair had a second try. Only one try was converted, and the score was -. Another try, this one converted, for Boclair and the pressure was really on.South Argyll thought they had secured the game when Ellis went over and grounded the ball only to realise he had gone over the dead ball line. No try and the pressure was on again. Minutes later, after some great forward work to turn the ball over, McArthur again went over for South Argyll#s fourth try. Another two points from MacKay made the score -.After the restart Boclair went all out to get another score. Great defensive work from the SA backs kept Boclair out for a sustained period of attack until, with only seconds to go, the scored their fourth try.As the conversion attempt fell short the final whistle blew and South Argyll celebrated a hard-fought win.While South Argyll didn not get out of the group stages they can be very pleased with third place,only one point behind second spot."},{"url":null,"title":"a garden of festive delight","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNot your common or garden evening of entertainment, a special festive concert will be held next week near Minard.Friends of Crarae will present their annual carol concert at Crarae Garden on Thursday December .The evening will feature Cumlodden choir and guests and the audience is welcome to sing along.Festive refreshments and a raffle will be available at the concert, which opens at .pm for a .pm start.Tickets will cost £ on the door, and the National Trust for Scotland shop will be open for those last-minute gts."},{"url":null,"title":"an ardrishaig piano recital to remember","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSaturday November  was a cold and frosty day and, whilst the audience had the luxury of warm hats and coats to fend off the chill of a  degrees centigrade hall, this was not afforded to soloist of the day, the -year-old Ukrainian Russian pianist Vitaly Pisarenko.When many would, however, have struggled with the cold, from his first entry he appeared unphased by it and indeed gave us a memorable exhibition of astonishing virtuosity and musicianship.Each half of his well-balanced programme started with early Beethoven sonatas, beginning with his first, Op. No. . Dedicated to his hero, Haydn, this was delivered with the reverence it deserved and the clarity and drive of the final Prestissimo would have pleased the dedicatee no end.The first half ended with two Chopin Polonaises # Op.  Nos.  and  # and his third Ballade. The second Polonaise was particularly impressive with its menacing opening figure and Vitaly#s judicious use of the sustaining pedal lent great clarity to all three pieces and indeed to all his recital.After the intermission came Beethoven#s Sonata Op.  No. . By this time Beethoven had developed his own inidual persona and the three contrasting movements of this work were beautully executed, particularly the Adagio with its slow melody and stuttering accompaniment and the contrasting fluidity of the final Allegretto.Next we heard Bela Bartok#s Suite Op. . This was typical Bartok from beginning to end, spikey, angular and generally very speedy and played with incredible precision. When I said to Vitaly that it sounded fiendishly dficult he retorted: # It#s actually quite easy I learned it in three days.#While not normal fare for our audience this, hopefully, was an interestingFirebird is probably Stravinsky#s best known work apart from, maybe, his #Rite of Spring#, and both were originally written as ballet scores. However, due to their popularity, over time these and other works of his have been transcribed by ious people for all sorts of instrumental combinations, and the Agosti transcription of Firebird for piano solo that Vitaly played as his finale is probably the most well known. It makes huge demands on the soloist as Agosti endeavoured to encapsulate Stravinsky#s rich orchestration into a work for only two hands it only works in the correct hands and Vitaly#s were just such hands.This was an electrying rendition and not just for the sheer virtuosity as there were gorgeous quiet sections as well. The thunderous applause at the end said it all.Virtuosity is a given nowadays and over the years we have heard some fine pianists at Ardrishaig, but it was Vitaly#s musical integrity and attention to detail which was a cut above and truly inspirational. This was indeed a recital to remember.The concert, in Ardrishaig Public Hall, was staged by Mid Argyll Arts Association in association with Argyll and Bute Concert tours."},{"url":null,"title":"no need for stress shop local in festive lochgilphead","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNow there is need to rush out on your lunch break, or even break your neck heading into town before the Big Day # Lochgilphead retailers are opening late, so you can relax while getting your Christmas shopping finished.A #shop local# initiative is being promoted around town, encouraging shoppers to support local businesses by purchasing their Christmas gts and festive feasts locally.On Thursday December  many of Lochgilphead#s shops will be open late, including The Square Peg Marmalade Deli Danny#s Ironmongers Fyne Tackle Argyll Book Centre Breagha R  S Stovecraft Love Dove Studio The Sweetie Jar West Coast Home Fyne Living Bluestone Argyll Pharmacy Mary#s Meals Argyll Gt Company The Archway D  D Wool and Crafts and The Mail Box, including the post office, will also be offering the usual postal servicesyou have any gts still to send off.Rumour has it that some shops will also be offering festive nibbles and drinks, plus promotional offers and discounts."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 5 the nineteenth hole","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWelcome to Episode Season  Finale # Join presenters Stephen Day, George Graham and Keith McIntyre for more golfing chat about Bob and other golfing fun # with additional material from David McPhee, Bruce McNab, Neil Armour, and Charles Spreadburry.This week they discuss more golfing terminology, look at some stats and even answer a listener#s question.You can listen and or download all Episodes of The BOBcast below"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 13 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsNever mind the general election, with its deep isions and rancour, let alone the circumstances which brought it about.

This year’s winner, picked by the skipper, was Robert ‘Grinch’ MacBrayne.The day started off as expected, pretty cold with a few light showers. Fishing was slow at first with roughly an hour passing before the first catch came aboard, but after that it was non-stop until lunchtime.The quality of spurs and whiting was better than expected with very few undersized caught. Most made the measure and on average spurs hit the -cm mark with a couple of decent ones coming in at cm tipping the scales at lbs oz.As the day progressed the weather deteriorated with heavy showers, hail and really strong gusts spinning the boat leading to the inevitable Etive tangles.A decision was made to cut the day short and lines up was called at pm.Given the conditions everyone coped well and at the end of the day four species, spurs, whiting, lsd and pouting, added to the tally of  counting fish.Highlight of the day were the two sea eagles that flew in quite close on the hunt for food but they had their work cut out with so many greedy gulls around. Food wasn’t an issue for the boys though with homemade soup, tablet, shortbread and ginger wine all hitting the spot.Back ashore and the scores tallied up, the winner of this year’s Christmas Shield was Gordon Law with Robert MacBrayne in second place.

Social care, mental health and primary care services are all crying out for more support, and better resourcing them would take the pressure off the accident and emergency service.The SNP government have failed to meet the AE target time every month for over two years.

Yet, inspite of the unique dficulties in delivering superfast broadband in rural Scotland, which BT described as the ‘most signicant geographic challenge in the UK, and arguably Europe’, the latest Ofcom ‘Connected Nations’  report shows that Scotland outperforms the UK as a whole when it comes to new broadband deployment.There remains work to be done and the Scottish government is committed to delivering the best possible value and completing the roll out by  .Mr Reid is right to say that contracts have not been finalised yet, but with telecommunications and broadband reserved to Westminster, the changes in contracts imposed by UK ministers mean that bidders require additional time to recalibrate their bids.It is up to Mr Reid to carp from the sidelines, but readers can be confident that this SNP Scottish government will deliver a future proof network that will make Scotland one of the best connected places in Europe.Yours,Ron Wilson,Secretary Kintyre SNP.Coffee thanksSir,This year our World’s Biggest Coffee Morning fundraiser entered its th year.In community centres, schools and workplaces, thousands of coffee mornings were held across Scotland to raise money and help us support people affected by cancer.I would like to offer a huge and heartfelt thanks to every single one of your readers who held or attended a coffee morning – your energy and generosity never ceases to amaze us.Whether it’s specialist cancer nurses, support workers or benefit advisors, we can only offer the support that people with cancer need thanks to the tireless fundraising efforts of our supporters.The number of people who need our help is growing, and we want to offer support to everyone who needs it.

It came after representatives of the local industries which discharge their waste effluents into the main sewage system indicated that they would be willing to co-operate in the neutralising of the acids in their effluents.Without neutralising the acid would prove damaging to the pumps envisaged for the new scheme.The motion calling on the council to give the go-ahead on the project was made by Dean of Guild William Stevenson, and seconded by Councillor N. S. McCallum, who said: #I think health comes before money in this respect.#Fears were expressed about the effect the scheme would have on the rates. Councillor Alastair McKinlay said: #It might be that in years to come we, as a council, will be blamed for putting the rates up.#Provost Daniel McKinven said that the efforts made in the past to secure the new sewage system for Campbeltown were #joint efforts#. The Provost said that the council had #done this for the good of Campbeltown# and that they would #see to it# that local labour is employed on the actual scheme.Mr W. P. Scott, the representative at the meeting of Messrs. Crouch and Hogg, the firm of consulting engineers who will be employed on the project, said that the pumping main would probably be laid along under the Low Askomel road.Mr Scott commented that the most expensive part of the scheme will be the actual laying of the pipelines.Hon. Treasurer George Halbert and Town Chamberlain, Mr William B. Allen, calculated that the rates may have to be increased by s d to cover the cost of the scheme. But Mr Halbert pointed out that the increase may be considerably more.The final calculation will not be made until Messrs. Crouch and Hogg supply a final figure for the cost of the scheme.The town will be eligible for a rates support grant.ONE-HUNDRED YEARS AGOHighland Parish Church ChoirOn Wednesday night the choir of the Highland Parish Church gave a concert in the Kirk Street Hall in aid of the funds of the Women#s Guild.The audience quite filled the hall, and a most enjoyable programme was received with every indication of appreciation.The choir contributed two-part songs which were rendered tunefully and with fine feeling, and the audience responded with particular warmth.The vocal solos by members of the choir were all most successfully rendered.The songs were nicely selected and several singers, heard for the first time, performed with great taste and sweetness.The soloists were Misses Macalpine, L. Wareham, Lizzie McCallum, F. Hall, and Messrs C. Kelly, W. McClymont, McKendrick, D. Macdougall, jr., Neil McCallum, and Edward Galbraith, the latter contributing Gaelic songs with ability and success.While all did well, the audience were particularly appreciative of the efforts of Miss L. McCallum and Mr C. Kelly, who had to respond to encores which would not be denied.Mr J. Smillie gave several violin solos with marked success, the audience showing great delight in his performances.A vocal duet was given by Messrs Kelly and McCallum.Rev. Norman Mackenzie, M.A., minister of the congregation, presided over the gathering with great acceptance.Miss Agnes Macmillan, organist, played the accompaniments with taste and sympathy, and has much credit by the success of her direction of the entertainment.A few remarks in a happy vein were made by Rev. C. V. A. MacEchern, of Castlehill Church, and at the close the customary votes of thanks were appropriately moved by Mr Robert Colville."},{"url":null,"title":"dalintobers youngest share festive spirit","story":"The children of Dalintober Primary School#s Early Learning Centretook an audience of their family and friends on an alphabetical journey through the Christmas nativity story.The play began: #A is for Angel, B is for Baby, C is for Celebrate with Joseph and Mary!#The young actors took turns in the spotlight according to their roles # angels, stars, shepherds, wise men and, of course, Mary and Joseph # to continue the whole festive alphabet.Their stellar performances belied their junior years, with every word audible during the  songs they learned for the production.After the nativity, the ELC#s youngest pupils continued the Christmas spirit by taking to the stage wearing Christmas jumpers, hats and boppers to perform some festive tunes.The school#s P to P and P to P pupils put on their own shows on Monday and Tuesday # see next week#s Courier for coverage of those events.Dalintober ELC#s Mary and Joseph. _cdalelcnatThree wee shepherds. _cdalelcnatThe angels were in fine voice. _cdalelcnatThe stars were among the performers who shone. _cdalelcnatMore shepherds, looking after their sheep. _cdalelcnatThe youngest performers were full of enthusiasm. _cdalelcnatThe ELC#s youngest members learned all their words. _cdalelcnatThe pupils who took part in Dalintober ELC#s nativity. _cdalelcnatThe ELC#s younger children on stage. _cdalelcnat"},{"url":null,"title":"too much turkey go for a slog in the sand","story":"Campbeltown Running Club is once again hosting its Boxing Day Slog in the Sand.There is a K and a fun K, which even walkers and their dogs can join in with, and best of all, it is all in aid of a very good cause.So get along to Westport Beach on December  in plenty of time for the registration which opens at .am, ready for the am start.It costs £ to join in the fun and all the proceeds are going to the Sunshine Room at Campbeltown Hospital.If you want to know more, email enquiries @campbeltownrunningclub"},{"url":null,"title":"world-champ-josh-taylor-enjoys-special-day-hibs","story":"The county star, who paraded his world title belts on the pitch at half-time, said: ldquoWhat a great reception at Easter Road.

But she asked why the young woman was so determined to climb the stairs, even though she was clearly very ill and finding it dficult.This led to me mentioning who Anne Frank was and that people visit the attic because itrsquos the place where she hid.ldquoWhy was she hiding  was the inevitable question, just as bedtime arrived.I was suddenly presented with a dilemma, not so much that bedtime was now delayed, but how to explain to a six-year-old the depth of evil and hatred that was the reason for Anne Frank having to hide in an attic with her family. And then whether to explain what happened to her after she was discovered.I knew that I couldnrsquot just ignore her question. So we searched for images of Anne Frank, which meant she became a real person for my daughter.Skye studied her and said she looked nice and kind, and asked again why she was hiding.I explained that people who didnrsquot even know her hated her just because she was a bit dferent to them. I couldnrsquot explain the horrors of genocide and concentration camps, but she understood that Anne Frank and her family must have been really scared to hide in an attic.ldquoWhat happened to her  asked Skye as she dressed for bed.This was not a bedtime story I wanted to tell. Indeed, for a child so young, it was not a story I wanted to tell at all. She knows there are bad people and staying safe is important, but we feel the need to protect our children from the evil and hatred that is sadly so deep-seated.But it is at this young age that the seeds of intolerance and hatred can be plantedthey are not encouraged and helped to feel empathy to others, including those who are dferent in fact, especially those who are dferent.So I told her a lsquochild-friendlyrsquo version of Anne Frankrsquos story,there can be such a thing. I gave no details of the horror of the Holocaust but we imagined how she must have missed her family when they were split up, and how sad it was that she died not long before the war ended.She wanted to look at Anne Frankrsquos photo again and say goodnight to her.ldquoThank goodness that could never happen to us here, could it dad ldquoNo, that is not going to happen, and we have to make sure it doesnrsquot happen to anyone  either, I reassured her.I felt quite emotional as I went downstairs with my kids sleeping safely in their cosy beds. I thought of the families in Syria who cannot keep their children safe from hatred and violence. I knew that such horrors could happen anywhere, at any time yes, even here yes, maybe even to us or our neighbours or friends. In fact, hatred of dference is indeed amongst us.A friend of mine was on a bus heading from East Lothian into Edinburgh last week and witnessed a horrible racist verbal assault on a Polish family. The horric murders in London are also part of the same hatred of dference ndash a man so full of hatred for people who think dferently that he randomly killed two amazing young people.Hatred is a virus that can infect any society and any inidual in it. History has taught us that fanning its flames can be an easy way for politicians to win power. But like real fire, once itrsquos released it can spread and destroy uncontrollably.People say fight fire with fire, but here the comparison ends, for we cannot fight hatred with hatred. Hatred only spawns more of it.And so I searched for words of that remarkable young woman Anne Frank, who left her diary behind, unknowing that it would be her gt to the world. Words I could share with my daughter, from one young thinking child to another. Despite writing at a time of unimaginable fear and horror, in her diary she has left us a timeless message of hope that comes from her rejection of hate:ldquoItrsquos dficult in times like these ideals, dreams and cherished hopes rise within us, only to be crushed by grim reality. Itrsquos a wonder I havenrsquot abandoned all my ideals, they seem so absurd and impractical. Yet I cling to them because I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are truly good at heart.It is our responsibility to live up to that inspiring message from a young woman who was a victim of the hate she rejected utterly to show our children, our family and friends, our colleagues and those we meet on a bus, that love, tolerance, empathy and respect of dference is the counter to hate.And we should expect no less from all our politicians."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-replace-old-boxing-gym-housing","story":"REM Associates have lodged planning applications seeking to replace the th century former Tranent Methodist Church building on Bridge Street with four two-bedroom flats.They submitted the applications on behalf of businessman and premises owner Alex Brown, who founded Bronx Boxing Gym, which was based at the old church, a decade ago.In recent years, Mr Brown had no involvement in the running of the boxing club but still let its boxers use the building.However, costly repairs were needed to make the former church safe, which led to the boxing club vacating the premises.Earlier this year, the club moved to the newly established Fit-in Fitness Gym on High Street, Musselburgh.A planning application has been submitted for the former church building and the east wall which faces the car park on Coal Neuk to be demolished.Drawings included within a second planning application show designs for erecting four two-bedroom flats with a basement car park with space for four cars."},{"url":null,"title":"familys-spectacular-christmas-lights-display","story":"The Woods family open their very own Santarsquos grotto and decorate their home each year to raise money for Mission Christmas and Cash for Kids.This year, there are more than , lights at their family home and in their garden.Dad Stevie Woods said the family ldquojust love Christmas and hope the stream of visitors theyrsquore expecting will leave donations for charity, either cash or a toy.They raised pound on their opening night.The lights were switched on for visitors on Sunday at pm and will be on from .pm to pm daily until Christmas.The grotto is open for visitors, who can enjoy the Disney characters painted on the inside and the Christmas films playing.There is also a Santa Sleigh where children can get their photograph taken, and this year there will be the addition of a Santa train, which Stevie made himself out of whisky barrels.He said: ldquoLast year we raised about pound so wersquore hoping to beat that.

It is a scary premonition.ldquoYoursquore just getting old, was a recent diagnosis from a family member! It was said with affection, of course, yet the ring of truth gave it an unhelpful sting. Age, of course, is just a number and state of mind and I have much to keep me youthful.What did help was meeting up with an old friend last week. As we sat together sharing memories of our youth and the shenanigans we got up to  years ago, I had a disorientating sense of time. It seemed impossible that so many years had passed since the moments we remembered had taken place. Those moments were so present for us. As another clicheacute says, it was asit was yesterday.We both complimented each other on how young we looked but I think this was because we both saw the younger person underneath the wrapping made by time. Society judges so much by appearance, we all do. But when we meet an old friend, even when we have not been in touch for many years, we see the person we knew, eventhe exterior has changed. As the philosopher Henry David Thoreau once said: ldquoItrsquos not what you look at that matters, itrsquos what you see.Who can say honestly they have not judged someone because of what they look like  I am as guilty as anyone . As I said, we all do it on the bus, in the queue at the supermarket while we wait our turn, everywhere. We glimpse at people, avoiding eye contact, but making immediate judgement on the way they look. Sometimes itrsquos negative, sometimes envious, sometimes positive and admiring but always superficial. And I know, like everyone , I too am likewise judged.Itrsquos a human habit, perhaps a primeval instinct in which we must quickly judge people for our safety. But of course outward appearance gives no clue to someonersquos character and real qualities. We must know something of that person first before we can judge on that.And this means seeing beyond what we look at. And to do this we need eye contact, a smile, a friendly gesture and the exchange of some words. We need to connect to the person inside. And the irony is, while there are more of us than ever sharing ever-bigger spaces, we are ever more disconnected from each other.The truth Irsquove come to realise is that you donrsquot have to be an old friend with someone to see their inner self, you just need to see beyond what appears to you. We have another primeval instinct and that is to detect the warmth of a character. But we cannot do thatwe only see what we look at and make no attempt to connect.My resolution, even before New Year, is to do this more often.

One business owner accused the local authority of trying to ide and confuse people so they did not attend.It comes after the council:Haddington Business Community Partnership had asked the council to postpone the public consultation until the start of the new year because it believes the local authority has breached Scottish Government guidelines stating that consultation exercises should not be launched during local or national election periods.A spokesperson for the council has denied this is the case and insisted it is a normal part of pre-consultation process.Community councillor Pat Lemmon said the decisions of the council were disappointing.She said: ldquoIt does not encourage feelings of trust for everyone working together. The ground rules change by the day.And she said the councilrsquos handling of the proposals had caused major distrust among residents, particularly when it came to the independently produced Haddington Vision document officials use to support their case.She said: ldquoThe Haddington Vision strongly said any changes had to be looked at by all the stakeholders, by everyone concerned, to avoid any ill feeling, to make everyone feel they had been consulted as part of proposed plans.ldquoThe statement made that East Lothian Council hopes to be in a position to implement a decision by March  indicates to me that there appears to be a race on to secure funding for the transportation hub.ldquoIf this is the case, is this the right decision given the strong views for and against any proposed hub in the town and the proposed town centre plans currently being discussed by the steering group ldquoTo have such a meeting so close to Christmas, and the stakeholder consultation at a time when many people are working, seems to me to be a bad decision.ldquoI am very disappointed that such a decision has been made.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council previously confirmed that the drop-in event would run -pm, with a public notice in the Courier of November  confirming that was the case.The event was to give local residents and businesses ldquothe opportunity to discover more about the proposals for a transport hub in Haddington.She said: ldquoThey will also be able to see the progress and history of the project to date, including the consideration of  dferent sites across the town.ldquoComments can be recorded as part of this consultation which will help inform the future development of the proposal and will be followed by another consultation in the New Year.However, the public section of the event has been reduced to just  minutes.When asked why the format of the event had been changed, the spokeswoman said: ldquoDue to a combination of level of interest and availability of staff, a stakeholders meeting will be held at pm and invitees include local business owners, schools, community council, sports clubs, transport companies and accessibility and active travel interests. [The] public event will start at pm.Other sites considered for the car park and dropped for ldquoious reasons include the field between West Road, Park Lane, Pencaitland Road and Letham Drive, and the site of the former Haddington Nursery School Annexe, off Meadowpark, which has also been earmarked for a housing development.The plans for Whittingehame Drive, which were drawn up following a series of closed door meetings, came under fire from a number of Haddington residents.Concerns ranged from the loss of green space on the site, which is beside the townrsquos skate park and G sports pitches, to the potential for accidents with youngsters playing next to the car park.The transport hub, which would include a car park with somewhere between  and  spaces, could also include ldquobus connections, bike hire opportunities and new pathways.According to East Lothian Council, the facility,approved, has ldquothe potential to free up parking spaces in the town for short-stay use, making it easier for people to access local businesses, essential services and tourist attractions.However, business owners were among those raising concerns about the proposals.George James, who runs the East Lothian TV and Video Repair Centre on High Street, felt that the last-minute changes were an attempt by the council to ide people.He said: ldquoIt is clearly isive and an effort to stop people attending the public consultations.ldquoWe are a local business and have been told we cannot attend the stakeholdersrsquo meeting as we are not considered stakeholders.ldquoWe are encouraging as many people as possible to join a protest at the Town House on Monday evening we are determined to ensure they do not get away with this approach, which appears shambolic.Karla Green from the shop is handing out leaflets advising people about the public meeting but the times have changed so much even her leaflets are now out of date.She said: ldquoThey still have pm on them so we have to tell everyone that the time has changed ndash again.Project consultants WYG will be in attendance on Monday and will have a number of display boards showing the extent of proposals.Council transport officers will also be in the Town House and people will have the opportunity to ask questions.A council spokesperson said: ldquoThe public lsquodrop-inrsquo part is now -.pm and it has been extended due to securing availability of key members of the project team being available to answer public questions.ldquoInvitations to the stakeholdersrsquo meeting are for two representatives from a range of organisations involved in business transport in Haddington and confirmed invitees include Haddington Business Community Partnership, Haddington Community Development Trust, East Coast Buses, Prentice

It has also previously been identied that the Coastguard site could potentially provide parking for any new flats in the Assembly Rooms.A metal staircase linking the car park to the adjacent Church Street and the town centre is also included as part of the proposals.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, had mixed thoughts on the scheme.She said: ldquoLargely, there is a demand for parking.ldquoHowever, these car parking spaces would require traffic to move past a very small group of cottages that have enjoyed a degree of privacy in effectively a cul-de-sac all the time they have been there.ldquoInitial messages I have had from residents are of horror.ldquoThe prospect is that green space will be tarmacked over and become a pretty signicant car parking lot.The spokeswoman for the local authority highlighted the proposed car park was part of a wider project surrounding parking in the town.She said: ldquoThe project that transportation is considering has nothing to do with the Assembly Rooms but rather a straight forward look at available space to act as long stay and to change Abbeylands parking to short stay.ldquoThe council is currently negotiating with Transport Scotland and Network Rail to increase the capacity of the rail station car park to stop indiscriminate parking on local streets. This site provides an opportunity to add some additional supply into the town to encourage parking behaviour that is more appropriate.Councillor Norman Hampshire, who represents the Dunbar and East Linton ward, was unable to comment on the specics of the proposals as he is convener of the councilrsquos planning committee. But he said but said there was a need to address parking problems in the town.He said: ldquoThe old part of the town, the narrow streets around Church Street and Castle Street, is very congested with the number of cars parked there because of the restrictions on the High Street. Traders and people who work in the premises park on the surrounding streets and they are very congested.There is definitely a need for more parking in the town centre.Councillor Paul McLennan, who also represents the town, is not part of the planning committee and welcomed the possibility of a car park being created.

They fear that given free rein the SNPrsquos interventionist instincts and spending plans coupled with Scotlandrsquos large budget deficit would mean interference in their business and crushing taxation on their company and their family.So what is a rational business person in Scotland forced to consider now instead of focusing solely on growing their business   The answer is that they start to think of moving activity and themselves out of Scotland.I am not suggesting that business investment will cease or that all those who run and own businesses will leave in January. That wonrsquot happen but what those who support independence fail to realise is that there are few really large businesses which are only active in Scotland, they have activities well beyond it and the choice of where investment goes is affected by political uncertainty. There are also few owners of large businesses in Scotland who are here all the time - they travel extensively, they might have a home in London or abroad as well as in Scotland, almost certainly some of their family will live outside Scotland.

Like its parent ldquopolitically correct, woke is a passion of the urban left. It is PC for the age of LGBTQIA+. suggested ldquowoke as word of the year, which arguably it should be, though not for the reason it thinks. For woke has changed meaning in the last  months, and become a term of derision, referring to a style of self-righteous, right-on thinking favoured by, well,columnists. It is now used to denote the metropolitan identity politics that contributed to Labourrsquos greatest defeat since the s.:Guy Stenhouse: Time to Get Over itNo-one is sure where the word ldquowoke came from, except that it emerged from African-American vernacular for ldquostaying alert, as in ldquostay woke, brother. In recent years it was adopted by the BlackLivesMatter movement with their hashtag #staywoke ndash meaning keeping black issues uppermost on social media.It was soon adopted by white millennials to emblemise not just racial awareness but a whole identitarian outlook on le. Woke expresses the ultra-feminist, multi-ethnic, gender non-conforming culture fashionable in American and UK campuses.Woke people love people of colour and loathe ldquostraight white males, ldquogammon and ldquoboomers. They adore so-called ldquonon-binary people who claim not to identy with any gender. No-one is quite sure what non-binary means. Do they swing both ways  No, thatrsquos bisexual. Are they transgender  Definitely not, and nor are they intersex. Itrsquos one of lersquos mysteries to many folk who are less woke.Wokeness has recently taken the media and advertising world by storm. Companies eager to keep up with the zeitgeist waste no chance to wave the rainbow flag and include multi-ethnic themes. This is sometimes called ldquowoke-washing. Every TV advert from McDonaldrsquos to John Lewis now has to feature a multi-racial family, asthe advertisers believe having two white people on one sofa is racism.The BBC drama Years And Years was kind of Woke Family Robinson. Black professhysional mother, transshygender daughter, gay cousin, asylum-seeker boyfriend, disabled sister ... all fighting the good fight against the emerging fascism of Brexit Britain. This compendium of woke identitarianism came complete with a middle-aged white dad. He naturally emerged as a morally worthless, adulterous creep, fit only to be punished by losing all his money.: Mark Smith: Happy Christmas First Minister ndash here are some questions I think you should answerWoke is easy to satirise and has been, mercilessly, by the comedian Andrew Doyle with his social media creation, Titania McGrath. She is a -year-old middle-class gender studies graduate, obsessed by her imagined victimhood, who identies as an ecosexual, non-binary person of colour and fights for social justice by writing bad poetry. ldquoThe only thing thatrsquos white about me, says Titania, ldquois my skin.She firmly believes women can have penises and that people should have electronic chips inserted in their brains to report heterosexual thinking. Men who have sexual dreams are guilty of rape, according to Titania.Woke folk thought Titania was the product of the homophobic, alt-right, fascist MSMndash or did until her creator, a gay Labour voter, was exposed last year. She is one of the great satirical creations of the century, just donrsquot expect Doyle to get invited on to The Mash Report.Woke is no joke. The leftrsquos penchant for strict identity politics, and the exotic fringes of LGBTQIA+ has had political consequences. The social media assault on ldquowhite working-class Brexit voters as racists and bigots was a factor in the alienation of traditional Labour constituencies. People in Bolsover, Workington and Sedgefield donrsquot much like being portrayed as fascists. Who knew There is a sanctimoniousness and intolerance about woke culture that is itself sometimes redolent of the authoritarian right, especially its approach to language. Anyone who mistakenly says ldquocoloured people instead of ldquopeople of colour, for example, will be ostracised. Pronouns must be obeyed. Feminist academics are no-edthey question whether transwomen are biologically female.Barack Obama warned the Democratic Party to avoid this ldquowoke politics with its ldquocancel culture. This is the practice of social justice warriors on Twitter demonising anyone who fails to conform to their particular form of non-conformism. If Trump wins again, it will in part because the Democrats havenrsquot listened.There is an anti-science, quasi-religious aspect to woke. Woke biology insists that sex is not innate but is ldquoattributed at birth ndash asevery child is born transgender. During the General Election campaign, the Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson tried, with disastrous results, to defend the woke dogma that biological sex doesnrsquot exist.Woke wars are raging in the Scottish National Party and have been since Nicola Sturgeon declared her support for self-ID ndash a law change to allow transgender people to self-identy as women without the need for medical intervention or convincing evidence that they have lived as women.There has been a vigorous reaction against this from feminists in and out of the SNP. They fear womenrsquos refuges, changing rooms and prisons are liable to be invaded by men declaring themselves to be female. They also resent being called ldquocis by wokeasians, aswomen are merely a subset of their own sex.The General Election has not caused any obvious soul-searching among the woke cadres. Indeed, the verdict ofwriter Paul Mason was a pitch-perfect expression of the woke worldview. The election was, he declared, ldquoa victory of the old over the young racists over people of colour selfishness over the planet.Such is the firm belief of the morally superior who spend their lives in an echo chamber saving the world from imagined hate crimes.

Itrsquos also exhausting having to google all the countless references to religious sects, ancient battles and subsequent grievances to understand what the hell is going on.For the record, I can confirm God is especially displeased at how His favourite song ndash Neil Diamondrsquos Sweet Caroline ndash has been reborn as a blasphemous hate anthem by aggrieved Presbyterians. Hersquos particularly infuriated at never being able to listen to the chorusrsquo sweet descending horn melody again without hearing a suggestion of illicit fornication with the spiritual leader of Catholicism.Yet, thatrsquos nothing compared to how infuriated He is over a rather unsavoury incident which took place last Sunday afternoon at Parkhead. As usual, I was idly floating over the stadium, keeping a particularly close eye on the famous North Curve section, when I spotted a large banner which boldly exclaimed ldquoF*** off Rod in a strange retro-futuristic font.Now, I was under the impression that I was carrying out these duties under the auspices of anonymity. Surely God would have told methe Pope had announced to the world that I had been canonised And evensupporters knew the Eurosceptic spirit of Rod Hull was watching over them, I was under the impression Celtic was a club which took pride in its historic ldquoopen for all stance. So I looked again. No, there it was ndash ldquoF*** off Rod. And to add insult to injury, a second banner pronounced, in the same queasily homespun Blakes  font: ldquoTories not welcome.Now, thatrsquos taking it too far. Sturgeon did well last week whipping up your ingrained inferiority complex but for the moment, Scotland is still just a whipping boy bleeding oil to grease the wheels of the English Treasury.It seems the SNPrsquos failed education policies have left you with a generation unfit to shove their hand up Emursquos a*** never mind run a country. I mean, these days the Clydersquos last remaining shipyard struggles to make rubber ducks float and you even had to get the Germans in to bring trams back to Edinburgh. Winston Churchill would bloody weep.Rod the prod NOW, I was a much-loved entertainer in le ndash so did not immediately assume it was me being told to ldquoF*** off when I saw the Celtic supportersrsquo banner. Yet, what other Rod could it possibly be The only other famous Rod ndash apart from Jane and Freddiersquos pal ndash is Rod Stewart. And it certainly couldnrsquot be him that the Green Brigade were telling to f*** off!I mean, theyrsquove known for decades that Rodrsquos a shameless unionist who almost broke his knees with the speed he got down on the palace floor to accept a knighthood. And letrsquos not forget Maggie May explicitly described a young Rodrsquos erotic liaison with The Iron Lady above her parentsrsquo shop.So, of course, it had to be me they were telling to f*** off ndash because the fans who held that disgusting banner aloft have historically had little issue with Rod Stewartrsquos multarious affiliations. And, I mean, they themselves have indirectly supported the Tory party through purchases of season tickets, strips, scarves and Bovril ndash with Celticrsquos majority shareholder billionaire Dermot Desmond being a generous Conservative donor. And then therersquos former director Lord Ian Livingston, who voted in favour of Tory tax credit cuts.The fans were certainly raging at Ian at the time, with a , strong petition urging him to f*** off, so surely any cancellation of Rod Stewart would have happened years ago too  The bagpipe solo in Rhythm Of My Heart alone justies lelong exile, but what about the time Rod shamelessly performed at Sun City in South Africa during apartheid  Or the countless times hersquos played Israel  Or persevering with hairspray and straighteners at  Blonde ambitionNO, I donrsquot believe Celtic fans were at all shocked that Rod would favourBoris Johnson over Jeremy Corbyn.Theyrsquove surely grown used to Rodrsquos non-partisan personality and wouldnrsquot be surprised when he congratulated Borison his electoral landslide. Yet, wecanrsquot judge a man by the company he keeps, can we We all have our flaws and Rod likely has a word when this fellow millionaire Londoner skewers the Scots, Irish, the working class, the Muslims, the disabled, the LGBT, the hairdressers and the people of Liverpool.And Celtic fans were certainly aware that Rod was also an acquaintance oftoxic insanity bucket Donald Trump. Of course, he says he doesnrsquot really see eye to eye with him on politics, but surely that just leaves two other sides of his personality ndash misogyny and madness. Still, Irsquom sure Rod is disgusted when his pal mocks, demonises and locks up societyrsquos most vulnerable in the relentless pursuit of the almighty dollar and elevated societal status among fellow demons.So it seems pretty clear to me that it couldnrsquot have been Rod Stewart who invoked the Green Brigadersquos wrath. It begs the question, however ndash of both Rods, why choose Rod Hull to f*** off  I mean, the only thing we have in common is that we both like having a bird on our arm.Hierarchy of hateAT LEAST the Tories arent as bad as Trump ndash I mean, they refused to let UKIPrsquos former token Jock MEP David Coburn join them last week - with their Scottishleader Jackson Carlaw essentially telling him to ldquof*** off Parkhead-style by revoking his shiny new membership card.Like Rod, David congratulated Boris and assumed his assimilation to the Tory hive mind was a mere formality. Carlaw, however, stressed that historical comments made by Coburn were \"incompatible with membership and red-carded him. Unlike career antagonist Tommy Robinson, who claims he was enthusiastically welcomed to the fold last week, along with thousands of Britain First members who were urged to join up ndash by their own party.Itrsquos fortunate for Carlaw that hersquos never put a foot wrong himself and can make such character judgements without hypocrisy. Unless yoursquore counting such trivial discrepancies such as his support for the \"rape clause\" policy on child tax credits, that time he made fun of Chinese accents, his singling out of Muslim MSPs to demand they condemn anti-Semitism and, famously, his loathing of Gaelic road signs.Of course, it could be said that he is a minor, inconsequential Tory henchman in comparison to his boss Boris, a congealed blockage in Billy Idolrsquos drain who himself has left no minority group unmocked.So,Coburn was deemed morally unfit to join Team Boris, surely that means he must be some kind of irredeemable puddle demon  Then again, perhaps not. We must remember this is a man who quit UKIP over extremism ndash reminds me of how Ken Livingston was thrown out of Labour for being anti-Semitic!And finally...WITH all those photos taken of him in Rangers strips, Rod Stewart clearly wise enough to understand le offers more than binary choices.And although it would put a few of his establishment palsrsquo noses out of joint, maybe only a non-partisan luminary like Rod could inspire harmonious mass solidarity to overcome the oppressive rule of a small minority of parasites who have spent centuries cultivating power and fortune by feasting on our blood, sweat and toil.But is Rod destined to be the Ghandi-esquefigure who unites all disparate tribes as one  Likely not. I thought theyd maybe just heard Rods American Classics ballad album, but God assures me itrsquos near impossible to wake folk up to the real enemy when binary ision is all theyrsquove known since they were dressed in a football strip as a baby in the cot.Yet, God has also informed me that any historical religious hijacking of sport has always been a manufactured polarisation of the proletariat ndash and that Scotlandrsquos hard-won independence will be pointlessit fails to tackle the issue decisively. Perhaps a more valid target of any fans suggestion to \"f*** off\" should be the billionaires who pay millionaires to kick sheep stomachs around rival temples to ide, conquer and profiteer from their lucrative monetisation of manufactured hate.Merry Christmas!"},{"url":null,"title":"john-bercow-urges-return-civilised-politics-brutal-year","story":"DEMOCRACY has ldquocome in for a pounding in  and there should now be a restoration of ldquopersonal courtesy, John Bercow has said.In this yearrsquos Alternative Christmas Message for Channel , the former Commons Speaker also says ato previous norms would be good for ldquoour own mental health.He warned social media in particular can ldquoamply hatred, racism, misogyny and abuse.The TV message, a fixture since , has previously been delivered by actor Danny Dyer, CIA whistleblower Edward Snowden and the husband of murdered MP Jo Cox.Mr Bercow, who stood down as an MP at the election, urged people to move on from the bitter Brexit rows and election campaign of .Speaking from a classroom at his childrenrsquos state secondary school, he said: ldquoI passionately support parliamentary democracy.

Understandably. frustrated passengers hit out at whoever is closest to hand, and that tends to be ScotRail and its staff.The blame game is an increasingly important part of running or overseeing a railway network, especially when passengers can take to social media social and complain in real time. So, although Abellio clearly failed to meet many of its targets, I donrsquot doubt that public pressure also played a part in the decision to end the contract early.And thatrsquos why Irsquom surprised Mr Matheson seems so keen on bringing ScotRail back into public hands, having already mooted setting up a public operator to bid against private sector rivals for the ScotRail contract. What makes him think the public sector will automatically do a better job than the likes of Abellio, which is itself owned by the Dutch state  Especially when itrsquos clear having control of the franchise is only part of the equation. Without control over the tracks , and the sort of eye-watering multi-billion pound investment that would probably require tax increases, European-style railways are a pipe dream.And at least under the current system the Scottish Government has a private sector enemy to blame and sack when things go wrong. Does the SNP really want to deal with the potential fallout at the ballot box when angry commuters turn their ire on ministers rather than Abellio or whichever private firm comes next  Mr Matheson should be careful what he wishes for. With building support independence the main partyrsquos main priority, taking over a potentially vote-losing train franchise is surely an unnecessary risk that could lead to dire consequences.Read more:ScotRail franchise cut short as SNP ministers strip Abellio of contractHe is not alone in being tempted up the nationalisation track, of course. The re-nationalisation of the UKrsquos railways was one of the few policies in the recent Labour manesto that seemed to be popular on the doorstep. And taking into consideration recent events in Englandand Scotland, one can understand the demands for change.But we hark back to the old days of British Rail with rose-tinted nostalgia when even a cursory glance at some of the realities tells you this is largely misplaced. We appear to have conveniently forgotten cold, dirty old rolling stock in thes taking us on deadly slow journeys. Passenger numbers speak for themselves, having more than doubled in the  years since privatisation. Lest we forget, too, it was a drastic programme of line closures in the sthat led to many communities in Scotland ndash including the entire Borders region ndash having their railway lines closed, with terrible economic and social consequences.Put simply, what matters to passengers is having modern trains with good facilities that arenrsquot too expensive and run on time.

It became the hit of the season, and went on to become one of the longest running musicals on both sides of the Atlantic.Sir Cameron was interviewed by three pupils from Mallaig High School - Finn Jobson, Kate Biddulph and Ellie MacPherson - to mark the th anniversary of local community newspaper West Word.He said he was just six when he first set foot in Mallaig on a family holiday and ldquofell in love with the area, but had to be taken out of a performance at the old village hall because he could not stop laughing at traditional unaccompanied singing, known as Mouth Music, which is often performed in Gaelic.Sir Cameron owes his vast fortune to the spectacular success of musicals such as Les Miseacuterables, Cats, The Phantom of the Opera and Miss Saigon.But he said that among the earliest shows he was taken to were in Mallaig - where he has owned an estate for  years.He said that his aunt and grandmother first brought him to the area in  and in the evening he would often be taken by the family to concerts at the Old Village Hall.ldquoThey often featured traditional unaccompanied Mouth Music, the sound of which Irsquom ashamed to admit, used to send me off into fits of giggles which caused my auntrsquos hand to to firmly clamp over my mouth to stle noise and embarrassment, said Sir Cameron, who grew up in Enfield, London.But he wanted to be a producer ever since his Aunt Jean took him to see Salad Days when he was eight.When he left school he became a stage hand and a cleaner at Londonrsquos Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, and worked his way up.ldquoI then plunged into my career, putting on numerous productions, during the s, often getting into considerable debt when shows didnrsquot work, until Andrew Lloyd Webber and I met up in  and created a musical everyone  had turned down based on TS Eliotrsquos poets, Practical Cats, he revealed.ldquoCats was to change the le of everyone who worked on it, and for me paid off my considerable debts and allowed me for the rest of my le, to produce the shows I really wanted to do.\"Luckily for me the public have continued to mostly like the same shows I do.Sir Cameron said Mallaig however has changed hugely and mostly for the better.ldquoMallaig may have lost most of its great fishing fleet, but it now boasts many other attractions and amenities the village could only have dreamt of years ago, he said.Referring to how the lsquoHogwartrsquos Expressrsquo and Harry Potter have boosted the area, Sir Cameron added: \"It is ironic that one of the oldest forms of transport, mostly obsolete around the world, the steam train, would actually both forge and safeguard Mallaigrsquos destiny.ldquoI feel most at home in the country, which is why I love the Mallaig area.\"Irsquove never been one for the glamorous le, though I do throw a good first night party.ldquoBeing surrounded by nature is one of the most relaxing things for me to do as it is the perfect antidote to the metropolitan way of le which doesnrsquot really understand that outside the cities, people in the country often think dferently and hold dferent values.Sir Cameron said he was optimistic over Mallaigrsquos future and ldquofor all its remoteness, is a very special place and there is no place like it.According to the Sunday Times Rich List this year, Sir Cameronrsquos personal wealth increased to pound.bn.Through his company, Sir Cameron owns eight London theatres -

Even with a record turnout in , the number was five per cent short.To me this is the SNPrsquos biggest stumbling block.Willie Towers, Alford.IN an otherwise excellent article Alison Rowatappears to accept at face value the assertion that Tony Blair is accurate in his analysis of why Labour lost the  General Election. In fact Labour gained signicantly more votes in  than it did in  , , and . In  Jeremy Corbyn managed to attract ,, votes whereas in  Mr Blair got ,, votes.The problem for the Labour Party and indeed all of the opposition parties is that under the first past the post electoral system the Tories managed to hold on to their share of the vote from  and slightly increase this by entering into an electoral pact with the Brexit Party. The Brexit Party stood down all of their candidates in Tory-held seats which ensured that they held on to these despite a four per cent increase in vote share by the LibDems.The fact is that had Labour, the LibDems, and SNP agreed a similar electoral pact with each other by standing down candidates in their respective target seats they would undoubtedly have reversed the result of this election. In this scenario the Tories would have lost  seats to the combined opposition resulting in another hung parliament. In Scotland such an electoral pact would probably have resulted in the SNP taking three further seats from the Tories, including the seats of Alister Jack and David Mundell. Instead of ruminating over the consequences of a Tory-hard Brexit we would now be discussing how the coalition Labour LibDem SNP government was about to bring forward plans to hold a second EU referendum.All of the opposition partiesneed to learn from this defeat that in politics as in le cooperation against a common enemy is essentialvictory is to be achieved.John Smith, Dunblane.FOR some Christians the Christmas story is a myth, what matters being not that it is a factual account of historical events, but that it is a telling of the truths of the human condition. We believe it to be the very human story of a child born into the squalid conditions of poverty and homelessness, into a family of migrants. There are seemingly deliberate reminders of those at the margins of society with the presence of the shepherds, impoverished outcasts of their day.Our st century story is one of increasing homelessness, of more children growing up in poverty, of migrants made to feel unwelcome in spite of their contribution to our society and refugees fleeing hunger, destruction and persecution being shown insufficient compassion. And of course globally the story is one of relentless suffering exacerbated by the impact of climate change.:Labour moderates turn fire on lsquocontinuity Corbynrsquo candidateThe Gospel accounts tell the story of a man revealing to us what it means to be fully human, dedicating our lives to the underprivileged and challenging those who abuse their power.In fact democratic politics have been seriously damaged recently by such abuse.

But do they really mean it First, we can all see the polls. Support for independence hasnrsquot changed much, but neither has support for remaining in the UK and that means therersquos a good risk of Yes losing in . In private, many senior figures in the Scottish Government accept the only comfortable referendum will be when the polls are showing around % for Yes for at least a year. And many unionists would agree with that: % would be a ldquosettled will ndash   is not.:Letters: The SNP surely cannot be so lucky next timeThere are other reasons to doubt the SNPrsquos insistence on . We know some of their strategists think allowing Brexit to bite for a few years could drive middle-class Remainers to Yes. We also know the FM is asking for a  referendumin the knowledge a Tory No will be sent up from London, England, and in the hope the Tory No will build resentment in time for a referendum she has a better chance of winning.Question two: Do you honestly think the election result is a mandate for the referendum Here is what ldquoScotlandrsquos Right to Choose says about the SNPrsquos mandate: ldquothe people of Scotland have voted on manestos containing pledges on an independence referendum, and have elected a Scottish Parliament where a majority of the MSPs support such a referendum. It also says the current mandate was reinforced by the recent General Election.But is anyone buying that, particularly from a party that has always objected to the flaws in the UKrsquos electoral system  The Scottish Government says that ldquofor  of the  years since  hellip Scotland has been ruled by governments elected by fewer than half of Scottish constituencies. True. But you could just as easily say Scotland is ruled by an SNP government thatrsquos supported by less than half the Scottish electorate. You could also say the SNP won % of the Scottish constituencies at the general election even though they attracted only % of the vote.The point is that our flawed system is usually an inaccurate reflection of opinion, and yet the Scottish Government is behaving asitrsquos Gospel. As I said last week, thousands of unionist Scots voted SNP at the general election because they wanted Brexit stopped and their votes do not count as support for a second referendum .:Nicola Sturgeon demands permanent referendum power for HolyroodThe bottom line  I think most Scots would accept a referendumthere was evidence of a settled will, as there was in the s for devolution. But the number of constituencies a party has in a flawed system is not a good or definitive measure of public opinion, especially on something as important as the constitution. A flawed system produces a flawed mandate.Question three: Do you accept that Scotland leaving the UK could be harder than the UK leaving the EU The Scottish Governmentrsquos document says a vote for independence in  would allow the smoothest transition to an independent Scotland taking its place as a member of the EU. Ah yes. Smooth transitions. Open borders. The easiest trade deal in human history. See how easily the slogans of Brexiters become the slogans of Scottish nationalists.The reality is that Scexit looks way trickier than Brexit. The UK is a sovereign state which means it can leave the EU without having to decide its currency it also doesnrsquot have to apply to join other international organisations or sort out its foreign or defence policies.The same does not apply to Scotland ndash after voting for independence, it would be leaving a state rather than an organisation made up of states and would therefore have to make many choices from scratch that the UK isnrsquot facing with Brexit ndash on shared assets and debts for instance. All of this means Scotland leaving the UK would be more complicated than the UK leaving the European Union.And thatrsquos before we talk about the border. The UK is going to be out of the single market and may restrict EU immigration. An independent Scotland, on the other hand, would be in the EU and would follow the four freedoms, including freedom of movement. Therefore, there would have to be checks at the Scottish border and no amount of Brexit-style reassurance from the Scottish Government is going to change that.And finally: do you believe a close result in a second independence referendum would be accepted as legitimate in Scotland A little bit more from Scotlandrsquos Right to Choose: ldquoWe are committed to an agreed, legal process hellip which will be accepted as legitimate in Scotland, the UK as a whole, and by the international community.Fair enough. Whatrsquos more, the First Minister seems to have demonstrated her commitment to an agreed, legal process by ruling out wheezes like an indicative referendum.However, the important phrase here is ldquoaccepted as legitimate. Brexit has taught us what happens when referendums are won by a slim margin ndash ision, bitterness, chaos, anger, and the losers push for another vote ndash and thatrsquos surely what would happen after a Scottish referendum next year, especially with the polls as they are. The result would be close. It would be contested and resisted and fought over.And answer me this, First Minister.

Indeed, Ministers have stopped even referring to the deadline,” Mr McArthur said.“It is all the more important, therefore, that priority is given to connecting those communities who have been waiting longest for any sort of service. Good quality, affordable broadband is increasingly critical in accessing services, allowing businesses to compete and enable people to go about their daily lives.#The Orkney MSP added: #Mr Matheson seems happy that Orkney continues to languish signicantly behind the level of coverage achieved nationally. As an MSP representing a central belt constituency, perhaps Mr Matheson believes this is just the ‘price you pay’ for living in an island or rural area.“Whatever the reason, it is unacceptable, the Scottish Government needs to re-commit to prioritising future broadband investment in Orkney and other communities who continue to lag behind when it comes to coverage.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Unfortunately the indications from the EU-Norway talks are that this did not happen and our fishing communities are going to feel the consequences.“Sustainability is important but we must remember that no one has more incentive to ensure sustainable fisheries than family-owned businesses and fishing communities. These groups depend on having reliable stocks now and for future generations.”He continued: “Amongst all the technical discussions and ideological debates, the direct impact on local communities who are reliant on fishing and the surrounding industries is being forgotten. Sustainable fisheries should protect the long-term success of our distinct fishing communities. I hope that the key players in these talks, and our Government, can set aside ideology and reflect on the social impact of quota changes.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Instead the overcast sky and sodden turf served to make her pensive mood more sullen. Then it happened. The moment that changed her Christmas beyond all her most fevered wishes…“First Minister, there’s a call for you,” said her Deputy Permanent Secretary, “it’s the Prime minister, he wishes to speak to you with some urgency.” “Really  Whatever for  He’s already made his sham post-election courtesy call. Unless he’s offering me an independence referendum I’d rather be at the dentists or in AE than speak to him again.” The First Minister’s contempt for Boris Johnson was biting.The DPS did not relent, however. “His Permanent Secretary was most insistent and said he would put the Prime Minister through immediately, he’s holding on the line now”.“Oh, all right then, I’ll take it in the drawing room, but make sure it’s recorded, I’m not having him saying one thing to me and leaking a dferent story to the English media.”She strode off to her favourite antique sofa, sat down and picked up the receiver, “First Minister here”, she said in an intentionally clipped tone asshe had been rudely disturbed.“Good morning First Minister, I am so glad we can speak, I have some serious news I must impart to you before anyone other. I do so hope it will make your Christmas brighter and bring great jollity at this joyous time of year,” said Prime Minister Johnson.Indferent already, the First Minister decided to be curt in reply, “I don’t have a great deal of time, I was just going to do some last minute Christmas shopping…”But before she could say anymore the Prime Minster spoke over her, “I’ve decided to be your personal Father Christmas. I received your letter to Santa, that formal request for a Section  Order, and after some more thought, I’ve discussed it with my Cabinet and it is agreed. You can have your Christmas wish, you can have the referendum. The procedures are already in hand and I shall be announcing it to the country immediately after this call.”Sturgeon was for once, momentarily lost for words. The pause was interrupted only by Boris Johnson saying, “First Minister, are you still there, did you hear me, I am agreeing to your request for a referendum.”Full of mixed emotions ranging from bewilderment to anger, and worry to puzzlement, Sturgeon gathered herself. There must be more to this she mused only last Friday Johnson had called and ruled out any referendum, so why the change of heart, was there a concealed plan  There’s always a concealed plan, she thought, for she always concealed her own intentions behind a wall of spin and knew Johnson did the same.“Well it’s good to know you now see things my way,” she said “the Scottish people demanded a referendum in the general election and it’s only right we should have the choice to decide to have one.” She chose her words carefully but they still came out through gritted teeth. Sturgeon did not want a referendum at all, her real wish was to nurse a sense of grievance about being denied a referendum. Johnson knew her game and Sturgeon now knew Johnson knew it. He was calling her bluff and enjoying the moment almost as much as hearing the election night’s exit poll that told him he had won. Sturgeon would now have to find ways of delaying the actual vote until after the Holyrood elections in , and would have to find some new grievances, and fast.“Oh don’t misunderstand me First Minister” Johnson went on. “When I say there shall be a referendum I mean of course I am recommending it be held under the strictest of terms. Such a constitutional matter is reserved to Westminster and I shall be announcing it must take place within the next six months so there is an end to constitutional wrangling and you can get on with the day job.”“Now that we are getting Brexit done I am intent on healing the country’s deep wounds. I want to build one nation in harmony and at peace with itself. We cannot go on being set against each other – and that requires me to address your wish for Scottish succession that ides Scotland, as much as it needs me to heal the Brexit ide across the UK”“Accordingly we must have the Scottish referendum by May next year and it will be based upon the register used for the general election. All Scots, by which I mean those people living in the rest of the UK or around the world who can show they were on the Scottish general election register in the last fteen years, will be entitled to a postal vote. I’m sure you will agree it is important that as many Scots are given the franchise in such an important decision.”“The question will be set by the Electoral Commission using the terms to “leave or remain” in the United Kingdom, as that phrasing is known to be the least pejorative and most balanced.” Prime Minister Johnson paused to let the First Minister respond.“I don’t find those arrangements at all acceptable, we shall not submit to any imposition. My Scottish Government shall decide who votes on what question and when.” Sturgeon said in full-blown anger, her face screwing up as she spat the words out. Her fists had instinctively clenched and the pencil in her right hand snapped.The Prime Minister was ready for this and replied, “As I said, I am announcing my decision to the country from Downing Street in a few minutes. If you wish to reject this very fair offer that can allow the Scottish people to move on from bitter ision and rancour it will be on your head. I shall leave it for Scots to judgeyou have the people or only your party at heart. Have a Merry Christmas.” The line went dead.It was now pouring outside Bute House.

According to the SNP version of events, nationalists and unionists alike entered into the constitutional debate with joy in their hearts. It didn’t matter what side of the debate we were on, we just glad to be involved.The truth is that the independence referendum campaign was an entirely miserable process for anyone who believes in the maintenance of the United Kingdom. For the majority of Scots, the prospect of victory for the nationalists was a source of anxiety, the prospect of Alex Salmond leading a newly independent Scotland a source of grave concern.Of course, the SNP had to spin a version of events which glossed over the uncomfortable truth that ’s vote on the constitution did nothing but create ision.I regret to report that the nationalists are at it again.Since the result of the general election, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon has told a story of a Scotland united against a common enemy in the shape of Prime Minister Boris Johnson. So deep is our loathing for the Conservative PM that we demand another referendum on independence. This is a truth against which nobody can argue.Except, that is, for anybody who cares to look at the election result.It is undoubtedly the case that the majority of Scots did not vote for Johnson’s party. Only a quarter of us backed the Conservatives. But it is also the case that only a minority –  per cent of us – backed the SNP. Evenwe include the vote for the party’s fellow nationalists, the Scottish Greens, the vote for pro-independence parties on  December reaches only  per cent.Despite this, Sturgeon and her fellow SNP politicians have spent the past week arguing that she has a mandate to hold a second referendum.This is something of a leap. And it comes with the claim that the people of Scotland – whether they are in favour of independence or not – wish to have the right to decide on the matter again.Even though it is nothing of the sort, the election result is, says Sturgeon, evidence that Scots would like the Scottish Government to have the power to call a second independence referendum. Currently, it is the case that the right to permit a referendum on independence resides in Westminster. Sturgeon would like to see that power transferred to Holyroodand she now argues that the nation is firmly behind her.It may well be the case that there exists a substantial number of pro-UK Scots who hanker for the stressful experience of a second independence referendum, but I sincerely doubt this.Sturgeon – who succeeded Salmond promising to be a unying figure in  and has spent the past five years being every bit as monomaniacal as her mentor – will not, I think, win many converts to the cause using the sort of rhetoric she’s deployed in recent days.She has talked of Scotland being held in the Union against its will. You can’t, she says, “lock us in a cupboard and turn the keys and hope everything goes away”.This nonsense might play well with those fully converted to the nationalist cause, but it is, I think, a little shrill \u2028for those yet to be convinced that Scotland’s best future lies in breaking from the UK.If Scots felt, as Sturgeon claims we do, imprisoned in the Union against our will, surely the great majority of us would have backed nationalist parties last week  For the past five years, the First Minister has spun a yarn of unstoppable growing support for independence. Each and every political development has been hailed as proof that increasing numbers of Scots are leaping on the independence charabanc. But the truth is that the numbers remain broadly where they were five years ago. The SNP may have the majority of MPs and MSPs but they have only a minority of voters on their side.During election campaigns, Sturgeon and her team can usually be heard talking about the need to protect the NHS. This is always a policy priority. In the aftermath of votes, however, the only subject deemed worthy of discussion is the constitution.This is hardly surprising, because the fact is that, while the SNP obsesses over a referendum that the majority don’t want, the NHS in Scotland remains in a parlous state.And then there’s the education system which continues to fail large numbers of children who leave school without even the most basic skills in literacy and numeracy. And then there’s Police Scotland, an organisation that lurches from crisis to crisis.There is no shortage of issues which the SNP would rather not discuss while it continues to argue that independence is a panacea.It is, quite simply, the case that, for all her talk of wishing to hold a referendum in , the First Minister remains powerless to do so. She has neither the right to call a referendum nor the numbers required to win one.And so, I suspect, that her language in recent days has been less about bringing the country together behind her nationalist project and more about throwing raw meat to those who are already on board.These have been a frustrating few years for the ardent Scottish nationalists. Promises of a second referendum have come to naught. The momentum described by the First Minister has not materialised.Of course, committed Yes voters will argue that the mandate Sturgeon describes is real. But it is not and no amount of magical thinking can change that reality.Sure, Sturgeon may yet change the minds that must be changedindependence is to become the preference of a majority of Scots. And, yes, the presence of Johnson in Downing Street may assist in that process. But, right now, the independence project remains stuck in the mud and no amount of nonsense about a Scotland imprisoned is likely to change that.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"gary rhodes a pioneer who inspired so many young cooks tributes pour in for tv chef","story":"Described as a pioneer who \"inpsired many young cooks\" and the man who \"almost single handedly put British food on the world stage\", Rhodes was one of the best known ambassadors for British cuisine and inspired a generation of Brits to enjoy cooking. window.twttr The top chef, who received five Michelin stars during his career, he is best known for his work on MasterChef, Ready Steady Cook and Hells Kitchen.

She followed Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn#s position, stating she would like to see a new Brexit deal negotiated with the EU and put to the British people in a referendum, with no Brexit the other option.Jenner Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, said her priority was to #uphold democracy# and to see Brexit through #as soon as possible#.The SNP#s Robert Leslie said that Orkney and Shetland had not voted for Brexit yet #we could suffer most# from the country leaving the EU. He added he would like to remain in the EU and help reform it from within as part of an independent Scotland.The Brexit Party#s Robert Smith did not attend, but his stance of a #clean-break Brexit# with a free trade deal with the EU was announced to the room.Unsurprisingly, Brexit proved the hottest topic of the evening with several questions based around that subject.Ms Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, surprised most in attendance by repeatedly going against party policy # firstly by saying she supported the actions of Gina Miller, who took the Conservative government to court over Brexit, because she was #upholding democracy# and secondly by saying that the government#s #settled status# scheme for EU citizens needed a #total overhaul#.So it would seem the only candidate willing to represent the more than nine and a half thousand brexit voters in Orkney and Shetland is working fisherman Robert Smith of the Brexit party. It would seem Boris promise that all tories elected in this election would back his brexit plan was a bit of the mark. Or maybe it shows that his brexit plan is not brexit at alltheir candidate For the isles is willing to back it.Good to see that the Brexit Party is not drawn into this level of debate. I am sure Robert Smith was absent because he was busy getting Brexit Done. Too right that a clean-break Brexit is what we need. Like was said before, a free trade deal will be the #easiest in human history#. Wise words from Liam Fox, and still yet to be disproved by the #facts#.Robert Leslie, SNP, is obviously unaware ofthe impact of independence. The EU has stated repeatedly that , wewill be automatically out of the EU on Independence Day # with #No Deal#.#When part of the territory of a Member State ceases to be a part of that State, e.g. because that territory becomes an independent state, the treaties will no longer apply #Westminster will no longer fund our #notional budget deficit#. It will become real. Nicola Sturgeon#s Scottish Growth Commission proposed a multi-year plan to reduce it to EU-acceptable levels. We must also have our own, independent central bank and therefore, our own currency. That will take nine yearsand will require tens of billions in foreign reserves.If Britain #remains# there would be a #hard UK border# with EU tarfs . Negotiations will be with Brussels, not Westminster.It will take at least  years, with austerity,to rejoin.And  when we do we shall join the euro and pass control of our economy trade and fishing agriculture to the EU.SNP EU Brexit policy is nonsense. Scots are shrewd people and will not buy it.No, I was absent because I was at sea.#with Rees-Mogg hiding below decks I think she was campaigning in the SW of England.Not surprising. The Brexit party are all at sea.At least you were at sea doing an honest days work Robert, unlike the other candidates. Nobody will know more about the negative effects of European Union membership than you!I#m a bit baffled. I read tonight that Jo Swinson has apologised that she and her Lib Dems backed the Tories# austerity policies. But last night I saw Willie Rennie backing those policies to the hilt. What a party.Jo was talking about the past.Willie was thinking about the future.Now  have quit, including Rees Mogg. Like what Robert did there though, referring to Jacob#s sister, formerly of the Brexit Party, and no longer campaigning for them in the South East of England. You#ve got to ask how a spare bedroom tax would impact on that family# including in their second and third homes and any additional properties in their portfolios.WHY SOCIALIST SNP MEMBERS SHOULD VOTE LABOUR TOMORROW:For the first time in forty years and possibly for the last time during my le, we have the chance to support a manesto that includes widespread nationalisation and the restoration of worker’s rights.These are policies that any self-respecting socialist would have regarded as red lines before Thatcher came along and “modernised” British politics.After Brexit and Scottish independence, we willto the natural battle between left and right. It will even take place within the SNP itself, once the phoney pre-independence “party of national unity” approach falls apart.During these debates, the left will highlight support for Corbyn’s radical policies as evidence that these are still relevant and can still win votes.Meanwhile, the right will highlight the lack of support for Labour as evidence that strong unions and public ownership are no longer winning policies and should be abandoned forever.If you can’t use your vote to get your candidate elected tomorrow, at lease use it to make a statement.The ideas behind Labour’s bold policies need to be kept alive.They will be as relevant in an independent Scotland as they will anywhere .Absolutely.Absolutely not, Johan. I am old enough to remember the Winter of Discontent. Comrade Corbyn, Comrade Scargill. First Secretary Sturgeon! Reach for the rusty tin, self-castration before I would vote Socialist or Nationalist.I am almost old enough to remember the s also. I went missing from hom when I wis about , because I was busy helping a couple of older folk collect fire wood in the absence of coal during the Tories  day week I think.We are not going back to the s, with what we know now we can run things much better under Corbyn.The absence of coal was due to Socialist and le long Soviet supporterMick McGahey#s miners strike. Hardly down to the Tories. Just the Unions holding the country to ransom. Thank God the Maggie neutered that bunch.It#s almost like you are saying Shetland needs a vocal and united local Labour Party willing to take a stand on environmental and equality issues and prepared to ensure people#s concerns are properly considered.Will the local branch make a start to rebuilding by considering whether it isn#t time to call an end to Sullom Voe Yes, it would be goodmembers stopped voting for other partiesIt#s almost like you are trying to change the subject. Which of the parties that plan to close Sullom Voe did you vote for It’s important that unions be strong but not omnipotent, as in the s when many major industries were still nationalised. We meed balance.Combining the two is all very fine for those who, like me, benefited from working in the public sector however it leads to a two-tier workforce, with those in the private sector footing the bill, in taxes or high product prices, for the privileged ones in the public sector. That also hits private sector pay as employers must maintain viability with their increased costs.Having said that, re-nationalisation of electricity would be hilariously apt because government would become directly accountable totaxpayers and or bill-payers for the soaring costs of energy arising from “decarbonisation”, associated with the lunacy of unilateral “declarations of climate emergency” and policies like Labour’s “net zero ”.The IPCC does not call for that and condemns unilateral action as being unhelpful in achieving international agreement.I voted for Blair when sanity prevailed,now Corbyn takes us all back, well he is trying to, but the result empowers Boris!!! So now we have a Boris   Sturgeon catfight. Interesting times ahead, perhaps an Independent Shetland is the way forward, history repeating.When Boris replies to the letter requesting an independence referendum for Shetland, I hope the recipient will share it on this forum.We could all do with a laugh.Don#t make us laugh IanI wouldn#t trust this council to run a bath never mind having full autonomy of all the finances!Are you going to be King Ian Just a jest, George, but many a true word!If Sturgeon goes Indy I would rather stay with the UK or go for autonomy. . Think about it.Agreed Johan, and Labour has had my vote this time, but when there is a chance of turffing out an austerity backing LibDem# The main thing is people are being offered a chance to take back control of the vital services they depend on that should never have been privatised in the first place.New management systems will mean these can in future serve the people rather than serving corporate greed.Whether we get there this election or not, Corbin#s bold ideas have reignited the debate and energised thousands more activists than the Tories have active members. Hope remains for a fairer society in which the economy works for the good of the people as well as the environment they depend on.The LibDems on the other hand remain forever compromised between the freedom of business to exploit people and the freedom of people not to be exploited. Some wonderful handwringing from Carmichael on Viking Energy this election.Well done for your stand there and on UHA.Particularly pleasing to see Friends of the Earth saying Labour#s manesto was better for the environment than that of the Greens.O dear, poor Peter.On the wrong side again.#Labour#s worst performance since #. #Corbin’s bold ideas have reignited the debate and energised thousands more activists than the Tories have active members.# What the Socialist left did for Labour, just imagine what the would do to the UK and shudder!!! Momentumare the new Militant Tendency, no wonder they are heading to the dust bin of history.No, I am agreeing with you Malcolm, and also saying there is a conversation to be had locally about how long Shetland should continue to host the oil industry.The biggest benefit would have been in stable local employment, but that is not what we have seen.If the oil industry honours its original promises there will be years of work in ing the terminal site to nature.Some will say the sooner that begins the better.If that thinking can#t happen on the left where  will it happen Apparently % voted for political parties that wanted a second Brexit referendum, but now we#ve got the blues.What hope now for the  in  bairns born into poverty Thank goodness we avoided Corbyn#s, Socialism Peter. Look to Socialism in Venasuallia what that would do for us. That whole country is in poverty.Over  million scots voted to remain in the uk nowhere near that amount of scots voted to remain in the eu or for the snp. What is it about democracy you don#t understand  You seem to think you just change the question to suit the answer you claim to have got to a question that was never asked. And then have the gall to say that brexiteers didn#t know what they were voting for.Think about this George. If two years ago I had said Boris would be PM with a landslide every one would have laughed. The phrase is #He who has the last laugh#, Ho, Ho, Ho. Now everyone calm down. The die is cast for Brexit, at last.Not that long ago the Tories and LibDems opposed the minimum wage, so it will be interesting to see which of Labour#s bold ideas become mainstream next..."},{"url":null,"title":"carmichael holds onto his seat ","story":"Alistair Carmichael has been ed as the MP for Shetland and Orkney for a sixth time.The longstanding isles MP won with over , votes, as the SNP were pipped to second place.SNP candidate Robert Leslie garnered , votes compared to Mr Carmichael#s ,.Meanwhile, the Scottish Conservatives came third, Labour fourth and Brexit Party fth, with independent candidate David Barnard coming last.Tory candidate Jenny Fairbairn polled , votes, Labour#s Coilla Drake ,, Robert Smith and anti-monarchy candidate David Barnard garnered  votes.There were  spoiled ballot papers, some of which may have been influenced by campaign by activist Stuart Hill, who called on voters to write #no thanx# across the paper.The result in this constituency is perhaps unsurprising.

They did well because of the absence of credible opposition, notably, from the Labour Party, with its incompetent leadership both nationally and in Scotland.

In response to Ofgem’s decision, SSEN is also promising to progress preparation of the Shetland #standby arrangements# which will complement the transmission link.It is hoped the decision will provide Shetland’s renewable developers clarity about future network charges, helping them make investment decisions and provide the evidence required by Ofgem for the regulator to approve the proposed transmission link to the Shetland Isles. Commenting on today’s decision, Colin Nicol, Managing Director for Networks, said: “We welcome today’s decision by Ofgem to approve our whole system solution for Shetland, which is a positive step toward meeting Shetland’s electricity needs at a much lower cost to energy consumers than alternative options.“The proposal will support future security of supply as well as unlocking Shetland’s renewable potential.Once built, the transmission link and the low carbon output from renewable generators on Shetland will also help support the electricity needs of Shetland’s oil and gas industry and its wider economy.“Our transmission business will shortly re-submit to Ofgem an updated Needs Case for the Shetland link and we look forward to working with Ofgem and Shetland developers to progress this proposal in a timely manner.”Funny how things like this are announced during the few days between the General Election and Christmas.Last we heard was renewable energy developers crying their eyes out that the proposed MW cable was inadequate for all the wind farms they want to build on Shetland.#Follow the money#. So-called #contributions# from SSEN#s customers and bigger cables with more generation lead to a reduction in the price of VE#s next bid in a renewable energy auction.Who would bet against SSEN#s revised #final needs case# proposing an even bigger capacity cable, enabling even more and bigger wind farms to be built Commenting on today’s decision, Colin Nicol, Managing Director for Networks, said: “We welcome today’s decision by Ofgem to approve our whole system solution for Shetland, which is a positive step toward meeting Shetland’s electricity needs at a much lower cost to energy consumers than alternative options.Does this statement mean that the average shetland family would be able to obtain electricity cheaper on the commissioning of the project  Would it be possiblethe turbines were commissioned prior to the connector cable being commissioned then could the power be made available locally at reduced pricing  This looks like so much greenwash and so many weasel words to a community whose council has a vested interest in rolling over and playing dead. What exactly are we to read into #meeting Shetland#s energy needs at a much lower cost to energy consumers# There is an implied promise there, and even a threat, but no actual guarantee of cheaper bills for local residents.As for #unlocking Shetland#s renewable potential#, this looks like code for unlocking their potential to exploit the landscape and the people through environmentally harmful proposals the people will get no say in.Shetland remains in thrall to the notion that all potential economic activity is necessarily a positive development.Some developments however represent an approach to development that dlsempowers, robs folk of a say and foists solutions onto them that do not address their problems or needs.There will be opportunities for some to profit no doubt, but is is hard for the council to dispassionately manage partnership with these far larger players when they are so wowed by the prospect of cash flowing into the reserves through ground rent to the Busta estate.The SIC will do diddlysquat to ensure local concerns are considered..."},{"url":null,"title":"development officer at shetland tourism association 2 ","story":"A unique opportunity to work with and support tourism businesses throughout Shetland.The STA is seeking a motivated inidual with a passion for tourism for a fixed term  year post.The postholder will work  hours per week on a self-employed basis.Tasks will include website updates, liaising with members and industry bodies, arranging member events, overseeing the implementation of the Tourism Strategy and producing reports as required."},{"url":null,"title":"hjaltland housing association ","story":"HAS AVAILABLE TO REGISTERED APPLICANTSpayable £. p.c.m.

Kezzie, the -year-old Border Collie who is around  years old in human years, might be more refined in age but getting her forever home has given her a new lease of le.Nuala Wilson, who has been a supporter of Dogs Trust for some time, had been searching for a canine companion with her partner Lance. They had seen Kezzie’s pictures on the Dogs Trust website and wanted to meet her.Nuala said: “We visited the Rehoming Centre, where all the other dogs were so excited and lively in their kennels. Kezzie just seemed so relaxed and we got the chance to meet and play with her.“Despite being an older dog, she has the heart of a puppy and I personally believe she chose us as her new owners as much as we chose her. Our le has changed so much since taking her home with us and we wouldn’t change it for the world.“We definitely have more responsibility with a dog and a set routine, however Kezzie is part of the family and makes our house feel like a home. We can’t wait to spend Christmas with Kezzie she will definitely get lots of toys and although she is on a special diet for her tummy, she will get some tummy friendly treats for dinner too.”Sarah Park, Assistant Manager at Dogs Trust Ballymena, said:“We are so glad Kezzie has settled into her new home. Although we were sad to see her go, we are over the moon because she couldn’t have found a better family.“Although Kezzie is the perfect example of a dog finding their forever home, statistics show online searches for puppies skyrocket by % in the countdown to Christmas and we would urge the public not to buy puppies or dogs as gts. Our slogan, A dog is for le, not just for Christmas, is still very relevant and a reminder to think carefully about the lelong commitment of getting a pet before making the decision.“If someone isn’t sure about whether now is the right time is to welcome a four-legged friend into their home, we would encourage them to support rescue dogs in other ways such as becoming a volunteer foster carer or sponsoring one of our beautul dogs.”Visit www.dogstrust.org.uk adogisforle to find out more about fostering, sponsoring a dog and for advice on dog ownership.

The Colin area representative has replaced newly elected MP for North Belfast John Finucane.Co-opted to Belfast City Council in Janaury , the -year-old told the Andersonstown News that it will be a “huge honour” to represent the people of Belfast.“What can I say, it’s amazing,” he said. “I’m honoured to have been asked by Sinn Féin to be the next Ard Mhéara of Belfast. “I have been an activist in the Colin area since I was . I’m very much about grassroots politics and that theme is something I want to continue. “I want to use the office of Mayor to bring politics from the ground up.” Having topped the council election poll in May, Danny spoke of how he will be continuing the civic work of party colleague John Finucane. “The role of Mayor is city-wide, I want to be a Mayor for all communities and to represent everybody. I want to champion the need for improvements to our mental health services. It’s something that has really impacted the Colin area. I want to use the office of Mayor to help in whatever way I can. I will work with our young people to ensure that they are included in decision-making that they have a brighter future and better quality of le.”The Lagmore father-of-three said he will be straight into Mayor business when he takes over the ‘chain’ today.“I want to do this for my family.  has been a dficult year for our family with the loss of our mother Edna. Mum was probably my biggest supporter and I want to do her, my we and children proud. I want to show my kids that there is nothing you can’t achieve through hard work and doing your best.”Sinn Féin group leader on the Council, Ciarán Beattie, described Mr Baker as a “well-respected and grounded community activist in the Colin area”.He added: “He has also been a vocal campaigner for LGBT and Irish language rights, climate action, community empowerment and for mental health awareness. “Danny will take this grassroot style of representation into the role of Mayor and ensure that all the needs of the citizens of this city are reflected in Belfast City Council. I want to pay tribute to outgoing Ard Mhéara John Finucane. He placed human rights social justice, environmentalism and defending Belfast against Brexit at the heart of his term.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"health workers begin 12 hour","story":"THOUSANDS of health workers across the north have begun -hour strike action in a dispute over pay and patient safety.The Royal College of Nursing, who represent around , nurses, are taking strike action for the first time in its -year history.About , other nurses, who are members of Unison have also walked out.On Tuesday night, leaders of the five main parties met the head of the NI Civil Service, David Sterling, and Health Department Permanent Secretary, Richard Pengelly, in a th-hour bid to avert the strike action and state their “collective support for the restoration of pay parity”.The Northern Ireland Office later said that Health was a devolved matter and Mr Sterling rejected the idea of restoring pay parity on the grounds of public interest.UNISON Regional Secretary Patricia McKeown said: “Everyone with power and authority in this society has conceded that our cause is just. We have had ‘sympathy’ from the UK Government through the Secretary of State, from all political parties that stood on our picket lines and from the leadership of the health service. But we have no resolution.“UNISON has agreed emergency cover and our members have volunteered to provide it. We have never seen such determination in health workers who have been devalued and disrespected for almost  years. For  weeks they have stood up for their rights and have now put the health service at the top of the political agenda.“Despite their sacrice there is still no action from those in power. It would appear that health workers, patients and the public at large are being used as pawns in a political game.“As we enter this signicant period in the industrial struggle the consequences lay firmly on the shoulders of the UK Government, our elected politicians and the leadership of the civil service.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"welcome organisation be kind to those living on the street","story":"I meet with Welcome Organisation CEO Sandra Moore in a room stacked from floor to almost ceiling of sleeping bags, which I’m told, have been donated by the Marine Society and Sea Cadets. Most,not all, of these will be gone over the coming nights to those sleeping rough in the city centre. Offering tea and coffee on tap from am until pm at their Townsend Street HQ, Sandra told the Andersonstown News that the need for their service is very much “ days a year”. “We have service users coming to us with ious needs, whether it’s clothes, a cup of tea or somewhere to have a bit of refuge. We do make targeted appeals throughout the year via our Facebook page and we do have people ringing to ask is there anything in particular we need. We always need decent trainers, sturdy, durable. We can’t hold out to jeans, in smaller sizes of waist, new underwear on which there is a massive demand all year round, socks and toiletries. “We can’t hold out to coffee, tea, sugar, washing powder, toilet roll, those things make a big dference to us,” she said.“We would ask for those who are donating that there is a reasonable le left in the items they want to give. We always have a need for sleeping bags and we don’t distribute tents on the streets as they would pose a danger.”Established  years ago, the Welcome Organisation has provided a vital shelter for those sleeping rough and who are experiencing homelessness. Sandra spoke of how the need for the service has “changed dramatically” in that time.“We are dealing with a greater number of people, people with more signicant issues, drug, alcohol, mental health, not all the people we work with do, its some, not all. What we are finding is that the age profile of those seeking the service is much younger, and there are more women coming to the Organisation. When I came  years ago we had six women in service. Now a third of our service users are female.”She continued: “We are working with homelessness in its most chronic form. We can’t forget that there is hidden homelessness. By that I mean people sleeping on sofas, moving from pillar to post. Nobody has a handle on that. One in  people within their le in Northern Ireland will experience homelessness. Le expectancy of someone who has had periods of continuous homelessness is  for a woman and  for a man.”Sandra said that currently those service users at the centre are predominantly young males from North and West Belfast.As  comes to a close, Sandra said that the issue of homelessness is facing a constant struggle in the New Year.“All services are facing pressure, lack of mental health services, lack of drug and alcohol support service and not just in Belfast, right across the North. We do not have detox or rehab facilities here, what services are there, due to severe pressures, aren’t responsive enough. We are trying to bridge that gap. It’s quite evident right across the city that there is a growing drug problem, there is a real need for education in communities. “People have to bear in mind that there is a back story to each and every person who is homeless. This is someone’s son, somebody’s daughter. Nobody has ever set out on that path. What child do you ask and they say ‘I want to be ill’, ‘I want to be struggling with addiction’, ‘I want to be homeless’. It’s not an aspiration but unfortunately it’s were we are. In Belfast I think we have a chance to not end up like Dublin, like London, the big cities. We still have a chance of doing something to contain it, but the agencies need to work together.”“No-one knows what the budget is for Ireland next year. How can you possibly plan while we have no minister for finance or minster for health  We, along with others, are highly dependent on the good will of the public, we couldn’t survive without the public,” she said. “I’ve been here  years and every year I am still overwhelmed by the generosity of people, people are very kind, however homelessness is an issue  days of the year.”Sandra said the levels of increased poverty within households job losses and the impact of Universal Credit are contributing factors to homelessness. “Regardless of whatever way Brexit goes, the economy is shrinking again, there is higher unemployment. “As my grandmother always said ‘when poverty comes in the door, love goes out the window’. We see so many times relationships breaking down because of the stresses of poverty linked to job losses. Statistics show that children growing up in poverty that their le chances are much worse. Someone who experiences homelessness as a child is much more likely to experience it as an adult – we need more preventive services going forward.”With the Organisation’s core team of staff, Sandra said that they couldn’t provide their service without their “ volunteers”. “We had  for Christmas dinner last year and so far we have wrapped over  Christmas presents,  of those bespoke for our regular users. We are inundated with people wanting to volunteer with us on Christmas Day – it’s a lovely day but it’s a hard day for a lot of people as you can imagine. We try to keep familiar faces around for the people that are coming in.“We just want to thank everyone for their continued support, we couldn’t do our work without it. We have a fantastic team of staff, of volunteers and the support of the public and the community. All I would ask is that people continue to be kind. That’s all I ask, is for people to be kind to those on the street. We don’t always know the story of how or why it has come to that.”For more information on the Welcome Organisation or to donate visit www.homelessbelfast.org"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"young people saying yes to yeha project","story":"ESTABLISHED over ten years ago, the YEHA Project has gone from strength to strength in helping young people in North Belfast.Based in the Flax Centre and the Houben Centre in Ardoyne, YEHA stands for Youth, Education, Health and Advice.The YEHA Project is made up of a small dedicated team of five full-time staff, sessional workers and a team of volunteers. One such youth worker is -year-old Cara O’Kane, who has been involved with YEHA Project for four years.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Cara explained more about the work of YEHA Project.“The YEHA Project supports young people in North Belfast aged  to  to tackle issues affecting their health and emotional well being,” she said.“Our work with young people embraces the core principles of youth work with therapeutic approaches.“Basically, we were set up over ten years ago to tackle health inequalities in North Belfast.“Our focus is on trying to get young people to focus on healthy lestyles and make positive and healthy choices regarding their wellbeing.“We do a lot of mentoring and support work where a young person would work with a youth worker informally centered around mental health and wellbeing. This may involve building coping skills and strategies for any dficulties they are facing in their le and looking at their interests and skills.“We want young people more involved in the community and activities instead of just going home after school as well.“It is about getting them out and about and giving them opportunities to try dferent things“We have had fantastic feedback from the young people themselves about the work that we do. They are testament to the work that they do themselves with our projects.“Our projects are all voluntary and everything is in the young person’s hands. Sometimes you have to step out of your comfort zone but the benefits are massive.The YEHA Project is also involved with cross-community work, alongside an organisation based on the Woodvale called Streetbeat Youth Project.Another successful project is the Carezone in Schools project, a pilot programme which is currently into its second year, based at Mercy College.Cara explained: “It is a model where we run one-to-one support within the school and have someone from YEHA project in the school daily to work with students in school.“After running a research programme, we found that over  per cent of young people would be more likely to speak to another young person about their problems rather than an adult.“We run the one-to-one mentoring service alongside a Peer Mentor programme where young people are trained up in Peer Mentoring to help support other young people on issues affecting their mental health and enables them to signpost to relevant support agencies.“It was a successful first year and last year we delivered  sessions to  pupils covering a range of issues including building coping skills and resilience, relationships, communication and social skills, health and well-being and anxiety.“We have a nice room in Mercy College where young people can come and relax and they are more likely to open up in such an environment.“It is all voluntary too, of course.”One young person, who took part in the programme, Jodie Shevlin, praised the benefits of it during the pressures of school exams.“The Carezone in Schools project is a way for pupils to distress and escape from the pressure of school work and exam,” she said.“The one-to-one work the project does is a chance for us to get worries or problems off our chest and be able to just have a more relaxed chat where we are really listened to.“It has really helped me get through my last few years of school.”YEHA ProjectFlax CentreArdoyne AvenueBelfast BT DATel:    "},{"url":null,"title":"bumper year for northern ireland as film location with game of thrones derry girls and line of duty","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have no idea yet what the impact is going to be on communities around the border, what the impact is going to be on this island in terms of north-south and east-west trade.\"He believes there has been a loss of trust in politicians over the last few years due to the \"shenanigans over Brexit\" and he urged political leaders to listen carefully to the people who are telling them they \"expect them to be back\" at Stormont. The pattern of voting in the recent general election in Northern Ireland showed people \"changing their allegiances in order to encourage politicians to go back to work in the Assembly\", he continued.Expressing satisfaction over the talks between Northern Irelands parties, Dr Martin said he was \"hopeful\" that this time around they wouldto the Assembly. \"I would be pretty mad, and most people would be,it didnt happen. I am hoping that that will bear fruit in the coming weeks.\"The longer this goes on we are noticing the impact on peoples hospital appointments being cancelled because of health cuts, we are noticing it in our schools who are struggling to meet their budgets, and we are noticing it in a rising level of sectarianism which was during the summer.\""},{"url":null,"title":"psni called after teams scuffle at dungannon swifts v institute game","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The result was the Atari Video Computer System . Released in September , the VCS was priced at the hefty sum of around pound – the equivalent of approximately pound today. The first incarnation of the system included a console, two joysticks, a pair of paddles and the Combat game cartridge. There were however eight other games available to be sold separately that included – Air-Sea Battle, Star Ship and Street Racer and Breakout. googletag.cmd.push Perhaps the most memorable of all the games of this era was Pong- the two-dimensional table tennis simulator. The game, originally developed as a training exercise in programming for an Atari employee, was one of the earliest arcade video games back in  and proved hugely commercially successful. A separate home version that could be played on a TV was released in . Players controlled game paddles by moving it vertically across the left or right side of the screen to hit a ball back and forth. The aim was to win by amassing eleven points. A point was won when one failed tothe ball to the other. The game was then included in the games for the Atari VCS two years later. Despite the obvious huge advances in gaming technology in the ensuing four decades the enduring appeal of Atari for people of a certain age remains. The Atari Flashback with the original games can still be bought today for around pound. But what other toys enthralled the children of the s  Launched in , the Nerf Ball was billed as the “world’s first official indoor ball”. The marketing team charged with selling what was essentially a large foam sphere, emphasised the safety aspect of the product by stating: “You can’t damage lamps or break windows. You can’t hurt babies or old people.” This simple message was very effective because four million Nerf Balls were sold in it’s first year in existence. Undoubtedly another of the favourite and best toys of the era was the Evel Knievel Stunt Cycle. Ideal Toys launched its popular line of toy bikes in  and zoned in on the antics of the crazy American stuntman to boost their sales. Knievel made a total of  jumps on his Harley Davidson that year including a leap over  vans at the start of that year. Whilst Evel is probably best remembered for his spectacular crashes rather than his successes, the sales of the toy did not crash and sold in millions. One of the few toys that made a full-blownto the commercial market  years after its original launch was Stretch Armstrong. Introduced to the world by the Kenner toy company in  the muscular male figure made of laytex rubber and filled with gelled corn syrup allows it to be stretched from its original size of  inches up to around  foot before reverting back to its normal shape. If a tear developed it could be repaired with an adhesive bandage and instructions on how to fix Stretch were included inside the box. Hasbro who bought the brand, very successfully brought Stretch Armstrong back to the market at the New York Toy Fair in . Christmas of course sees us all indulge in sweets and the s was no exception.

First to three goals was the aim in the table top game Crossfire in the s. The object was to push one of the pucks through the opposing player’s goal by firing small metal ball bearings at them using the attached guns. The effect of the Star Wars film series on popular culture has been immense. But with the filmmakers initially dubious about the success of the first film in , manufacturers were seemingly reluctant to launch a toy franchise based on the film.

As filming began for The Empire Strikes Back in spring  children were screaming for new merchandise that Christmas. And nothing has changed since.

The Bionic Woman series was a spin-off from the s Six Million Dollar Man television science fiction action series. Like its parent program The Bionic Woman spawned its own line of toys. Kenner produced a -inch doll of the character, with similar features to the Steve Austin version , except instead of a bionic eye the dolls head would click when turned, simulating the sound of Jaimes bionic ear.

Originally written as a poem by Cecil Frances Alexander, the carol was first published in  in her work, Hymns for Little Children. A year later in , the English organist Henry John Gauntlett discovered the poem and set it to music. Mrs Cecil Frances Alexander was born at  Eccles Street, Dublin in April . She was the third child of Major John Humphreys of Norfolk and Elizabeth .

In , Cecil Frances Humprheys married clergyman William Alexander in Strabane. He was later to become the Church of Ireland Bishop of Derry and Raphoe and the Primate of All Ireland.

Mrs Alexander was a involved in charitable work for most of her le and she was involved with sting up the Derry Home for Fallen Women and worked on the development of a district nursing service. Another classic hymn penned by Mrs Alexander, There Is a Green Hill Far Away has obviously endured the test of time but few realise the part that it has played in transforming the education of deaf children almost  years ago in the north of Ireland. Cecil Frances Alexander and her sister Anne were heavily involved in local church activities in Strabane including their visits to local families. On one of the visits they met a young deaf boy from a poor home in the area. They were greatly concerned about the loneliness of his existence and the fact he was alienated from learning, especially about Christian way of le.

Mrs Alexander is also commemorated by an Ulster History Circle blue plaque on Derrys Bishop Street. One of her most famous quotes remains: Do no sinful action, speak no angry word ye belong to Jesus, children of the Lord.

Mann was organist at Kings between  and . In his arrangement, the first verse is sung by a boy chorister of the Choir of Kings Chapel as a solo. The second verse is sung by the choir, and the congregation joins in the third verse. Excluding the first verse, the hymn is accompanied by the organ. According to the tradition of the Kings College Choir, the soloist of this hymn is usually chosen on the day of the performance, when the choirmaster decides whose voice is the strongest on the day right before the broadcast.

And why shouldn’t we  We deserve to let our hair down and our belts hang loose for a few days every year. Honestly, there’s nothing better than half a selection box and a couple of Chocolate Mikado for breakfast, washed down with the fizzy drink of your choice. Unfortunately, that means that come January, a lot of us will be looking in the mirror and regretting a food filled festive season. Now this article doesn’t hold the secret to dropping back a dress size in two weeks or getting down one or two notches on the belt. googletag.cmd.push And it’s not because the next few hundred word are not helpful, it’s because quick fixes simply don’t work.Quick fixes focus on restriction and deprivation, not freedom and satisfaction. This mindset is not sustainable. Nobody can live, or wants to live off a kale diet or a brutal daily workout. So how do you get the results you want  Well we have a few helpful tips to help you make that sustainable change. Tip  - Keep it simple!Small changes to your diet and lestyle are more sustainable than dramatic overhauls. By making small changes over a period of time, helps to keep you motivated and on track and develop a habit - a good habit! googletag.cmd.push Tip  - Set realistic goals% of people will make a resolution to lose weight in the New Year but it’s not a very specic goal and so they inevitably end up failing. It is the same with fitness goals you want to get fitter but you need to ask yourself some questions first. Would you like to run a k or k  What about strength goals  Or maybe you’d like to learn a perfect a handstand. These goals are more actionable than vague ones. Tip  - Have a planA great philosopher once said, “a goal without a plan is just a wish.” Your plan could be as simple as losing .kg a week, to give you confidence on your summer holidays. Maybe your plan is to run the local k race in May. By having a deadline and a definite goal, it is very easy to plan. Tip  - Kick into actionThe next part is often the hardest. Here is where you put those plans into action. Another wise philosopher once said “No change can happen without taking action.” This is often where many people fail to succeed. The easiest way to make changes is to make them small and manageable. If you always miss that evening class, try bringing your gym gear with you to work. Miss the class and you’re guaranteed to feel bad, and that’s a mental setback. Tip  - Stay on the wagonWith sustainable change, consistency is the key, unlike the quick fix where you go all out for a few weeks but fall off the wagon. With small achievable changes, you start to achieve victories in your diet or fitness routine and the long-term goals are easier to visualise and accomplish. Tip  - Be better, not perfectMy last tip for achieving long term results is to aim for better not perfect. Everybody is human, even us personal trainers have lazy days or choose the unhealthy option over the salad! Treat yourselfand this will help you stay on track and smash those goals in  and beyond.

So we are very pleased at Derry Now to speak with our favourite man of the moment, Santa Claus.  What is happening at the moment Santa Claus Well, I have received so many letters from the good children in Derry and surrounding areas, I have had to stay up extra late over the last few nights. All the elves are working very hard to make sure that everything will be ready for delivery of the presents on Christmas Eve night.I am hearing very good reports about the children in the city and surrounding areas from my Santa helpers.The North Pole is very cold, so we have had to wrap up very well, as I noticed you have had to do in Derry as well, over the past few weeks. googletag.cmd.push What advise have you for the children of Derry, who will be waiting with great excitement on the night before Christmas Mammies and daddies will want to make sure that you get to bed early, so that you are fast asleep when I arrive.Last year, I noticed that a few of the children tried to stay awake, but by the time I arrived in the county, it was great to see that all the good boys and girls were fast asleep. Will the children all get what they want This is the biggest problem that I have each year. Normally I will try my very best to get the boys and girls what they want, but sometimes that is not possible.I am very very sorry for this, but I always try my best and will always try.But sometimes you know, the surprise present on Christmas morning, is the best present of them all. googletag.cmd.push Have you had any letters from this part of the world So many, you would not believe. Creggan, Bogside, Brandywell, Rosemount, Pennyburn, Belmont, Carnhill, Shantallow, Skeoge, Ballyarnett, Culmore, Lisnagelvin, Altnagelvin, Irish Street, Clooney, Currynierin, Top of the Hill, Drumahoe, Ballymagroarty, Hazelbank, Foyle Springs and Strathfoyle are just some of the areas that have already written in.But there are still a few places that I may have not mentioned, so get those letters in to me. Will you get to write to everybody in time Probably not, but the great thing about the magic of Christmas is that I can see every letter written to Santa, eventhe children forget to put it in the post. Will you be hungry I am always hungry with having to travel all around the world. Sometimes I get a chance to get a little bite to eat, but a glass of milk and a sandwich is always great. I have been told by Mrs Claus to keep off the sweets, but maybe just one or two. Rudolph says that the reindeers are happy with some water and maybe a carrot, but don’t worry, as they are all well fed before they leave the North Pole. Last words to the children of Derry Make sure and be on your best behaviour. Listen to your parent or parents and remember that some presents are so very expensive, but please enjoy the ones you get. I have seen children in Africa and other poorer countries, who are not as lucky as the children in Derry.And always remember that there are other children out in the world less well off than you.  Ho! Ho! Ho! and a big Happy Christmas to all the readers and advertisers of Derry Now.  May  bring you lots of joy, happiness and good health.

Local writers, Ben Dillon and Liam Diver, took their spot in the limelight reading a few of their own poems that reflect the challenges le can bring. This reading may be a stepping stone to further writing and more performances from both Liam and Ben.Julieann Campbellread from her Guildhall Press publication, “Milk Teeth,” and graced those in attendance with a number of new poems she is currently working on.Damian Gorman is a quietly compelling performance poet and his rendering of his poignant autobiographical poem, “The Giant Basket,” touched hearts in An Cro Mor. Undoubtedly though, the evening’s youngest performer, Caitlin Browne, was the star of the night. The audience hollered their appreciation after her lively reading. Her father, Jim, in the audience, was a proud and delighted man.An audience member from Linsfort Drive offered this feedback: Why can’t we have nights like this more often ” Creggan Community Collective deserve both thanks and praise for opening their dwoors to this “Christmas Cracker.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The new community hub represents an investment of pound. million stemming from both Council and the Department for Com- munities through its Neigh- bourhood Renewal Invest- ment fund. A second com- munity centre is also at an advanced stage of procure- ment for the neighbouring Galliagh estate, providing much needed facilities in the Outer North Neighbourhood Renew-al Area, signicantly improving the community infrastructure and available shared space in the area. The community centre in Galliagh will be the first purpose-built major facility of its kind at this location in the heart of one of Derry’s largest housing communities.Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District, Councillor Michaela Boyle, said the new centres would play an important role in the delivery of community services in both the Shantallow and Galliagh areas.She said: “Investment in local communities is a major priority for Council and that commitment is evident in the signicant capital investment in new facilities in recent years,” she stressed. “The new centres will become vibrant and busy community hubs, facilitating new activities and the delivery of vital services within Shantallow and Galliagh.“There are great ambitions for the transformation of the city’s community areas as outlined in both the Strategic Growth Plan and the Local Development Plans and we need the infrastructure and facilities in place to realise these aspirations. I really look forward to seeing the plans move now to the next stage as quickly as possible.”The Department for Communities is contributing pound.m towards the two new community facilities.Sharon McCullagh, deputy director, Community Empowerment Division of the Department for Com- munities, said: “After many years of partnership working with Council and the local community in respect of both Shantallow and Galliagh community centres I am delighted the aspirations of the community can now progress to reality. “I welcome the appointment of the contractor for the Shantallow Community Centre and the progression of the procurement process for the Galliagh Community Centre project.“The Department for Communities through the Neighbourhood Renewal Investment Fund has com- mitted pound million to Shantallow Community Centre and pound. million to Galliagh Community Centre. Both these projects will signicantly improve com- munity infrastructure and space in the Outer North Neighbourhood Renewal Area. “They will facilitate continued delivery of community-based pro- grammes and services and an improved environment that will contribute to more confident and sustainable communities. “I really look forward to the development of both these projects on the ground.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The principal cast performed like seasoned professionals, bringing the iconic characters to le with flair and panache.Eoin McGuinness and Ellen McGurnaghan were outstanding in their comic portrayals of Gomez and Morticia Addams, while Annie Haughey and Eoin Moore were superb as the sinister siblings, Wednesday and Pugsley.The hilariously embarrassing grandmother was played by Aisha Oladipupo, and Year  student Conaire Laverty brought endless laughs as the grunting Lurch. Conn Murnin, as Uncle Fester, was a particular audience favourite and his departure on a rocket to seek the love of his le mdash the Moon mdash was a highlight of the show.The ever present long dead Addams ancestors were a tight and focused chorus including a stunning range of costumes from cavemen to flappers.

The boys are all training hard and we are working on a few dferent permutations for the decider, but it will definitely be horses for courses.ldquoTony McIlhone, Jack McLaughlin and Adam and Gareth George will be key for us in the final. Their experience should stand us in good stead, but I have absolutely no doubt that our young players will rise to the occasion, he added.Fitzsimmons paid tribute to Gerard Kelly, who led the team, to Harry Clarke Cup success last season with Kieran Sharvin and who is still in the management team.ldquoIt is a pleasure and honour to work alongside Gerard, who puts so much effort into keeping the club going. We have been friends for many years and work so well together, he said.ldquoWe have come up with a few ideas on how to get at Ballynahinch Olympic, but we will leave that information to the changing rooms in Meadowvale.Barry McGoran and Marty Sloan have moulded Ballynahinch Olympic Town into a force to be reckoned with, despite the fact that they rarely field with the same  every week due to first team call-ups.As a reserve team, people tend to write them off in the big games, but theyrsquove consistently proved that theyrsquore good enough to compete with anyone.The squad has done exceptionally well to get to another final, but they wont be happy until they get our hands on the cup.McGoran and Sloan like to play the same way as Killough and use the tactic of attack being the best means of defence and Barry feels that Olympic arenrsquot far away from lting the trophy.ldquoWersquore only half way there and need to stay focused. We got a bit carried away last year, but wersquove learnt from that. We need calm heads now, hesaid.ldquoKillough will go into the final as favourites. Theyrsquore a good side with some quality players, especially in midfield and can be lethal going forward, but so can we. We showed that in the semi-final and we have plenty of quality players ourselves.In lsquokeeper John McMenamin Olympic have an experienced custodian, who is a great shot-stopper and as brave as they come.A mixture of Niall McGlew, Mick Rice, Gavin McMullan, Thomas Rodgers Reece McConnell, Darryl Russell and Liam Sloan will make up a formidable defensive barrier with Simon Marmion handed the playmakerrsquos role in the middle of midfield.Shane Rodgers, Simon Marmion, Jack Roddy, Josh Fennell, Gary Wilson, Daniel Rice, Stephen King, Dylan McCartan and Connor Reid will vie for starting places alongside Marmion leaving the twin threat of Darren Lyons and Aaron McCaffrey up front.This pair compliment one and other perfectly.Both are comfortable on the ball and both are workaholics. Defenders canrsquot take an eye off either one as they will destroy you in a flash.McGoran believes his side are ready to cash in on the success of the clubrsquos first team.ldquo The club has come a long way in recent years and when you see the success that our first team is having its incredible, McGoran beamed.ldquoThe professionalism and dedication they show in training has filtered down through the club and it has inspired the younger players to put the work in to try and get to that level mdash and thatrsquos a big part of why our seconds team is doing so well.ldquoLast year ended up being a disappointing Christmas for the club, so itrsquos up to us all to make sure we put things right this time around..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Department.jpg","title":"Department ‘has just 8 staff members’ to fix all streets lights in province  ","story":"A LEADING government department has warned that it is not able to operate a full street lighting repair service across the district due to cutbacks.The Department of Infrastructure has revealed that its repair budget has been slashed by two thirds, down from just over poundm to around poundm. In addition, roads officials only have eight electricians to repair faulty street lights across the Province, with just five of these working full-time.The crisis facing street lighting repairs has been highlighted this week by South Down MLA Colin McGrath who has been contacted by many concerned residents across the constituency.He said that the government departmentrsquos failure to sanction work to repair street lights mdash which includes replacing faulty wiring and defective bulbs mdash is a major concern for many, in particular, the vulnerable and elderly.Mr McGrath said that while the issue may appear trivial and mundane to some, to a signicant number of others, itrsquos literally is a matter of personal safety.He said many are fearful of injuring themselves due to faulty street lights which plunge areas around their home into darkness.The MLA declared: ldquoThere is barely a street or road in South Down that does not have street lights which are not working. When there are several defective lights in a row, this creates problems.Mr McGrath said that he and his colleagues have been ldquoinundated with repair requests which are passed on to the departmentrsquos street lighting team.He said that while he is full of admiration for the local team who work tirelessly to resolve faulty streetlights in a professional and courteous way, they can only work with the budget they have been given, one which he said falls well short of what is required.ldquoI have written to the Department for Infrastructure and have found out that the budget for street lighting should be poundm a year. It is currently a mere poundm which is totally inadequate and falls well short of what the public expect, declared Mr McGrath.ldquoApparently, there are only eight full time staff managing the work of replacing and fixing street lights across the whole of North and this is wholly unacceptable. Eight staff from Derry toNewry, and Enniskillen to Ballycastle is not enough and represents a situation that demands action.The MLA confirmed that he has also raised his concerns with the permanent secretary at the helm of the government department asking that in the depths of winter and reduced daylight hours, additional funding will be made to address the issue.Mr McGrath added: ldquoWe are literally in the dark over what will happen next and need to see some solution to this problem.A spokeswoman for the Department for Infrastructure has confirmed that officials have discussed the street lighting situation with Mr McGrath.ldquoWhilst we appreciate his concerns, we have explained that in common with many other parts of the public service, the Department continues to face budget challenges and resources are not available to provide for a full street lighting repair service, she continued.ldquoThe Departmentrsquos current budget for street lighting repairs is approximately poundm, which is much lower than the pound.m that would be required to provide a full street lighting repair service.The spokeswoman explained that repairs are now generally limited to those that can be carried out by the departmentrsquos internal street lighting workforce, which consists of five full time and three part time electricians.She added: ldquoDue to the restricted service, outages may take much longer than usual to be repaired, with priority being given to hazardous electrical defects and group outages..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Devaney.jpg","title":"Devaney elected as new chairman of Down GAA  ","story":"DOWN GAA elected a new chairman at the annual convention in Newry last Wednesday evening.

Like many other couples of that era, the wedding was a small affair and they spent a welcome few days honeymooning in Dublin.Alan worked as a writer in the Supply and Secretariat branch of the Royal Navy and soon needed to leave his new bride at home toto his posting. Muriel worked in the office of the now defunct Ulster Transport company.They met on a bus from Belfast to Portaferry and the rest, as they say, is history.ldquoI think we were both on the bus from Belfast and my mother, who knew Muriel, sat beside her and they began to talk and then we were introduced, said Alan. ldquoI was sitting behind and my mother then invited her down for supper the next night.Muriel interjected jokingly: ldquoI was supposed to be going to a shorthand class, which would have made my dear father much happier, but I mitched off and went to the Ritz pictures instead.ldquoHis mother had already spotted me and approved me as a likely candidate for her son as she believed that I knew how to keep house since I was doing it at home as my mother died when I was very young.Alan said that his motherrsquos approval of Muriel very much matched his own.ldquoI had clapped eyes on her before and I thought she will do very nicely for me. It was a private thought, but my mother must have picked up on it and had some insight, he added.Muriel did come for supper the next night and an invitation to a dance was given by Alan. They courted for over a year and more whenever he was home on leave.Alanrsquos parents, Rachel and Ian, were in the next room when Alan later asked Muriel to marry him and they celebrated with tea and supper again.ldquoI was completely flabbergasted but I would say that it was a romantic proposal, recalled Muriel. ldquoAlanrsquos father was great at tending to an open fire in the sitting room and his mother was a great hostess in making scones and cake for supper, so I think just after his father tended the fire, Alan turned tome and asked me to marry me. I think I said yes with a laugh as it was so unexpected.The couple spent the early years of their marriage in Malta where Alan was stationed and where the eldest two sons where born.While the family spent a short time living in Bangor, they have spent the last  years living Downpatrick where Alan went on to work for Radio Rentals in the town, and later in the British Red Cross Society in Belfast, while Muriel worked for the Saul playgroup and later in Downpatrick Library.The couplersquos love of music and going to the theatre, both in Belfast, and at the former Theatre Upstairs, in Irish Street, Downpatrick, was a shared passion over the years.Even today, they both love to watch or listen to concerts on the radio or TV, with performances perking up them up from a trying day or calling on their Alexa to play some Glen Miller music.Muriel said: ldquoWe both love the theatre and we both absolutely love music of all sorts. If therersquos anything that doesnrsquot suit us, we have a wee word with Alexa and say itrsquos your turn to chose.Alan added: ldquoIrsquove often said isnrsquot it wonderful that we have the same tastes in common and thatrsquos a great start to a marriage as well as a good sense of humour and a short memory.Muriel said: ldquoI think it did help that we did like the same things but I would say donrsquot leave it too long before you say sorry for whatever may have happened or been said between you.

Cllr Enrightrsquos assertion has been rejected by council officials.ldquoThe long-standing plans to publicly finance the redevelopment of public lands in Downpatrick town centre have been abandoned, he claimed.Cllr Enright said business representatives who attended the meeting in Downpatrick were not informed that a proposed road linking Irish Street with St Patrickrsquos Avenue as part of a new one-way system was not proceeding.He said such a scheme mdash which roads officials have said is not viable given the cost and the small impact that it would have on congestion mdash would have eliminated the need for traffic lights on all the main junctions and ldquomassively reduced congestion around the centre of town.Cllr Enright claimed that when he queried the decision, he was informed that the councilrsquos priorities are the Ballynahinch bypass and Newryrsquos southern relief road.He added: ldquoAll this comes hot on the heels of the scandalous proposed closure of Downpatrickrsquos visitor information centre in favour of Newry, progressing greenways around Newry but not Downpatrick and the abandonment of the promised Edward Street one-way system, which was supposed to have been delivered on a short-term basis in  until the new council revisited the roads priority list.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokeswoman said the local authority has allocated poundm to the Newry City Centre regenerationproject, with poundm secured from the Belfast Regional City Deal, not the poundm quoted by Cllr Enright.She continued: ldquoIt has been proposed that the development of Downpatrick town centre and the old PSNI station should be done collaboratively between local and central government with intervention from other public sector bodies.ldquoThis remains the case.

We have a lot of very good, talented young people coming through and, as far as I am concerned, we have a bright future ahead of us. I think what our results have shown tonight is that people have realised that stalemate politics and power splitting, rather than power-sharing, is not working for the people of Northern Ireland.The DUPrsquos Glyn Hanna, who saw his party vote decrease by just over two per cent mdash down from , in  to , mdash said he was pleased the DUP remained ldquothe voice of unionism in South Down on what had been a disappointing night for his party where, particularly in North and South Belfast.He said that the election count had been a ldquotough night for unionism explaining that he was not disappointed with his own performance in an ldquounforeseen election.Mr Hanna added: ldquoIt is important that the DUP remains the voice of unionism in South Down and it is going to stay that way as we have a solid voice and a firm Assembly seat. On the doorstep, people said they wanted the Assembly up and running and I think that that is going to happen.Alliancersquos Patrick Brown was delighted to increase the partyrsquos vote by over  per cent.In  the party polled , votes which Brown increase to , votes last week, placing Alliance fourth in the South Down pecking order, just  votes behind the DUP.The Alliance man believes that the only way to unite people in South Down is toa cross-community candidate to Westminster, suggesting that the surge in support for his party was because people are ldquofed up with the current situation at Stormont.Brown also believes that Alliance is potentially edging towards a South Down Assembly seat given the strong constituency base that it now has and that he would be up for contesting any future election.Ulster Unionist Jill Macauley mdash who was delighted to increase the party vote by just over three percent mdash rising from , votes two years ago to , this time out, was one of bright lights of her partyrsquos Westminster campaign.She was delighted to increase the vote at what she described as ldquoturbulent political times and said it was clear on the doorstep that voters are angry with the conduct of the DUP and Sinn Fein and their lack of delivery.ldquoThe clear message from the electorate was that they want local politicians to get back to work and restore the Assembly and the Executive. The current health crisis was also a major concern and the impending emergency that faces our strangled education system, she said.ldquoWith the UUP share of the vote increasing in such a toxic environment, it encourages me that we must be doing something right. I hope voters will continue to put their faith in the Ulster Unionist Party as a vehicle in which unionism can move forward as an inclusive and modern movement, instead of the politics of fear we have all come to know.Aontuacute, which was contesting its first Westminster election, polled , votes,  less than the collective performance of its three candidates at the recent Newry, Mourne and Down Council election..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Im.jpg","title":"I’m here to serve you%2C says Shannon  ","story":"STRANGFORD MP Jim Shannon secured another convincing victory mdash albeit with a reduced vote mdash for the third time in last weekrsquos general election.The overall Strangford turnout vote was also down, just .% of the eligible electorate compared to .% turnout in .While Mr Shannon topped the poll with , votes out of , valid votes, it was a %on his last thumping win when he was the DUP MP with the biggest majority.This year that honour went to Ian Paisley in North Antrim, who was nearly , votes clear of his nearest rival.A committed Christian and a pro-le advocate, Mr Shannon appealed to nearly half of the Strangford voters, earning a . % share of the vote in what was always a one-horse race.However, as he and his election team stood while Stephen Farryrsquos North Down win for Alliance was announced at Bangorrsquos Aurora Centre around am on Friday morning, there was an air of sombreness and distinct lack of celebration mdash perhaps due to news which had filtered through that party colleagues Nigel Dodds and Emma Little-Pengelly were in danger of losing their seats.The ing officer seemed to be in a rush to make the Strangford announcement as Dr Farry was unable to make his acceptance speech until after Mr Shannonrsquos victory was announced.Mr Shannonrsquos  year-old mother, Mona, who lives near Kircubbin, was there to support him, as was his we, Sandra.

As was that of SDLP runner-up Michael Savage.They were the only two South Down candidates who made their way to the podium to thank those who voted for them on a night when Northern Irelandrsquos political environment changed signicantly.With voters across the province electing a majority of nationalist MPs for the first time, it truly was a night of edge-of-the-seat political drama. Itrsquos often said that first itrsquos news then its history, but at the Belfast county centre news and history were inextricably intertwined.Minutes after the South Down result had been declared, the glare of the media spotlight was on official confirmation that the DUP had lost South Belfast.As SDLP supporters and the party faithful cheered loudly for Claire Hanna, the Sinn Fein contingent took a moment out of celebrating Mr Hazzardrsquos victory to watch proceedings.Hazzard was always the favourite for the South Down seat and used a sporting analogy to explain how he felt about the contest. He said favourites donrsquot always win, pointing out how hard he worked on the ground, emphasising that the was never complacent about the challenge he faced from the SDLP.From early in the count, SDLP members said that it looked as though their man was in with a real fighting chance and from the boxes which had been opened, the duo were neck and neck.While some of the Sinn Fein contingent appeared to be sporting furrowed brows early into the counting process, they were always confident that their man would emerge victorious and that he did, albeit with a reduced majority.There were suggestions that unionist voters in the Crossgar area had backed Mr Savage, who was clear throughout his campaign that he would not only be an MP for all, but one who would take his seat in the House of Commons.And while it was reported close between him and Mr Hazzard at one stage, the Sinn Fein man eased ahead in the race to cross the winning line, with the SDLP man left wondering what might have been.He had been given a relatively short lead-in time to last weekrsquos parliamentary pole and while pleased with his performance, he clearly felt he could have done even better and pushed the Sinn Fein man all the way to the line.Elsewhere, Alliancersquos Patrick Brown was one of a number of his partyrsquos candidates who built on their recent success at the EU and local council elections.The Westminster poll was viewed as a key litmus test that would rigorously challenge Alliancersquos recent election surge in a first past the post electoral system which did not rely on the votes of other parties.Mr Brown, who in May trebled his Newry, Mourne and Down Council vote in Rowallane, was at it again. His election agent and fellow councillor, Andrew McMurray, stood for Alliance in  and polled , votes, but Brown more than trebled the Alliance vote, a performance which helped his party leapfrog the Ulster Unionists to become the third largest in the province. Overall, Alliancersquos vote in South Down increased by an impressive . per cent, marking a remarkable performance by Brown.Most signicantly, Alliance now has its eyes focused firmly on securing an Assembly seat and while Mr Brown refused to be drawn on whether he would like his name to go forward should such a contest arise, there is no doubt that he will be the partyrsquos preferred candidate. He left the count centre a happy man his stock within his party continues to rise.Elsewhere, the DUPrsquos Glyn Hanna was pleased with his performance, despite his vote decreasing, and he didnrsquot rule out being the partyrsquos flag bearer in a future Assembly electionthis weekrsquos talks at Stormont fail to restore the power-sharing executive.Ulster Unionist, Jill Macauley, defied pundits suggestions that her party would not do well in South Down, by increasing the UUP vote by almost three per cent.Province-wide, the UUP polled , votes but with a new leader in charge the party did not produce the performance it had been hoping for.

I am so joyful and thankful as is my husband Dermot and our families.Orkambi was made available freely available following a surprise move by Department of Health Permanent Secretary Richard Pengelly at the end of October.Scotland and the Republic of Ireland made the drug free available to CF sufferers earlier but NHS England wrangled with the drug company over price.Once a deal was agreed in England, it paved the pay for Northern Ireland to introduce Orkambi for patients as young as Lorcaacuten, along with Symkevi, which can be given to children aged  and over.Jen was only informed on Monday that the drug was available for Lorcaacuten following a phone call from his treatment nurse.She said: ldquoI was absolutely shaking holding the phone when they told me that Lorcaacuten could get his medication as he has been fighting off the pseudomonas infection since last November.ldquoOrkambi was being given to those children with the higher clinical need and Lorcaacuten got it because of his infection, but I know of so many other families who have campaigned long and hard as we have.ldquoItrsquos just a matter of sufficient quantities of the drug becoming available as I know that the medical teams are working around the clock to distribute to as many patients as they can.Lorcaacuten was observed for five hours in hospital before he was allowed to go home with what his mother calls his ldquomagic medicine. He will need to take it twice daily from now as well as taking his antibiotics and being nebulised several times a day.However, Jen says that studies have shown that children with CF who take Orkambi from the age of six can live with the condition for an extra  years.ldquoThis is not just a Christmas present for this year, but for all the extra years we hope to have with Lorcaacuten, said Jen.ldquoWhilst I love Lorcaacuten to the bottom of my heart, these past three years have been very dficult.

And I think that is probably just as true for many who value Christianity above all  in their lives and are affronted by what often resembles a taking over the Temple with tinsel and trinkets. Yet not liking Christmas is still regarded as a personality defect a defect that renders you mean, aicious, uncaring and deaf to the needs and concerns of your fellow citizens.Scrooges personal story of redemption in A Christmas Carol is the true lesson of ChristmasTo even hint that you don’t like Christmas is to be greeted with a chorus of ‘Bah! Humbug!’ and dismissed as an ‘Old Scrooge.’ Ironically, most of those who so respond have never fully understood the deep and very personal story of redemption at the heart of A Christmas Carol a story that most of them have probably never read. The lesson of A Christmas Carolisn’t about celebrating Christmas with booze, office parties, over-eating and slumping in front of a TV or computer screen. It’s about learning lessons from your own le, acknowledging your flaws and changing your approach. It’s about an annual pause for reflection and a steer for the way ahead. In other words, it’s never too late to do things dferently..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button “I will honour Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it all of the year. I will live in the Past, the Present and the Future. The Spirits of all Three shall strive within me. I will not shut out the lessons that they teach. Oh, tell me I may sponge away the writing on this stone”. Scrooge was better than his word. He did it all and infinitely more and to Tiny Tim, who did not die, he was a second father. He became as good a friend, as good a master, as good a man as the good old city knew, or any other good old city, town or borough in the good old world. Some people laughed to see the alteration in him, but he let them laugh, and little heeded them for he was wise enough to know that nothing ever happened on this globe, for good, at which some people did not have their fill of laugher at the outset.The interesting thing about that passage, coming after Scrooge’s encounter with the third Spirit, is that it doesn’t require a belief in any religion, let alone Christianity. It is about fundamental humanity and decency and is just as relevant to an atheist like me as it is to my friends who do have religious beliefs. In precisely the same way that a pet isn’t just for Christmas, nor is Scrooge’s message. The lesson learned that night didn’t end on the Twelfth Day of Christmas. It lasted for the rest of his le. It affected everything he did afterwards. It made him a stronger, better person the sort of person who didn’t carepeople laughed at him. The Scrooge who had abandoned others and lived without them, found a way back to them.George Bailey, from It’s A Wonderful Le, believed that he had been abandoned by others and saw suicide as his only option. Nothing made sense to him. He believed he had no worth, no purpose, no need to exist. And when he tumbled from the bridge, into the river, that’s when Clarence, an angel trying to earn his wings, came to the rescue. He took him on a journey similar to Scrooge’s encounter with the past, present and future: “Strange, isn’t it  Each man’s le touches so many other lives. When he isn’t around he leaves an awful hole, doesn’t he  You see, George, you’ve really had a wonderful le. Don’t you see what a mistake it would be to throw it all away ” Bailey, who believed others had abandoned him and decided that their rejection meant there was no point to his le, found a way back to them.And maybe that’s the central message of both these stories: for many – probably far more than we’ll ever realise – it’s about finding a way back from personal demons and setbacks. That journey back, which often involves a personal redemption of some sort, cannot be made alone. In fiction thejourney is often steered by spirits, angels, ghosts. It real le it requires ordinary people albeit doing extraordinary work in homelessness, mental health, addiction, loneliness and assorted reaching-out-in-one-way-or-another charities. Ordinary people being there to try and catch those falling from a bridge. I know what it’s like to be caught. By adoptive parents who took huge risks in taking responsibility for a frightened, untrusting, nightmare-scarred, traumatised child. By people who later rescued me from a very dark period in my le when I was enveloped in a crippling depression. And by a partner who saw some sort of inner light and led me to a world of unconditional love, wonder and the mountainous joy of my children. I’ve been extremely lucky.It’s ok not to like Christmas. But it’s not ok to make people feel bad for not liking it. It’s not ok to keep pumping out the message that spend, spend, spend trumps personal reflection and learning lessons from our own lives, especially the debt of care we owe to others who are clearly struggling as much on every other day of the year as they do on ChristmasDay.Christmas Day matters, for all sorts of reasons. I used to hate it, but then I got lucky and nowadays I love it. So, my best wishes to all of you, however, wherever and with whom you spend Christmas. For those of you feeling abandoned take comfort in the fact that there are people waiting to help you. Every le matters.Irish language act is unacceptable — it is just another ‘compromise’ to satisfy Sinn Fein Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingMan dies after serious two vehicle collision -

During his time at Stormont the le-long Ulster Unionist served as employment and learning minister as well as minister for regional development.In October , after a year of unemployment he described as a “chastening experience,” Mr Kennedy was appointed as a welfare support officer by the Enniskillen-based Ely Centre – helping Troubles victims ensure they are receiving the benefits they are entitled to..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button “I regard this as a huge personal honour and I’m delighted that the leader of the party, Steve Aiken, asked me to take on the role of chairman and that was endorsed by the party executive on Saturday,” he said.Mr Kennedy also said it was an opportunity to “give something back to the party” and to help restore its fortunes.“There are challenges for the Ulster Unionist Party, as indeed there are challenges for unionism, and those have to be addressed. My view is that the best way to address them is hard work from the bottom up from the grass roots...with everyone working together in a united spirit.”He added: “We have seen unionism suffer some very serious setbacks recently.

It boasts a unique approach to teaching vocational skills, as well as academic and sports facilities.In particular, one alleyway on the school site had seen sheds transformed into small businesses, which the pupils ran - earning qualications and gathering valuable work experience, with staff and students hoping to open it up to the public soon.ldquoItrsquos a bit like Diagon Alley, isnrsquot it  said Ms Wood. Here the school hosts its own bike repair shop, in the form of Spokes, a cafe, its own radio station - The Voice - and plans for a zero-waste food shop are well under way.Robin Hackett, head of KS, showed me around some of the buildings.ldquoThe cafe opened to our students around July time, and was fully operational and officially in September, for the new academic year, he said.ldquoIt opened at the same time as our radio station, with money generously donated from the Postcode Community Trust.ldquoNext on the agenda is our plan to open a fully zero-waste food shop. Wersquove been having talks with other similar shops around Cardf and here in Penarth, like Foxyrsquos, about how to do it.ldquoThe idea is that, because wersquore a residential school, it will give our pupils a place to shop for things like cereal, fruit, biscuits and so on without plastic wrappers or other waste.ldquoOur initial, short-term plan is to reduce our own, internal impact on the environment, butwe can get it up and running to the extent we want, we may as well open it to the local community. Imagine - popping over to the school, grab a tea or a coffee, do your food shop and get your bike serviced, all by our pupils.The pupils I spoke to were enthusiastic about opening their school to the community, and plenty of them had applied for shts in the shop and cafe.One proudly told me he had secured shts in the cafe, and while we peered through the window into the future site of the zero-waste shop, he made sure I noticed the poster for the Lego club. He was the president of it.ldquoWersquore hoping to open the shop in January, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore just waiting on the builders now.ldquoA lot of kids here struggle in academic settings, so this is all building good skills for the future. Our philosophy is, one percent change at a time adds up to a lot.We moved across the alleyway to the schoolrsquos music room.It was well-stocked with plenty of high-tech equipment, from first-class ampliers to cutting-edge keyboards. Excitingly, the school also has a state-of-the-art soundbooth on the way from Germany.ldquoWersquore looking to rent it out to local bands and others as a rehearsal and recording space, once wersquove built it up to the second floor, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore investing in better equipment, and wersquoll be holding radio production workshops with the local primaries, like Victoria Road.The school doesnrsquot just offer vocational opportunities, either.ldquoRecently a lot of pupils went to Belgium, to Ypres, said principal Matthew Burns. ldquoThe best part is they cycled most of the way there!ldquoOver five days, they would cycle a huge distance, and then ride a coach or the Eurostar partway. That way, they got all the way to Ypres, to hear the Last Post and lay a wreath.ldquoWe also put a lot of emphasis on sport, with a state of the art Astroturf we rent out to the community, and a great football team - we recently attended a tournament at Heronsbridge and only narrowly lost to the overall winners.ldquoOutside of that, our KS group are putting together a foodbox raiser for Christmas for those in need, and wersquove just had our drama and music department invited to put on a production for the Senedd.With IT suites, science labs and gymnasiums, this barely scratched the surface of what the school had to offer. Itrsquos no surprise the school has been so successful, with such close attention from its staff. As a school focussing on children with learning dficulties, the pupil number is kept low, with around  pupils attending at any one time. The largest class has eight pupils, with most having fewer.ldquoWe have around  day pupils and  at the moment in residential, staying in one of our four homes on and off the site, said Ms Wood. ldquoFor those children, we offer a  week-a-year provision.ldquoThe houses are lovely - we really want it to feel like their own home, their own bedroom, with their belongings.ldquoIt forms part of our relational approach - how we talk to our children and how we talk to each other. If we have a new pupil arrive here, the first thing to focus on is building a positive relationship with them.ldquoThe conversations are all about recognising whatrsquos going on and supporting them, in their own time.Judging by the smiles on the faces of staff and students alike, itrsquos an approach to be emulated the world over. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con211.jpg","title":"connaire mcgreevy brewing a burgeoning m business","story":"Posted on Monday December  by Ulster Business In the last  years Co Down man Connaire McGreevy has built his facilities management business CTS Projects into a £m firm, started a brewery, bought a bar and chaired a football club. He speaks to John Mulgrew about further growth, holding back on GB expansion due to Brexit, and why staying in the EU is the best deal we have “It’s good for the environment, businesses and people,” Connaire McGreevy tells me.He’s speaking of course about EU membership, and he’s one of Northern Ireland’s business leaders not concerned with remaining partisan on the matter, as we head into a Christmas General Election and sit with a deal on the table which would likely lead to increased costs and bureaucracy between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Connaire founded CTS Projects back in , and has developed it into a erse facilities management business, recently expanding further into the Republic – giving him reach from Donegal to Waterford, and “everything in between”.“We are an all-island facilities management company with signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland,” he told Ulster Business.“It has had signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland. We made moves after the Brexit referendum – we needed to ersy with a subsidiary.“There has been signicant growth in the Republic of Ireland, with % year-on-year. In business, it’s easy to grow from a base of nothing so we will see that normalise.”CTS began le refurbishing rundown properties, such as old social housing stock, to get them prepared to accept new tenants. That then grew and developed to include a focus on renewable heating, such as biomass boilers and solar  – focusing on energy efficiency. Around % of its work is with public sector clients, and the remainder with private companies.Those private sector clients include private office schemes in Belfast, looking after all of the main facilities management. CTS has grown into a -strong full-time workforce, with around  additional full-time sub-contractors also working for the business. And it’s on track to hit £m turnover this year.But CTS, like many other firms, has actively held back investing in new operations in GB, until there is a clear Brexit outcome.“Unfortunately we have noticed NI business opportunities have started to stagnate or decline,” he said. “A lack of an Assembly is having an impact on public sector– core maintenance, as opposed to new infrastructure development,” he says. “With private, there has been a downturn.”But he says since the summer “people seem to have found a new sense of confidence”. He says some of those who were holding back post-referendum appear to have now pushed forward with some investment.Speaking about which areas the company has grown in to, he said it has developed further into a more erse building management business.“We also expanded into fire and security in  – areas such as fire extinguishers, alarms and . We have found that energy efficiency and the environmentalis coming to the fore.” That includes areas such as battery energy storage and solar  for homes.“We have a lot of public sector clients in housing, education and healthcare. We have had local government in the past, and are actively targeting that area with new innovation.”Connaire’s own interest in decent beer drew out his entrepreneurship five years ago when he set up Mourne Mountains Brewery in Warrenpoint. On a separate note, he’s also the current chairman of Warrenpoint Town FC.“ was a passion turned into a business,” he says. “It’s exciting stuff, in terms of creating beer and marking five years. It’s still in its infancy and has been impacted by a mushroom of craft breweries.“I am still optimistic in the market, but I don’t see it growing as fast anymore. Looking at the market across the island, some may close their doors. The scale might not be there, and there are lots of larger breweries and imported beers – the consumer has so much choice. People know what they are looking for.”An opportunity also came knocking recently which saw Connaire taking on a bar in Warrenpoint, the Ye Old Ship Inn, which he says has a very personal connection.Connaire’s sister Ciara, who worked with him in CTS Projects and was a former gaelic footballer, passed away suddenly in . Connaire says she had worked in bars over the years, and the idea of taking one on was a conversation which they had.“There is vertical integration with the bar, as it’s an outlet there for us, with pop-up bars with the brewery.”But he, like many others in the brewing and distilling industry, says Northern Ireland’s licensing laws “are in the dark ages”. The main concern is that beer producers cannot sell their products to the public during a tour of the brewery, and require a drinks licence to do so.“We have a number of tourists who arrive at the doors, asking about tours and beer… it’s embarrassing for Northern Ireland. We don’t have the legislation in place. I am passionate about tourism in the area, and we have tourism projects in the mix.”With Brexit, Connaire believes the current deal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson would create a ergence down the Irish Sea, making all-island business a more attractive and palatable affair for companies here.“It’s an administrative border – paperwork, time and a cost to business,” he says. “Our plans would be going into GB to set up new company, with a small acquisition and some back office administration support. “All-island, under the deal it looks like we can have easy access, which is welcome. It’s so connected and any ergence is going to have an impact.”He said that could have an impact on foreign direct investmentas companies from outside the UK and Ireland. And Connaire says there is still no clarity of what a potential deal with the EU could look like on the outside.“It’s a waypoint in that journey and we have to be very cautious,” he said. “I personally feel we get the best deal possible being in the EU. Looking across the world, there are now trading blocs everywhere.“At this stage, in business circles, a lot of people are holding back investment to see what the trading environment is like. It’s the most uncertain period in my business journey.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191106_8525_web.jpg","title":"leading from the front kpmgs johnny hanna","story":"Posted on Wednesday December  by Ulster Business Fresh from a three month sabbatical travelling with his family, KPMG’s new partner in charge, Johnny Hanna, sits down with Ulster Business to discuss growing an already-strong local professional services firm with global reach, developing the next generation and what’s needed to set Northern Ireland apart on the world stage Johnny Hanna’s new role as partner in charge at KPMG in Northern Ireland sees him take the helm of an organisation already in a strong position, but also one which is very much in growth mode.And with more than  years under his belt working across KPMG, he’s now been tasked with taking the next leap forward – building on its strong client base, tackling the new business landscape which lies around the corner, and growing the next generation of top talent.While a global firm, KPMG works with a host of Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes – having le-long relationships with indigenous success stories such as First Derivatives and Norbrook – while also working with global businesses with connections to the UK and Ireland.TALENTKPMG now boasts a Belfast workforce of nearly  staff. But as the intake of top new graduates and experienced hires grows, that number looks set to expand and develop further still. Johnny’s confident that the company will continue to grow at its offices at the Soloist building in Belfast city centre. He points to the benefits for KPMG staff of signicant collaboration and shared working opportunities with Dublin as part a successful all-island business now employing over  people. The firm’s Corporate Finance team, for example, led by Russell Smyth are the go-to advisors in the renewables sector when it comes to fundraising for new assets north and south.“It’s an exciting time for the firm,” Johnny says. “We have done a lot in the last few years, working with many new clients, investing in our new office and increasing our graduate numbers. In addition there has been a record number of promotions. I’ve been working closely with our previous partner in charge John Hansen on all of that as well as continuing to grow and drive our large tax team, an area of expertise which we’ve always been renowned for.“My focus will be about maintaining this momentum and ensuring we continue to offer the expertise and solutions which our clients need, which will drive our growth. That means being alive to changing trading conditions, increased regulation and a business environment increasingly uncertain, disruptive and complex”.A law graduate from Queen’s University Belfast, Johnny’s also a fellow of Chartered Accountants Ireland, and a Chartered Tax Adviser– starting his career in Dublin with the former Arthur Andersen, which was later merged with KPMG.The Newry man became a partner with KPMG in  and has been head of tax in Northern Ireland since . The tax practice boasts around  tax professionals, most of which are dual qualied in tax and accountancy. “It’s a key dferentiator for us,” he says.“And while tax and audit represent the more traditional strands of business, KPMG has invested signicantly in new skills, specialisms and services arising from technological advances such as articical intelligence and cyber-security.”Johnny takes over his role at a time when Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the UK and Ireland, is undergoing arguably its biggest business and economic sht in a generation.“Brexit is just one part of it. We have been working closely with companies to prepare for Brexit, whether there is a ‘no deal’ or some sort of deal here.“We have had a lot of engagement with business groups and other stakeholders over the last three years to highlight our concerns and those of our clients. Wherever we end up on Brexit will definitely dictate the future trading conditions. Our role will be to help clients navigate their way around any new barriers they could face, as well as examining the potential opportunities which may arise from the UK’s exit from the EU.” ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Attracting foreign direct investmentis something which cannot be ignored here, and a dferentiator for Northern Ireland could help bolster that – whether it’s a deal which moulds Northern Ireland as a unique business destination in the UK and Ireland, finally introducing a lower devolved rate of corporation tax or ideally a package of measures.“Not long after I took over the head of Tax role in  we co-hosted a breakfast in our KPMG New York office with ious international businesses. At that time there was a lot of talk around the reduced corporation tax rate. There was a lot of positivity and enthusiasm in the room that morning around the opportunity for Northern Ireland, and I’m looking forward to getting back to those types of discussions.“Northern Ireland requires a range of tools to help drive economic success in the post-Brexit era. It’s investment in infrastructure and skills, initiatives on export-led growth, delivering a .% tax rate and some sort of devolution of income tax powers – we need step change initiatives which can really turbocharge the private sector.”COMMUNITYGetting the right talent is also key for KPMG, building and developing a workforce which is increasingly erse, as well as giving back to the community. That includes a range of initiatives, including the recent launch of a skills-based scheme which has seen KPMG staff volunteering to help children, from a wide iety of backgrounds, with their literacy and numeracy skills.“Our graduates want to do more than get their qualications and service clients. They want to know that what they are doing has a broader purpose and objective. They want to know about our commitment to the local community and on environmental issues and be proud to work for KPMG”.  “We are ambitious to keep growing the practice and have a fantastic pool of talent in Belfast at all levels to help us realise those ambitions.“Ensuring we maintain the right culture within the firm for our people to reach their full potential and achieve their career aspirations is incredibly important. I was delighted we were able to add to our already strong team with the recent addition of four new partners in Ashleen Feeney, Paddy Doherty, Neil O’Hare and Dominic Mudge within our Deal Advisory, Tax and Audit teams.  “My role is to ensure that when I hand over to the next partner in charge, we are in an even stronger position than we are today. That’s the challenge and the goal but given the strong team and our market position, I know that I will relish the opportunity”.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
