On the last leg of the visit, the Prince of Wales will speak at the International Conference Centre at the invitation of President Nana Akufo-Addo.While he will mainly use it to pay tribute to Ghana’s role in the Commonwealth, Charles was keen to reference the slave trade in Ghana and Britain and Europe’s role in it.He also wanted to use the occasion to highlight Britain’s determination to tackle modern slavery.The prince was visibly moved by a visit to Fort Christiansborg in Osu, a suburb of the capital Accra, during which he was told of its chilling history.Built in 1661, the fort – also known as Osu Castle – was used by the Danes to hold slaves before they were sent to the New World.In the 19th century, it became the headquarters of the local British government.Colombian star of Royal Ballet reveals he used...How the nation will remember next week: Hour-by-hour what\u0027s...Share this article    The Prince of Wales will mainly use his speech to pay tribute to Ghana’s role in the Commonwealth (pictured being greeted by dancers at Fort Christiansborg in Accra, Ghana)    Meghan and her mother Doria RaglandIn an unprecedented step, the Duchess of Sussex’s mother is expected to fly in from the US to spend Christmas with the Queen.Meghan’s mother Doria Ragland, 62, is said to have been invited to Sandringham to join her daughter and the rest of the Royal Family.The honour was not extended to Carole and Michael Middleton, parents of the Duchess of Cambridge.A royal source said it was ‘a very thoughtful gesture’, adding: ‘It’s a mark of the Queen’s respect for Meghan and an acknowledgement that she doesn’t have any other relations in this country – unlike Kate, who has a very close family.’The Middletons have joined the Queen at church on Christmas morning, but stayed with William.                                                     At the bottom were dungeons in which enslaved Africans were kept for up to six months as they awaited transportation.During a sombre moment in searing heat, Charles paused at the foot of the stairs, known as ‘the door of no return’, to reflect on the fort’s horrific past.In his speech today, he is expected to say: ‘The histories of our two nations are closely intertwined, and while today we enjoy shared opportunity, we can never forget that our past has sometimes borne witness to tragedy and loss and, at times, profound injustice. At Osu Castle, it was especially important to me – as indeed it was on my first visit there 41 years ago – that I should acknowledge the most painful chapter of Ghana’s relations with the nations of Europe, including the United Kingdom. The appalling atrocity of the slave trade, and the unimaginable suffering it caused, left an indelible stain on the history of our world.‘While Britain can be proud that it later led the way in the abolition of this shameful trade, we have a shared responsibility to ensure that the abject horror of slavery is never forgotten, that we abhor the existence of modern slavery and that we robustly promote and defend the values which today make it incomprehensible, to most of us, that human beings could ever treat each other with such utter inhumanity.’Charles will also pay tribute to the strength of the relationship between the UK and Ghana.He is keen to highlight the country’s role in the Commonwealth and stress how, by acting within the organisation, it can play an important role over environmental issues and rapid urbanisation.He will also acknowledge Ghana as an example to the region and to the world of a stable democracy, a beacon of tolerance and ersity.In his speech, the prince is expected to say: ‘The Commonwealth should strive for renewed relevance in the lives of its citizens and should draw upon its unparalleled networks of professional expertise, to offer practical solutions to some of the most pressing challenges of our time, many of which are increasingly deep seated and deeply integrated.‘No issue is more pressing than that of climate change.’"},{"url":null,"title":"Grim reality WW1 brought life 100 colourised images mark centenary","story":"Hilarious moment great Dane tries to hide stolen loaf in his MOUTHMelbourne Cup punters let their hair down and revel at FlemingtonShocking video of bouncer kneeing a girl in alleged Halloween assaultWomen carrying alcohol and sex toy put bacon on a mosque\u0026#x27s doorNoah Lamar pleads guilty to robbery during trial in 2017Amazon promote their delivery boxes in their new Christmas advertGirlfriend walks into the car door as boyfriend drives off\u0026#x27White piece of s***\u0026#x27 Burger King worker goes on racist tiradeA fallen bear cub climbs a snowy mountain cliff to meet its mumCross Counter charges forward to win the 2018 Melbourne CupKen melts hearts with letter on Old People\u0026#x27s Home For Four Year OldsChristopher Boon breaks in tears after arrest during investigationThe comments below have not been moderated.Enter your commentPost comment to your Facebook TimelineBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.Do you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?Your comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.Do you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?Your comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual  We will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

If people can get another bag in their bin they will get another bag in their bin — any way they can.’The favoured method in these parts involves climbing into the bin, then jumping up and down on the contents to compress them. Unpleasant, and not entirely risk-free. Others have resorted to stockpiling waste in sheds and garages, but complain about rodent infestations.Still more try to off-load black sacks on others, with or without permission. Another resident told how whenever he goes out to walk the dog he takes a carrier bag of rubbish with him, stuffing it in pavement bins as he goes. Some simply burn their waste in braziers or on back-garden bonfires. Fly-tipping is on the increase.          Families are struggling with the new regime as their bins overflow with rubbish          Sue Foster with her Overflowing bins in Old Colwyn, Conwy          Despite the sign saying \u0027no fly tipping\u0027 rubbish had been dumped by these bins as residents complain that the offence is on the riseIn one town I visited, the over-sized wheelie bins set aside for flats had been fitted with padlocks. Those that had not were overflowing with black bags, many ripped open by birds or rodents. The contents, including soiled nappies and food waste, had spilled on to the pavements.‘It’s the four-weekly collection,’ said one local businessman in despair. ‘The council sent out a team to clear up the mess last week and now they’ll have to do the same again. How much will that cost? How can that make financial sense?’When the council introduced the scheme a month ago, they promised savings of £390,000 a year. All well and good, but as everyone in these parts is quick to point out, the same council has just had a king new office complex built for its staff.          Bits and piece of waste appeared to have escaped from the overflowing binsUnder a controversial deal with the developers, this will cost council tax payers in Conwy Council Borough £58 million over the next 40 years. Worse still, it has been suggested that they could face a council tax rise of 11 per cent next year. For what? Some homeowners are now so fed up they are digging further into their own pockets to pay a private firm £8.99 a week to empty their bins.And, of course, where one council leads, others follow. In recent weeks, Anglesey and Denbighshire councils have both signalled that they are considering introducing four-weekly collections too. Several English councils have introduced three-weekly collections.So the bin-management tactics I witnessed last week could soon become required practice nationwide. Meanwhile, there can be little doubt that when it comes to recycling, the residents of this corner of North Wales are already doing their bit.          Litter from Overflowing bins now lines the streets of Old Colwyn following the move to increase the time between bin collectionsFigures show that their waste recycling rate stands at 64 per cent. In England, the average is 44 per cent. But Conwy is under pressure to do more. By 2025, it must hit 70 per cent, a target set by the often intractable Welsh government. Failure to do so could result in fines of up to £600,000 a year. Like all councils, it is also under severe financial pressure.Boiling pavement burns skin off dog\u0027s paws and another is...Should your taxes pay for this? Labor politician wants EVERY...Share this articleThe council claims the various other collections — there are 19 in a month, such as food waste or textiles — will help. ‘It’s easy to recycle more,’ reads a line on the council’s website.Well, try telling that to retired teacher Sue Foster. The 65-year-old lives in Old Colwyn with her husband, her 40-year-old daughter, her grandson, 22, and granddaughter, 11. The family has three cats and a dog. When I met her on Wednesday, she was organising a vast array of recycling receptacles outside her detached home. There were two food caddies to put food waste in and three large plastic boxes with lids, each stacked one on top of the other.          On bin day extra bags of rubbish were piled high on top of household binsOne was for recyclable plastic and cans, another for glass and brown cardboard, and a third for white paper or grey card. When these get full, Mrs Foster has extra capacity in the form of two white nylon sacks.In addition there was a bin for sanitary waste and two green sacks for garden waste. Oh, and let’s not forget that black bin — filled to the brim and ready to be emptied for the first time in a month on Wednesday.‘I recycle everything but even so it is an absolute joke, it’s awful,’ says Mrs Foster, who has even resorted to flushing any dog mess down an outside toilet, rather than having it fester in bags in the black bin.‘The only way I have been able to manage is because my next-door neighbour has let me put sacks in his bin. There are five of us and only two of them — but we have the same size bin. I asked the council for a second black bin but I was told it’s only available for households of six or more. It’s absolutely ridiculous.’          Residents have resorted to stockpiling waste in sheds and garages, but complain about rodent infestationsA sentiment Donna Pimley-Jones of nearby Kinmel Bay can well understand. She has to pack her rubbish bin till it’s well over-flowing, plus cope with the myriad extra category bins the council has brought in. Of course, having a family makes it so much harder.Those I spoke to who lived on their own or as a couple were generally just about managing with the new collection arrangements and maximising the amount they recycled.But for families the lack of space in the refuse bin was a clear problem.Indeed, come bin day many of their homes could be identified simply by looking for over-filled bins with half-open lids. Which bring their own issues with them.Along the coast in Penmaenmawr last week a possible effect of the problem was there for all to see — a dead rat just yards from Neill and Emma Scullard’s bins.          Some over-sized wheelie bins set aside for flats had been fitted with padlocks‘We have two young children aged one and four months, and the rubbish quickly piles up,’ said Mr Scullard, 31, who works in the catering industry. ‘It’s obvious that the accumulating rubbish will bring rats in. You can sometimes see where they have ripped the plastic bags apart. It is a nightmare. It would make more sense if they gave us bigger bins.’In Colwyn Bay, meanwhile, the problem is greedy seagulls tearing at plastic bags.Carrie Harling, 31, a cleaning supervisor, and Ann-Marie Potter, 24, a cleaning assistant, are neighbours in a block of three flats that house 12 people, including seven children. Their waste has to fit in three bins.          When Conwy announced the move to monthly collections, the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health warned of the potential risks‘It’s a stupid scheme — two-weekly is bad enough, never mind four-weekly,’ said Ms Harling. ‘So the rubbish just mounts up in our black bin and we also have black bags full of rubbish in our back garden. The seagulls have a field day.’Others choose to avoid overloading their bins by disposing of waste as it accumulates. One parent I spoke to sheepishly admitted that he works in a school — and that each week he takes a bin-bag to dump in their bins.The concern is that others will resort to fly-tipping. A number of residents I speak with complain that there has been more dumping of rubbish in rural areas. Statistics show there were 980 incidents of fly-tipping reported in 201415 rising to 1,351 in 20162017.When Conwy announced the move to monthly collections, the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health warned of the potential risks. Weekly bin rounds have all but disappeared in Britain. At least another 20 local authorities, including several in Greater Manchester, North Devon and Leicestershire, have already imposed or are considering three-weekly bin collections.          Weekly bin rounds have all but disappeared in Britain‘We cannot hide our disappointment at this retrograde step,’ said Tony Lewis, policy chief of the institute, which represents 8,000 public health staff in charge of controlling local pollution and hygiene.‘There are real risks with moving to a monthly collection system, such as elevated levels of fly-tipping, domestic refuse burning, pest infestations, odour nuisance and fly nuisance, especially in the summer months.’ But a spokeswoman for the council told the Mail there were no such issues in Conwy, saying there would only be problems with smells or rodents if householders recycled food waste incorrectly. She said the number of reports of rats to the council had declined in the past year.          Sue organising a vast array of recycling receptacles outside her detached homeAs for fly-tipping, she also denied this was linked to the changes to bin collections, saying that tonnages of fly-tipped waste had not dramatically increased.Maybe that’s because some householders have decided to look for other, costly, alternatives.Binzilla, a private company that charges £8.99 to empty your wheelie bin, claims to now have customers running into the ‘high hundreds’ in the area.‘We have been working in Conwy since about January when they were on a three-week cycle and people were already struggling. Then they started making noises about four-week collection and our phone didn’t stop ringing,’ said managing director Yousef Ayub.‘We send trucks in to that area of North Wales from Manchester two times a week and don’t have spare capacity on the days we go.‘We are now adding an extra route with a view to basing two trucks in North Wales permanently.’ With some customers opting to have their bin emptied every week, that’s a cost of almost £500 a year. Of course, for most people that is simply not an option.And even if it were, given that an average Band D property in this area pays £1,469 a year in council tax, paying for a service they have already paid for would be hard to swallow.          At least another 20 local authorities, including several in Greater Manchester, North Devon and Leicestershire, have already imposed or are considering three-weekly bin collections‘Where does all our council tax go so they can only manage one collection a month?’ is a frequent complaint I hear on my rounds.Many point the finger of blame at the council’s new HQ in Colwyn Bay. The payment plan for the property, which will house 700 staff, will cost taxpayers at least £58 million in rent over 40 years.‘The really sad thing is that the £390,000 the council save per annum from reducing bin collections wouldn’t even pay one third of the annual rent on their new HQ being built at the moment,’ observed one online poster.‘Bravo Conwy Council, you’ve properly got it wrong this time!’The council defends itself saying that the new offices will enable it to work ‘smartly and more efficiently for the people of Conwy, creating a 21st-century council with services and infrastructure to match’.Questions have also been raised about what the council is going to do with all the extra recycled material. The estimated savings were based, in part, on selling more recyclable materials.But a decision by China to ban imports of waste plastic means huge backlogs are building up and the value of the waste, which would normally be sold to recycling companies, has collapsed.As a result several councils have given up on collecting and recycling plastic separately, which means an increasing amount is being burned for energy, or buried in landfill. Others are stockpiling it in vast dumps visible from space.I put this question to the council. The spokeswoman said that thus far they had not experienced any issues with a ‘lack of capacity’ for recycling collected in Conwy.She added that if residents are recycling properly ‘most households’ will have enough space in their black bins for rubbish and that surveys during the trial found only 2.2 per cent of bins had raised lids. This, it was claimed, ‘clearly shows that the vast majority of residents in the four-weekly collection trial area had sufficient space in their black wheelie bins’.Meanwhile, Andrew Wilkinson, Head of Neighbourhood Services for the council, added: ‘For most people in Conwy County four-weekly bin collections are no problem, just the next logical step towards a less throw-away society.‘More people are recycling and, thanks to TV programmes such as Blue Planet and campaigns such as the Mail’s “Turn the Tide on Plastic”, people are thinking more about what happens to waste.‘None of us want plastic ending up in landfill or the ocean, so why would we give people unlimited opportunity to throw away plastic in their wheelie bin, instead of recycling it?’It’s a fair enough question. But among those who pay his wages there will also be no shortage of people who will also question whether the methods employed in Conwy are in fact the best way of achieving those aims. "},{"url":null,"title":"QUENTIN LETTS years Remembrance ritual brings quaver voice","story":"    This arrangement - Heckington 100, from in Lincolnshire - commemorates the 31 men from the village who died in the First World War.

The dolefulness of this Sunday’s civic gatherings around the country will be matched by November’s leaf-fall and a general dankness in the air.It is a day for greatcoats and hats and the stamp of black shoes on cold flagstones and gravel paths, when a smell of soil and decay is on the churchyard breeze.That the Great War ended on November 11 was strategic happenstance, but the date — the 11th of the 11th — had a poetry to it and it pretty much coincided with the ancient festivals of Hallowe’en and All Souls’ Day.    Grassmoor Craft Group in Derbyshire displayed nearly 2,000 poppies in the heart of the village, commemorating the end of WW1 From earliest times this was when the Celtic inhabitants of our isles contemplated death and those they had lost. I have never been to a Remembrance Service in the southern hemisphere, where it is springtime and Nature is bursting out all over, but it must have a very different flavour.How do you spend Poppy Day? Do you attend your local parade or do you watch TV coverage of the national ceremony in London, where the Queen and her prime ministers, present and past, lay wreaths at the Cenotaph?I went to the London event once, to stand in the crowds on Parliament Square and watch the old soldiers march past, elderly men still bristling with comradely pride. It gave one a rare sense of nationhood and of what the Armed Forces do for our parliamentary kingdom.Ex-Paratrooper, 62, goes on hunger strike until Remembrance...\u0027I was expecting rum, I got a Jägerbomb!\u0027 Hilarious moment...Strict school that banned \u0027Meet Me At McDonald\u0027s\u0027 haircuts...Share this articleMost years, though, I have spent Remembrance Day at ceremonies in Gloucestershire and Herefordshire. The hymns reach into our innards: Abide With Me, O Valiant Hearts or Parry’s setting of the Tennyson poem Crossing The Bar.Laurence Binyon’s words, ‘they shall grow not old as we that are left grow old’, catch the theft of youth from those who died in war and those of us now being bent by age.There is the march-past by the local branch of the Royal British Legion, medals swinging on lapels and veterans juddering to attention in defiance of the years. That these veterans include familiar faces — neighbours suddenly transformed by wearing their old colours — accentuates the Forces’ local links.    This tribute features 662 hand knitted and named poppies on crosses now installed in front of Worthing Town Hall thanks to the talented ladies of Storm MinistriesThe dead come often from the county regiments. From the war memorial lists you hear local surnames — in our part of Herefordshire six members of the Lee family, still prominent in the village — and that makes the years telescope and 20th century sacrifices seem closer.Then comes the two-minute silence, when all you can hear is the wind at your ears and the occasional sniffle from someone who has found it all too much. The Last Post may be trumpeted less than faultlessly, but the blend of earnest imperfection and shared solemnity can be immensely powerful.So many of those who died were just farmhands from nearby fields, unsuspecting lads who exchanged spades and ploughs for rifles and howitzers.           Pre-School children listening to a story about why we mark the 11th November with poppies.  All the children and staff were involved in making the poppies for the display at Humpty Dumpty Day Nurseries \u0026amp Pre-Schools in LichfieldSome people find Remembrance Day too militaristic. They are entitled to their view, but there is a difference between enlightened patriotism, which is a fine thing, and triumphant nationalism, which has no place at any church service or, for that matter, elsewhere.In the list of fallen former pupils that I read every year, there is one, Ahrens, who was a German who died while fighting against us.He may have been ‘the enemy’, yet we honour him as an equal before God, a man no less patriotic and unfortunate than our British troops. War is hellish for both sides.          The people of Clowne, Derbishire,  have crafted a poppy display to adorn their memorial wheel as the centenary approaches in coming days On Sunday, the President of Germany, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, will lay a wreath at the Cenotaph. Some who lived through the war are opposed to his presence. I, born post-war, can only welcome it as a further moment of reconciliation between us.Then there are those who choose to wear pacifist white poppies. Intellectually I might question their stance — are they saying they would never fight evil? — but emotionally it is hard to condemn their idealism. What did our grandfathers fight for, particularly in the war against Hitler, if not the right to hold contrary views?My mother, in her 80s, finds it harder to bite her tongue about pacifism. Her father was a British Army sapper who landed at D-Day and dashingly fought his way east through to Germany, running into a few lumps of shrapnel en route. He died in 1949, partly of his wounds, and my mother’s childhood was wrecked by that war.          This display at Blackpool\u0027s Victoria Hospital in Lancashire features a replica of the Menin Gate draped with knitted poppiesRemembrance Sunday is not easy for her, yet she stands with her gloved hands gripped tight, defying the raw memories that must make her want to gasp. The formality of Remembrance Sunday’s ceremonial, with its spare, stark words and its wind- whistling silence, is very British in its emotional restraint.Do WE romanticise those and other wars? Do we cast back longingly to a less complicated time, when stalwart women and men did not hesitate to make sacrifices for king and country?It seems we mark the day more now than 30 years ago. Amid today’s zingy restlessness maybe Remembrance Day reflects a need for occasional acts of communal melancholy.There must come a time when we will place less emphasis on the world wars and focus instead on loved ones we have lost in the previous year. I can see it would make sense for Remembrance Sunday eventually to become an All Souls Sunday. But I don’t sense that moment has yet arrived.A hundred years on, the story of the Western Front continues to grip our imagination. So, on Sunday, I will recite once again that sorrowful list of the unforgotten fallen whom we never knew. You can send us your best Remembrance Day poppy displays by emailing: pictures@mailonline.co.uk"},{"url":null,"title":"Former Topshop manager accuses Sir Philip Green year long harassment campaign","story":"Auna Irvine (left), who headed one of the billionaire’s flagship US stores, said she had counselling to help her recover from alleged intimidation and bullying from Philip Green (right) The tycoon has vehemently denied the allegations. Miss Irvine has become the first woman to publicly accuse Sir Philip, 66, of sexual harassment. The media has been barred from reporting sex harassment and racism claims levelled against the tycoon by British employees because of an injunction.However, the Telegraph has revealed Miss Irvine’s allegations because she is based in the US. The single mother, who was manager of a Topshop branch in Las Vegas, claimed Sir Philip would phone her at night, shout and call her ‘naughty’. She added that he would demean her in front of staff and his friends.#pinknotgreen: Sir Philip Green hit with calls for a BOYCOTT...A foul-mouthed bully who left young women in tears - but...Share this articleMiss Irvine said she was ‘destroyed’ by the ordeal she allegedly endured at the hands of Sir Philip. ‘I felt extremely demeaned and devalued,’ she said. ‘It took years off my life.’ She claimed employees turned a blind eye to the billionaire’s behaviour, saying: ‘Everybody lives in fear.’She added: ‘He was extremely flirty and touchy from the moment he met me. The first thing he did once he was introduced to me was wrap his arms around my waist and said to the others present, both men, “Now this is what a manager should look like! Meet my new girlfriend – the Vegas manager”.          The former Topshop manager (pictured) has become the first woman to publicly accuse Sir Philip of sexual harassment ‘He would call me at all hours of the night. He had this obsession with – it gives me chills – this word “naughty”. It was like his tone of voice and it was just like, “Are you being naughty? I bet you’re being naughty”.’Miss Irvine said Sir Philip must not be granted the ability to silence his accusers by throwing money at the courts. ‘If money can buy your court system, then it’s going to be a very ugly world,’ she said.But the Topshop boss’s law firm, Schillings, said Miss Irvine had been fired for giving clothing away to her boyfriend and putting it through the checkout as damaged. They also said Sir Philip was not in the country.MP Maria Miller, Tory chairman of the Commons women and equalities committee, said it was a ‘mockery’ of the law that UK victims could not have their stories heard.     "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/11/05/10/121D224E00000514-0-image-m-5_1541414292209.jpg","title":"Biggest poll conducted EU referendum finds 54 cent chose stay bloc","story":"    Pictured: Theresa May speaks during a media conference at an EU summit in Brussels last month          The results of the Survation poll of 20,000 for Channel 4 News are shown in this graphicZOOM AND DRAG THE MAP BELOW TO SEE HOW YOUR AREA WOULD VOTE NOW ACCORDING TO THESURVATION POLLZoom and drag the map to see your area Double-digit falls in support for Brexit were recorded in a string of seats in Labour’s heartlands, including Wigan, Stoke-on-Trent and Middlesbrough.The findings could help sway the mood of Labour MPs as they consider whether to back Theresa May’s Brexit deal or join the campaign for a second referendum.

On the one hand we are being told Brexit has made people hostile towards migrants, on the other we are told we are more relaxed about it.          Former Ukip leader Nigel Farage (pictured) questioned the narrative that Brexit had made people hostile to migrants \u0027You can\u0027t have it both ways. The truth of it is, the reason those figures have changed is a big chunk of the electorate think the immigration issue has been dealt with because we voted Brexit, and they think our major political parties will carry out their wishes.\u0027Actually, the penny\u0027s not yet dropped. That there is no intention for this Government or this opposition to deal with open door immigration.\u0027 In a no deal scenario, a majority of voters would back staying in the EU, at least temporarily, according to the poll.The survey found that in a no-deal situation 35 per cent believe Britain should remain in the EU, while 19 per cent would want to delay leaving to allow more time for talks, and 36 per cent would wish to quit the bloc.It also asked how people would vote if the government secured a deal tomorrow, with the question being predicated on the assumption that the agreement would reflect what has been seen from Number 10 so far. Most said they would reject such a deal - 33 per cent - as 26 per cent responded they would accept it, 34 per cent did not know and seven per cent indicated they would not vote. The poll ided viewers online, with some remarking on the supposed pro-Remain agenda of Channel 4 and others praising the power of the research.            Justice Secretary David Gauke last night said: ‘We are at the end of a negotiation, in a period where there is a lot of uncertainty.

A total of 45 per cent of those surveyed said the same about the Labour leader and 46 per cent said Mr Johnson would be worse at negotiations too. The survey also raised the possibility of a deadlock in negotiations and what they UK should be willing to agree to if such a situation occurred.It found the most unpopular prospect to be Britain agreeing to limitations on trade with non-EU countries, as 62 per cent said the government should not agree to limitations even to break a deadlock. A total of 45 per cent of respondents also rejected the notion of checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.The one notion that respondents said the government should be prepared to agree to in order to break a deadlock was that after Brexit UK and EU citizens should be free to live and work in each other\u0027s countries - with 63 per cent backing the prospect.Adherence to EU regulations on manufactured goods was backed by 50 per cent in the event of a deadlock, but 32 per cent rejected the idea and 19 per cent were unsure. What does the British public think about Brexit? | Survation"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/13/22/5024EADA00000578-0-image-m-70_1536872978757.jpg","title":"Archbishop Canterburys plan compete payday lenders shunned 90 cent churches","story":"    The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby promised to go to war with payday lenders in 2013 but more than 90 per cent of Anglican churches have shunned his planMore than 90 per cent of Anglican churches have shunned the Archbishop of Canterbury’s plan to compete with payday lenders.Just 8.8 per cent have any involvement in social financial projects or offer debt advice, and only two per cent run their own advice or lending operations.The news comes five years after the Most Reverend Justin Welby promised to go to war with market leader Wonga and other payday lenders.In 2013, the Archbishop of Canterbury warned the head of Wonga: ‘We’re trying to compete you out of existence.’ He said the CofE would use its 16,000 churches to give consumer-friendly credit unions a foothold in every high street.But yesterday the Church published its ‘statistics for mission’, which showed that last year only 1,139 churches were involved in ‘money matters and debt advice’ projects.The figures from 13,000 of its churches showed that 2,347 run night shelters for the homeless, nearly 3,000 operate a ‘community cafe’, 4,191 have a parent and toddler group, and nearly 8,000 work with food bank charities.           Figures from the Church revealed that last year only 1,139 churches were involved in ‘money matters and debt advice’ projects but many ran other services  like night shelters.

Not only are they a nuisance in the noise pollution, there are numerous restrictions as to take off and landing. It has been suggested to me that the NeoXcraft will sound more like a leaf blower than a helicopter and therefore disruption to local residents will be kept to a minimum.\u0027With a number of the most expensive homes ever sold in the area being mine, my intentions are to offer a craft with Hermitage in early spring next year.

It turned out to be a fun read and rather interesting. A friend, Helena Smith, basically wrote the book from Teddy’s dictation, poor grammar and all. He wanted to set the record straight in the late 1930s that while life on the post Civil War frontier was hard, it was also a lot of fun…It was a fun book, ideally suited to nights in a mountain cabin. In some of it you can see the source of countless western themes. Other aspects of life on the 19th century ranches are surprising (roller skating for example).Astonishing.

William Golding’s Lord Of The Flies has brought back memories for quickspace:Just read Lord of the Flies for the first time, finishing it yesterday with the horror of boyhood re-emerging 41 years later, the panic and cruelty boys inflict on each other. Having gone to an all boys school after flunking my 11+, the hierarchy and mob mentality felt familiar, though I don’t think anyone was brutally murdered by a mob or had their brains bashed out by a fuck-off rock. Oddly, the description of Simon’s corpse reminded me the description of Curly’s wife after her death in Of Mice ... At least in tone, curiously poetic and so sad I bawled my eyes out, which I’m glad happened now and not in my school days.The Portable Dorothy Parker, “a collection of her short stories, poems, reviews and personal correspondence” has impressed JohnHunt:Everything in the book is short, though the book itself runs to just over 600 pages … Like Runyon, Parker is very much of time and place and, again like Runyon, the time runs from the 1920s to the early 1950s and the place is New York and its environs. Parker knows her characters and she’s betting that you have a passing familiarity with them as well. Her stories are told from an unapologetically female perspective, often a woman’s internal dialogue. If you appreciate a good zinger at the end, if you need someone who’s quotes you will be able to recall at just the right moments, if you are looking for a good laugh or a way to consider the female perspective from her time period, Parker is your sure guide.Parker also wrote A Star Is Born if you’re wondering if she is still relevant today. You just can’t go wrong.Anna Burns’ Milkman has worked for chasm:I’m surprised by the reviews that described it as a difficult read, I thought it pretty accessible. I also thought it the best Booker winner for some years, original, thought-provoking, humane, and unputdownable.Meanwhile, jinxsboy51 recommends The Butchering Art: Joseph Lister’s Quest to Transform the Grisly World of Victorian Medicine by Lindsey Fitzharris:Very readable history of the transformation that occurred in medicine about the role of infection and sterilisation in making a big difference in surgery survival rates. NOT for the those with queasy stomachs.Finally, talking of stomachs, annegeraldine has been focussing on Thackeray’s Vanity Fair:The men have gone off to battle in Waterloo leaving Amelia a pitiful wreck and Becky planning her strategy should she be widowed. Joseph Sedley remains with the women: “At half-past two, an event occurred of daily importance to Mr Joseph -- the dinner-hour arrived.

The key issue is how long the backstop would last (Brexiteers say it can’t be indefinite), and who could end it (Brexiteers want the power to end it).The spokesman said (via our Politics Live blog):This includes ensuring that, if the backstop is ever needed, it is not permanent and there’s a mechanism to ensure that the UK could not be held in the arrangement indefinitely.The pound has also nudged a five-month high against the euro, trading as high as €1.1465.Bloomberg is impressed by the power of Dominic Raab’s thumb to move markets:The responsiveness of the pound to headlines may be well documented, but its sensitivity reached new highs Tuesday as it rallied on a mere hand gesture.Investors had been waiting for news on progress in the Brexit orce talks with U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May gathering her Cabinet Tuesday morning. When BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg tweeted that the Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab had said “thumbs up” on the way out of the meeting, it was enough to send the U.K. currency to the day’s high.“Isn’t it wonderful to be working in a market where a simple thumbs-up moves a currency by 40 pips?” said Jordan Rochester, an analyst at Nomura International Plc.The pound has jumped to a two-week high as Brexit speculation swirls.Somewhat astonishingly, the rally came after the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg tweeted that Brexit secretary Dominic Raab had given reporters a verbal ‘thumbs-up’ following a crunch cabinet meeting.There’s no more detail about exactly what Raab meant -- whether he means progress on the Irish backstop, or simply that he’s still optimistic.But it’s enough to send sterling up to $1.3090, up half a cent against the US dollar, at its best position since 22 October.The pound had earlier lost ground after DUP chief whip Jeffrey Donaldson predicted that “we are heading for no deal.” This rapid rebound suggests the City is extremely anxious for signs that London and Brussels could reach an agreement to avoid the UK crashing out of the EU at the end of March.Rachel Winter, senior investment manager at stockbrokers Killik \u0026amp Co,isn’t convinced that a Democratic-controlled House would force peace in the trade wars.“The President uses the stock market as a barometer of his own success and is clearly keen to keep it at a high level. His plans for further expansionary fiscal policy, for example additional tax cuts and more infrastructure spending, would also have positive consequences for the stock market.” “There is concern that a Democrat majority in the House would cause governmental gridlock, making it difficult to pass further legislative changes. Further tariffs on China might be difficult to implement, which would potentially be good for emerging markets. That said, Democrats have long been critical of the trade imbalance between the US and China, and many leading Democrats applauded Trump’s tariffs.”The New York stock exchange is expected to drop when trading begins in under two hours, as America heads to the polling booths.Cautious traders will be sticking to the sidelines until we have some idea of how the midterm elections have played out. Given recent political shocks, they’ll be treating opinion polls warily.As my colleague Tom McCarthy explains, many scenarios are possible:Election night could end with the Republicans retaining their majority in the House of Representatives and strengthening their majority in the Senate, despite a historic exodus of Republicans retiring from Congress, widespread disapproval of Trump and the customary strength of the opposition party at this stage in the elections cycle.Yet some prominent Democrats – starting with the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi – are predicting a blue “wave” that will deliver a strong Democratic majority to the House. (Predictions of the Senate flipping blue are notably fewer.)It’s worth remembering that Wall Street’s interests don’t always run parallel to Main Street’s.Indeed, the two thoroughfares can erge widely when it comes to the state of America, and the global economy. What’s good for The Market isn’t always good for The People.As analysts at FX Pro put it:Wall Street has its own interest.Financial institutions fear that a full control by the Democrats over both houses (the House of Representatives and the Senate) could lead to the restoration of the Dodd-Frank Act, which restricts the activities of banks and the abolition of recent tax cuts.Dodd-Frank imposed new rules on the banking sector to avoid a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis, ending the ‘Too Big To Fail’ scandal. It was partly repealed earlier this year, despite warnings that this would increase financial risks.But while the economy is still growing robustly, business investment actually declined in the last quarter, suggesting the tax windfall isn’t being pumped into new equipment, machinery and infrastructure.European stock markets are falling deeper into the red as lunchtime approaches.Connor Campbell of City firm SpreadEx blames midterm jitters, as investors wonder whether the Democrats will claim a majority in the House of Representatives:A tentative start turned resolutely negative as Tuesday went on, investors’ midterm election nerves perhaps becoming more pronounced as voting gets underway.Brexit worries are also weighing on traders’ minds, as Theresa May struggles to reach an agreement over the Northern Ireland backstop that will satisfy Brussels and her own cabinet. A senior member of the DUP (who are supporting May’s government) has predicted that Britain would leave the EU without a deal.Many Americans have already made their choice of senator, congressman or woman, or governor, of course.Early voting has been particularly brisk, suggesting the overall turnout at these midterms could be sizzling high as both sides push hard to get the vote out.The polls are open, meaning early-rising Americans on the east coast can cast their ballots.It’ll be hours until we get any exit polls, though. Most polling stations stay open until at least 7pm local time (so midnight onwards for UK readers)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/942341352f64179bdd74265a8978f5805fc75fad/516_375_2855_1713/master/2855.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98e3174d6ea711510902193237eaa915","title":"britain brexit eu british government irish backstop","story":"The government has compounded tactical errors with pointless offence, losing friends over its duplicity on the Irish backstopCountries, like people, find bad habits hard to break. A smoker may resolve to quit but reach for a new cigarette. A lone drinker may start with orange juice and slowly add vodka. And a departing member of the EU may declare it is seeking a special new partnership with its strongest allies then spend two years trying to ide, deceive and shaft them.When Ireland’s foreign minister, Simon Coveney, tweeted on Sunday that Britain’s calls for a time-limited or unilaterally breakable backstop “are not backstops at all and don’t deliver on previous UK commitments”, he echoed the frustration across the EU. The concern is not that the UK holds a different opinion, it is that it is reneging on the guarantees it has already made. As the negotiators brace themselves for a lock-in at the last-chance saloon, the underlying problem is less about the backstop than the EU’s chronic lack of trust.There is a reason why Britain is being dragged kicking and screaming from the backstop to the withdrawal agreement. Since the start of this process, our government has confirmed every European fear and British stereotype. The UK has sought to ide and rule, bypassing the European commission and playing member states off against one another ceaselessly demanded unique privileges unavailable to either members or non-members and continued to insist upon fantasy technology at the Irish border to prevent the return of all-too-real sectarian violence.Our long reputation has always preceded us but, immediately after the referendum, the EU held out genuine hope that the government might behave reasonably. Certainly, Britain’s official narrative centred around building goodwill and demonstrating good faith. But, in reality, Theresa May quickly compounded tactical errors with pointless offence. The 2016 “citizens of nowhere” conference speech horrified EU diplomats, who also objected to the threatening tone of the Lancaster House speech and Article 50 letter. In May 2017, the prime minister even accused “bureaucrats of Brussels” ​of meddling in the UK election. Boris Johnson’s rhetoric about punishment beatings and whistling for money, and Jeremy Hunt’s likening of the bloc to a Soviet prison did little to help.The EU expected domestic Tory theatre, but ministers’ hostile language has also bled into personal relationships. Johnson, David Davis and Dominic Raab have all been deemed abrasive figures, and EU officials report numerous breaches of courtesy and protocol. Character and personality matter, and British arrogance has not won friends or influence.The Irish position, in particular, has faced open scorn in the British media. In the past few weeks, UK officials have dismissed and belittled Dublin’s concerns in off-record briefings, while senior MPs have accused the country of exaggerating the border issue or fabricating it altogether. Irish figures are well accustomed to such condescension and have bristled at yet another outbreak of groundless British exceptionalism. The rot set in early, when the government demonstrated its intention to subordinate the Good Friday agreement to UK-only trade deals. Ireland’s dismay solidified last December when then-Brexit secretary Davis declared the backstop was unenforceable. As for May, she paid no attention at all to the island of Ireland until she lost her parliamentary majority and bribed one of its parties to rescue her.It is often unclear if the UK is trying harder to hoodwink the EU or itself. Ministers have repeatedly called for things they must know to be impossible. Davis promised that a trade deal would be ready to sign next March May insisted free movement in its current form would end during the transition period and now Raab declares that he can unilaterally terminate a backstop that both sides agreed will last “unless and until another solution is found”. In sacrificing trust, we have also sacrificed credibility. After two long years, the government not only appears duplicitous, but demonstrably out of its depth.Brexit’s slow unravelling was both predictable and avoidable. Officials frequently remark that if they had trusted the UK’s motives and competence, they would have afforded the government more leeway. But instead of building bridges, the UK quickly burned them. The EU now suspects the government will do everything it can to wriggle out of the backstop, and is determined to thwart Britain’s faithlessness with a watertight withdrawal treaty. If, in the final weeks, the EU is holding our feet to the fire, it’s because we have shown it must.• Jonathan Lis is deputy director of the thinktank British Influence"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c555b01b6c8f21124bca393d582e629c4a41599/81_173_4726_2835/master/4726.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94f203e22901ac1fb560a9d4dc496381","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of miniature","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘miniature’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment in the Observer New Review is ‘miniature’.

In some cases, two pupils are disappearing from the rolls for every class of 30. Some local authorities are also approaching these figures for dropouts.Fears have been increasing that some schools are “offrolling” – getting rid of students who could do badly in their exams – in an effort to boost their league table position.The head of Ofsted, Amanda Spielman, is among those voicing concern. The inspectorate has yet to find a way to differentiate offrolling from cases where schools have acted in the best interests of children, but it has started to gather its own data.Education  looked at England’s 50 largest academy trusts and 50 largest local education authorities, and compared the number of pupils in year 11 in 2017-18 – the students counted when GCSE results are published – to the number in year 10, a year earlier.The findings reveal a consistent pattern in some chains of year groups shrinking substantially. The same four trusts fill the top four places in our table (below) on 2017-18 data and on data for 2016-17. The trend of disappearing pupils appears to be happening at a higher rate in the academies sector.Many of these teenagers will go to pupil referral units, or will be educated at home. This means their grades will not be counted in their school’s exam results.The trusts we spoke to say they are acting in the young people’s best interests. Some of the trusts point to a high level of disadvantage among their pupil intake. Education  published the first story on “vanishing” GCSE students nearly five years ago. Now we have used the same methodology to plot a league table of falling year 10 and 11 rolls based on school-by-school pupil number data from the Department for Education. The Harris Federation has been questioned before over evidence of reducing cohorts of pupils. Its response has been that its statistics reflect wider local population patterns, with London – where most of its schools are – seeing many young people moving in and out of secondaries.Jarlath O’Brien, director of education at a chain of academy special schools and author of Don’t Send Him in Tomorrow, which is about marginalised pupils, gasps when told these statistics.A spokesperson for Aldridge Academies says: “Our position represents the history of the schools we have taken on and that we are committed to changing. It categorically does not reflect any policies that would deliberately reduce the numbers on our rolls.”A spokesperson for Inspiration Trust says it “often takes on schools with falling rolls, and it takes time for that to stabilise”. The Harris Federation did not respond to requests for comment.Grace Williams, cabinet member for children and young people in Waltham Forest, says it would be “misleading and unhelpful” to attribute falling rolls to “any one factor”, with pupils moving to alternative provision, parents choosing to home educate and some families having to leave short-term tenancies, all being possible explanations.Anne Longfield, children’s commissioner for England, says: “Some schools are gaming the system by off-rolling some of the most vulnerable children, including some with special education needs and disabilities, in an attempt to improve the school’s exam results. These figures raise questions of some academy schools that they need to be able to answer.”She adds: “The government needs to be bold in finding solutions to stop these practices, including looking at the possibility of financial penalties and doing much more to encourage schools to keep children in mainstream schooling whenever possible.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fd26645e1a00b2b637181af08e3003449ed8563/0_75_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5484cded5bf114ea6ce43308c64bd53e","title":"how to eat chicken soup","story":"As autumn begins to bite, How to Eat is cooking up a hearty, rugged broth with, of course, bread and butter on the side. Is there any other way to enjoy it?The big coats are out and the nights are drawing in. Winter is coming. It is time to seek comfort in warming, hearty one-pots – and, in particular, the restorative power of chicken soup.The jury is very much out on whether the subject of this month’s How to Eat (HTE) might “do stuff” to you medicinally – the so-called Jewish penicillin likely exerts a strong placebo effect – but as we shiver through chilly commutes, hacking and coughing our way towards Christmas, arriving home to a steaming bowl of chicken soup indisputably lifts the soul.That bone broth warms the marrow. But only if it is done properly, which is where HTE – the series examining how best to eat Britain’s favourite dishes – comes in. So what is the ultimate expression of chicken soup?For sanity’s sake, this piece will limit itself to chicken soup prepared in a broadly European and North American style. Not out of chauvinism, much less xenophobia. But simply because exploring the full panoply of Asian, African and Latin American chicken soups in a way that does them justice would make this article balloon into an unmanageable, indigestible sprawl. An epic so vast it would make War and Peace (that “loose, baggy monster”, as Henry James put it) look like an offhand tweet.Bits. It should have bits in it. This broth should be dense, with visible pieces of chicken, vegetables, pulses and pasta. You may not be able to stand your spoon in it, but your spoon should definitely encounter some firm resistance. That heft, that ruggedness is central to this soup’s ability to banish the blues – both in the solidity and safety it suggests, and in the textural and flavour variation it provides in each mouthful. You need to chew here. Think of it as rewarding work. Eating chicken soup should feel like you are taking on a hot, generously filling fuel, laying down essential fat and protein for the cruel winter ahead (hence a gelatinous bone-broth base, speckled with globules of fat, is preferable).Chicken soup should never be smooth. Cream of chicken soup, that pallid, sweet concoction – that looks more like a milkshake and in which the chicken meat has invariably gone AWOL – is utterly childish. It may sound more sophisticated, but chicken soup given the velouté treatment is similarly vapid. A velouté might be a smart way to showcase a single vegetable (say, Jerusalem artichoke), but its silky mouthfeel is jarring in a context where you want body, chunks, meat. Similarly, there is something eerie about clear chicken consommés. That is an awful lot of cheffy work for a soup that will leave any right-thinking diner asking: where’s the rest of it? It is as if someone has stolen, if not chicken soup’s soul, then its crown jewels.Soup served in a cup will always, as Danny Dyer might put it, leave you feeling mugged off. The idea that all soups should be blended into a smoothly drinkable texture is infantile, and there is something about hurriedly slurping down gulps of warm, viscous savoury liquid (in contrast to the way a spoon moderates the pace of consumption) that is actively nauseating.Ideally, chicken soup should be served in a wide, deep bowl and consumed with a round soup spoon (using an oval dessert spoon, on the basis that it is more elegant, is a real Hyacinth Bucket move). Such a bowl retains its heat, acts as a reassuring visual representation of how thoroughly your hunger will be sated and gives you plenty of space to root around.Likewise, there is no practical reason to tilt the bowl away from you as you finish the last dregs of your soup, other than as some coded middle-class signalling to people around the table that you too unthinkingly adhere to petty bourgeois niceties. It is awkward nonsense. Ignore it.Apart from the chicken, which is firm enough that it can overhang the edges slightly, everything should be chopped into small enough pieces that a few of them can comfortably nestle together in each spoonful. Including long, floppy strands of difficult to control ingredients (spaghetti, flat noodles, cabbage etc) will likely leave you wearing half of your soup. In a noodle soup, you sign up for that it is a different proposition. But in chicken soup, keep it tidy. For instance, use smaller pastina (orzo, anelli, sorprese).Real pieces of chicken This may sound obvious, but it is a suggestion widely ignored by many commercial manufacturers of canned and fresh soups. Get some darker meat in there for additional flavour and do not shred the chicken. In a soup, shredded chicken becomes waterlogged and woolly. Instead, cut it into firmer chunks.Vegetables Onion, sweetcorn, celery, carrot, cabbage (darker, challenging varieties, for example, kale), celeriac, parsnip. Feel free to char or part-roast some of those vegetables first to build in further layers of flavour.Chorizo Used sparingly as a seasoning (this is not chicken and ham soup), a small amount goes a long way.Bulking agents A scattering of chickpeas, rice, redyellow lentils, pasta or barley (perhaps even a mix of several of these) will add textural variety, a satisfying bottom-end weight and further nutty, iron-y flavours.Cream Just a drop or two, swirled through.Turkey The most disappointing meat on the market: accept no imitations.Bacon Unless safely marooned on a central island of ingredients, above the waterline and used strictly as a garnish, bacon becomes curiously mealy in soups. Likewise, chicken crackling: if immersed in all that liquid, it ends up not crisp and salty, but unedifyingly soggy and slimy.Mushrooms In a chicken pie, all good, but in a hot soup, the flavour of mushrooms is muffled and, like leeks, they achieve an altogether unpleasant level of slipperiness. Needless to say, even before we get to the issue of including prunes in a savoury soup (ye gods!), HTE is not a fan of cock-a-leekie.Potato In a soup, chunks of potato are always either undercooked or mush. There is no in between. Moreover, in a soup in which you need to work hard to avoid blandness (see flavour boosters, below), potato is a noncommittal shrug of an ingredient that adds body without flavour.Broccoli Water gets trapped in the heads of the florets and superheats so that, even as the soup cools, those pieces of broccoli maintain a thermonuclear temperature that could strip fire-resistant paint from a garage door, never mind the roof of your mouth. Not that you are likely to use them here, but as a general warning, tomatoes pose a similar danger.Peas Pointless, in this context.Egg Which came first: chicken soup or the idea of gently cooking strands of egg through it? HTE cannot say, but it is an ineffectual and unnecessary addition.It is rare that HTE strays into the realms of seasoning specifics. The how-to-cook nitty gritty is Felicity Cloake’s domain. But is worth reiterating that from salt, pepper, garlic and white wine upwards, chicken soup benefits enormously from some added va va voom to lift its somewhat beige ingredients. The more obvious herbs (parsley, thyme, bayleaf) can be too domineering, but if judged correctly, a little heat (ginger, chilli) can bring everything into sharper focus. Masala spices, harissa or ras el hanout can also be effectively deployed, but that is to take chicken soup on its travels in a way that HTE promised to avoid at the top of this piece.Even when stuffed to the gills, wiping your bowl clean with a piece of thickly buttered bread is the pinnacle of the chicken soup experience. Mopping up every last drop of those magical savoury juices is a must – like an impromptu roast chicken sandwich at the end of your meal. Who could say no to that?Remarkably, many people swear by chicken soup as a hangover cure. In a fragile state, and certainly before midday, HTE could think of nothing worse. Even the thought of it makes HTE bilious.Chicken soup is even wasted at lunch, arguably. It is best eaten after dark, in deepest winter, when rain is lashing against the windows and, if only for a few hours, you are determined to hibernate from the world and its endless horrors. Self-care starts with chicken soup.So, chicken soup: how do you eat yours?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4854a886fd8f9d55a4403865c45b2c2c1e1a7bcf/0_271_4040_2423/master/4040.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f4be6c1f5a78cde056522ea840769f5","title":"manchester city european nights pep guardiola football champions league","story":"• City have lost their last three home European games• ‘It’s down to the players, not the fans,’ says Kyle WalkerManchester City have denied there is an Etihad factor that works against them in the Champions League. Pep Guardiola’s team take on Shakhtar Donetsk on Wednesday on top of their group, two away wins having restored the damaged caused by the opening day defeat by Lyon, though that result back in September means City have lost their last three games in a row at home in Europe.“The game against Lyon was the only bad performance that counted,” Guardiola said. “Before that we played well against Liverpool but could not make up the deficit from the first leg, the game was over before the last 20 minutes, and the defeat by Basel did not matter because we were already qualified. Each game is different, but after the defeat by Lyon every Champions League game is now a final, because we need to be in the knockout stage. We want to take our place with the best 16 teams in Europe.”Evidently not everyone in Manchester feels quite the same way, because City’s crowds for Europe are generally lower than their domestic attendances, the habit of booing the Uefa anthem has not completely died away, and Guardiola has just taken part in a promotional club video aimed at encouraging supporters to feel more positive and proprietorial about European nights.Kyle Walker believes a relatively subdued atmosphere does not necessarily harm the home side’s chances, though feels the stadium could be more intimidating for visitors. “As players we concentrate on the game rather than worrying about the fans, but obviously you do notice the atmosphere when you go to certain grounds,” the defender said. “It can be difficult to play away when you can feel the supporters right behind their own side, and we probably do lack that a little bit, but if we want to make history it’s down to the players, not the fans.”One example of what Walker is talking about came at Anfield last season, when a typically partisan atmosphere contributed to City conceding three goals before half-time and effectively going out of the competition. “We were unlucky to come up against a Liverpool side that was on fire, but at the same time it was 10 minutes of madness that cost us the tie,” Walker said. “I feel we have learned from that now. We could have gone to Anfield and got a draw, then we would have had a better chance against Liverpool on our own turf.”Guardiola is expected to rest several key players, possibly including John Stones and Sergio Agüero, with an eye on the Manchester derby at the weekend. Ilkay Gundogan and Nicolás Otamendi have both been declared fit, though not necessarily ready to step straight back into the side after being sidelined for several weeks by injury. “The next game is always the most important and my main concern at the moment is to reach the knockout stage in good condition,” Guardiola said. “If we can win the next two home matches in the Champions League we will be there. Of course Manchester United is a big game but we cannot start thinking about that until we have played Shakhtar. They may be bottom of the group but there are only good teams in the Champions League. My feeling from being in it for 10 seasons is that every season it gets tougher. The clubs are better, the players and managers are stronger and each season the desire gets higher, so getting through is complicated.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d1d38f9824c9ddd397fd25f03c45e8b8397a457/0_93_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d87e95326d8ce230238618e702308887","title":"wayne rooney foundation england usa gate receipts fa","story":"• Rooney charity to benefit from other ‘fundraising initiatives’• Kyle Walker: ‘I think it is probably the send-off he deserves’The Football Association has confirmed the Wayne Rooney Foundation will not receive any of the gate receipts from England’s Wembley friendly against the United States despite it being billed as the Wayne Rooney Foundation International.Rooney will pick up a 120th senior cap in a one-off appearance on 15 November as England supporters are given the chance to hand the country’s all-time leading goalscorer a proper send-off. The 33-year-old, who now plays for DC United in Major League Soccer, has not represented the Three Lions in almost two years and his return has given rise to heated debate that is sure to intensify after the FA’s revelation about where the money raised from ticket sales will go.“The FA is a not-for-profit organisation which invests millions of pounds back into the grassroots game on an annual basis,” an FA spokesperson said. “The proceeds from the England v USA will go back into the English game. However, to honour Wayne Rooney and his record-breaking England career, we will also help raise money for the Wayne Rooney Foundation through a number of fundraising initiatives around the match.”It is understood the FA will support the foundation through fan collections, silent auctions in hospitality suites and by promoting awareness of the causes Rooney’s charity is raising funds for. Conversations as to the final arrangements are continuing but the approach will be similar to other charitable friendly matches, such as the Breast Cancer Care International against Holland in 2016. Supporters will be given the option to add a donation to the Wayne Rooney Foundation when they purchase tickets for the match, while there will be text-to-donate details inside the stadium during the 90 minutes.Rooney will be included in Gareth Southgate’s squad for the United States match but will not be considered for the Nations League meeting with Croatia three days later. The decision to award Rooney such an honour has been met with differing responses from present and former England internationals.Peter Shilton, who with 125 caps is the only player to have represented England more times than Rooney, and ex-captain Alan Shearer both agreed that Rooney’s achievements deserve honouring – but that should not extend to him playing in the match. However, a member of the current England set-up – Manchester City defender Kyle Walker – spoke in favour of the move.“I think it is good,” he said. “Wayne was there from when I was 20, he helped me right through my England career. I think it is probably the send-off he deserves for what he has done for both English football and England.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36f1e426727760955bc3dda76e4c1bc2330a23a3/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b5e15099ed0bd99c45145de34cb0adf","title":"dorcas amakobe girls football kenya moving the goalposts","story":"In coastal Kenya a football organisation is revolutionising society by putting women in public spaces previously reserved for men“We are pushing the boundaries that have been placed there for women and we were going beyond that. We have seen a lot of transformation working with the girls but we have also seen a change in how the community see girls and young women.”Dorcas Amakobe is director of Moving the Goalposts, which runs women’s and girls’ football programmes in coastal Kenya. As she explains, the organisation’s impact in the Kilifi, Kwale, Mombasa and Tana River counties runs far beyond sport.“Girls were facing a lot of challenges around being able to go to school,” Amakobe says. “A lot of them were getting pregnant and dropping out – those that managed to get to school.“We had girls facing sexual abuse – they were targeted, some were raped, some were actually physically abused by their parents and these circumstances have made women feel inferior. That was emphasised by the social norms in the community: that a woman’s place was in the kitchen and women only aspire to reproductive roles.”So they started Moving the Goalposts to help girls think about themselves differently and that started on the pitch: “Football then was reserved for men. We didn’t have any women playing football in the coastal region of Kenya. Therefore it was a good opportunity to start a conversation. When girls came to the pitch there was a lot of attention.“People started asking why girls were occupying this space and that helped us start a conversation, that girls can do anything that men can do. If a girl is given an opportunity to go on the pitch, to go to school, to run a business, she can achieve the equal potential that a man can achieve.”Amakobe is softly spoken but the authority of her organisation rings loud at Laureus’s Sport for Good global summit in partnership with Allianz in Paris, where representatives of 130 organisations using sport to create social change are meeting to discuss and share their experiences.Since Moving the Goalposts was founded in 2002 it has gone from working with 300 girls and women aged nine to 25, to 9,000 and the decision to use football to reach out into rural communities was an obvious one. “Using football was a message in itself, because it was purely reserved for men,” Amakobe says. “We also needed a sport which was accessible. If you have a sport which costs a lot and needs a lot of infrastructure then that means it’s not accessible.”They have shifted attitudes. “It has not been an easy thing for us. When we started we had a lot of obstacles and challenges. We work in really deep villages where transport is a problem, so if you don’t plan how the girls will go back home the chances are these girls might not reach home. We’ve had parents pushing back they didn’t want their girls occupying these public spaces. Some said our girls were rude, because the girls were confident and getting to know themselves.“Now we have 9,000 girls. That means more parents are allowing their girls to participate in sport. Few schools had teams for girls to play in. Now we run school tournaments and we have more school teams participating in the Kenyan school league than any other region.”The organisation uses its position in society to expand on conversations around gender equality. “We have training for parents in our programme and also conversations where parents and girls are able to discuss issues around gender and equal rights. I feel our investment with the parents has been one of our biggest successes.”Moving the Goalposts fuels its growth by bringing into the fold as coaches the young people it has helped, training them and offering schooling and career assistance in return. “Most of the sessions are run by volunteers who are beneficiaries of the programme. We don’t employ people from outside. We give them incentives, we give them school fees to go back to school, help with uniforms. We invest in their own growth and development as young people.”What does watching the development of the girls mean to Amakobe? “That’s when I get emotional,” she says. “One of the girls just signed a contract in Israel to play in the Israeli top ision. She started with our programme when she was nine and we’ve seen her become a professional player. Apart from seeing the change in her as a sportswoman we have also seen a change in her as a person.”It is not only those forging a career in football who are seen as success stories. “There is a presenter on a radio show who joined our programme having dropped out of school at primary age. She never went to high school. She joined our programme and we insisted she had to go back to school.“Now she’s a radio presenter at a radio station in our region. She’s not a sports presenter, she’s not a football player, but you can see the change she’s able to have in the community because she was given an opportunity through sport.”The Africa Women Cup of Nations kicks off next week in Ghana with three countries able to book a place at the World Cup. Kenya’s chances are slim, given they are ranked 129 in the world and are in it only because Equatorial Guinea were disqualified for fielding an ineligible player. But a good showing from African teams at next year’s World Cup in France would do wonders for the profile of the sport on the continent.“It’s really important,” Amakobe says. “If we have more girls in professional sport and more winning the global awards that in itself would create a shift. Having African women’s teams getting media coverage, getting the opportunity to play on a global stage, is important.”And Kenya? “I feel that we have a chance but our federation needs to invest more.”• Hibernian secured their third Scottish Cup in a row, and a Cup double, with an 8-0 defeat of Motherwell.

This was obviously after the ball had been aimed at one’s (lesbo) head in the kind of terrifying gesture that we were taught, as girls, to laugh off – or, worse, take as a compliment. (See also: the pinging of bra straps.) Well, here we are in 2018, which in many ways is just an endless gif of a football whacking your outraged teenage head (which – ha! – in my case turned out to be bisexual), and a 13-year-old girl is being called a lesbian … for playing football. Some things, such as the nature and content of homophobic taunts, don’t change.Darcie, from Monmouthshire in Wales, has reportedly been told by PE teachers that she cannot play football as a recommended sport at school. Her peers “have criticised me a lot by saying I’m a man or a lesbian”, she says. The other children’s parents are reportedly no better, apparently shouting “don’t let a girl tackle you” during matches. Gender stereotyping never looked so unoriginal.Anyone who is bringing up children or has walked past a playground or weekend kickabout in their local park will have clocked the vast outnumbering of boys playing football while a vast outnumbering of dads shout encouragement the separating of primary school girls and boys for sports days the conspicuous lack of girls and, for that matter, black and Asian children.The veneration of conventionality has always been the way of school life, stultifying for so many of us, but gender stereotyping and segregation in sport continues to be completely unacknowledged. Which is how you get dated, embarrassing stuff happening, like England’s national governing body for swimming offering guidance to women on the best costume for flabby stomachs, pear shapes, boyish bodies and large or small busts.

Now, celebrities from Beyoncé to Michelle Obama are helping to tear up the idea of what a woman should sound likeNo one wants to sit next to a loud woman. I know this because someone recently moved the placement card on a dinner table to get away from me. That label – “loud woman” – has never been a compliment, even though some of us may wear it as a badge of honour. Picture a loud woman and she is in Technicolor, with the sound turned up past 11, looking like she is stuck in the 80s: big hair, massive gob, voice like a foghorn, part witch, part harridan, part pub landlady. You definitely don’t want to sit next to her when she has a drink inside her.So, what are we supposed to do with the idea of loud women in our postfeminist age? Where have they all gone? Theresa May seems to maintain her fragile power by being the opposite of loud. Angela Merkel built a 30-year career on being as unnoticeable as possible. The response to Germaine Greer in recent years can be summed up as: “Shut up.” Is it no longer acceptable to be a woman and a noisy, loquacious pain in the arse? After all, the women we now think of as loud usually communicate through performance as larger-than-life versions of themselves: Beyoncé, Rihanna, Lady Gaga.In everyday life, there is still something uncomfortable for a woman about being called loud, because the implication is that a) you don’t care about the people around you (otherwise, why are you making them feel uncomfortable?) and b) you don’t care what other people think about you. To allow yourself to be loud as a woman is to be borderline psychopathic – to switch off your empathy and your emotional intelligence – to love the sound of your own voice, to take up too much space. That is the theory, at least. (“Who do you think you are? Beyoncé?”)The reality, of course, is that the expression: “He is a loud man,” does not exist. Certainly, I have never heard anyone say it. A man may occasionally speak loudly. Traditionally, though, loud is a thing that certain women are, rather than something they do. Loud is a word we attach exclusively to women, often alongside the word “lairy”. Loud is a code that says to women: “Please stop doing that.” This, in turn, has often been a signal for women to turn around and say – almost childishly, but quite understandably: “I’ll take up all the space I want, thanks.”What a loud woman looks like, though, has changed hugely in the past two decades. With Michelle Obama publishing her autobiography, Becoming, next week, it is clear that a new generation of women want to redefine the term. As the former first lady puts it: “I admit it: I am louder than the average human being and I have no fear of speaking my mind. These traits don’t come from the colour of my skin, but from an unwavering belief in my own intelligence.” If you ask women whom they would most like to be as a public speaker, many will say Obama. Her speaking style – controlled passion, warm authority, approachable charisma – is extremely attractive. She is the new kind of loud: the volume is calculated and in tune with the audience.Thanks to digital platforms and social media, there has been a huge shift in the past 20 years in how women communicate and build a platform. Many of the women in the Top 10 chart of most popular TED speakers cannot be defined as loud, although their reach is extraordinary and they have built lucrative careers off the back of it. (To enter this chart, you need a minimum of about 10m views for a speech, so it is a fairly accurate measure of impact.) Brene Brown, a research professor who specialises in social work Susan Cain, an author Susan David, a psychologist Elizabeth Gilbert, who wrote Eat, Pray, Love and Amy Cuddy, a social psychologist, have all featured on this list. They are all speakers who embody the opposite of the fire-and-brimstone public-speaking presence of someone such as Margaret Thatcher. Often their message is about how to have your quiet voice heard in a noisy world. Meanwhile, it is becoming clear that many women we may think of as stereotypically loud are secretly quiet. Take Barbra Streisand, currently punting a new album at the age of 76. She had appalling stage fright for years and would only sing live at charity gigs. Adele? She is the richest UK celebrity aged 30 or under and an extraordinary performer. But she has been so nervous in the past that she has vomited into the front row as a result, she strictly controls her exposure to the stage. There are many recent examples of high-profile women who have decided to change things not by shouting the loudest or by drawing attention to themselves, but by starting initiatives that promote other women: take Reese Witherspoon’s multimedia brand, Hello Sunshine, Jameela Jamil’s “I Weigh” campaign (encouraging people to “weigh” their life achievements) and Sharon Horgan’s production company, Merman.At the recent People’s Vote march in London, at least half of the speakers were women, many of them under 30. They were all impressively accomplished orators, able to play to a crowd of thousands and to the camera at the same time (they were being filmed, so that the video could be relayed). Watching them and soaking up their confidence, it occurred to me that what was impressive was that none of them could be dismissed as loud women. Yet their impact, no matter what your politics, was striking.The difference in their styles, particularly among the younger women, was noticeable. A few held forth almost like spoken-word poets, in the style of Hollie McNish or Kate Tempest, allowing themselves to sound creative and passionate. One – an NHS doctor – spoke with quiet, dignified anger. Another was an old-school union speaker, addressing the crowd exactly as a leader of the NUS would have done in the 70s, complete with Citizen Smith intonation. Their styles were as varied as those of the male speakers. This variation and experimentation among female leaders is something we are only starting to see.Just as the past few years have seen a rise in the body-positive movement and an understanding of the expression “fat shaming” and the extent to which those ideas have been internalised, I wonder if the “loud shaming” of women is finally being recognised. Samuel Johnson’s horrible quote about women and public performance is more than a century old: “A woman’s preaching is like a dog’s walking on his hind legs. It is not done well but you are surprised to find it done at all.” When I was a child in the 70s, it was common for me to be told to be quiet and stop showing off – at home, at school, by adults of all kinds. It was not until I was much older that I realised I was not being loud or showing off – I was just talking. This is not necessarily a woman thing it is only in the past few decades that children have been allowed to be as noisy as they want. Anecdotally, many women will say that they learned from an early age that being loud – whatever this means – was not welcome behaviour.“Whatever this means” is important. Because I think we are redefining what it means to be loud. We are starting to understand that you are not obliged to be loud just because someone has told you not to be. My grandmother was a great role model for me when I was growing up. She could be loud. She ran a corner shop with a rod of iron, spoke her mind, laughed raucously and did not suffer fools gladly. But she also agreed with the old saying: “Empty vessels make the most sound.” Modern feminism has to hit a happy medium between these extremes. Don’t make noise for the sake of it, but don’t shut up either. There is a lot of experimentation to be done in the space between those options. As for the person avoiding me at dinner? Maybe I was just wearing too much perfume.How to Own the Room: Women and the Art of Brilliant Speaking by Viv Groskop is out now (Bantam Press, £12.99).

As Daptone release his posthumous album, Ozzy Osbourne, Margo Price and more remember his talentCharles Bradley’s blooming as a soul singer wasn’t a dream come true, reckons Tommy Brenneck, because Bradley was never in a position to dare to have a dream to hold on to. “His life was full of tribulations that dudes like you and I would never be able to relate to, just from being a poor, uneducated, black man in America,” says Brenneck, the songwriter, producer and guitarist who was at Bradley’s side as he transformed from a Brooklyn handyman to one of the great latter-day testifiers of the classic soul sound.Bradley had been abandoned by his mother as an infant – he never knew his father – and taken up by her again at eight before he ran away at 14, when he was arrested and sent to a juvenile detention centre. There he learned to cook, for hundreds of people at a time later he got a similar job at a mental institution in upstate New York. “He cooked for 20 years before hitchhiking across the country to pursue whatever dream he had,” says Brenneck. From 2002, when Bradley made his first recordings for Daptone Records, until his death from cancer in September 2017, he found a voice that put his life into sound. “He made it look easy because he was a natural,” says country artist Margo Price. “Charles genuinely loved his audience and his fans, and it radiated through him. You could see how happy he was on stage, but you could also feel his pain. I have never cried more tears of joy and sorrow watching someone perform.”“He had that thing that won’t let you sleep at night if you ignore it or makes your body move in a way you didn’t think it could, to touch the truly raw places of your spirit and let it take you somewhere bigger than you,” says Nathaniel Rateliff.“I remember how completely blown away I was the first time I heard it,” Ozzy Osbourne says of Bradley’s version of Black Sabbath’s Changes, which Bradley recast as a deep soul waltz. “He showed me the versatility of the song – he took Changes to a new level.”Ten unheard and rare recordings from across Bradley’s career are now being released as Black Velvet, which captures Bradley propelling across the dancefloor and brooding over ballads. The title comes from the stage name Bradley used when he was singing in bars as a James Brown tribute act, before his career was established. The album, far from sounding cobbled-together, is a fittingly powerful collection.“When he began pursuing music in New York, creating this Black Velvet character,” says Brenneck, “he didn’t have a dream, so much as a comfort and identity as the local handyman who looked and dressed like James Brown.”“Black Velvet,” explains Gabe Roth, who co-founded Daptone, “was this superhero that helped him transcend all the struggles of his life. ”Bradley sought out Roth when he decided being Black Velvet wasn’t enough. He turned up at Roth’s door around the turn of the millennium and announced: “I heard you were looking for a singer.” He sang for Roth there and then, and Daptone soon got him in a studio, recording Rodriguez covers, although he didn’t release his first album, No Time for Dreaming, until 2011. In the meantime, he was part of the Daptone family, even helping build the label’s studio.“When Daptone was being built, I took a ride with Charles to go to Home Depot to buy building supplies, and people were saying to him, ‘What up, James?’ and ‘How’s it going, Black?’” Brenneck says. “People were being nice to him, but you got a glimpse into this real sadness – his whole identity was built on being someone else. No one called him Charles. When he broke out of the James Brown act and took off the wig and became the Charles Bradley we know – and I literally held his hand through that process – we let out this monster of an artist. Every song me and Charles wrote came from somewhere deep, and he carried that weight and anguish with him every time he sang. He would bend over, his face squashed up – and that was before he’d sing a note.”When Roth introduced Bradley to Brenneck, he found a collaborator who could take the time and effort needed to help him express his talent. Still, it was five years before they became musical partners. Brenneck was looking for a new sound after touring with the Mehanan Street Band and the Budos Band, and happened on Bradley again. “His voice was so compatible with the mid-paced, moody music I was making between tours. It turned out the shit that moved me was really moving Charles. And that’s when our relationship really transformed. He was my guy and I was his guy.”What defined Bradley’s anguish, Roth says, was not the poverty in which he had spent most of his life, but his personal relationships. “He had lot of issues, from childhood, with his mother. And then his brother being killed. And he had issues with his own sexuality and identity..”Working with Bradley wasn’t always easy. He suffered stage fright, and couldn’t read or write music, so Brenneck acted as his interpreter and transcriber when they wrote together. At first it created problems: he sometimes didn’t learn the lyrics – the power of his voice was enough to sell a song – until fellow Daptone singer Lee Fields persuaded him to start doing so. “The song that really connected was Loving You Baby,” Brenneck says. “There’s a verse in there I completely love and he wasn’t singing it. But when he learned it after talking to Lee, the audiences started responding. And Charles, a very sensitive man, felt that response. He didn’t realise there was power in those lyrics – he thought the power was in his screaming. He learned that people were responding to songs he wrote.”Bradley was the second of Daptone’s stars to pass away within a year Sharon Jones had died in November 2016. It left a hole in this tightknit family of musicians. What Bradley leaves behind is the music, and the memory of an extraordinary performer. “I owe a lot to my performance to watching him,” Price says. “He was so badass. The way he threw out roses to the audience, the way he danced unashamed and unchained, how he jumped down in the crowd and parted the sea of people, touching hands and hugging people. He was fucking brilliant.”• Black Velvet is released on 9 November on DunhamDaptone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f314d004eff69b99529b9fc4859eb49c815c0368/0_60_4072_2443/master/4072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d92b7a6318f488ef5628bd3476bb3d5b","title":"roy hargrove 10 key performances from bebop to hip hop crossovers","story":"The American trumpeter, who has died aged 49, influenced a new generation of jazz artists with his soul and funk fusionAt his final UK performance, at London’s Jazz Café on 9 October, I watched trumpeter Roy Hargrove play with his characteristic bebop intensity and sultry swing. He packed his five-piece band on to the stage and cruised through the funkier numbers from his fusion project, the RH Factor, as well as the straightahead jazz of his more recent work on Earfood, from 2008. There was no sign Hargrove was unwell his death, on 2 November, was caused by cardiac arrest due to kidney disease.Hargrove performed in his trademark suit and shades, the snappy dress code that added to his charm as an instrumentalist. His playing was slick, rarely exhibitionist and never inidualistic. Seldom taking the microphone, except to thank the crowd for their support – his yearly sold-out performances at the Jazz Café were something of a residency – he let his instrument do the talking. The performance cemented his status as one of the great trumpeters of his generation.Hargrove combined the jazz tradition with the soul revival and burgeoning hip-hop scene of the 1990s, and collaborated with artists ranging from his mentor Wynton Marsalis and saxophone legend Sonny Rollins to neo-soul stars D’Angelo, Common and Erykah Badu. The soft interlacing of his trumpet lines and horn arrangements on these critically acclaimed and commercially successful neo-soul and hip-hop records laid the groundwork for more recent jazz crossover work by the likes of Kamasi Washington, Keyon Harrold and Robert Glasper.Though only 49 when he died, Hargrove left a gigantic back catalogue: more than 20 albums as bandleader and more than 50 as a sideman. Here is some of his finest work.After being discovered by New Orleans trumpeter and educator Wynton Marsalis, Hargrove studied at the New School in New York and collaborated with saxophonist Bobby Watson. Some of these recordings caught the ear of Sonny Rollins, who invited Hargrove to play on his 1991 album, Here’s to the People. Rollins was so impressed by Hargrove’s mature style that this track is dedicated to the then 22-year-old. His languorous and measured solo offers traces of the upbeat swing that characterises his later playing. “Having been fortunate to play with the super, super trumpet stars of the day, I found it inconceivable that this new kid on the block could be in that class, could be that good,” Rollins wrote on Facebook on 3 November. “He was. He is, and will always be.”Bassist Christian McBride was a long-time collaborator of Hargrove’s. On the title track of McBride’s 1995 debut record, you can hear the funk influences creeping into Hargrove’s trumpet playing, favouring groove and feel as well as technical expertise. McBride tweeted in tribute to Hargrove: “I have no words over the loss of my dear brother of 31 years. We played on a lot of sessions together, travelled a lot of miles together, laughed a lot together, bickered on occasion – and I wouldn’t change our relationship for anything in the world. Bless you, Roy Hargrove.”In 1998, Hargrove won his first Grammy, for best Latin jazz for Habana. The leap from the American jazz tradition to the complex time signatures and speed of Latin jazz on Habana showcased Hargrove’s versatility as composer and player, most of all on the lightning-fast lilt of Mr Bruce.The new century heralded Hargrove’s movement away from the jazz tradition he’d spent two decades exploring. Recruited by drummer Questlove to join his supergroup Soulquarian, he wrote and arranged on sessions for artists such as D’Angelo, Erykah Badu and Common. On Green Eyes, Hargrove’s trumpet is a soothing response to Badu’s opening in the style of Billie Holliday, before taking the lead on the hazy groove of the second half. It is a 10-minute introduction to the jazz underpinnings of the neo-soul movement.Hargrove also deconstructs the groove on D’Angelo’s Spanish Joint, taken from the latter’s second album, Voodoo. Hargrove’s Latin jazz influences provide pointed interjections to D’Angelo’s layered harmonies. This subtle back-and-forth exchange holds the composition together.Another key member of the Soulquarians group was the late hip-hop producer J Dilla. On rapper Common’s fourth album, Like Water for Chocolate, the complex influences of the Soulquarians collide: Hargrove’s solo jazz lines merge with Dilla’s snappy programmed production and Common’s lyrical dexterity to salute Afrobeat pioneer Fela Kuti.After his intensively productive neo-soul years, Hargrove returned to the jazz tradition. He won a second Grammy for best jazz instrumental album on this collaboration with Herbie Hancock and Michael Brecker, which celebrated the work of Miles Davis and John Coltrane. Hargrove showcases a softer side on the Poet, harmonising with saxophonist Brecker to create a ballad-like atmosphere and putting his own spin on the piercing inidualism of Davis’ playing.Injecting his experience of the neo-soul scene into a solo project, Hargrove formed the RH Factor – a funk-soul crossover featuring Badu, Common and rapper Q-Tip. On Poetry, Hargrove expertly uses the space between his playing to accommodate Badu and Q-Tip’s interlocking lines, creating one of his most popular tracks to date.The true marker of immortality in jazz is to write a standard. These standards – penned by the likes of Cole Porter, Gershwin and Coltrane – become the core repertoire of musicians in training before being endlessly reinterpreted. While Strasbourg St Denis may not yet appear in the standards books, its infectious melody and scope for challenging solos has seen it become a fixture of jazz jams and rehearsals everywhere.Early in his career, Hargrove made a name for himself as a member of the Dizzy Gillespie All-Star Big Band, drawing comparisons to the titular trumpeter for his dextrous playing. After establishing himself as a solo artist, however, Hargrove returned to the big band format only for his final album Emergence. Here, he is a confident leader of the 19-piece ensemble, his experience arranging for the neo-soul crowd condensed into the rollicking swing of Ms Garvey, Ms Garvey. It’s a complex number, with Hargrove shining in the background harmonies but leaving ample room to showcase his band, in particular Jason Marshall on baritone saxophone."},{"url":null,"title":"inside the booming business of background music","story":"Once derided, the successors to muzak have grown more sophisticated – and influential – than any of us realise. By  Jake HulyerNot long ago, Rob Wood found himself at Heston Blumenthal’s house, in south-west London, where he was being persuaded to eat a flower. They were supposed to have been discussing the TV chef’s latest project, testing music’s effects on the dining experience, for which he had hired Wood to pick the songs. Instead, he was recounting a recent trip to south-east Asia. The flowers on his kitchen table, he said, were from that same trip: he was trying to capture their flavour for a dish he was developing. Wood smelled the flowers. Blumenthal, increasingly animated, urged him to take a bite he wanted the music to capture and complement the flower’s exotic qualities. Under duress, Wood had a little nibble.Wood is the founder and creative director of Music Concierge, a company that chooses background music for businesses. His clients include iconic fashion brands, such as Harvey Nichols and Mulberry, and luxury London hotels, such as the Connaught and the Savoy. Some clients hire Wood because they want to influence iniduals’ behaviour. When the football club Tottenham Hotspur was looking for music for its new training ground complex, Wood was asked to provide playlists for a holistic programme covering every aspect of Spurs’ players’ psychological and physical wellbeing. Others seek to create a certain atmosphere, such as the restaurant German Gymnasium, for which he sourced particular bell sounds that evoked Mitteleuropean cafe culture. For another client – a late night, alcohol-free burger bar in Kuwait, which delivers food on a conveyor belt – Wood had to conjure the vibe of a 1980s New York block party, choosing early hip-hop by Grandmaster Flash and lesser-known tracks by James Brown.Music, even when you are barely aware of it, can be surprisingly powerful. Over recent decades, researchers have found that it can affect how much time we think has passed while waiting in a queue, how co-operative shoppers are with sales staff, and even how sweet or bitter food tastes. One study found that shoppers’ preference for French or German wine shifted according to which of the respective countries’ traditional music was playing from a nearby set of speakers.The background music industry – also known as music design, music consultancy or something offered as part of a broader package of “experiential design” or “sensory marketing” – is constantly deciding what we hear as we go about our everyday business. The biggest player in the industry, Mood Media, was founded in 2004 and now supplies music to 560,000 locations across the world, from Sainsbury’s to KFC.The core of a music consultant’s work is creating distinct, cohesive musical identities for brands. That can mean allying the brand with a particular heritage, such as the restaurant Dishoom, where food and interiors pay postmodern homage to colonial-era India, and where Wood’s playlist features a genre known as “exotica”, an American-born, 1950s style, which refracts world music influences through a western lens. At other times, it can be finding a fresh angle, such as Kenyan restaurant group Nyama Mama, which caters to a young, cosmopolitan clientele and where, rather than just global, American-dominated pop, artists from Nairobi are also played.One day this summer, Wood and his team were working on music for a new hotel, the Dixon, which is due to open in a converted courthouse near London’s Tower Bridge in December. Wood’s brief was for distinct playlists for different areas: the lobby, the bar, the restaurant and the gym. Aside from the gym, where the music – sprightly, uplifting club tracks – would remain consistent at all hours, the playlists were to be ided into different “day parts”, the choices tailored to either four or five different time periods.In an office in Shoreditch, the hotel manager and its owners, with the creative agency working on the hotel’s branding, walked Wood and his team through every detail of the project: the build materials, the history, the average sum – £23 – they anticipated customers would spend in the restaurant. They spoke about emphasising the culture of the local area, and showed slides that included phrases such as “where your enrichment begins” and “authenticity in every detail”. (Authenticity is a word that comes up often in these kind of meetings.) The hotel would be marketed as “premium four star”, they explained, designed to appeal to “the discerning executive” and affluent millennials.After the meeting, there was a trip to the half-finished building site, where the owners pointed out architectural features and Wood, who stayed mostly quiet, appeared to be looking for clues. Much of Wood’s job involves taking abstract suggestions – a handful of adjectives, a scattering of reference points, a corporate slogan – and turning them into music. No small amount of intuition is also required. It is common, he says, for clients to speak about being bold or creative. Part of his job is working out what they really want, whether he should deliver something that will precisely match expectations or pleasingly upend them.The following month, Wood showed me the sample playlists his team had come up with. The hotel’s bar was to be in the old courtroom itself, a high-ceilinged room with wooden furniture. The aim with the music there, Wood told me, was to create a sense of loftiness without sounding staid. “They want heritage but they don’t want it to be traditional,” he said, playing me a gentle, swinging jazz track. The way he explained his process often seemed imprecise, but so, too, was the effect he was trying to achieve: a refined sense of the past that could not be pinned down to any specific period.For most people, background music means muzak. In the 1920s, George Owen Squier, a former US army officer who went on to earn a doctorate in electrical engineering, developed a new way to transmit audio through wires. His idea led to the creation of a company named Wired Music, which enabled businesses to broadcast music in offices and commercial premises. In 1934, in homage to the wildly successful camera company Kodak, Wired Radio was renamed Muzak.Sonically, muzak set the template for background music that would persist for decades: orchestral instrumentals which referenced classical and, later, popular music. Over time, the name would become a term of derision, synonymous with a kind of dated easy-listening music infuriatingly drifting through every public space. “It’s just a kind of amniotic fluid that surrounds us,” said communications professor Gary Gumpert in a 1990 documentary. “It never startles us, it is never too loud, it is never too silent it’s always there.” It was a balm to sooth awkward silences, gentle encouragement toward a brightened mood. An indication of the popularity it once enjoyed is the radio stations – with names like Easy Listening and Beautiful Music – which brought the format into people’s homes.Although the background music industry has existed for almost a century, it has constantly been reshaped by changes in the way music is distributed. For decades, the industry’s ability to deliver music in a non-stop format was as important to clients as the music itself. Each of the background music companies developed its own technology for distributing the music supplied to businesses. For Muzak, it was the transmission through wires it had patented decades earlier for fellow US-based company 3M, it was a bulky cartridge format, sent through the post and then played through a device also of its own design.In the 1970s, the introduction of affordable multi-deck tape players – compared to the fiddly steps involved in putting on a vinyl record, or unreliable multi-record changers – suddenly made it easy for businesses to choose and play music continuously. “You couldn’t control the market any longer,” recalled Peter Standley, who worked at a major UK background music company, Reditune, during that period.Technology also helped shift the consensus about what background music could be. With cassette players at home and in cars, people became accustomed to listening to whatever they wanted, wherever they were. As early as the late 1960s, companies such as Yesco in the US had started licensing original music from record labels, using the popular songs of the moment, rather than easy listening arrangements which paid reference to them. Over time, this became the norm, including at Muzak, which eventually merged with Yesco. (More recently, Muzak was acquired by Mood Media, and in 2013, its brand name was retired.)By the time the CD was invented, in 1982, background music was becoming more nuanced. The CD was the first digital format for music and, by the late 1990s, it had enabled background music companies to develop digital libraries – before the likes of iTunes in the early 2000s – where tracks could be organised by highly specific filters. “If you wanted nothing but love songs that were slow tempo, sung by women, that had a saxophone solo, we could create a playlist using our database,” said Sean Horton, a former music consultant for PlayNetwork. But that was just a taste of the new world of infinite choice that was to come.There are two main ways psychologists think about the effects that music can have on us. The first is physical. Numerous studies have confirmed our common sense assumption that we often subconsciously match what we are doing to what we hear. In 1985, for instance, one study found that diners chewed at a faster pace when higher-tempo music was played. (Researchers measured this according to the delightfully named metric, bites-per-minute.) Interestingly, they noted, diners did not finish their meals faster, suggesting that they had actually been taking smaller bites.The second approach focuses on the associations that music can trigger and how context, such as the environment we are in, affects those associations. One 1998 study found that diners in a cafeteria were willing to spend more money when classical music was played in the background than when there was no music at all. One explanation, researchers suggested, was that diners associated classical music with quality. (In an indictment of the changed fortunes of easy listening music, it elicited a worse response from diners than silence.) Researchers also use the related concept of “musical fit” to understand why people respond to particular music differently depending on the setting.Wood and his team need to take both of these approaches into account. When the client is a retailer, three words come up time and again: high dwell time. Clients want to keep customers browsing for as long as possible. For one high-end department store, Wood’s job was to calm down a busy, hectic environment. Deploying delicate contemporary classical and “intimate vocals”, he aimed to make the store a more pleasant place to spend time, while also complementing the upmarket feel of the building. Some jobs require the opposite approach, however. Many hotels do not have capacity to seat all of their guests for breakfast, which means they want to turn tables quickly. In those cases, Wood provides a brisk soundtrack, rather than the more sedate, leisurely sounds you might expect.One question all music consultants face is just how unobtrusive their selections should be. It is a choice that is sometimes described as between “foreground” or “background” music. Andreas Liffgarden, of Spotify-backed background music supplier Soundtrack Your Brand, drew an analogy between the foreground approach and the way certain fashion labels refuse to pander to their clientele’s tastes. “You might not like red trousers,” he said, “but I don’t give a fuck about that, because red trousers is in vogue in 2018, right?”For better or worse, most clients are not looking for the musical equivalent of red trousers. Paul Hillyer, head of media at Mood Media’s UK business, described the approach his company often takes as “cradle to grave”, the least offensive to the widest spectrum of people. One of their clients is Fuller’s Brewery, which plays music in most of its 400 or so pubs in the UK. Andrew Durn, whose role at Fuller’s involves liaising with Mood Media, described its sound as being roughly like Radio 2, catering to an older, comfortable crowd. “What we don’t want,” he told me, “is customers walking in, listening to the music and saying: ‘What’s that all about?’”It is the strenuously inoffensive nature of this kind of background music that riles up some of the industry’s fiercest critics. One group, Pipedown, have campaigned “for freedom from unwanted music in public places” since 1992, when its founder, Nigel Rodgers, was spurred to action by a particularly irritating experience in a South Kensington restaurant. “Do you hate unwanted piped background music?” reads the call to arms on the group’s website. “Do you detest the way you can’t escape it? (in pubs, restaurants and hotels on the plane, train or bus down the phone ruining decent television programmes adding to the overall levels of noise pollution in public places).” The group, which counts Stephen Fry and Joanna Lumley among its celebrity supporters, claims some credit for the decision Marks \u0026amp Spencer took in 2016 to stop using music in its stores. “You’re not going for a special sort of atmosphere, you’re just going to do your shopping,” Rodgers said.One of Pipedown’s boldest claims is that there is “no genuine evidence” that background music increases sales. Opinions vary on this question, although most experts do not share Pipedown’s hardline position. Adrian North, a psychology professor at Curtin University in Perth, argues that small purchases are where it is most possible to influence consumers. He conducted the 1997 study that found that shoppers were more likely to choose either French or German wine, depending on which of the respective countries’ music they heard, something he contrasted with a decision like buying a car. “I would be astonished,” he said, “if someone chose a Renault over a Volkswagen just because you play French music in a showroom.”Others argue that it makes more sense to think about the influence of background music in terms of subtle, long-term benefits, rather than immediate impact on sales. Rhonda Hadi, marketing professor at Oxford University’s Saïd Business School, believes companies that provide an experience, such as flights or accommodation, can reap the greatest rewards. “The service itself is so intangible,” she said, “that people rely on any cues they can to gauge the quality of the service that they’ve received.”Hadi says that consumers value this holistic approach more than they used to. Younger consumers, she said, tend to value authenticity, which the marketing industry interprets as a preference for “congruence”, the idea that everything should fit with the brand and the story they tell about themselves. While it might not alter someone’s decision about which car to buy, the right music, in a particular car showroom, might coalesce with a package of other details to make someone feel good about the hefty sum of money they are about to part with.One afternoon in July, two Music Concierge staff – music consultant Damon Martin and account manager Morgan Mackintosh – visited Mulberry’s Kensington office. They were there to present a sample set of playlists for the redesign of the British brand’s flagship Regent Street store. Around the table were Baron Osuna, Mulberry’s head of image, and Bradley Taylor, head of visual merchandising and store design. Mackintosh turned her laptop around to display a PowerPoint presentation, which she clicked through as Martin talked.Music Concierge’s brief had been to find music that would match the concept for the store’s new design, “British Brutalism”, as well as Mulberry’s “brand pillars”: Britishness quality lifestyle accessibility real. The plans for the store involved concrete structures planted in the centre of the shop, along with glazed green tiles and Windsor chairs. Phrases used to describe the new design included “British nature”, “decorative gestures”, and “honest materials”.One of the steers from Mulberry was that it wanted the stores to feel more like a gallery space. In the past, Mulberry had signalled “Britishness” in its stores by playing artists such as the Cure and Joy Division, but for this new design, Martin suggested slightly more avant-garde British artists, such as Brian Eno and Four Tet. (Speaking in a nearby cafe afterwards, Martin recalled different versions of “Britishness” he had come up with for other clients, like Noël Coward for a heritage hotel, or young guitar bands for a high street retailer.)A song by Digitonal, downbeat and electronic, played tinnily from Martin’s portable speakers. “It’s on the softer side,” he said, “but it has a sense of drama and it builds.” Taylor and Osuna listened, nodded, and offered occasional comments. “It might feel a bit sombre,” Osuna said. “I think we could approach the warmth through playfulness,” replied Martin, picking out a song by Russian artist Kate NV. Ascribing it to “real”, the final brand pillar, he said, “There’s a sort of eccentricity to it that offers a sense of lightness.”The songs presented to Mulberry were intended to convey how the full playlists would sound. Once a client is satisfied with Music Concierge’s concept, the team at the office adds flesh to the bones: the playlist designers, who are junior to the music consultants, search through their internal music libraries to find songs that will make up the playlists’ full length, which can number between 1,000 and 8,000. The number mostly depends on how many different sections the client wants to ide their playlist into, and the number of different areas at the location. The cost, per site, can range from about £35 to £250 a month.Companies like Music Concierge have capitalised on the sweeping changes to the world of retail in recent years. In the face of competition from online retailers, many high-street businesses have sought to repackage shops as a “destination”: no longer just a functional place to buy things, they are presented as an experience. The idea of experiential marketing has also taken hold. The business academics Bernd Schmitt and Alex Simonson captured this idea in a prescient book published in 1997: “In a world in which most consumers have their basic needs satisfied,” they wrote, “value is easily provided by satisfying customers’ experiential needs – their aesthetic needs.” Martin Lindstrom’s influential 2005 book, Brand Sense, built upon these ideas, hailing the marketing power of sound and scent. He cited Play-Doh, Crayola and Johnson’s Baby Powder as the brands with the most recognisable smells. Underscoring music’s role in conjuring positive associations, he wrote: “Music makes new memories, evokes the past, and instantaneously can transport you to another place.”Music Concierge was one of several companies set up in the mid-to-late 2000s, responding to these trends, and in particular a greater commercial appetite for music carefully tailored to particular brands. Rob Wood, like many of these companies’ founders and employees, had jumped ship from the music and media industries. His trajectory is something of a parable for the way the music industry has had to transform itself – both economically and culturally – in response to the changes wrought by technology.After graduating from university in the early 1990s, Wood spent a few years DJing and running an arts listings magazine, eventually going on to become editor of the alternative music magazine Jockey Slut in 1999. But, as the internet began to eat away at the magazine industry’s circulation figures and advertising revenues, Wood ended up working for an online booking portal for luxury hotels. Reviewing hotels for them, he noticed how often establishments would be playing music that seemed jarring. “They were just putting on what I’d call Cafe del Bula Bar,” he told me. “Cliched music, which wasn’t appropriate to a boutique hotel in the Cotswolds.”At just the time that the digital revolution was shaking up the music and media industries, businesses were increasingly seeking the skillset that Wood possessed. After a few years of ad-hoc consultancy, in 2007 he founded Music Concierge. Wood is sanguine about his role in pulling music away from the alternative enclaves where he first discovered it. As the music business has tanked, for many the notion of “selling out” has come to seem dated. Selling rights for songs to be used in adverts, TV, videogames, films and public spaces now accounts for a much greater slice of music industry profits. Any artist still reticent about licensing their music may be persuaded to do so by the promise that it will be used in a more sophisticated, artful way than ever before – a change Wood has played a part in: his job, after all, is scuffing the line between commerce and culture. “I’m doing something I’ve always done,” he said. “I’ve always been driven by introducing people to music they didn’t know they might love.”Just as it always has, the future of Wood’s industry will depend on how well it can adapt to the pace of change. Since Spotify was founded in 2008, digital sales of music have collapsed, and streaming – on Spotify and its competitors Apple Music, Tidal, Deezer, Pandora and more – has become the way most people listen to music. Everyone can now instantly access most of the world’s recorded music online.For background music companies, streaming is both a threat and an opportunity. On the one hand, music has become easier to access and distribute, meaning that companies like Music Concierge can select, deliver and tweak the music they deliver to businesses with greater speed, flexibility and precision than ever before. On the other hand, everyone now has access to vast music libraries that were once the preserve of a tiny number of hardcore music nerds and people working in the industry. “It went from us being the boutique music expert to having more of a collaboration with the brand,” said Sean Horton, who worked as a music consultant at PlayNetwork for over a decade. “Streaming turned everyone into a music expert.”Behind the rise of streaming lurks the spectre of automation. One part of Spotify’s appeal is its playlists, where it offers music for particular activities, as well as inidualised recommendations. The latter relies on comparing your choices with those of millions of other users, combined with analyses of the raw properties of songs, such as key, mode and tempo. For many people I spoke to while reporting this piece, the algorithms used to provide these recommendations seemed to be a source of anxiety. At the bigger companies, in particular, staff were keen to stress the importance of the real-life curator. Richard Hampson at Imagesound emphasised the intuitive side to his job. “It’s always been about feel and human touch,” he argued. “Human taste is really important, and the algorithm thing is removing that.”During my visit to his office in July, Wood showed me a playlist he was working on for Gravetye Manor, a hotel we had visited the previous month. Compared to many of his other projects, this one was a minor undertaking: it was for a bar that seats about 20 people. The hotel had just sent some feedback that the music for the evening sounded a little too muted, and he had some ideas for livening it up. He clicked through his laptop, pondering each of the songs’ qualities, teasing out how they might fit together. “A bit of Britishness,” he said, enthusiastically, picking a track by Richard Hawley as well as a Marvin Gaye track, “to balance it out with a bit of familiarity”. A Shirley Bassey cover of the Doors, her voice crooning out of the laptop speakers was, he explained, “a way of testing the boundary”. He paused to listen for a moment, pleased with the choice.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d333868df3256845f50b6fd7139bb3202537d4ca/0_107_5576_3345/master/5576.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3856dbfd9dc55e4243f2e5ca706f061e","title":"inside the campaign to stop brexit podcast","story":"As Brexit negotiations gear up again this week, the campaign for a second referendum is gathering momentum.

EU fined £135,000 over data misuse - liveThe anti-Brexit group Best for Britain has put out this comment about today’s cabinet from one of its supporters, the Lib Dem MP Layla Moran. She said:Theresa May’s cabinet met for almost three hours this morning to discuss Brexit but not a single decision was made. The can was kicked again down the road and another working group was created to try and get the government out of the bind they are in.Dominic Grieve, the Conservative former attorney general and a leading pro-European in the party, told BBC News a few minutes ago that he did not see how the EU could agree an Irish backstop that would allow the UK to unilaterally pull out. The UK would only be about to withdraw by mutual agreement, he said. And he claimed that showed why Brexit was flawed and why a second referendum was needed. He told the programme:We are leaving the EU, but we are going to place ourselves in a relationship with the EU where we lose all influence over decision making, and are likely to be subservient to the EU in critical areas about the nature of our future trading relationship with them, or for that matter the nature of the relationship that Northern Ireland has with them.It really reinforces for me why we should have a people’s vote. What is going to end up being offered to the British public, and the government is going to seek to carry through parliament, is something markedly different from what was being discussed in 2016.Here is my colleague Pippa Crerar’s story about today’s Brexit developments at cabinet.And this is from the ’s Steven Swinford.This is from the Daily Mail’s political editor, Jason Groves.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, has been speaking at a press conference with the Slovakian PM, the Sun’s Nick Gutteridge reports.Here is the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg on today’s cabinet.Ireland’s prime minister Leo Varadkar has expressed enthusiasm for Theresa May’s proposal for a review clause in the Brexit deal over the Irish border saying it could be to Ireland’s “advantage”.The taoiseach told Irish parliament he had not yet seen any wording on the review mechanism proposals but warned it would only work if it sat alongside an open-ended backstop deal.Dashing Brexiter hopes that he might be backsliding on the need for a guarantee over the border, he told the Dail it would “not be worth the paper its written on” if it included either an expiry date or a unilateral exit clause, something the hard Brexiters are insisting on. But Varadkar dispatched criticism from Sinn Fein that a review clause was a watering down of the backstop, declaring it could be the “creative” idea needed to break the logjam in Brexit talks and that it may even work in Ireland’s favour. During questions he told MPs:A review clause would have to be negotiated we have yet to see proposals from the UK as to what it would look like but if we do have a backstop, if it is used, if it does apply and potentially last into perpetuity it may be to our advantage or necessary at various points in time to have a review.A review is very different to an exit clause and we cannot accept an exit clause that would unilaterally allow the UK to resile from the backstop, nor could we accept an expiry date.The Spectator’s James Forsyth has written a very good blog with new information abotu what happened at cabinet. Do read the whole thing here, but here’s an excerpt.Penny Mordaunt argued that Brexit was like a plane journey and that people wanted to hear from the pilot at the beginning and the end of the journey and they got worried if they heard from the pilot mid-flight to say that they weren’t going to land when they were expected to. To which, David Mundell— the Scottish secretary — shot back that the passengers would be equally alarmed if they heard that the pilot couldn’t land the plane. To which, Michael Gove — a famously nervous flier — remarked that he always found a gin and tonic helped if that happened. I suspect that all the cabinet might be in need of a drink before the week is out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc487dfc4b1ae6d27ad443170aeeb18aef77255c/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f290d31985bfdbef8b318e14816d589","title":"tell us has your company adopted a living wage policy","story":"We want to hear from readers working for companies paying Living Wage Foundation rates as an increase is announcedStaff of some 4,700 employers who have adopted a voluntary living wage policy are in line for an inflation-beating pay rise.The foundation’s figures are £1.17 higher an hour than the national living wage imposed by the government for workers over the age of 25.

As a young boy dreaming of one day being an All Black you’d lie in bed at night, dreaming of pulling on the shirt and running out at Twickenham, or Cardiff Arms Park – the great stadiums of the world. To be there, to run out on to that pitch, to see everyone eating their cucumber sandwiches in the car park as we drove in, those are great memories.My next time at Twickenham was at the 1991 World Cup. By then I’d played 58 times for my country. We had a pretty experienced team, but for most of us including myself it was the first time we’d played against an Englishman. In those days England were quite different to us, in terms of the way they scrummaged, the way they packed the ruck, the line-outs. So we had to do a lot of specific preparations for that game. We came out on top that day, but by the time I came back again in 1993 England were a different prospect.We were a developing team in those days, with a lot of young players. We’d played all right during that tour, and very well against Scotland the week before, but we lacked a bit of experience. You forget how good England were in those days. We weren’t a very large team and they were a lot bigger than us: Martin Johnson, Ben Clarke, Tim Rodber, these guys would tower over us. They were big, experienced, and we didn’t take our opportunities.We lost 15-9, but that match was a real turning point for us. Looking back now, it was a game that showed us what we needed to do if we were going to be competitive going forward. It hurt at the time, for sure. That day just happened to be the reunion of the 1983 and 1973 teams who had beaten the All Blacks also, so the dinner that night was hard work. But we remembered that, and some of the comments we got that night, and going forward the mantra was, “Remember 93”. The next time we played England was in the semi-finals of the 1995 World Cup, and going into that match we spoke a lot about what happened at Twickenham in 1993. We didn’t lose that one.By the time I got back to Twickenham in 1997 the new West Stand had been built, and I felt that changed the atmosphere a bit. I was the touring captain, but an old knee injury had flared up and I had to sit in the stands as we were lucky to get out of there with a 26-26 draw. It was a new experience, and one I didn’t find easy. I’ve had a lot of practice since, and I’ll be covering this year’s game for Sky – I’m a lot more comfortable now with being a spectator. The crowd was very passionate, very loyal, and these days I enjoy the atmosphere at Twickenham. That was a tour I shouldn’t have come on – I’d had an operation on my knee in June or July and we thought it had come right, but I wasn’t fit enough to play, and that was the end of my international career.When I play golf, my favourite courses are the ones I’ve played well on. It’s the same with rugby: my favourite ground in the world is Loftus Versfeld, because we won a series there. I like grounds where the fans are very close to you, like Newlands or Loftus. I used to love Cardiff Arms. Twickenham’s got some mixed memories for me, but it’s certainly one of the iconic grounds of the world.It’s been an interesting year for the All Blacks. We’ve lost a game, which isn’t normal, but I think the team is in good shape. There is a lot of depth in the squad, and a lot of the young guys have had a lot of Test minutes, which is going to be hugely beneficial at the World Cup next year. You’d like to think the guys will have another win to celebrate at Twickenham this weekend, but with all the new players in the England team it’s hard to know what to expect. As I learned, at Twickenham anything can happen.

After a few years of Lions I was planning a winter off to clear my head. I felt beautiful about that. So I arrived here fresh.” Upon arrival in Colombo he did not however anticipate playing in the first Test. The assumption was that Jos Buttler would take over the keeping duties.But on Monday Joe Root told him he was playing in Galle. “I was quite shocked,” said Foakes. “It was a lovely surprise and a proud moment. It was just an amazing day. You don’t know what to expect. It feels a little bit surreal at the moment. I’m sure when I see family and stuff it will sink in. My brother and my mum booked flights yesterday and are on their way over. I didn’t think I would be playing and nor did they!”On Tuesday as the forecast rain magically drifted elsewhere Foakes drew upon his considerable experience of cricket in Sri Lanka with England Under-19s, the Lions and the local Colts side, where he played alongside Dilruwan Perera and Akila Dananjaya.He was not intimidated by the conditions and he was not going to be critical of those above him in the order. England were 113 for five at lunch and Foakes’ generous take on that was that “the wicket was tacky then. It could have been worse if we had not been so aggressive in the morning. But my game plan is to find the gaps”. Which is what he did expertly through the afternoon and evening sessions.This was a vital innings in the context of this match and the longer-term future of the England side. Such an accomplished performance under pressure has reinvigorated the debate about how England deploy their all-rounders. Foakes’ pedigree as a keeper has never been in doubt. Now in Galle he has given the impression that he is comfortable with the added demands of Test cricket. Assuming he keeps to his usual standard, the case for Foakes to keep possession of his place and the gloves in Kandy and beyond is very strong.Where would this leave Buttler and Bairstow, who at the end of play was the first man to meet Foakes at the boundary rope for a fist bump? They would revert to being specialist batsmen. So if Bairstow is fit for the second Test the selectorial conundrums resume. Unwittingly in two sessions Foakes has added to the creative tension. And that’s a good thing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b726d2af24d82f962252712b7269cd71b1c6c61f/0_37_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39944f5473f814fbdbeeb1356ff851fe","title":"the mysteries review six plays reveal the state of the nation","story":"Royal Exchange, ManchesterFor this earnest but often profound cycle of plays, Chris Thorpe and Sam Pritchard quarried local experience around the UK‘There’s communities – what we have now – and community – what we used to have.” Thus opines a sozzled Ukip-ish councillor in Chris Thorpe’s engaging new state-of-the-nation play cycle. It’s three years since Thorpe and director Sam Pritchard set out on a road trip around England with a copy of the Wakefield Cycle of medieval mystery plays in the boot of their car. That journey – immersing themselves for months in the life of six places – has resulted in this earnest, uneven but often profound cycle of six contemporary plays. This tour has already visited each community portrayed and reaches its climax now at Manchester (population 510,746), a long stretch from Eskdale, Cumbria (population 242). With a little more development, it deserves a longer life.This Mysteries wears its relationship to the medieval tradition lightly, although there’s a pleasing nod in the story of Eskdale’s sheep-farming community to the Wakefield Cycle’s most famous rural subplot, The Second Shepherds’ Play. Instead, this is a modern set of deftly woven secular dramas, all of which urge us to look at the modern landscape around us and ask who owns it.The temptation to reach towards melodrama in aid of an emotive plot results in the least well developed entries. In Whitby, we learn of the suicide of a young man in Boston, the death of a child. But in Staindrop, County Durham, a community still dependent on Raby Castle as a landlord and employer, we watch as ripples spread from a dispute in the castle gift shop: everyday interactions strip bare the fault lines of a millennium of social inequality. I was burning to know how it went down when performed in Staindrop’s Scarth Hall.Thorpe and Pritchard have quarried local myth and language from each stop on the tour designer Rosie Elnile has amassed a selection of talismanic objects. Thus at the start of Eskdale, the uniformly strong cast enact a sheep-shearing with equipment lent by a local farm in Stoke-on-Trent, we enter a modern potters’ workshop scattered with local Stoke pottery. (This play’s handling of alcoholism and homelessness feels naive.) We were also treated to a handbell performance by the members of the impressive Stoke Minster Bell Ringers. After Boston there was a slightly more bemusing appearance by a duo who appeared to be Lincolnshire’s answer to Ali G. But it’s the objects on stage that really root us in locality. At the start of Whitby, a toy-sized fishing trawler is ritually set afloat on a pool of seawater drawn from Whitby harbour. Questions about the dream or danger of Brexit hover, largely unspoken, except when the conversation turns to Whitby’s fishing industry. Thorpe and Pritchard have their eyes set on a much longer-term sweep of history.We start with two women exploring the lines left by a Roman fort in the Eskdale landscape and end with an astonishing oration to the city of Manchester, from multicultural Roman camp to multicultural contemporary community. It is a requiem also to the 22 people killed at Manchester Arena on 22 May 2017, and an empathetic, if occasionally presumptuous, attempt to understand the life of Manchester man Salman Abedi, the bomber who took their lives with his own.All of the six cast members have an ear for verse-speaking, and this is a rich six-part harmony. Unnerving and yet uplifting."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70195c6671441a48137679778f9c1b7f3dd4680c/85_675_5429_3259/master/5429.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e10b88f4dc956a92e7302507a781d12","title":"tea history china chengdu centuries old teahouse sichuan province","story":"This centuries-old teahouse in Sichuan province and its regulars are a world away from China’s modern megacitiesOut in the western suburbs of Sichuan’s capital, Chengdu, the town of Pengzhen is home to what’s said to be the oldest teahouse in China. About 300 years old, the Guanyin Pavilion is at the heart of a tiny community of historic streets where, against a tide of rapid modernisation, the local population proudly preserves its heritage and traditional way of life.“An old proverb goes: ‘In Sichuan you’ll see more teahouses than sunny days’,” Qiang Li, the Pavilion’s manager, tells me as he unlocks a pair of heavy wooden doors. “Even though they can be found on every street corner, none are like this one. This is a yizhu, a hidden pearl.”We step into the bamboo and adobe building and he flicks a switch. A series of lightbulbs come to life, revealing striking communist propaganda splashed across the walls. Fading images of Mao Zedong gaze down, the former leader of the People’s Republic beaming his trademark beneficent smile.“The teahouse has survived centuries of Chinese history as well as the many fires that destroyed the rest of Pengzhen,” Mr Li continues as he lights an old woodstove and loads it with rusting kettles. “It has even escaped the modern developers and their concrete,” he adds with a laugh. “The whole neighbourhood is the same. It’s a piece of the old China that is disappearing everywhere else. Go see for yourself.”Outside, the sun is rising over the buckled terracotta rooftops of Horse Market Street. An old lady shuffles into town in her slippers, her tiny frame laden with foraged roots and leaves. She stops to exchange pleasantries with a vendor setting up a stall of the Chinese delicacy pidan (preserved egg), before heading off in search of customers of her own down the town’s main thoroughfare, Forever Harvest Street.There, in one of Pengzhen’s oldest dwellings, I meet Zhihu Fu who is hanging freshly cut noodles out to dry, like shredded clothes on a washing line. “So much history in China has been knocked down completely, or it’s been rebuilt to look old, but not here,” she says in the courtyard of her centuries-old home, now under a local government preservation order. “The only thing that’s new is the paved road – and that only arrived a year ago.”A local chef, Bin Li, hurries over to buy some bundles of wheat flour mien and I follow him back to his restaurant. “A Heavenly Table” for a breakfast of mapo doufu, which translates as “pock-marked old woman’s tofu”, a Sichuan speciality.“This restaurant was once a communist-run canteen which served free food to the workers,” he says, waving a spoon towards photographs of the former party chairman. “We are not rich people but we have a type of wealth in knowing our past”, he says. “That’s rare in China. No matter what we think of what went before, we like to cherish it.”At the next table I chat with a man who is visiting from distant Xi’an, China’s Imperial capital for 11 dynasties. “Here, there’s a different kind of history on display,” he says. “The attraction is not in grand temples or museums but simple, everyday life. You don’t learn the history of emperors here, instead the stories of ordinary people.”I continue to the junction with Chicken Market Street, where I’m introduced to the local doctor, Qingyuan Xu, a man with a captivating, toothless grin and fingers disconcertingly wrapped in yellowing bandages, the result of an accidental knife wound.“I recently cured my wife of leukaemia,” he says, as if to reassure me of his credentials, “using a tincture made from the hoods of cobra snakes”. Restored to good health, Mrs Xu joins us and promptly lights up a celebratory cigarette.Qingyuan, 78, began studying traditional medicine at the age of eight under the tutelage of Master Liu, one of the physicians to Chiang Kai-shek, the former Chinese leader who was ousted by the communists and forced to flee to Taiwan. “All lives, even humble ones, are touched by the greatest milestones of history”, he says.I loop back to the teahouse where mid-morning sunlight is now pouring through holes in the roof. Old men sit in lonely silence, staring into the distance as if mesmerised by the puffs of Thermos steam and cigarette smoke sailing up into the rafters.In one corner I see a young woman taking photographs of an antique ceramic. The figurine portrays a landlord forced to his knees by students, his arms tied in preparation for torture, a dunce’s hat denouncing him as evil and worthy of death. “There are things here from the old China which we don’t get taught in school,” she tells me in a guarded whisper.“This teashop, this neighbourhood, they don’t look anything like the modern China I know,” she adds. “I’m from Guangzhou and in the big cities we don’t get many opportunities to experience the past but here you can literally feel it – it’s like history has come back to life.”• Guanyin Pavilion Old Tea House, 23 Mashiba Street, Pengzhen Town, Shuangliu District, Chengdu. Pengzhen is off the tourist trail so it’s best to take a cab. A ride from central Chengdu using Didi Chuxing (Chinese version of Uber, available in an English-language version) takes around 45-60 minutes and costs from £10 one-way.

The key question in these elections is: will Republicans be able to keep control of both chambers of Congress?Historically, the party of the president has lost seats in the House of Representatives in midterm elections. In 2010, two years after Barack Obama was first elected, Democrats lost 63 seats in the House.But polling suggests Democrats are unlikely to win the Senate – and may even lose seats.As well as a potential late-night Trump Twitter meltdown, there’s plenty more to watch out for on Tuesday. More women are running in the midterm elections than ever before, and three states could elect African American governors for the first time.Most polling places will close between 7pm ET and 11pm ET. But in Alaska and Hawaii most will shut at midnight ET. Of the states with earlier closures, Florida, Pennsylvania and New York have a number of House seats which Democrats consider winnable.Early – as soon as the polls close. But remember 2016?  Once convinced a Democrat is going to win, twice shy. So it’s best to wait until actual results come in.It won’t be straight away. The size of some states, the high number of absentee ballots, the predicted high turnout at the polls, and the expected closeness of some of the races all mean that many results won’t come out until the small hours of Wednesday morning at the earliest.But given that some key districts should be called relatively early in the evening, we could have an idea of who will control the House by midnight. In the 2014 midterms the Associated Press called the Senate for the GOP at 11.25pm.That means there is likely to be a tense wait before we know who will control the House, in particular, for the next two years. will be live-blogging all night and throughout the next day.

Of the cable channels, CNN and MSNBC will have chin-stroking gurus poring over maps of the US, while Fox News will boast typically considered coverage featuring Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham.As of Friday the Cook Political report rated 17 Republican-held seats as likely to flip to the Democratic party, or leaning towards the Democrats.Some of the races attracting attention include Sharice Davids, a Kansas lawyer and former MMA fighter, who would become one of the first Native American women elected to Congress. (Deb Haaland, who is also Native American, could win election in New Mexico.) In New York’s 19th district Republican incumbent John Faso is running neck-and-neck in the polls with Antonio Delgado. The campaign has been marked with racist overtones, as GOP groups have used loaded attacks against Delgado, who is African American, over his former rap career.Steve King, a long-serving Iowa Republican, could lose his re-election bid. King, known for his inflammatory beliefs and statements, has plunged in the polls as attention has been drawn to his relationships with European far-right parties and endorsement of politicians with ties to neo-Nazi groups.Republicans have their eyes on Montana’s Jon Tester, a former farmer, in a state which Trump won by 20 points in 2016. Heidi Heitkamp, Democratic senator for North Dakota, is also vulnerable.Many are following Democrat Beto O’Rourke in Texas, who is hoping to oust Republican Ted Cruz – a 2016 presidential candidate – from the Senate. O’Rourke has drawn large crowds, and plenty of press attention, but is running behind Cruz in the traditionally red state.If elected, Stacey Abrams, Andrew Gillum and Ben Jealous would become the first African American governors of Georgia, Florida and Maryland.Abrams and Gillum, who has faced racially charged comments from his opponent, are in tight races, while Jealous – a progressive backed by Bernie Sanders – looks to be more of a long shot.In Vermont, the Democratic candidate Christine Hallquist would become the first ever transgender governor if she defeats Phil Scott, but is behind in polling."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c93bef73695234ce796ef5700b8e44d6b053f989/0_94_4302_2581/master/4302.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9eff133305a96fdda5f72fb60e2e6bd","title":"vote for our lives youth midterm elections nra","story":"Student activists plan national high school ‘Walkout to Vote’ as NRA spending has fallen significantlyNine months after a school shooting in Florida sparked a series of nationwide protests, there are signs that Tuesday’s election could bring a substantial jump in youth voter participation, as the National Rifle Association’s election spending has dropped dramatically.Student survivors of the February shooting in Parkland, Florida, which left 17 students and teachers dead, have spent months visiting districts across the country with a simple message: “Vote for our lives.”The Parkland students and their high school allies across the country have attempted to make the midterm elections a referendum on Congress and its refusal to pass stricter gun control laws. By increasing youth participation, they argue, young people can vote out the Republican politicians who have blocked any additional gun control laws at the federal level for nearly a quarter century, even as mass shootings have grown more frequent and more deadly.A coalition of youth groups is organizing a national high school “Walkout to Vote” at 10am on Tuesday morning, with at least 500 schools expected to participate, according to Katie Elders, one of the event’s organizers.“Tomorrow, if you haven’t already voted, is your chance to be a hero for yourself and everyone you love,” Emma Gonzalez said.The 18-year-old Parkland student, who became an international icon for her passionate speeches against the National Rifle Association and government inaction on gun violence, was speaking at a small press conference in Florida’s capital on Monday.“Gun violence is on the ballot. Our lives are in the hands of the people we elect. Vote in every election like it’s your last, because it very well could be,” Gonzalez said.“We’re seeing many signs and signals that this is a very different midterm election when it comes to youth engagement,” said Abby Kiesa, the director of impact at Circle.The National Rifle Association is pouring money into a handful of Senate races, but its overall spending has dropped dramatically compared with 2014. NRA spending so far is just under $10m to support pro-gun candidates, compared with more than $25m in 2014, according to federal election data compiled by the Trace, a not-for-profit news site focused on gun violence."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d222f03f8c511a9c46aa7f4ed4fd4ce8648a8f6/0_150_3775_2265/master/3775.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d02ad646fa6db55d799abfae3828ed3","title":"are you voting in the 2018 us midterm elections tell us about it","story":"On 6 November we’d like to know what the atmosphere is like where you live.

In week five of his blog,  Alexi Duggins finds out how to meet, greet and mean it Fifteen years ago, I had the worst job interview of my life. For two excruciating hours, I was subjected to brutal The Apprentice-style grilling. Management jargon was fired like bullets as my (admittedly misguided) dream of a career in graduate recruitment was reduced to smoking rubble.Then, as I turned to leave, it got personal: “I’ll be honest with you. You need a haircut if you want even the slightest chance of working here. Your hairstyle doesn’t create a good first impression.”I shook his hand and turned to the door. “Actually,” he added, “you should get a better handshake as well.”While it’s been a good few years since that moment, when I watch  Labs and Philips’ video about creating a stonking first impression, I do wonder, could mine still do with some work? Particularly as, in just under a week, I have a big meeting with a potential client, where it’s essential that I impress.Hmm … I decide to spend the next few days trialling the video’s advice.MondayLooking at my schedule for today, it seems unlikely that I’m going to have the opportunity to make any first impressions at all, unless my weekly night of wedding admin suddenly turns out to be a ticket to a crunk party.So my best option to impress new people seems to be the tube. I decide to start with the simplest piece of advice in the video: “Smile!” and I try beaming at passengers who catch my eye. Largely, this seems to have the opposite of its intended effect, as people quickly glance downward on making eye contact.The exception is one suited 40-something who returns my smile and holds eye contact for so long that it occurs to me that my fiancee would definitely not be happy to hear about this experience. I realise that perhaps what I have actually managed is something more like flirting, and suspend my efforts for the day.TuesdaySmile now toned down to more platonic levels, I beam at a middle-aged woman I pass on the street near my office. She stops me in my tracks. “Do you know, you’re the first friendly face I’ve seen today? I’ve just moved here from Guernsey and people are just so much less welcoming!” For the next 15 minutes, she opens up about what island life is like, the things that make London bearable and her pride at recently becoming a grandmotherunpaid babysitter (her reason for moving here). Safe to say that I’ve made a good impression and, frankly, it’s lovely. Although I am now very late for work.WednesdayNo smiling at people today. I can’t afford to be late for work again. But I now only have two days until my big client meeting, so I test out my handshake when one of my fiancee’s friends comes over to pick up a dress. “It’s good!” she smiles with relief when I press her for a verdict. “You’re saying hello and you mean it!”This is a weight off my mind, given the job interview feedback. It also sounds like I’m following the video’s advice to ensure you keep your handshake firm. “Although saying that, I guess I don’t like strong, alpha male handshakes,” she finishes. Hmm, perhaps there is work to do.Thursday“Ow! You’re not Donald Trump!” replies one of my friends as I test out my new improved, extra-firm handshake on him in the pub. “Ooh no, too limp: bit creepy,” offers another as I try relaxing it. “Fine, but what’s up with your face? You’re concentrating so hard you look constipated!” says another. I’m tempted to yell: “I have a big meeting tomorrow, I need to get this right!”But instead, I cast all thoughts from my mind and just do my normal handshake. “Good. Firm, but not too firm. Do that in future.” Maybe my handshake was OK after all.FridayIt’s the day of judgment. As my smile has proved capable of generating new friends, I decide to do more of that. I also choose to just go with my natural handshake, spiced up with other tips from the video, like saying: “Great to meet you!” (Even if the thought makes me feel like a happy-clappy customer greeter at Disneyland.)And it goes really well. Everyone smiles. No winces from my handshake. And when I uttered my greeting, every single one of them also replied: “Great to meet you!” In fact, they did it so naturally that it made me realise that the rest of the world clearly does this every time they meet another human being. I’ve been missing out.As I leave, a colleague turns to me: “I think that went really well!” And, frankly, so do I: way better than my meetings normally do.As I head off, I realise that this advice has been thoroughly useful. While there have been points where it’s gone a bit off the rails, they were when I was trying too hard, rather than acting natural. Making a good impression definitely involves a bit of smiling, eye contact and cheerful greeting. But there’s something even more important than that. You’ve got to be pretty hip-hop about it. You’ve also got to keep it real.Do what feels right with Philips: whether that’s finding your inner confidence or a grooming routine that works for you.

Journalist and podcaster  Jimi Famurewa reviews his journey through fashion faux pas to stylish gentWhen I think of the questionable fashion choices that litter my past – the time I sported two bumbags as a 10-year-old, the roomy skater jeans I liked to wear halfway down my backside, that summer when I really, really got into leather wrist cuffs and backpacker-ish beads – there is one ill-advised look that always sticks out. In fact, among some of my oldest friends, it has almost taken on a mythic quality: a folkloric garment shrouded in legend and whispered rumour.It would have been around the late 90s and, as a 16-year-old, I had successfully badgered my mum into getting me a pair of wincingly tight, metallic silver jeans from the Littlewoods catalogue. I looked, in my eyes, incredible. Bold. Vaguely futuristic. And it was only when I saw my kind friend Chris’s gaping, faintly horrified expression – having risked a split crotch by sprinting to catch the bus for a night out – that I thought something might be up. “Jesus,” he said, unable to mask his disbelief, “you look like the Tin Man.”Despite the evidence to the contrary in this story, I’ve always thought of myself as, mostly, quite an assured dresser. I was lucky enough to have two innately stylish older brothers who provided useful visual guidance, stacks of style-minded men’s magazines, plus whatever clothes I could sneakily liberate from their bedrooms.This fortune gave me the confidence, as a tween, to chafe ever-so-slightly against the “Ben Sherman and Reebok Classics” hegemony of the time. Having siblings who were willing to take risks with their look basically meant that (the odd clanger notwithstanding), I always understood that there was nothing wrong with experimenting a little bit.But there’s something about climbing to the figurative base camp of your mid-30s, as I have now, that makes you reappraise everything that has come before. Obviously these days, men’s fashion has never been a bigger or more varied industry – in June, Euromonitor was the latest market researcher to find that it is growing at a faster rate than women’s fashion. But, squinting warily at old pictures on Facebook, I can’t help but wonder if my unabashed interest in cultivating a personal style occasionally manifested as, well, misguided overconfidence.Trends and personal phases are partially to blame, of course. Midway through my teenage years I became a skateboarder and soon found myself weighed down by enormous hoodies, baseball caps and chunky scuffed-up trainers. This gave way to the UK garage years – tight Reiss T-shirts, tighter jeans and Patrick Cox loafers worn without socks – which slowly evolved into a more casual university look with looser, paint-spattered Diesel jeans, clunky statement belts and, at one point, a thoughtlessly grabbed vintage T-shirt that looked like it said “IRA” on the back.Grooming-wise, this was also the time that – save one turn-of-the-millennium night when I briefly twisted my hair into little Craig David-style buds – I started to tweak the neatly trimmed look I’d had since my double-bumbag days. As I emerged from university (and increasingly frequented sticky-floored indie club nights), I grew my hair out into a kind of knotted demi-fro that was heavily indebted to (read: shamelessly stolen from) Bloc Party frontman Kele Okereke.It’s here that I think my life as something of a charity-shop peacock truly began. I lived in winklepickers, tweedy blazers, pocket squares, deliberately moth-eaten, plunge-neck T-shirts and jeans so skinny they often ripped if I overdid it on the dance floor. There was a cherished, patterned cravat that I’m pretty sure I found on the floor outside a house party.In isolation (and the context of the guitar-mad mid-noughties), there was nothing wrong with any of this. But it was just all too much. The volume was up way too high. In thrall to a certain scene or look, I had surrendered all subtlety and true iniduality in favour of a kind of box-ticking maximalism.So how did I shed those fussy adornments and arrive at the quieter, workwear-focused uniform I tend to employ today? Well, fatherhood – which brings with it clothes that are often accidentally accessorised with a smear of mashed-up food – has definitely made my taste more utilitarian and less prissy. Taking inspiration from well turned-out colleagues in their 40s – all turned-up selvedge denim (finished with tightly woven bands) and Red Wing boots – certainly helped. And, in swapping Albam chore jackets for All Saints blazers, I’m certainly broadly in line with the times.But I think, more than all that, it’s the hard-won self-knowledge that can only come with age. Rather than swinging wildly from one trend to the next, I’ve found a groove that suits and reflects me. I no longer feel vaguely deficient if my look doesn’t neatly conform with what’s on a particular shop mannequin or musician or off-duty footballer. My hair has morphed into a low-maintenance, ragged low-top and I let my beard grow out when the mood strikes me. I invest in quality key pieces – slouchy shirts, Breton-style tees, go-with-anything white trainers – rather than haphazardly splurging on youthful fast fashion wheezes.The clothes, as per the often misattributed Mark Twain quote, do not actually make the man. It’s the other way around. And as soon as you understand that, well, you might even be able to pull off a pair of shiny silver jeans.Do what feels right with Philips: whether that’s finding your own style or finding a grooming routine that works for you.

It called on Beijing to release detained Uighurs and other Muslim minorities, protect religious freedoms in Tibet, and stop harassing and detaining human rights lawyers.Activists say as many as a million Muslims have been arbitrarily detained in internment camps in Xinjiang, where they are forced to undergo political indoctrination.“We will not accept the politically driven accusations from a few countries that are fraught with biases, with total disregard for facts,” said vice foreign minister Le Yucheng. “No country shall dictate the definition of democracy and human rights,” he said.Tuesday’s half-day UN panel, which included brief comments from more than 100 UN member states and responses from China, highlighted the range of human rights issues raised by advocates. While some states praised Beijing’s progress on human rights, others issued harsher statements.“Overall, we are concerned about the broader deterioration of human rights in China since the last universal periodic review,” said Tamara Mawhinney, Canada’s deputy permanent representative at the UN.Germany called on China to “end all unlawful detentions in Xinjiang,” while Iceland and Japan expressed concern about the rights of minorities in Xinjiang. Several states urged China allow UN observers into Xinjiang. The US called on China to abolish all internment camps in the far western territory and release the “possibly millions” detained there.Chinese delegates said internment centres were not re-education camps but vocational centres that offered free training in the law, language, and workplace skills.Trainees sign agreements and receive diplomas after their course, according to Yasheng Sidkie, the vice mayor of Urumqi. “Xinjiang is a nice place. I’d like to say, welcome to Xinjiang,” he said.Spending on security-related construction doubled in 2017 in Xinjiang, an academic analysis of government expenditure found on Monday.Chinese officials reiterated earlier claims that the policies in Xinjiang were within the law.“China is citing its own domestic laws to legitimise the camp system,” said Peter Irwin, program manager for the World Uyghur Congress. “Citing domestic legislation is meaningless if the legislation itself contradicts these clearly accepted human rights norms,.”UN members, including the US, urged China to free lawyers such as Wang Quanzhang, who disappeared after a police raid in 2015 Tashi Wangchuk, who was sentenced to five years in prison for promoting the Tibetan language and the Uighur activist Ilham Tohti.In response to criticism about the treatment of human rights lawyers, the Chinese delegation said the law protected lawyers, but those who break the law must be held accountable. The arrests did not constitute the “repression of so-called human rights lawyers”, one delegate said.Outside the UN headquarters in Geneva, protesters organised by the World Uyghur Congress and other NGOs demonstrated against China’s policies in Xinjiang.Countries that commended China’s progress on human rights included its alliesNorth Korea, Syria, Cambodia, Cuba, Kenya, Namibia, and South Africa.Frances Eve, a researcher for Chinese Human Rights Defenders, said: “China has always used its economic muscle to ensure friendly treatment by fellow states, but it was surprising to hear a few countries actual speak in support of China’s efforts to change the international system to suit its anti-human rights agenda.”During the review process, China also defended its encroachment on freedoms in Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China that is given a high level of autonomy under the “one country two systems” arrangement.An art exhibit featuring a dissident political cartoonist was cancelled this week. In October, a Financial Times journalist was expelled after the correspondents’ association he headed hosted an event by a banned pro-independence party leader.“Like any other jurisdiction, such freedom is not absolute,” the Chinese delegation said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f05bb82a5e1577a8924e7eaf9d3ce333540e804/0_14_4676_2806/master/4676.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8a0d22608860a9fc948aae7b449e64a","title":"the kindertransport children 80 years on we thought we were going on an adventure","story":"In 1938, the first of the Jewish Kindertransport children evacuated from Nazi Germany arrived in Britain. This week, we’re publishing the stories of six of those refugees, beginning here with Bob and Ann KirkFriday is the 80th anniversary of Kristallnacht – the Night of Broken Glass. The pogrom of 9 November 1938 in Nazi Germany demonstrated to the Jewish population their lives were in urgent danger and that they must leave if they could. But where to go? Other countries were reluctant to take refugees and adults were finding it increasingly difficult to get out, so Jewish organisations in Germany, Europe and the US attempted to get children out, persuading governments to take child refugees on temporary visas.Ten thousand came to the UK, on trains and boats organised by Jewish groups and other philanthropic organisations. This week, an exhibition opens at the Jewish Museum in London featuring the stories of six of the children who came to the UK from Germany as part of this rescue effort, which came to be known as the Kindertransport. The six are now in their 80s and 90s, and have made short films recounting their experiences.I visited each of them in their homes and heard their remarkable, moving, often tragic testimonies. Some never saw their parents again all suffered the pain of separation some were so traumatised they couldn’t speak of what had happened to them for decades afterwards – not even to their children. But in each the light of defiance, humour and commitment to life shines through. And each now goes into schools to talk to young people about what they and their parents suffered, testifying both as an act of remembrance towards their parents but also as a warning to the next generation that intolerance, hatred and scapegoating of minorities are ever-present threats.Bob Kirk was given his sharp, pointedly British name by a Scottish captain when he joined the army towards the end of the war. His real name is Rudolf Kirchheimer. Is there any of Rudolf Kirchheimer left? “I suppose there must be somewhere,” he says.Kirk’s father owned a textile warehouse in Hanover, in northern Germany. In the years before Hitler came to power in 1933, Kirk enjoyed idyllic family outings with his parents, brother and sister, who was 12 years older. His father had won the iron cross in the first world war and was proudly German. He was also close to 60 and reluctant to leave Germany.Kirk’s sister left Germany in 1936, moving first to South Africa to work. She got married there, and then went to Brazil, where she and her husband lived for the rest of their lives. Kirk only met his sister again in 1981. His brother, who was two years older, went to the UK in February 1939 on a training work permit. His parents then put their remaining child down for a Kindertransport, and he left, just before his 14th birthday, in May 1939.“I didn’t really know where I was going,” he recalls. “There were about 200 children on that transport, and we were all, to say the least, a bit nervous. You are concerned, excited, and most of us were sold the idea that we were going on an adventure, and that, of course, our parents would be coming as soon as they got their papers.” He was carrying his small regulation suitcase, and had his stamp collection confiscated by Nazis at the Dutch border. He carried no family photos or memorabilia. “My parents were so intent on not making it seem like a parting that they didn’t include anything which might suggest we wouldn’t see each other again.”As they parted, his parents told him to be a good boy and that they would see him soon. But he never saw them again. Kirk went back to Hanover in 1949 and discovered that they had been transported to Riga in December 1941 and never returned. He also visited his father’s old textile business and found two of his father’s former employees now running it. He recalls them being far from pleased to see him. He would have reclaimed his father’s business if he could, but when he visited his father’s former bank they told him all its old records had been destroyed in the allied bombing.Kirk says he lost almost 20 family members in the Holocaust. How, I ask him, did he cope with the pain? “With difficulty,” he says. “It’s not something where you say: ‘I’ve got to get over this.’ You just live with it and, eventually, you assimilate it. I never felt guilty about surviving. I felt tremendous gratitude to my parents for their courage. All the parents who allowed their children to go showed tremendous courage.”After being demobbed from the army, Kirk trained as a bookkeeper and did well, rising to the position of company secretary in a textile company – a neat link with his father’s old line of work. In the late 1940s he met the former Hannah Kuhn (who became Ann Kirk after their marriage in 1950), another Jewish refugee from Germany, who came to the UK on a Kindertransport in April 1939.The Kirks say they found great solace in being able to talk to each other about their experiences, but they didn’t talk to their sons about what they had been through, wanting them to “have as normal a life as possible and not burden them with our history”. One son did not hear their full stories until they gave a talk at the local synagogue in 1992. Bob refers to “40-year syndrome” – the time it took for Holocaust survivors to start opening up about their lives and for other people to be willing to listen.Ann, an only child who grew up in Cologne, also lost her parents. Her father was musical and used to play chamber music with friends in their large flat even now she says she finds music for the cello, her father’s instrument, hard to listen to without weeping. Her parents had a boat, and she says weekend journeys on the Rhine with them are still her “treasured memories, coming back at sunset with a view of the bridge and the cathedral – Cologne was lovely”.Her recollection of leaving her parents to board the Kindertransport – by this time they had moved to a much smaller flat near Berlin – are deeply affecting. “Everyone around us was in tears,” she recalls, “but my dad tried to joke about it. I was going on a big adventure. What a wonderful chance for a little girl to have. Then they must have jumped into a taxi to get to the next station but one, and there they were waving – waving until their hands almost dropped off, and that’s the last sight I ever had of them.”She received frequent letters from them before the outbreak of war in September 1939, and then a Red Cross message from her father to her foster family – two middle-aged, unmarried Jewish sisters in Finchley, north London – saying that his wife had been deported in December 1942. The following February, she received a further message saying he was well and healthy, and was pleased to hear that she was progressing well in Britain. She later learned he was deported a few days after that message, and many years later she discovered they had both perished in Auschwitz.“It’s an additional grief that they didn’t even go together,” she says. “What my poor dad was going through what they both must have gone through. Thanks to the courage and wisdom of my parents and the goodness of the two ladies who looked after me, I am here. The educational work I do now is in part a memorial to my parents. Their memory lives on and they are not forgotten.” I ask her for their names – Herte and Franz Kuhn.

Impending disaster is painfully apparent and yet, time and again, councillors willingly and wilfully hurl themselves lemming-like over cliffs to lose their limited powers in the ravine at the bottom.In 2001, councillors – all councillors not just Dublin ones – lost their powers over waste collection and disposal, following their failure to ratify plans for waste disposal facilities, or any form of waste charging. As a result this power was transferred to council management, hugely unpopular bin charges were introduced, and the Poolbeg incinerator, which all parties opposed, was built.More recently, the failure to agree a route for the Liffey cycle path, which had been six years in the planning, resulted in the scheme being removed from the control of Dublin City Council and handed over to the National Transport Authority.In this case it wasn’t just the councillors (who couldn’t agree traffic ersions past their constituents’ houses) who were to blame, but also council officials, who produced endless iterations of the scheme, one of which saw double-decker buses rerouted through an existing apartment block.The most recent, and one of the most damning failures or officialdom to get to grips with decision making, is the College Green plaza refusal farce. The council tip-toed around the issue for a decade, tinkering with selective traffic restrictions, musing over fountains and statuary, but never really grasping the problem, which required getting buy-in from Dublin Bus before the project went to An Bord Pleanála for approval – a step which itself should have been taken years before.Surely there’s a better way of getting things done in the city. Could this dithering, bottling, buck-passing and procrastination be solved by Dublin having a directly elected mayor?“The central power, the most important point, of having a directly elected mayor, is that they have a ‘bully pulpit’,” Dr Deiric Ó Broin, DIT academic and co-author of the upcoming book Mayoral Governance in Dublin, argues.“The elected role gives them the authority to argue for more investment in the city, for keeping a more appropriate share of the money generated in Dublin. And they have to deliver their job is on the line. If they don’t deliver they may not be re-elected. That concentrates minds.”However, the concept of a mayor is one thing, the reality of the role and its functions is quite another, Ó Broin says.“The big issue is what powers the mayor would have and where would they come from. There is no point if the mayor is just a lord mayor, as in they have significant ceremonial but minor functional role, but who lasts for a five-year term.”Dublin city chief executive Owen Keegan agrees. “If it is to be successful the directly elected mayor has to have real powers, but he or she can only have real powers where the powers are taken from somewhere else. This notion that there’s some unallocated power that you can give to the mayor has no basis in reality – all power is already allocated.”And there isn’t much power within the hands of the council to give to a new mayor, Keegan says. “Since local government is weak here, the power and functions would have to come from central government, and that is a real issue because if there’s a directly elected mayor who is responsible for energy, and communications and transport in Dublin it doesn’t leave very much for the central Government to do.”Another vexing issue is what physical area would be governed by the mayor. “Culturally and politically we are obsessed with counties and county boundaries. I could see an argument for a city-only directly elected mayor and that gets away from that problem, but I don’t see how a city-based mayor could have responsibility for transport in Dublin, which crosses local authority boundaries,” Ó Broin says.This issue of boundaries played a large part in the collapse of the last mayoral plan. In 2013, then minister for the environment Phil Hogan decided, despite there being no legal requirement, that the councillors in all four Dublin local authorities would have to be in favour before Dubliners would get a chance to vote in a plebiscite on whether or not to have a mayor.The following year Dublin City, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, and South Dublin voted overwhelmingly in favour of the proposal but it was vetoed by Fingal, whose councillors felt they would be the poor country cousins, largely ignored by a city-focused mayor who would only be after their airport.As Gerry McGuire, a Labour councillor at the time, said there would be “no chance of getting a pothole fixed in rural Fingal”.Hogan showing great fortitude in keeping a straight face said he was “disappointed” as he was “the greatest proponent of devolution probably in the history of the State”.Last year the Government revived the mayoral proposal, making provision for a plebiscite this year, but it has recently kicked the can down the road, and kicked it out of the capital, determining that regional cities would vote at next year’s local elections on whether to have a mayor, but in Dublin it would first be referred to a citizens’ assembly for the capital.It seems like another unnecessary hurdle given that a similar forum spent five months formulating proposals for the mayor’s role in 2013, and, at that time surveys showed public support for a Dublin mayor was up to 80 per cent.Even if Dublin does get a mayor, what the Government appears to be proposing is a toothless role, either a mayor with the same powers as the current lord mayor, except elected, or an “executive mayor” who would take on some of the functions of the council chief executive.A plebiscite to decide whether there should be a mayor is unnecessary, Lacey says. “If the Government is serious about making progress let them legislate for it now. There is no need for a plebiscite. Successive governments never sought permission as they systematically dismantled local government in the past, so let them just repair it.”However, Lacey does not believe it’s necessary that the mayor would be all-powerful from the outset. “Calling for the full range of powers to be set out in advance is misguided. This is a position and a role that needs to be established and then given space to evolve.”But he says he can see particular areas where a mayor could make achievements straight away which might seem minor, but would be significant.“A mayor could initially have responsibility for natural resources. For example there isn’t much point in Dublin City Council cleaning the river Dodder in Donnybrook, if it’s not being cleaned first in Tallaght. Or sports capital grants – it makes no sense for a civil servant sitting in an office in Kerry to decide what local sports organisation in Dublin gets a grant.”Then, he suggests, other powers could be added such as waste and traffic policy, which should be “brought back under control of the council anyway”, he said.Ó Broin cites the system in Copenhagen as one where the mayor having control of these services works well. “The mayor has responsibility for education, welfare, labour services, welfare, climate change and a range of municipal services – Denmark, and Scandinavian countries in general, have very good, empowered local government.”Further afield, Boston and Toronto are recognised as good examples of mayor-led cities, he says. While our nearest neighbours have had some successful mayors, in some British cities, including Stoke-on-Trent, they have scrapped the office.The London model, Lacey believes, is not the system that should be copied in Dublin. “I don’t think the London model is a good one, with an all powerful mayor and a fairly toothless assembly. I’d like to a see a mayor working in partnership with a much smaller council – 24 or even 18 councillors. We should reduce the four councils to a manageable size, and give them more responsibility.”Keegan thinks the London model has worked well, particularly in relation to the mayor’s transport and policing supervisory functions, but he is with Lacey on the reducing in numbers of councillors from the current 63 in the city.“I am impressed by cities that have a small number of full-time councillors. In many cases they have executive functions. I think these councils, with a large number of councillors, make everything very difficult. Dublin City Council is too large. We are twinned with San Jose, where there’s a mayor, and I think they have eight or nine council members.”Keegan, however, remains unconvinced of the merits of having a mayor in Dublin. “I am a little bit concerned that the next ‘big idea’ is the directly elected mayor, and we’ll all lorry into that with great enthusiasm, but I have seen very little convincing analysis as to why this is such a good idea.“It’s been presented as a panacea to everything that’s wrong in Dublin, that will automatically be made right the day after we have a directly elected mayor.”Dublin doesn’t get credit for its success he says. “I don’t accept the notion that Dublin is a basket case. On many parameters Dublin is a very successful city. A good litmus test is the multinationals. They come here because they can attract people to live here. Of course it has problems with transport, and housing but these are problems of success. There was no housing affordability problem when we were in the depths of recession.”The “mad rush” towards the directly elected mayor idea reminds him of the “mad rush” to set up Irish Water. “Water supply was and is a major challenge but there was a notion that if you set up a separate utility everything would be hunky dory, but its implementation left a lot to be desired.”If the implementation of the mayor is poor, Dublin could find itself losing more than it gains, Keegan says.“There are strong arguments for a directly elected mayor, and I’m not saying there isn’t scope for improvement in the city’s governance, but there is a danger if we rush into this it won’t achieve any of its objectives, we’ll lose the things that work, and we’ll be worse off.”Each of the proposals in this Capital Ideas series has been put to a group of three experts for an initial “back of an envelope” evaluation. They are: Frances Ruane, former director of the Economic and Social Research Institute Caroline Spillane, director general of Engineers Ireland and Cliff Taylor, economics columnist with The .Caroline Spillane I have reservations about this plan, particularly due to the size of Dublin relative to the country as a whole. One person would have responsibility for 40 per cent of our population. The powers of this office would need to be carefully defined.The proposed mayor would be in a position of power for only five years, which could lead to short-term thinking.Cliff Taylor This proposal has surfaced in various forms over the years and fits into a common theme that restructuring institutions or posts can fix problems. This could be a good idea, but the job spec, powers and budget are key. The benefit depends on how it is structured – and who is elected, of course.It is a useful proposal but to work it requires a new vision for local government, something talked about for years and years but never delivered.Frances Ruane Cities with elected mayors seem to work well. However, in Ireland, this would have to be set up as part of a rebalancing of central and local government, if it is to work. If the city itself does not have decision-making power, then adding a mayor will not solve the problem.Meanwhile, Dublin City Council should work on its governance and adopt an integrated problem-solving planning approach. This must involve all four authorities working together. That would involve no serious resource costs.How can we improve Dublin city\u0026rsquos infrastructure, services and daily life?

Savour that moment because this may well be the very last time this particular ritual will ever happen.If all goes according to a plan laid out by the European Commission, the last-ever mandatory clock change in the European Union will take place in 2019. Member states must notify the commission by April of next year on whether they want to opt for permanent summer or permanent winter time. Whether all 27 states are prepared to go along, however, is not yet clear.This weekend, the Department of Justice (which has responsibility for everything to do with timekeeping) is announcing plans for its public consultation here on the proposal.A recent European Commission online public consultation across the EU found 84 per cent of citizens were in favour of ending the changing of clocks in spring and autumn.The commission trumpeted the fact that it had got 4.6 million responses, the highest number ever received in an exercise of this sort, and that 84 per cent of those backed the change to a single year-round time.Less loudly advertised was the fact that engagement varied significantly from country to country three million of those responses came from Germany, representing almost 4 per cent of that country’s population. In contrast, less than 0.25 per cent of Irish people bothered to respond.The question now is whether inidual member states will agree to proceed along the lines advocated by the commission, which has stated a preference for summer time to be applied universally. There is potential for chaos, with a patchwork of time zones emerging across continental Europe.Initial polling, for example, suggests people in the Netherlands and Denmark would prefer permanent winter time, while Germans want summer time.“We are not proposing that the whole EU either switches to summer or winter time,” said transport commissioner Violeta Bulc at a press conference last month. “All we are proposing is that we do it together.”But clock-switching on the Dutch-German border is hardly the desired outcome.An intriguing twist from the Irish perspective is whether the UK, at a moment of heightened political tension, will view this as a symbolic opportunity to flaunt its newly acquired independence.Brexiteers’ enthusiasm for such a stance may be dimmed when they realise it would mean Britain sharing a time zone with Brussels and Berlin for almost half the year.But understandably, media coverage here so far has focused on the prospect of travellers from Dundalk to Newry having to adjust their watches – or of people nipping across from Lifford to Strabane in search of an extra hour’s drinking time.For geographical and historical reasons, Ireland and the UK have been on the same clock since Dublin Time was abolished in the wake of the Rising in 1916.We moved in lockstep with the UK when it experimented with year-round summer time in the late 1960s, and any recent proposals for change, such as one mooted in a Private Members’ Bill rejected by then minister for justice Alan Shatter in 2013, have been contingent on decisions made at Westminster and, more recently, in Brussels.So what would the changes mean? If Ireland opts for year-round daylight-saving\u0026nbsptime, then dawn won’t break in the west of Ireland until almost 10am in mid-December. However, if “winter time” is maintained throughout the year, sunrise in Dublin will occur well before 4am in June, and the stretch in the evenings will be a lot less grand, with sunset happening before 9pm even in midsummer.Those are the extremes, but where permanent summer time offers real gains is in the “shoulder months” of November, February and March, when the majority of people will have much more daylight at the end of their school or working day without too much negative impact in the mornings.There has been a broad attempt across the world in recent decades to do away with annual time-shifts, based on data about their negative health effects and on a more general sense that an additional hour of daylight in the evening is more valuable than one in the morning.Meanwhile, the main rationale for the current system – reduced electricity usage – has been rendered less important by the introduction in recent years of energy-efficient electric lighting. Lifestyles have also changed enormously since the current system’s introduction a century ago, and even since the last experimental change 50 years ago.Flexible working time, increased leisure opportunities and longer retail opening hours all have an effect on how we spend our day.The main impediment to change, it seems, is institutional. In the US, legislators in California and other states are also pushing for year-round daylight-saving\u0026nbsptime, but they need to persuade the federal government before they can proceed. As in the EU, American legislation allows each state to decide its time zone but forbids inidual states from choosing when or if to change their seasonal clocks. Whether the gridlocked US political system can respond remains to be seen.Here, the Department of Justice’s public consultation asks three questions. Do you want to stop changing the clocks twice a year? If the clock changes stop, do you want to remain on summer time or winter time? Is staying on the same time as the UK more important than your choice of summertimewintertime?“It is very important that as many citizens as possible respond to this consultation and express their views so that the Government may take account of public opinion when considering this proposal by the EU,” says Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan, clearly implying that the Government will take account of public opinion without being bound by it.Ultimately the success or failure of the proposal may come to be seen as a test of the EU’s ability to act quickly and decisively on a simple issue which will have an almost immediate effect upon people’s lives. The process so far has been startlingly fast, but the national consultations may be a different matter, depending perhaps on the views of the people who get up early in the morning."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"GPs talk to parents \u0026lsquoover patient\u0026rsquos head\u0026rsquo children\u0026rsquos ombudsman to tell psychology conferenceSite was also at centre of controversial legal row involving broadcaster and then neighbour in 2006Government department seeks tenders for medals to recognise role played in centenary eventsBruton seeks urgent advice from Attorney General on digital safety commissioner BillTDs debate 180 proposed amendments by pro-choice and anti-abortion TDsSaurjan Syergaz robbed by Donna Dineen (23) after being stabbed when trying to help herNumber of Irish patients using cross-border directive set to rise further with new servicesCase over tenancy of Dublin apartment went to Residential Tenancies Board before it was appealed to High CourtRickshaw cyclists face new licensing and vetting rules as motorised rickshaws bannedDecision follows two-day meeting of Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation in DublinDesmond Duffy (70) pleads not guilty to murder of Desmond Sullivan (59) in DublinWoman in her 60s dies in Co Roscommon while man in his 40s dies in Co LaoisTrial hears girl (15) taken out of class to be spoken to by police without parent presentJudge tells siblings to sell late father\u0026rsquos former home and split proceeds to end rowFifty-year-old claimed he shot friend in self defence and then cut up body with chainsawAs an MEP, he was regarded as a big beast of the party, and a possible return to national politics was occasionally mootedSean McFarland (36) accused of publishing name of student at centre of Jackson, Olding caseLast month McIntyre lost legal battle keep recordings and transcripts confidential"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3688165.1541515883!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"nurses to ballot for strike action after rejecting pay proposals","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIrish Nurses and Midwives Organisation (INMO) says  508 people were waiting for a bed on Tuesday. Nurses are set to ballot for strike action in the weeks ahead following their rejection of Government pay proposals to tackle recruitment and retention difficulties in the health service. The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation made the announcement on Tuesday after a two-day meeting of its governing executive committee in Dublin.If the ballot is passed, nurses would stop work for 24-hours, providing only life-preserving care and emergency response teams for operating theatres and emergency departments. Last Friday the Health Service Executive offered the INMO new talks this week in an attempt to avert potential industrial action in hospitals and the broader health service in the weeks ahead.Last month members of the INMO voted against Government pay proposals by 94 per cent.The proposals were also rejected by members of the Psychiatric Nurses Association (PNA).However, the proposals were accepted by Siptu which also represents nurses. Nurses who are members of the INMO had sought an across-the-board pay rise to deal with recruitment and retention problems in the health service.They were seeking increases of up to 12 per cent to bring them into line with other degree -entry staff in the health service such as physiotherapists.The Public Service Pay Commission found there was no generalised recruitment and retention problem in nursing and midwifery although it highlighted localised difficulties.In September, the Government - based on recommendations of the commission - put forward a €20 million package of measures aimed at dealing with recruitment and retention problems in some areas of the health service including increased allowances and faster access to promotion posts. The Government maintained between 18,000 and 20,000 nurses could benefit from the proposals.Some nurses could also benefit from a separate Government initiative to address the two-tier pay system in the public service under which staff recruited since 2011 are paid less than longer-serving colleagues.However, some nurses would benefit from neither of the Government’s new pay proposals.Separately nurses said that there were more than 500 patients, who required admission to a hospital bed, waiting on trolleys or on wards on Tuesday morning.The INMO said there were 508 people waiting for a bed. It said 383 were in an emergency department while 125 were in wards elsewhere in a hospital.The INMO said the hospitals worst affected by overcrowding were University Hospital Limerick, where there were 52 patients waiting for a bed Cork University Hospital where 50 patients were on trolleys or on wards and Midland Regional Hospital Tullamore which had 38 patients queuing for a bed.On Monday the INMO said there were 449 patients on trolleys or on wards in hospitals around the country waiting for a bed.The HSE said on Monday its plan for addressing the additional pressures faced by hospitals in this winter will be sent to the Department of Health for approval in the coming days.The  reported on Tuesday that an official HSE evaluation of how the additional pressure on the health service was handled last winter - which saw record levels of hospital overcrowding and more than 700 patients on trolleys on occasions - concluded that special Government funding effectively came too late to be of optimal use."},{"url":null,"title":"halloween celebrations costumes around world pictures","story":"Around 2000 people gathered on the streets of Kawasaki, Japan, to watch the country\u0027s largest Halloween parade on Saturday 28th October.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

That super-slim profile which sloped down to an impossibly thin edge? That\u0027s what this laptop looks like when the lid is closed. It\u0027s a little smaller in most directions. It used to be 32.5cm wide, now it\u0027s 30.41cm. Before, it was 22.7cm deep, but this has shrunk to 21.24cm and its height (its thickness when closed, in other words) has gone from 1.7cm to 1.56cm at its thickest. Note, though, that the thinnest measurement of all, that uncannily thin lip, has actually crept up from 0.3cm to 0.41cm now. In other words, it\u0027s smaller in every direction except at the very edge where it\u0027s all of 1.1mm thicker. Big deal. Oh, and it\u0027s dropped from 1.35kg to 1.25kg in weight.This means it\u0027s the lightest Apple laptop apart from the MacBook (0.92kg).The point is that compared to the previous MacBook Air it\u0027s improved, apart from a tiny bit extra on the thinnest measurement, which I defy anyone to notice. That\u0027s before we get to the colour, which was silver only until now. The new model also comes in space grey, as well as a fruity, peachy gold shade to the aluminium that continues to make up the laptop\u0027s structure.The Apple logo is no longer backlit, instead it\u0027s a reflective metallic apple, carefully colour-matched to the aluminium frame around it. This\u0026nbspbrings the MacBook Air into line with the design language of the other latest MacBook and MacBook Pro models.It looks tremendous, a perfect balance between small body size and big screen, thanks to the tiny bezel that runs round the display. This bezel is nothing compared to the wide silver frame around the display which was required when the first model arrived.The connectivity has been updated, too. There\u0027s no SD card slot, no USB-A ports and no wonderful MagSafe power connector. Only the headphone socket is carried over to the new laptop. What\u0027s new is the same Thunderbolt 3 USB-C connector found on the MacBook, used for data transfer and charging. Except this laptop has two of them, which is a very big improvement. It\u0027s not the super-useful four sockets that are found on the MacBook Pro, but it\u0027s a very welcome upgrade.The other visual difference is the trackpad, which is noticeably larger on this new laptop. And it\u0027s a Force Touch pad, that is, it gives the impression of moving when it\u0027s only a persuasive haptic feedback that\u0027s fooling your finger. This is one of the most noticeable changes to the laptop, once you\u0027ve stopped admiring the thin dark bezel and all-glass covering that succeeded the silver aluminium frame.The 13.3-inch screen is now –\u0026nbspfinally! –\u0026nbspa Retina display. Instead of the 128 pixels per inch (ppi) on previous similarly-sized MacBook Air screens, this has leapt to 227 ppi. To say this makes a difference is an understatement. Actually, it\u0027s more that if you used the MacBook Air, it was fine until you glanced at a recent MacBook or MacBook Pro with their glorious Retina displays, and then you simply didn\u0027t want to go back. Now, the MacBook Air has joined the Retina club.It\u0027s unquestionably the upgrade Air users waiting to replace their laptop have been aching for over the last few years. There are more colours available on this screen\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbsp48 per cent more, Apple says –\u0026nbspand in this respect also, the improved display is a big step forward.Since the display has been upgraded, you may very well want to watch video on it –\u0026nbspafter all, it\u0027s bigger than the largest iPad screen, and almost as high-resolution. So, you\u0027ll be glad of the improved audio. Apple says the new stereo speakers offer twice the bass and an extra 25 per cent of volume compared to the last model. I haven\u0027t measured it, you understand, but it absolutely sounds better and definitely loud. There are three microphones on board, which is useful because this laptop supports hands-free Siri, of which more later.It may look just like the old keyboard but wait until you try it. To be fair, the original MacBook Air keyboard was a sumptuously comfortable user experience which some feel has never been bettered. The new keyboard was clickier and noisier. This is the third-generation of the new butterfly-mechanism keyboard which is noticeably quieter than the second-gen. And, unlike the previous MacBook Air, this one is now in line with the other Apple laptops, with inidually backlit keys. Of course, you\u0027d expect the processor to be cutting-edge. It is, and although in everyday use the previous MacBook Air was perfectly fast enough, this is noticeably more capable and speedier, even down to simple things like opening files and launching apps. When I first saw the second-generation MacBook Air, all those years ago, I was told that battery life was excellent and plugging it in all day long just wasn\u0027t necessary. That\u0027s just as true today and in the week or so that I\u0027ve been testing the laptop, it\u0027s lasted more or less a full day with ease. Important in a laptop as portable as this one. The processor is powerful enough to let you talk to your computer. Say Hey, Siri from across the room and it\u0027ll respond. Only the most recent MacBook Pro models can match this. Although it lacks the super-cool Touch Bar of high-end MacBook Pro models, the MacBook Air has stolen another excellent feature: Touch ID. Nestled to the right of the function keys is a tiny, glossy square. Register your fingerprint and you can unlock it with one touch. This is a brilliantly intimate way to open your Mac, quicker and simpler than a password and only beaten for ease by unlocking with the Apple Watch. You can use Touch ID for Apple Pay, too, when you\u0027re paying for stuff online. It\u0027s made of aluminium. Well, that\u0027s normally not much of a thing to focus on. But this MacBook Air is the first Apple device to be made from 100 per cent recycled aluminium. The bits left over when other MacBooks, iPhones and iPad are created have been turned into this new laptop thanks to Apple metallurgists working on how to create a new alloy that can be re-used effectively. Note that the colour of the laptop is identical to the colours used in non-recycled Macs –\u0026nbspa sign of the success of this alloy. It means the carbon footprint is half that of the last MacBook. Apple uses smelting processes which are less harmful than some manufacturers in the first place, but now, with this laptop, no smelting has been necessary at all, which is a definite bonus for the environment.Which MacBook should you buy?That\u0027s an interesting question. The new MacBook Air sells for £1,199, that\u0027s £50 cheaper than the cheapest MacBook, which has a smaller display, older processor and lacks some of the best features of the new Air such as an extra USB-C socket, Touch ID and hands-free Siri. On the face of it, it\u0027s a no-brainer: why spend more for a less advanced machine?The only reason is portability –\u0026nbspthe MacBook is small and significantly lighter than the Air. You really feel the difference when you\u0027re holding both, though neither is exactly heavyweight. If you\u0027re happy with the weight of the Air (and pick it up in store to see for yourself) then the Air wins out in every other department, from its glorious screen to its extra speed and features. And if you want the cheapest MacBook of all, the Air with its previous design, is still available, for £949. This older model is likely to remain a keen choice for the budget-conscious for some time to come. Mind you, the new one is way better in every single respect (unless you really need an SD memory card slot, and –\u0026nbspyou know what? – there are dongles for that).Unless you need something super-light, the MacBook Air is the best choice. Unless you need advanced processing power that only the MacBook Pro can deliver, the MacBook Air is the best choice. The new model is pricier than the old, but it offers a great balance between power and portability. The new design is cute, especially the new gold finish, and the addition of Touch ID is a genuine advantage. Most of all, it\u0027s a reminder that in the last 10 years, not much has happened to overtake the design ethos of the MacBook Air, apart from a better screen, faster processor, slimmer bezel, better connectivity and improved security in the form of Touch ID. All of which are included here.The new MacBook Air was a hugely popular laptop. Goodness knows we\u0027ve been waiting a long time for this upgrade, but it\u0027s here, and Apple has delivered the goods.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We’ve hiked wages by up to 30 per cent in just four years! Aren’t we great?That\u0027s what the chain\u0027s press release said. OK, I added the last part, but you get my drift. It is indeed welcome news. But there is a caveat. By contrast to, say, cosmetics outfit Lush, furniture retailer Ikea, luxury goods emporium Burberry, and a number of smaller outfits, Lidl is not among the sadly very limited number of retailers that are accredited Living Wage employers. More than 6 million UK jobs ‘pay less than real living wage’Minimum wage failing to give families a basic \u0027no frills\u0027 lifestyleThe majority of companies still refuse to pay the real living wageTo secure that status you have to ensure that outsourced workers, who perform functions that in an earlier age would have been performed by employees, enjoy the same benefits. Given the dizzying number of functions businesses employ other businesses to handle for them, that matters. You can hardly call yourself a living wage employer if you go out and sub contract with people to provide cleaners, or temps, or security guards, or trolley collectors, who pay poverty wages. The aforementioned retailers have proved that you can still turn a nice profit while being accredited living wage employers. So have Aviva, Barclays, Nestle, Nationwide, KPMG, all of which (I imagine) engage in some level of outsourcing. So it shouldn\u0027t be impossible for Lidl to do the same. Tess Lanning, director of the Living Wage Foundation, says the campaign exists “to tackle the rising problem of people paid less than what they need to makes ends meet”. That problem is a big one in Britain. Too big. She adds: “To do this we ask real Living Wage employers to ensure all staff, including their sub-contracted staff, are earning a wage they can really live on. In many supermarkets this means valuing the outsourced cleaners, security guards and trolley collectors as an integral part of the workforce alongside the cashiers and store managers.”As a former trolley collector myself, albeit before anyone had thought to outsource that function, I heartily endorse that sentiment. The Foundation says it would be more than happy to work with Lidl so it could become the first accredited living wage supermarket in Britain. I urge the company to take up the opportunity to do so so that next year I will be able to give the announcement it puts out at this time every year an unqualified endorsement.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Now a site in Gillingham in Kent will go, along with hundreds of jobs there.\u0026nbspA Lloyds Banking Group spokesperson said: “Lloyds Banking Group has today announced that it will create an additional c.2,000 roles, as it strengthens its capability to offer customers new leading-edge digital banking products and services.\u0026nbsp“The Group is investing to further digitise the bank and will refresh some existing roles and create new roles within its structure, while also providing comprehensive retraining for colleagues to help them build their capabilities to meet the demands of these future roles.Llouds said the latest announcement was part of a £3bn commitment it\u0026nbspmade to invest heavily in technology and staff.\u0026nbspLloyds reported\u0026nbsppretax\u0026nbspprofits of £1.8bn last quarter but is pressing on with plans to cut costs and adapt its business.Unite national officer Rob MacGregor said: “As the profits stack up for Lloyds, so does the uncertainty for loyal staff who work hard to serve customers. This latest announcement will undoubtedly hit the morale of staff who have had to endure round after round of job cuts, branch closures and constant upheaval.“The news of additional jobs will prove to be a bitter pill for workers at Lloyd’s Gillingham site closure. These hard working staff face limited opportunities for redeployment, while other workers around the country could effectively be forced out of a job because they are unable to travel or move to where the new roles are located.“Unite will be pressing Lloyds to guarantee no compulsory redundancies and ensuring that staff who move into new roles are given the support and skills that enable them to continue delivering the best possible customer service.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

ABF posted a 1 per cent rise in group revenue to £15.6bn, while pre-tax profit went up 5 per cent to £1.4m. The group reported that Primark “delivered its most significant profit growth in recent years” in the 12 months to 15 September, with retail revenue up 6 per cent at £7bn and operating profit up 15 per cent to £843m. ABF said the discount store performed particularly well in the UK, with like-for-like sales up 1.2 per cent. Success in its retail arm helped to offset continued decline in ABF’s sugar business, which has long been struggling due to falling sugar prices as a result of\u0026nbspthe EU removing sugar sales quotas. Shoppers evacuated as major blaze breaks out in Belfast PrimarkPrimark\u0027s own brand cosmetics now completely cruelty-freeGeorge Weston, chief executive of Associated British Foods, said: This was another year of progress for the group. We continued to pursue the opportunities to grow our businesses with a gross investment of £1.2bn. “Strong profit performances were delivered by each of Primark, grocery, agriculture and ingredients. These more than offset the decline in sugar profit which was caused primarily by low prices in the first year after the structural change in the EU sugar regime. Looking ahead, management have clear plans for further investment and for pursuing opportunities for business improvement.The company said it plans to focus investment in Primark, Twinings Ovaltine and its ingredients business, and expects profits to improve in retail and grocery, while sugar profits will be “significantly lower”. Meanwhile, the group said it will pay a idend of 45p for the year, marking a 10 per cent increase on the amount paid to shareholders in the previous 12 months. Emma-Lou Montgomery, associate director at\u0026nbspFidelity Personal Investing’s share dealing service, said: “Associated British Foods has hit the sweet spot for investors again. Not with its sugar business but with fast-fashion brand Primark, whose performance has more than compensated for the fall in profits in its sugar business as a result of the deregulation of the EU sugar market.”“Primark has delivered its most significant profit growth in recent years and that’s especially sweet in a retail sector that has soured for so many other retailers. For many that 10 per cent rise in the annual idend for shareholders will just be the icing on the cake.”Shares in ABF were up more than 2 per cent in early trading.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack – one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin’ Around – as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb – the “best friend” character eaten in the second episode – went viral the weekend it dropped. Netflix’s Marvel shows tend towards the overlong and turgid. An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox’s blind lawyercrimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck\u0027s turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York’s Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D\u0027Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson – charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife – the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused. It’s a feat of bravura factual filmmaking from French documentarian Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, which comes to Netflix with a recently shot three-part coda catching up with the (very weird) Peterson clan a decade on. Stranger Things: the Euro-Gloom years. Netflix’s first German-language production is a pulp romp that thinks it’s a Wagner opera. In a remote town surrounded by a creepy forest locals fear the disappearance of a teenager may be linked to other missing persons cases from decades earlier. The timelines get twisted and it’s obvious that something wicked is emanating from a tunnel leading to a nearby nuclear power plant. Yet if the story sometimes trips itself up the Goonies-meets-Götterdämmerung ambiance keeps you hooked. 625 A Series of Unfortunate EventsThe wry and bleak Lemony Snickett children novels finally get the ghastly adaptation they deserve (let’s all pretend the dreadful 2004 Jim Carrey movie never happened). Neil Patrick Harris gobbles up the scenery as the vain and wicked Count Olaf, desperate to separate the Baudelaire orphans from their considerable inheritance. The look is Tim Burton by way of Wes Anderson, and the dark wit of the books is replicated perfectly (Snickett, aka Daniel Handler, is co-producer). If you’re curious as to how Cary Fukunaga will handle the Bond franchise, his limited series, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, drops some delicious hints. It’s a mind-bending sci-fi story set in an alternative United States where computers still look like Commodore 64s and in which you pay for goods by having a “travel buddy” sit down and read you adverts. The Breaking Bad prequel is starting to outgrow the show that spawned it. Where Breaking Bad delivered a master-class in scorched earth storytelling Saul is gentler and more humane. Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord’s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? Don’t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker’s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash – yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story San Junipero and Star Trek parody USS Callister, which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It’s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders – including the notorious “Co-Ed” butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost  Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret. This drug trafficking caper spells out exactly what kind of series it is with an early scene in which two gangsters zip around a multi-level carpark on a motorbike firing a machine gun. Narcos, in other words, is for people who consider Pacino’s Scarface a touch too understated. Series one and two feature a mesmerising performance by Wagner Moura as Columbian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, while season three focuses on the notorious Cali cartel. Reported to be one of Netflix’s biggest hits – the company doesn’t release audience figures – the fourth season turns its attention to Mexico’s interminable drugs wars. A cloud hangs over Aziz Ansari’s future after he was embroiled in the #MeToo scandal. But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. One of Netflix’s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan’s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling – a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn’t feel all that guilty about. You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We’re firmly in Martin Scorsese\u0027s Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Brühl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs’s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms – but Love’s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there’s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs – but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman “mansplained” away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix’s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new “skins”. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix’s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel’s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs.2125 Rick and MortyDan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFlyDoc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon.Mad Men’s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda “Britannica” Richardson.Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues. One of the most ambitious modern comedies, animated or otherwise, Archer tries on different varieties of humour for size and even occasionally tugs at the heart strings.Breaking Bad for those with short attention s. The saga of Walter White took years to track the iconic anti-hero’s rise from mild mannered everyman to dead-eyed criminal. Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family.A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto).A cartoon about a talking horse, starring the goofy older brother from Arrested Development… on paper little about BoJack Horseman screams “must watch”. Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack – one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin’ Around – as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb – the “best friend” character eaten in the second episode – went viral the weekend it dropped. Netflix’s Marvel shows tend towards the overlong and turgid. An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox’s blind lawyercrimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck\u0027s turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York’s Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D\u0027Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson – charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife – the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused. It’s a feat of bravura factual filmmaking from French documentarian Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, which comes to Netflix with a recently shot three-part coda catching up with the (very weird) Peterson clan a decade on. Stranger Things: the Euro-Gloom years. Netflix’s first German-language production is a pulp romp that thinks it’s a Wagner opera. In a remote town surrounded by a creepy forest locals fear the disappearance of a teenager may be linked to other missing persons cases from decades earlier. The timelines get twisted and it’s obvious that something wicked is emanating from a tunnel leading to a nearby nuclear power plant. Yet if the story sometimes trips itself up the Goonies-meets-Götterdämmerung ambiance keeps you hooked. 625 A Series of Unfortunate EventsThe wry and bleak Lemony Snickett children novels finally get the ghastly adaptation they deserve (let’s all pretend the dreadful 2004 Jim Carrey movie never happened). Neil Patrick Harris gobbles up the scenery as the vain and wicked Count Olaf, desperate to separate the Baudelaire orphans from their considerable inheritance. The look is Tim Burton by way of Wes Anderson, and the dark wit of the books is replicated perfectly (Snickett, aka Daniel Handler, is co-producer). If you’re curious as to how Cary Fukunaga will handle the Bond franchise, his limited series, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, drops some delicious hints. It’s a mind-bending sci-fi story set in an alternative United States where computers still look like Commodore 64s and in which you pay for goods by having a “travel buddy” sit down and read you adverts. The Breaking Bad prequel is starting to outgrow the show that spawned it. Where Breaking Bad delivered a master-class in scorched earth storytelling Saul is gentler and more humane. Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord’s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? Don’t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker’s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash – yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story San Junipero and Star Trek parody USS Callister, which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It’s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders – including the notorious “Co-Ed” butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost  Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret. This drug trafficking caper spells out exactly what kind of series it is with an early scene in which two gangsters zip around a multi-level carpark on a motorbike firing a machine gun. Narcos, in other words, is for people who consider Pacino’s Scarface a touch too understated. Series one and two feature a mesmerising performance by Wagner Moura as Columbian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, while season three focuses on the notorious Cali cartel. Reported to be one of Netflix’s biggest hits – the company doesn’t release audience figures – the fourth season turns its attention to Mexico’s interminable drugs wars. A cloud hangs over Aziz Ansari’s future after he was embroiled in the #MeToo scandal. But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. One of Netflix’s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan’s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling – a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn’t feel all that guilty about. You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We’re firmly in Martin Scorsese\u0027s Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Brühl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs’s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms – but Love’s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there’s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs – but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman “mansplained” away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix’s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new “skins”. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix’s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel’s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs.2125 Rick and MortyDan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFlyDoc Brown-esque duo of time travellers.

Created by David Angell, Peter Casey, and David Lee, the comedy was widely celebrated during its eleven seasons, winning 37 Emmys. The sitcom ended with the eponymous character leaving Seattle for Chicago.Doctor Frasier\u0026nbspCrane, played by Grammer, first appeared in beloved Boston-set sitcom Cheers which ran on NBC from 1982 to 1993. The actor has gone on to enjoy\u0026nbspbig-screen success, starring in Hollywood sequels such as X-Men: The Last Stand, The Expendables 3 and Transformers: Age of Extinction.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Now a site in Gillingham in Kent will go, along with hundreds of jobs there.\u0026nbspA Lloyds Banking Group spokesperson said: “Lloyds Banking Group has today announced that it will create an additional c.2,000 roles, as it strengthens its capability to offer customers new leading-edge digital banking products and services.\u0026nbsp“The Group is investing to further digitise the bank and will refresh some existing roles and create new roles within its structure, while also providing comprehensive retraining for colleagues to help them build their capabilities to meet the demands of these future roles.Llouds said the latest announcement was part of a £3bn commitment it\u0026nbspmade to invest heavily in technology and staff.\u0026nbspLloyds reported\u0026nbsppretax\u0026nbspprofits of £1.8bn last quarter but is pressing on with plans to cut costs and adapt its business.Unite national officer Rob MacGregor said: “As the profits stack up for Lloyds, so does the uncertainty for loyal staff who work hard to serve customers.

Sean O’Grady prepares for the worstClick to followThe IndependentWith the best will in the world, and there may be a remarkable shortage of that in the coming months, a chaotic Brexit will make reliable delivery of a huge variety of items more trickyIn the\u0026nbsptwo and a bit years\u0026nbspsince the EU referendum, successive waves of optimism and pessimism have crashed across the nation as hopes for an acceptable outcome\u0026nbsprise and fall. We still don’t know what will be decided at upcoming “crunch” European Union summits –\u0026nbspand the possibility remains that, even if a healthy dose of\u0026nbspgoodwill enables some kind of agreement to be cobbled together, Brexit will be messy.Whatever else, undoing a half-century of integration is bound to cause some distortion. So to be prudent, you might want to “Brexit-proof” your life, just in case. Here is my\u0026nbspfar from exhaustive\u0026nbspguide to some of the things you might (or might not) want to consider as departure day approaches.1. Stock up on loo rollWhat could be more essential to civilised life? Right now your local supermarket will happily sell you as many multipacks of Andrex (other leading brands are available) as you can transport home – but after 29 March\u0026nbsp2019\u0026nbspthere is a risk\u0026nbspthey may need to ration the supply. You see, some 50 per cent of the wood pulp used to make toilet rolls in UK factories comes into the country on lorries from Sweden,\u0026nbspan EU member state. When the lorries get stuck on some ferry somewhere, the factories will soon run out of raw material. They could make up the shortfall with the wood pulp that comes in from Brazil, although apparently that stuff isn’t as comfortable to use. You have been warned.Raab: Those fearing Brexit hit to car industry should show ‘mettle’2. Order your new car nowAround 85 per cent of the UK’s new car market is accounted for by imports,\u0026nbspand there are few vehicles you can buy that don’t have at least some European Union\u0026nbspcontent – including some famous British brands. The Mini, for example, has a crankshaft that crosses the Chanel more than a dozen times as it reaches completion. The Jaguar E-Pace, an excellent sporting SUV, is made in Austria, while only the Astra from the Vauxhall range is made here –\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspagain, it\u0026nbspcontains EU parts. On the other hand, all of BMW’s four-cylinder engines for the likes of the 3 Series are made in Birmingham…Disruption to such automotive supply chains will make delays inevitable for virtually any brand.\u0026nbspTariffs on new car imports, if imposed by the UK, may add to the list price – if you can source the vehicle in the first place. Order now from stock and relax.By the by, if you own a Fiat, Kia, Volkswagen, Nissan, Toyota, Skoda, Seat, Renault, Peugeot, Citroen, Vauxhall, Ford or virtually any other brand with parts from the EU, which includes “British” brands such as Mini, Bentley and Jaguar, then you might also want to buy a few spares. Just in case.3. Apply for an international driving permitThis is fairly crucial if you want to be able to drive legally “over there”.If you are fond of a proper brie, to offer a further random example, you know what to do...One of the main benefits of EU membership we take for granted is the Europe-wide recognition of national driving licences. This could conceivably end if we “crash\u0026nbspout” of the club. An international driving permit will allow you to drive legally throughout\u0026nbspthe EU you’ll need to\u0026nbspapply\u0026nbspfor it personally at a post office, for a reasonable fee of £5.50.4. Lay down some French wines, German salami, Italian pasta, Polish vodka, Belgian chocolates, Spanish manchego, Greek olives…With the best will in the world, and there may be a remarkable shortage of that in the coming months, a chaotic Brexit will make reliable delivery of these sorts of treats more tricky. There are British alternatives to many of them\u0026nbspbut\u0026nbspnot all, obviously. The commercial British olive, for example, is yet to make its appearance. If you are fond of a proper brie, to offer a further random example, you know what to do (no offence Somerset). You can\u0026nbspfreeze\u0026nbspharder cheeses and stick\u0026nbspsome pickled or “brined” cheeses in the pantry. The delicatessen then – such a continental word – is your next shopping destination. You’ll at least enjoy it, but try not to eat it all at once. Get stockpiling.5. Make sure your health insurance covers trips to the EU or EEAThe European Health Card and smooth reciprocal arrangements across the EU for member\u0026nbspcitizens in need of care could disappear. The safest solution might be to apply for some health insurance\u0026nbspthat will cover you in the EU for holidays and business trips.6. Review your investmentsNever a bad idea in any case. If you’re lucky enough to own some, including a (money purchase) pension pot, then be ready for the volatility a chaotic Brexit will bring. Currency movements will probably mean dollar, euro and other foreign currency assets will rise in value you may also find changes in the tax treatment of your stocks, shares, bond and real estate as the UK and EU settle down to their new, less convergent relationship.Fears of a collapse in sterling may be exaggerated but it is something you need to be aware ofWithout going full Project Fear II, there may also be sharpish trends in inflation, interest rates and tax that you might not have foreseen. A change in the Bank of England bank rate, for example, will influence gilt and, thus, annuity rates for people who purchase one with their retirement pot (though of course\u0026nbspyou don’t\u0026nbsphave to go down the annuity route under the newish “pension\u0026nbspfreedoms”). This could be favourable, or not, depending on what happens, but you need to understand what might happen, so far as you can. As ever, do your own research and seek independent financial advice.7. What, the gîte has to go?The timeshare pad in Spain, the cute little conical cottage in Puglia, beach apartment in Cyprus, bolthole in Paris… all favourite British property investments, and hitherto unthreatened by discriminatory taxation or property laws –\u0026nbspbut perhaps no longer.\u0026nbspThere might also be some effect on the popularity of your place if you let it out to UK holidaymakers, many of who will obviously be stuck\u0026nbspin Blighty\u0026nbspeating the cheese and wine reserves they’ve built up (see point 4).Post-Brexit, there may be less certainty that British citizens, resident or not, will enjoy the exact same property rights and tax equality they do now. On the other hand, if the euro, Bulgarian lev or Croatian kuna strengthens against the pound, other things being equal, then the sterling-equivalent value of your real estate may go up.\u0026nbspThere again, fears of a collapse in sterling may be exaggerated\u0026nbspbut it is something again you need to be aware of.8. Double-check the family treeYour ancestry, and one or two other conditions, might help you apply for a passport of another EU member state, should you want one.Don’t forget that although dual citizenship is permitted in the UK, it isn’t available\u0026nbspin all EU states, so you need to check if necessary, make a choice.Usually some form of parentage qualification can deliver a new passport from an EU nation – though a substantial investment can also secure one (see point 6). You will usually need to register your birth, even if it was in Britain, with the country you wish to become a citizen of. Here are a few of the basics to get the ball rolling (though there is much devilish bureaucracy in the detail so beware)...Surge in British people obtaining EU citizenship, new data revealsItalian citizenship: by being born\u0026nbspto an Italian parent and, in some circumstances, via an Italian grandparent. Or by naturalisation – at least 10\u0026nbspyears’ residency.Irish citizenship: yours if\u0026nbspsome of your parents or grandparents were Irish\u0026nbspor, under some circumstances, by marriage to an Irish citizen.\u0026nbspNaturalisation by residency will also get you an Irish passport.Spanish citizenship: for British expats it is possible\u0026nbspto obtain Spanish citizenship via residency, but you will have to surrender your\u0026nbspBritish citizenship – toss a euro\u0026nbspfor it. Alternatively, once you have lived in Spain for five uninterrupted years, you can apply for an “EU long-term residence permit”, which enables you to work and live in Spain on the same basis as Spanish citizens. You can\u0026nbspalso apply if you have a Spanish father or mother.Cypriot citizenship: been married to a Cypriot for at least three years? Time to celebrate!\u0026nbspCypriot parentage will also do the trick,\u0026nbspas will\u0026nbsp“citizenship by investment” – a property worth at least €500,000.\u0026nbspIt might be prudent to make sure your next prescription gets filled in good timeMaltese citizenship: naturalisationresidency for five years should do it. But here too there is a chance of flashing the cash via the Malta Inidual Investor Programme – at least €500,000 in various combinations of Maltese government bonds, and the National Development and Social Fund. Five years of marriage to\u0026nbspa Maltese citizen is another route.\u0026nbspMost EU and EEA countries (eg Norway, Switzerland) are members of the Schengen scheme, meaning no border checks in any case for EU citizens.9. Order your European-made fridge, washing machine, dishwasher…Much the same arguments apply to consumer goods as they do to cars, though the prevalence of Chinese-made products (sometimes with European brand names) means that the possible delays and inconvenience are somewhat less for this class of goods. However, if you really desire a German-made Miele washing machine you might be wise to make a move on one now.10. Buy your foreign currency\u0026nbspnowI don’t have a Brexit crystal ball any more than anyone else but it seems reasonable to conclude that a\u0026nbsphard Brexit, the nearer it gets, could well bring about a hefty depreciation of sterling – as happened the morning after the 2016 referendum, when the pound lost about 15 per cent of its external value (though it did gradually recover). Then again, whenever there is a wave of optimism about the talks, sterling tends to rise. The pound would be expected to slide against all the major currencies in an unexpectedly chaotic scenario, so\u0026nbspif you wish to be cautious\u0026nbspyou could get your euros, dollars, roubles and rupees in now.11. Stock up on medicinesAssuming they have a long shelf life, that is. This is one of the most vexed of all the post-Brexit questions, about which we have heard a lot from politicians. All one can say now on the question of imported medicines is that they will, under UK law, be OK to use\u0026nbspin Britain if they’re already EU approved, as we will adopt all the European Union regulations from day one\u0026nbspof Brexit. However, like so many other goods, there may be delays in transportation, and it might be prudent to make sure your next prescription gets filled in good time. The UK has a competitive pharmaceuticals sector, for now\u0026nbspthere is a reasonable chance that your pills and potions can be sourced by the pharmacy. Keep a weather eye\u0026nbspopen for updates.12. Au pairs, tenants and employees: let\u0026nbspthem go now or hang on for dear lifeWithout a legally sound withdrawal agreement, the rights and status of EU citizens living and working in the UK will need to be clarified, and there is no sign of that yet. Some may decide to leave the UK, even after many years here, which will inevitably\u0026nbspcause great disruption.\u0026nbspYou may therefore\u0026nbspwish to make some contingency arrangements of your own if, say, you rent a house to a Slovak family, have a French au pair or employ workers from Poland. The short story is that they may be hard to replace.13. Take advantage of “the exciting opportunities” offered by BrexitJoking aside, there will be some potential benefits for the new “global Britain”. If you’re the entrepreneurial type, you might well want to seek out new trading opportunities in China or India, as (or\u0026nbspif) tariffs and other restrictions that are now levied on goods and services in either direction are lifted. That could happen as a result of unilateral UK action or, in the longer run, through the kind of ambitious trade deals ministers talk so frequently\u0026nbspabout.All in all,\u0026nbspnow may be a good\u0026nbspmoment to start that business advising Indian students about how to get a visa and apply for a course at a British university. Provided of course the government finds such an arrangement with India that is compatible with its migration targets.Created with Sketch.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.John Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

Engage in some cross-border arbitrageNot smuggling, you understand, but legitimate trade exploiting anomalies in inidual markets.If the Troubles return post-Brexit, it won’t just be due to the borderThis may be of especial interest to people living near the Irish border, who will have to make the most of whatever is coming their way this\u0026nbspspring. On the one hand, the prices\u0026nbspof various goods will erge because of movements in the exchange rate,\u0026nbspas well as duty, taxation\u0026nbspand regulation. The opportunities will be obvious. On the other hand, the EU or UK may decide to instal more stringent customs controls than before it’s\u0026nbspa sensitive subject. Or they could just forget about Ireland and leave things as they are, tolerating a certain amount of cross-border economic activity. Let’s be honest, no one knows.15. Watch your phone billOne of the greatest of the positive practical differences the EU Commission made in recent years was to cut mobile phone roaming rates among EU states.\u0026nbspIt is not yet clear whether\u0026nbspthat regulation will survive the Brexit process, although it may be caught by the UK withdrawal legislation.16. Check your flightOpinions, even at this relatively late stage, differ on how easy air travel will be post-Brexit. There are many EU regulations that govern passenger air transport\u0026nbsp(and freight for that matter). These\u0026nbspmay be overcome by UK-based\u0026nbspairlines setting up subsidiary companies in the EU\u0026nbspbut carrying on with business as usual – or not. Once again, confusion is the most likely outcome, and you may wish to exercise caution about booking your next flight.17. Learn to love your local uniThe future of European educational projects such as the Erasmus exchange scheme is under active discussion. More broadly, EU students can come and study in Britain at UK tuition fee rates, and that may not be so in future. By the same token, British students going to study in the EU may find themselves facing new fees and charges,\u0026nbspas well as having to factor in the impact\u0026nbspon their living costs of potential shifts to the exchange rate.18. Beware the expat lifeJust as there will be much uncertainty about the future of EU citizens in the UK, so there will be for those Britons living happily in EU countries, working or retired. There will be many issues to consider, some covered above: the cost of healthcare taxes on\u0026nbspproperty and income the payment or uprating of the UK state pension payment of local social security benefits gyrations in the exchange rate,\u0026nbspand the value of real estate across borders\u0026nbspremitted income from the UK the right to bring other family members to come and live with you voting rights and much else.19. Watch out for the RockSounds sinister – but not meant to be. Many Britons have links to Gibraltar, not just for financial reasons. Thus far\u0026nbspan under-discussed aspect of Brexit, Gibraltar is another UK territoryEU land border that raises an awful lot\u0026nbspof questions. The situation is made trickier because the EU has\u0026nbspgranted Spain a veto on future arrangements on Gibraltar. Nothing could change, perhaps\u0026nbspor “concessions” may only amount to the Spanish police having a role at the airport or the Spanish could decide to make life at the border more difficult, even though many Spanish workers rely on Gibraltar for their livelihoods.Created with Sketch.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit deal Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 march20. Don’t count on future working visits to the EUBy analogy with the US, if things really do get nasty\u0026nbspthen visa-free EU travel may be restricted to holidays and leisure. “Work”, even on a temporary assignment, may be treated differently, as it is by the\u0026nbspStates. Thus a special visa from the EU Belgium\u0026nbspmay be required if, say, a journalist wishes to go to Brussels, ironically, to report on the EU’s activities.\u0026nbspLikewise, an architect who wants to go Prague to supervise some construction work may need\u0026nbspan EUCzech permit. That’s because\u0026nbspif the UK\u0026nbspleaves the single market, British qualifications will not necessarily be recognised by EU states, as they tend to be now. Once again, a “worst case scenario” possibility that has\u0026nbspnot been much discussed.\u0026nbspSo there we are then. With luck, Britain won’t leave the EU at all certainly the pressure for a Final Say referendum is growing by the week. Or maybe we will do so in name only, or perhaps\u0026nbspacross a smooth, seamless transition that will take many months. Then again, Brexit hasn’t enjoyed much luck so far…\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It works by throwing out an array of 30,000 infrared lights, which hit the holder\u0027s face – a sensor in the camera can then see where they fall and check whether the right person is holding the phone.Cheaper, colourful version of latest iPhone finally goes on saleBut when the light is especially bright – on a sunny day, for instance – those invisible lights within the phone can get thrown off and the facial recognition sensor can have trouble seeing its owner.The new feature will improve that by better illuminating people\u0027s faces. The new sensor and its better lights will lower the impacts from visible lights of environment in order to improve the Face ID user experience, according to the report first spotted by\u0026nbspMacrumors.In addition to those new features, the updated version of the Face ID sensor could also allow it to use time of flight calculations to make 3D models of the things it is looking at. That technology works by throwing out a piece of light and seeing how long it takes to bounce back, and then using that to work out the distance – similar to something like radar.If Apple were to integrate that, it would allow the phone to use its modelling software to create augmented reality features to improve tools like the Animoji feature, for instance.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It was spinning very quickly as it flew through the solar system, and seemed to speed up rather than slow down as it went.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

If so, that might have happened by accident – or the object might in fact be a spacecraft made by an alien race, they said.Alien asteroids could have brought life to Earth from spaceThe object might be a fully operational probe sent intentionally to Earth vicinity by an alien civilisation, the researchers write.It is not the first time that astronomers have suggested the rock could potentially be an alien spacecraft. Soon after it was discovered, researchers with the Breakthrough Listen project announced they would be monitoring it and seeing if it was sending out radio signals.The new study, written by\u0026nbspShmuel Bialy and Abraham Loeb from the Harvard Smithsonian Centre\u0026nbspfor Astrophysics, looks at the way that solar radiation could be used to power the object as it flies through space. They calculate that it would have to be very thin but very wide – and that such a shape would be possible.If they are right that the object is being propelled by radiation pressure from the sun, then it will be a breakthrough even if it is entirely natural. Such an object would be of a kind never before seen, most likely formed by an entirely unknown process happening deep in space.But it might in fact be artificial in origin, they write. One\u0026nbsppossibility is that ‘Oumuamua\u0026nbspis a\u0026nbsplightsail, floating in interstellar space as a debris from an advanced technological equipment, the authors claim, and it might be unused debris that has\u0026nbspbeen thrown out into space from a planetary system.Such an explanation would account for the various strange characteristics of Oumuamua, including the unusual shape it seems to have.Scientists on Earth have already looked to develop that kind of technology, which would be used to make tiny spacecraft that could be shot through space at intense speed and be pushed only by light. It might already have been developed elsewhere, they write, and could be used for transporting cargo between planets or even between stars.But even more strange is a theory that the rock could have been sent here on purpose. Alternatively, a more exotic scenario is that ‘Oumuamua may be a fully operational probe sent intentionally to Earth vicinity by an alien civilization, they write.Oumuamua is now too far away from Earth for scientists to understand any more about it. But more could be found by looking into the solar system for more objects of this type, the authors say – which could happen more in coming years, as new ways of surveying the sky are turned on.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

ABF posted a 1 per cent rise in group revenue to £15.6bn, while pre-tax profit went up 5 per cent to £1.4m. The group reported that Primark “delivered its most significant profit growth in recent years” in the 12 months to 15 September, with retail revenue up 6 per cent at £7bn and operating profit up 15 per cent to £843m. ABF said the discount store performed particularly well in the UK, with like-for-like sales up 1.2 per cent. Success in its retail arm helped to offset continued decline in ABF’s sugar business, which has long been struggling due to falling sugar prices as a result of\u0026nbspthe EU removing sugar sales quotas. Shoppers evacuated as major blaze breaks out in Belfast PrimarkPrimark\u0027s own brand cosmetics now completely cruelty-freeGeorge Weston, chief executive of Associated British Foods, said: This was another year of progress for the group. We continued to pursue the opportunities to grow our businesses with a gross investment of £1.2bn. “Strong profit performances were delivered by each of Primark, grocery, agriculture and ingredients. These more than offset the decline in sugar profit which was caused primarily by low prices in the first year after the structural change in the EU sugar regime. Looking ahead, management have clear plans for further investment and for pursuing opportunities for business improvement.The company said it plans to focus investment in Primark, Twinings Ovaltine and its ingredients business, and expects profits to improve in retail and grocery, while sugar profits will be “significantly lower”. Meanwhile, the group said it will pay a idend of 45p for the year, marking a 10 per cent increase on the amount paid to shareholders in the previous 12 months. Emma-Lou Montgomery, associate director at\u0026nbspFidelity Personal Investing’s share dealing service, said: “Associated British Foods has hit the sweet spot for investors again. Not with its sugar business but with fast-fashion brand Primark, whose performance has more than compensated for the fall in profits in its sugar business as a result of the deregulation of the EU sugar market.”“Primark has delivered its most significant profit growth in recent years and that’s especially sweet in a retail sector that has soured for so many other retailers. For many that 10 per cent rise in the annual idend for shareholders will just be the icing on the cake.”Shares in ABF were up more than 2 per cent in early trading.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Both in\u0026nbspinvolved people being barred\u0026nbspfrom entering the UK because officials were “not satisfied” they would return home.\u0026nbspBoth were reversed within 12 hours of the articles being published.\u0026nbspMan blocked from seeing baby after Home Office loses passportEU slavery victims at risk of re-exploitation after BrexitHome Office ‘risking repeat of Windrush scandal for EU citizens’Home Office stops US resident visiting seriously ill daughter in UKExperts\u0026nbsphave warned, however, that\u0026nbspthe speed at which the\u0026nbspdecisions were\u0026nbspreversed following the media coverage\u0026nbspraised\u0026nbspserious concerns about the accuracy and fairness of the Home Office’s decision-making process.\u0026nbspIt amounted to a “popularity contest” in which\u0026nbsponly those able to access journalists could get their cases resolved, they said.\u0026nbspAmong the cases overturned after reporting by\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspwas that of Yvonne Williams,\u0026nbspthe 59-year-old daughter of a Windrush generation\u0026nbspimmigrant who was served with a removal order despite\u0026nbspher whole family being in Britain.\u0026nbspThe decision to prevent\u0026nbspsix-year-old, UK-born Mohamed Bangoura\u0026nbspfrom returning home\u0026nbspto his mother following a holiday, was also reversed, as was the case of Hafizzulah Husseinkhel, a\u0026nbsp27-year-old\u0026nbspAfghan man who was threatened with deportation despite having served in the British army.Journalists reporting on these cases are usually contacted\u0026nbspby either the inidual themselves, charities\u0026nbspsupporting them\u0026nbspor, increasingly, solicitors representing them. Immigration lawyers said media coverage was\u0026nbspnow often\u0026nbspthe only way to obtain a “fair and timely” resolution from the Home Office.Chai Patel, legal director at the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI), said that while it was good for inidual cases to get resolved, the process exposed a “completely dysfunctional” system which is\u0026nbsp“incredibly unfair” for those unable to get their cases in the media.He added:\u0026nbsp“It shows how little faith or consideration immigration official\u0026nbsphave\u0026nbsphas\u0026nbspin their\u0026nbspown decision-making that they’re willing to reverse them in a matter of hours, minutes sometimes, of them getting a bit of bad publicity.\u0026nbspAnd it’s seriously concerning that instead of having proper processes, we now have a popularity contest where, if you can get enough people to shout about your case, the Home Office will just change its mind.“Many\u0026nbspwill\u0026nbspnever going to have their case\u0026nbspin the press because\u0026nbspit’s too sensitive,\u0026nbspor they don’t have the contacts or the lawyers to get in touch with journalists and\u0026nbspthey don’t have communities building campaign groups around them. They’re never going to come to the press’s attention.”Mr Patel said\u0026nbspeach Home Office U-turn\u0026nbspwas an admission\u0026nbspthat there is\u0026nbspno\u0026nbspsolution to the underlying problem whereby people are\u0026nbsp”consistently – almost as a matter of course – given entirely unfair decisions that will destroy their lives until they’re lucky enough to get them turned around”.Danielle Blake, a legal expert from\u0026nbspthe Immigration Advice Service (IAS), said it was a “big ask” for clients to willingly expose their personal circumstances to the world, but conceded that media exposure was often required to obtain a fair and timely resolution\u0026nbspfrom the Home Office.She added: “As advisers we come across many clients who are in the most desperate of situations. A\u0026nbsplot of them are separated from their loved ones and have been for a very long time. All of this adds several months onto an already long and emotionally draining process. It’s very upsetting to think that for those who wish to keep their story private, they face being stuck on a never-ending merry-go-round of paying exorbitant Home Office fees, only to come up against a brick wall of non-communication.”\u0026nbspWith Brexit on the horizon, campaigners raised concerns that an already “broken” system is going to be placed under even more pressure, with potentially disastrous implications.Mr Patel said: “The Home Office can’t function with the number of applications made currently. It’s going to get a lot worse when the government has to develop\u0026nbspan immigration system that includes EU nationals as well.\u0026nbspWhatever happens, the pressure on the Home Office both in terms of future migration and dealing with the people here already is going to be huge. To prevent disaster they need to completely reform every part of the immigration system, because currently it is completely broken.”A Home Office spokesperson said:\u0026nbsp“The home secretary has been clear since his first day in office that he wants a different approach to the immigration system which provides control, but is fair and humane.\u0026nbspIf evidence about a case comes to light then it will be considered by caseworkers, but solely because a case is covered in the media does not mean it will receive a favourable decision.”Asylum and ImmigrationShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The EU has said December is too late to reach an agreement, though some in Brussels\u0026nbspsuspect the deadline could slip yet further.Tory eurosceptics, including in Theresa May’s own Cabinet, are concerned that plans to keep the UK inside a customs union with the EU temporarily to help prevent a hard border could see Britain never fully leave the bloc’s orbit.The Irish border dilemma shows the media ignores issues at our perilEU plans compromise on customs union to solve Irish borderIrish border checks ‘will have to return’ if there is a no-deal BrexitThe UK had itself requested that the so-called “backstop” apply to the whole UK rather than just Northern Ireland, as originally proposed by the EU – in order to avoid border checks between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. But Brexiteers are now worried about the implications of the policy, and want some kind of time-limit. Mr Barnier\u0026nbsphas said a time-limited backstop would be “no backstop at all”.\u0026nbspA Downing Street spokesperson said on Tuesday that Cabinet ministers needed more time to consider ways to ensure Britain could not be bound to the EU by the backstop indefinitely.The spokesperson\u0026nbspindicated that a meeting of the body on Tuesday had discussed such options, but that ministers failed to reach a final conclusion.A customs union would still not prevent all border checks, the EU has said, because of the continued need for health and regulatory checks on animal products. Michel Barnier has said these would increase ten-fold after exit between Great Britain and Ireland, if the UK leaves the single market.Created with Sketch.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.John Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

Voters faced a choice between a known reality and an unknown alternative.“In the campaign, untestable claims took the place of facts and reality.”Human rights specialist Jonathan Cooper, a barrister at Doughty Street Chambers, said: “The current state of the Brexit negotiations is worrying people throughout the UK and the legal profession is no exception to that.“We represent people from across industry and society and we see every day the way the prospect of a catastrophic Brexit deal is already causing real harm.“This letter to the prime minister has been signed by over a thousand of my colleagues who are convinced that not only is a people\u0027s vote the right thing to do, it is the most democratic thing to do as well.”A Department for Exiting the EU spokeswoman said: “The people of the United Kingdom have already had their say in one of the biggest democratic exercises this country has ever seen and the Prime Minister has made it clear that there is not going to be a second referendum.“We remain confident we will agree a mutually advantageous deal with the EU.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They deserve much better than the uncertainty and confusion they have been subjected to as a result of the Brexit negotiations.”It has been signed by Labour MPs including Liz Kendall, Chuka Umunna, Wes Streeting and Mike Gapes, as well as representatives from the Liberal Democrats and SNP.The letter says that “with only a few months to go” until Brexit “the future remains uncertain for over three million EU citizens living in the UK”.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

She said that, while the UK should aim to secure a withdrawal agreement as soon as possible, this would not be done at any cost.“The prime minister said that, once agreement was reached on a withdrawal agreement, it remains the case that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed and it will be subject to securing an acceptable full future framework.”The Independent understands that Downing Street believes a withdrawal agreement could be agreed with Mr Barnier, and then in a period before an EU summit is held to sign it off, the outstanding parts of the outline future trading relationship could also be fleshed out.The goal would then be for a European Council summit to approve the lot, passing the baton to MPs in the UK to vote on it in parliament before Christmas.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

She said that while the UK should aim to secure a withdrawal agreement as soon as possible, this should not be done at any cost.Ms May stressed that any deal on withdrawal would be subject to the EU and UK finalising a framework on their future relationship in areas like trade and security, which is expected to be set out in a separate political declaration.The PM\u0026nbspsaid that once agreement was reached on a withdrawal agreement, it remains the case that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed and it will be subject to securing an acceptable full future framework, said the spokesman.The growing epidemic of cheap drugs such as spice and black mamba is turning Britain\u0027s town centres into places that people fear to go, a Tory MP has said.Ben Bradley urged the government to reclassify synthetic cannabinoids as class A drugs, warning their prevalence was becoming a serious national problem.The MP for Mansfield laid bare the devastating impact on communities, saying: Synthetic cannabis is one of the cheapest drugs on the market but also one of the strongest.The effects of these drugs can leave users resembling zombies slumped in a state of semi-consciousness sometimes foaming at the mouth, sometimes passed out in the street.This is clearly having a negative impact on town centres and local economies, it\u0027s causing anxiety amongst shoppers and business owners, decreasing footfall and discouraging families from spending the day in the town centre.Speaking in a Westminster Hall debate, Mr Bradley said the current class B classification was limiting the action that local services and the police could take, with forces struggling to deal with it on a local level.Such drugs, he added, were placing an absolutely huge resource drain on the NHS with extra strain being put on ambulance services, while prison officers were having to go home sick having inhaled fumes from people taking the drugs.Mr Bradley said one prime spot for users was right outside his constituency office and one of his staff members had regularly resuscitated people.Labour\u0027s Ruth Smeeth said one woman had a drug user jump into her car outside her house and refuse to get out, adding: My constituent\u0027s four-year-old daughter was in the car. She was forced to leap out in terror and is now terrified.A deal on the Irish border to break the Brexit deadlock is not close, the EU\u0027s chief negotiator has said.Michel\u0026nbspBarnier\u0026nbsptold Belgian broadcaster RTBF: For now, we are still negotiating and I am not, as I am speaking to you this morning, able to tell you that we are close to reaching an agreement, since there is still a real point of ergence on the way of guaranteeing peace in Ireland, that there are no borders in Ireland, while protecting the integrity of the single market.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar told the Theresa May\u0026nbspon Monday that he was ready to consider a review mechanism as part of a backstop arrangement to keep the border with Northern Ireland open after Brexit.But he made clear he would not accept an arrangement which gave the UK unilateral powers to ditch the customs union without the agreement of Brussels.It is not feasible to go back on the roll-out of universal credit, Whitehall\u0027s financial watchdog has said.Sir Amyas Morse told MPs he thought the time had passed to reverse the decision to roll six working age benefits into one, which Labour has promised to scrap.National Audit Office (NAO) head Sir Amyas told MPs: We wrote a report recently on universal credit where one of the comments in the report that I explicitly, personally, inserted into it was that I didn\u0027t think there was any feasible possibility of going back on the universal credit project at this time.I believe there were lots of things that could be done, possibly, better in it, but I didn\u0027t think one of those things was a meaningful discussion about going back to seven or eight different forms of benefit.I\u0027d thought we\u0027d got past that point. The change process had gone too far for that to happen.When it started there was a very ambitious approach of trying to do everything in an agile basis which clearly didn\u0027t work out well and which I think the department had great difficulty executing.Ms Denham told the fake news inquiry: The major concern that I have in this investigation is the very disturbing disregard that many of these organisations across the entire ecosystem have for the personal privacy of UK citizens and voters.If you look across the whole system, that is really what this report is about and we have to improve these practices for the future.Asked to which organisations she is referring, Ms Denham replied: Facebook, data brokers, political campaigns, data companies.As you know we\u0027re looking at political parties and their use of data so we really need to tighten up controls across the entire ecosystem because it matters to our democratic processes.Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham has told MPs there were problems with how Facebook attempted to ensure users\u0027 data was deleted by organisations like Cambridge Analytica.Facebook required signed confirmation the data had been deleted from the heads of organisations which obtained it, she said, but that was not always the case.We\u0027ve found some problems with the signing of those authorisations - some of them weren\u0027t signed at all, Ms Denham told the Commons Culture, Media and Sport committee.In addition, the Information Commissioner\u0027s Office (ICO) has evidence Cambridge Analytica still held some of the data as recently as spring 2018 despite claiming it had previously been deleted.The follow-up was less than robust and that\u0027s one of the reasons we fined Facebook £500,000, she added.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It’s vital that the government engages with the workforce and takes steps to ensure there is adequate capacity in place.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It will serve as an opportunity for businesses to reach people, he said.WhatsApp update finally brings stickers to messaging appThe status feature is something like the stories tool that appears in Instagram and Facebook, as well as WhatsApp. It allows people to post updates that will appear to all of their friends, letting them share photos or text and then letting it disappear afterwards.WhatsApp has struggled to come up with ways to show its users ads: without a feed, like Instagram or Facebook, there are few places for them to be injected.When it dropped its subscription fee in 2016, the company posted a blog post making clear that ads would never interrupt your communication, further adding to the issues about how advertising could be shown within the app.But the status feature appears to have solved that problem, allowing WhatsApp to slide marketing posts in between updates from friends, like it does with Instagram stories.As well as serving as something like a feed, WhatsApp\u0027s status feature has quickly become a huge part of the app. It now has a huge number of users, and is more popular than many major apps like Snapchat.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Europe and its security.”The French president continued: “We will not protect the Europeans unless we decide to have a true European army.“We need a Europe which defends itself better alone, without just depending on the United States, in a more sovereign manner.”Mr Macron was speaking in Verdun,\u0026nbspnortheast France, as part of a week-long tour of battlefields leading up to First World War Armistice centenary commemorations on Sunday.Macron says Britain could stay in the EU ‘for sure’ if it changes mindFrench voters explain why they’ve lost faith in MacronEmmanuel Macron’s approval rating falls to lowest point yet Macron urges EU leaders to stand firm against May in Brexit talksThe French head of state will receive world leaders including Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin for commemoration ceremonies in Paris on Remembrance Sunday.The election of Mr Trump to the White House appears to have given more urgency to the cause of boosting the EU’s defence capabilities, with leaders warning they cannot simply rely on the United States.European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker\u0026nbspsaid last year that “deference to Nato can no longer be used as a convenient alibi to argue against greater European efforts”.France is the strongest and most vocal\u0026nbspproponent of an EU army but\u0026nbspGermany has also tentatively endorsed Mr Macron’s proposals for a joint command structure for military interventions.A number of proposals have been put on the table for how EU nations could cooperate more closely on defence. The European Commission says closer defence cooperation “is not about creating an EU army”.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Members of the group Your Vote Matters encourage people to vote before an event hosted by US Senator Claire McCaskill as she campaigns for the US Senate in Saint Louis, Missour.

Egypt: 800 tombs discovered back to Pyramid of GizaThey now think the postholes were a key feature of the equipment which allowed hundreds of workers to haul giant blocks of stone more quickly than previously understood.It has long been theorised that the Egyptians used a system of ramps to help construct the Pyramids but the new finding suggests the ramps were steeper.This helps to lend weight to the theory the Egyptians used a complicated system of pulleys allowing builders to push and pull the blocks of stone with greater speed and ease.Roland Enmarch, a senior lecturer in Egyptology at the University of Liverpool and a co-director of the project that discovered the postholes, said the system has revolutionised theories about ancient Egyptian builders.Archaeologists think they might have solved the mystery of how the pyramids were built (Image: )He told the : \u0026ldquoThe system we have discovered would allow more people to exert force at one time, so it means you would be able to exert more force and move the blocks more quickly.The discovery was made in September meaning Dr Enmarch and his fellow director of the Institut Francais d\u0026rsquoarcheologic Orientale (IFAO), Dr Yannis Gourdon have yet to publish the findings in any peer-reviewed journal but added they intend to.Dr Enmarch said the alabaster quarry where the discovery was made has been known to Egyptologists since it was found by Howard Carter, the archaeologist who found the tomb of Tutankhamun.According to Dr Enmarch, his team had been in the quarry to document and study inscriptions but became fascinated by how it was constructed and if there was anything they could learn about how it compared to the construction of the pyramids.

The Netherlands and Spain were the only other EU countries in the top ten.That is some achievement for the UK. And demonstrates that the people who know where to invest, know it should be in the UK.They know we live in a dynamic nation, brimming with potential.So as we leave the European Union, we should remember the many reasons investors choose to put their money here in the United Kingdom, which is one of the world’s largest and most successful economies.We are at record levels of employment. Our success is underpinned by a legal system whose reputation is second to none. We have a skilled workforce and a low tax and a well-regulated economy.We are home to some of the finest universities, our research and development capabilities are cutting-edge and our financial institutions world-leading.We are in the right time zone to trade with Asia in the morning and the United States in the afternoon — and, of course, we speak English, the language of global business.Plus, there is serious global momentum behind businesses in the UK. We continue to attract more Foreign Direct Investmentthan anywhere  in Europe. And we are the number one choice in Europe for key strategic investments, such as headquarters. So it’s easy to see why more than , new businesses start up here every day.And it isn’t just small and medium-sized businesses. The UK has created  of Europe’s  companies valued at more than billion.Only this week Monzo, the British bank which operates through an app on your phone, secured £million of investment in order to double its workforce. This raised the company’s value to the £billion mark just three years after its formation.This is a fantastic vote of confidence in the UK and yet another sign that we have plenty to be optimistic about after we leave the EU.Investment creates jobs across all parts of the UK, pumps money into our communities and improves the lives of millions of people.Last year, FDI created , new jobs in the UK as well as safeguarding another ,.One reason we are seeing so much success is that this government has built an environment that makes investment and job creation easy.We are champions of free trade and we actively encourage businesses of all sizes — from start-ups to large corporations — to build trading links in all corners of the world.This weekend I’ll be representing the UK at the China International Import Expo in Shanghai where we are a “country of honour”.Over recent months, China has started to open up its market for UK goods and services, including dairy products, potatoes and petrol stations.And, this weekend, we intend to build on these achievements and create even more exciting opportunities for British companies.We also possess world-class talent. For example, we excel at research and development, which means that overseas companies want to tap into British expertise to advance the quality of their products. In last week’s Budget, we announced a further £.billion to strengthen the UK’s global leadership in science and innovation — that brings the total to £billion invested in research and development since .We want a partnership with business to make our country prosper.The Government’s Industrial Strategy includes innovative deals agreed with inidual sectors to attract investment. We are already reaping the rewards.The global marketplace never slows and we, too, must never stand still.Building on our impressive investment success, I have implemented the High Potential Opportunities scheme, which will deliver growth where it is most needed, often to previously overlooked areas.The success of the AgriTech programme in the West Midlands town of Telford and Leicestershire’s leading space sector cluster are proof the benefits of global investment are being felt in every part of the country.Over recent months, the Department for International Trade has led a series of investment roundtables, promoting UK industry to a global audience and driving foreign direct-investment into the UK as we prepare to leave the European Union.So far, these events have centred on tech, le sciences, automotive and agri-tech sectors and will soon start to focus on areas such as the creative industries.Initiatives such as this are going to be key in the coming months as we develop the UK’s own independent trade policy for the first time in more than  years.Working with businesses in the UK and overseas, I am determined to continue generating this flow of good news.But the facts tell a dferent story: Confidence in Britain is riding so high around the world that foreign investors are betting on it like never before.New UN figures show that in the first six months of  we were second only to booming China in attracting investment.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We want to see vibrant hubs where people live, shop, use services, and come together.I recognise that these challenges are linked. Empty shops and decreasing footfall on the high street can contribute to social problems such as crime, unemployment and loneliness, while successful high streets can make communities stronger.That is why this week I am launching the new Open Doors project to help regenerate the high street and support community groups.The scheme will match landlords of vacant commercial units with community groups offering vital services to younger and older people. The aim is to reduce loneliness among our most vulnerable members of the community, whilst increasing footfall in town centres.We know that there are already some really successful examples of landlords working with community groups to provide premises on a temporary basis, to the benefit of both parties.However, we know that landlords may not be aware of the benefits of these arrangements, and community groups may not know who to approach or how to negotiate a temporary contract.This Open Doors scheme will help to overcome these barriers and bring vital services, as well as footfall, to local high streets.This announcement follows the Chancellor’s Autumn Budget which confirmed a new £. billion plan to support and transform the high street.In July this year, we asked Sir John Timpson, a businessman with more than three decades’ experience of what makes our high streets tick, to look at what’s needed to respond to issues currently affecting the high street.He recommended we set up a national body to strengthen local leadership and establish a new fund to support the renewal and reshaping of town centres.So, in this Budget provided a new £ million Future High Street Fund to help local areas adapt to changes and to prepare long-term strategies.The money will help improve transport links, redevelop empty shops, and restore historic properties, keeping our high streets fit for generations to come.We’ve also established a new High Streets Taskforce to help local leaders prepare and implement new strategies for their town centres.Small retail businesses will see their business rates bills cut by a third, saving them up to £ million over two years.These actions will help create a more level playing field for all retailers.It’s against this optimistic backdrop that I will outline my vision for communities at next week’s Locality Convention.I have been clear about my department’s priorities – building the homes this country needs, supporting and strengthening communities, and boosting local growth.Our resolve to deliver on these commitments has been bolstered by a bold budget.Our communities and our high streets will not be left behind.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Most blame him for Brexit.But his really unforgivable error was to see “Thatcher” as a dirty word and dodgy Tony Blair as The Master.As a result, he failed to win an outright majority in  and happily shacked up with treacherous Lib Dem Nick Clegg.He bet on another cosy coalition in , only to land a majority and the unwelcome obligation to deliver his promised referendum.Keep chillaxing, Dave.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Despite applying early thinking he would be all prepared, now hes around £ in debt.He told the Sun Online: “My paycheque in August messed me up completely. When September came along and I had to pay my rent for October, I didn’t have anything there.“I had no money in the bank, I had been paying to get my baby clothes and things, and I was left with nothing.”Universal Credit looks at the earnings in one calendar month to work out how much Brits can get paid. But any income they get in that time can mean benefits may be slashed.Because Simon got paid from his old job during his assessment period, he was then told he had to wait until the next month for any help. Overall this meant he went more than eight weeks for his first benefits payment.He’s just one of hundreds of people who have said they are being pushed into debt on the new benefits system, which rolls six payments into one monthly sum.Last week the Chancellor revealed that Brits will be able to get more help moving onto Universal Credit - but those changes won’t come in until .He also announced Brits will be able to earn up to £ more as a result of changes in the work allowance, but those won’t start to kick in until April either.Simon said: “It was all because of that first payment,I had applied later it wouldn’t have happened.“The balance on my journal said zero.“I’m overdrawn and getting bank charges because the money just isn’t there. It’s not a great start to taking care of my son.”Simon, who previously worked as an agricultural engineer making equipment for brewers, had to take out a £ emergency advance to help him out, and is maxing out his credit card too.“My rent is , that didn’t even cover it,” he added.“I’ve cut lots of my bills, but my council tax is still £, I have to pay for food for both of us, and I can’t get out of my TV contract until next year.“I’ve worked all my le and only had to claim Jobseekers once for a few months - that was a lot easier. If the system ain’t broke, don’t fix it,” he said.He thought he would be getting around £ a month in total in Universal Credit - which would include help with his housing, child tax credits, child benefit and income support.In his first month he got £, and his second month he got £ after the debts he owed were taken off.He’s now £ in debt and struggling to buy food and pay off bills.“Just because I had my final pay cheque in August, it’s messed me up for September onwards.“I’m overdrawn on my bank account, and getting overdraft charges because the money isn’t here.”Baylfs and debt letters have been coming in too - all since he first was forced to apply for Universal Credit.To make matters worse, he’s got a court summons because he’s behind with his council tax.But luckily kind friends and family have been helping Simon out buying clothes and nappies for his little one.“Finley will be  months soon, he’s teething and I’m doing it all on my own, it’s a struggle.“Winter’s coming too and with a baby you have to have the heating on.“I can’t move somewhere cheaper because my family network and support are all here. Universal Credit is just so stressful.”A DWP spokesperson said: “Universal Credit payments reflect a household’s circumstances as closely as possible during each monthly assessment period.“A person’s income during their first assessment period, including final wages, will therefore be reflected in their initial payment. If earnings or circumstances change during subsequent assessment periods this is taken into account and payments will adjust.This ensures thata claimant’s income falls, they will see a rise in their UC payment.The new system will roll six benefits into one monthly payment - but has been beset with problems so far.MPs have even threatened to block the Universal Credit switch altogether unless protections are made for the vulnerable.Today The Sun revealed that a loophole in the Universal Credit system has let fraudsters claim £, in fake advance payments.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If Theresa doesn’t stare down the EU and win a mechanism that does this, the whole argument is immaterial as there is zero chance of passing the Commons.“She just doens’t have the numbers.”The  Cabinet ministers - its eight Leave campaigners, now joined by a handful of former Remainers - who have been dubbed ‘the Pizza Cabinet’ for their night time secret meetings over takeaway pizza.Another Cabinet source added: “It’s important for us to be able to say we really have taken back control and been true to the referendum result”.The choppy top table meeting comes as No sources say no deal is likely at all this week. And a prospective date for emergency EU summit with its  other leaders to agree any deal has also been pushed back to November  or .Irish premier Leo Varadkar also dug in yesterday as stand-off deepened to publicly insist he would never agree to giving the UK any “unilateral” decision making power to pull out of the border backstop.Mrs May phoned the Taoiseach to propose “a review mechanism” in a bid to find a compromise, which he said was open to considering.But Mr Varadkar warned it could only ever be triggered with the agreement of both sides, or the backstop “isn’t worth the paper it’s written on”.Mr Varadkar also said Dublin is now hoping to seal a Brexit deal “by the end of the year”, raising the possibility of talks stretching into December.Becauseshe fails to deliver the ­latter, all hell will break loose.It is incredible to see EU leaders demanding, with a straight face, the power to stop us finally leaving without their permission. They know they would never grant it — why would they Using the trumped-up Irish border “problem”, they would prevent us from ever signing our own trade deals. They would shackle forever the trade policy of the world’s fth-largest economy.Despite Brexit’s uncertainty, booming Britain has attracted the world’s second-highest levels of investment this year. That is exactly what the EU fears.It is why they want to neuter us as an independent trading power. Just imagine the hoots of triumph — and joyous disbelief — in Brusselsthey succeed.Being locked in a customs union, so central to the whole EU project, is not some minor detail. It destroys Brexit’s economic case.That’s why Tory MPs voted overwhelmingly against it.So Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab is right to warn the PM today that she MUST stare down the EU or face ruin.We must have the power to exit any “temporary” customs union or “Irish backstop” when WE alone decide.Anything  is abject defeat. Humiliation. A monstrous betrayal.If No Deal is the alternative, so be it.Voters have cut Mrs May a break until now. People know how hard her task is.Butshe capitulates now, at this key moment, that trust will vanish overnight.It came as Mrs May discussed the situation with Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz last night.A Downing Street spokesman said: The Prime Minister updated the chancellor on the progress of Brexit negotiations saying that % of the withdrawal agreement was now complete, and that she was confident that a solution could be found on the Northern Ireland backstop.The Prime Minister added that the UK wanted to see quick progress and that both the UK and the EU were working hard to achieve an agreement.With Austria holding the rotating presidency of the EU, the spokesman added: Chancellor Kurz said that the Austrian presidency stood ready to help facilitate an agreement as soon as possible.HMRC officials yesterday told MPs that two new inland depots would be used to inspect ‘suspicious’ freight to relieve pressure on ports in the event of a No Deal Brexit. But HMRC chief Jon Thompson warned: “The time to implement an optimal No Deal system has gone.”Health Secretary Matt Hancock hit back at Boris Johnson’s attack on the government’s soft Brexit plan yesterday, in which he branded it “an absolute stinker”.Mr Hancock insisted: “The frank truth is there isn’t another deal on the table. It doesn’t matter what rhetoric you use”.A giant poll of , voters last night claimed Brits would now vote to reverse the Brexit decision by % to % in a second referendum.More than  council areas have switched from backing Leave in  to Remain now, including the UK’s second largest city Birmingham.The survey was carried for last night’s Channel  programme Brexit: What The Nation Really Thinks.The PM last night replaced Tracey Crouch, who quit as Sports Minister last week, with Mims Davies.Downing Street said Nigel Adams becomes Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Wales Office, and an Assistant Government Whip.In other moves, Jeremy Quin is now a Government whip, Lord Commissioner of HM Treasury.And Gareth Johnson has been made assistant Government whip.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

According to new polling by YouGov, only three per cent of us think we aren’t handing the taxman enough — and just  per cent that most people pay too little.It’s hardly surprising. For most, the biggest thing they want politicians to tackle in their own lives is the cost of living. The more the taxman takes, the harder it gets to cope.Yet when you talk to ordinary people about tax, you find out that it is not a financial issue. It’s a moral one.They’re not greedy. Or selfish. They know the NHS needs money. And the police.But they also know thatthe state takes too much of what you earn, you’re not going to bother earning it in the first place.So they think that you should always workyou can — but that it should always pay to work. Andthe Government is taking more than half, you’re working for them, not for you.That’s why our think tank, the Centre for Policy Studies, is urging ministers to embrace two vital principles, outlined in our latest report.First, you shouldn’t have to pay tax before you’ve earned the bare minimum. One of the best things the Conservatives have done — inspired by our think tank — was to raise the amount you can earn before you pay income tax. At the most recent Budget, Philip Hammond hiked it to £, a year — from just £, back in .But there’s a sting in the tail. People aren’t paying income tax — but they’re still paying National Insurance, which is income tax by another name. We estimate that .million people have been “taken out of tax” — but are actually still paying it.And there’s another problem — at least for the politicians. Raising the personal allowance has kept take-home pay above water since the financial crisis.But just nine per cent of those we and YouGov surveyed knew it had gone up by that much, and  per cent said they hadn’t noticed it in their pay packet.That may be why just  per cent told us the Tories were the party of low taxes.That’s why we suggest a new universal basic income, a new right, for every worker, that the first £, a month will be free of both income tax and National Insurance. That’s a £ tax cut, which takes those .million people out of tax completely. And it should be front-and-centre on every pay packet.The next idea is just as important. It is that the taxman should let you keep at least p of every extra £ you earn — a work guarantee.At the moment, our tax system is riddled with points where you suddenly face a great big spike in what you pay.For the rich, it happens when your salary hits £,, and your tax rate soars to  per cent as that personal allowance is clawed back.But the biggest victims are those trying to come off welfare into work. In some cases, they only get to keep p in every extra £. So it’s no wonder they’re tempted to give up.This happens because even as the tax system gives, the benefits system tries to claw it back. That’s why we’re asking the Government to cut the rate at which Universal Credit is withdrawn to p in the £, to ensure it always pays you to climb the income ladder.Of course, this kind of thing costs money. We don’t want to copy Labour and go back to borrowing billions that we can’t afford. Or to scrimp on the NHS.But given the Government is spending more than £BILLION a year, there’s certainly room for some savings.For example, we currently spend £billion a year trying to encourage people to chip into a pension — yet have the lowest savings rate since records began. And that cash is spent woefully inefficiently — because the relief is based on your original tax bill, the top one per cent get as much help as the bottom  per cent, even though they need much less incentive to save.Replacing the current pension with an ISA-style system, where you got an up-front bonus for saving, would be simpler and more effective — and save us billions that we could use to help people right now.Andthe Government doesn’t like that idea, we’ve got plenty more.A forthcoming report of ours identies a dozen ideas for saving public money, adding up to £billion a year — from pegging Whitehall’s admin costs to the private sector, to eliminating wasteful and economically distorting subsidies, to reducing duplication in local government.Eventhe Government thinks it can’t find the money now, it needs to put making work pay at the heart of its future decisions. Not least because it is wildly popular.The universal working income is backed by  per cent to nine per cent. The work guarantee by  per cent to  per cent. These aren’t Tory ideas, they’re backed overwhelmingly by voters across the board.Perhaps that’s because these ideas embody what we all know to be true. Everyone who can work, should work. But people will only workit pays them to do so.The job for the politicians is to make damn sure it does.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But it would be a national calamitythey were ever able to do the same to our country.“To stop that, Conservatives don’t just need to expose what Labour has become under Jeremy Corbyn, we also need to beat them in the battle of ideas.”Changing the National Insurance threshold would cost around £. billion and cutting the UC taper rate up to £ billion as part of an overall £. billion package of reforms set out by the think tank.It suggested abolishing upfront tax relief on pension contributions and efficiency savings in public sector spending could help fund the reforms.Tom Clougherty, head of tax at the Centre for Policy Studies, said: “The purpose of these reforms is to ensure that whatever your circumstances, and whatever your earnings, work will always pay.“We’ve made great strides over the last eight years in taking millions of low-earners out of income tax, but now we need to go further and take them out of National Insurance as well.“The British public deserve a tax system that encourages and rewards aspiration and hard work at every level.

The PM said that more work was needed before the plans are ready.However, theres just a week left before No Deal preparations are set to be ramped up, and serious plans get the green light to begin.She got a boost last night from Brussels as it emerged that Eurocrats were willing to offer a compromise on the backstop - sending the pound soaring overnight as hopes for a deal rose.But today Michel Barnier and Irish PM Leo Varadkar both doubled down on their stances, and expressed doubt that a deal was even close.Michel Barnier said this morning: I’m not in a position to tell you that we’re close to a deal because there’s still a real point of ergence.He later said any backstop cannot have a time limit.And the Irish PM said: There can be no expiry date and there can be no unilateral exit clause, andit were to be either of those things, the backstop would not be worth the paper it was written on.He said he was open to creative solutions such as a review clause, but insisted he had committed to nothing yet.No sources say no deal is likely at all this week, but Mrs May is set to redouble efforts to get an agreement signed off within three weeks, so theres enough time for MPs to vote on it.A special summit could be hosted later this monththe Cabinet and EU negotiators agree on a draft to solve the issue.However, Jeremy Hunt warned the PM today that her MPs wouldnt support the Irish plans unless we have the right to end the customs union deal at a time of our choosing.The Sun revealed today that Brexit boss Dominic Raab and other pro-Leavers were set to urge Mrs May to face down the EU and insist that our demands are non-negotiable.They called on the PM to insist on a mechanism in the Brexit deal for Britain to stay in control of how long it stays in any backstop customs union to keep the Irish border open.The so-called backstop proposal is a back-up plan for what will happen with Northern Ireland in the event Britain and the EU dont get a trade deal after we leave the bloc.Ireland will be staying in the EU but Northern Ireland is leaving, and both sides are keen to avoid ato the hard border which saw so much fighting and violence during the Troubles.Both sides want to make sure there are as few checks between North and South as possible.Brussels wants Northern Ireland to remain part of the EUs customs unionwe dont get a Brexit deal to ensure trade flows smoothly.But the PM says she cant possible split off Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK.Not least because that would anger her allies in the DUP, which Mrs May relies upon to keep her Government afloat.She wants to keep all of the UK in a customs uniontheres no Brexit deal.However, Brexiteers wont accept us being tied to the EU forever - and their rules.They want to make sure Britain can have an exit mechanism so we can get out when we choose.Brussels wants it to be a mutual decision.This issue has been troubling Brexit talks for months, and is one of the final sticking points in signing off a Withdrawal bill in the coming weeks.If Brussels had the power to sign off our exit, they could keep us tied to the bloc for as long as they wanted.The -month transition period will see negotiators thrash out an agreement to keep trade flowing, but the backstop proposal is to decide what happens in the event talks break down in that time.Bloomberg reported that the UK could commit to a union that we could only leave by mutual consent with the EU - but that would mean Brussels would get the power to decide.They said that new options were being put to ministers today.No dont think a deal sill be signed off this week, but prospective dates for a an emergency Brexit summit are being discussed already.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We would like to apologise to any guests who did not have a positive experience at our event.We are listening to all feedback very carefully and will take the appropriate action to continue to improve this event, so that we can bring it to the level of our other touring shows.As with any new conceptual event it is particularly dficult to meet the ying expectations of a wide range of guests from all walks of le, however we must strive to do so.We have made a vigorous investment into the show, intentionally running it at a loss in Bristol in order to make signicant improvements for our guests.At present we have  refund requests out of our , guests, which is a level that we want to bring down to zero for future events.Organisers confirmed they had received about  complaints after the weekend.The festival had previously received complaints after it headed to Liverpool last month.And one frustrated visitor, Anna Heyes, pointed out: Youd think theyd have the cajones to pull the event, go back to the drawing board, do some decent market research, some proper project management and then launch an event they can be proud of and make money from and that wed all enjoy and promote!Its frustrating how they keep getting it SO wrong!However others said the event had been fine, with one writing: At the end of day its a chocolate festival, you cant really do much with chocolate to make the whole  hour event exciting.Others who have booked for the event - which will be held across the UK, including Oxford, Edinburgh and Leicester - are now hoping to get refunds.People have shared advice about how to get a refund, saying it was possible through Eventbrite."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000447300590.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"werepup parents werewolf babies","story":"Were talking about the hundreds of adults who have become the proud parents of WerePups - ultra-lelike dolls modelled on a cross between a baby and a werewolf.The cult creations, which are as as realistic as they are repulsive, are all hand-made, unique and priced at up to ,- but that hasnt stopped fans from snapping up WerePups faster than they can be manufactured.In fact, the dolls have spawned a huge following and created a community of owners who are happy to spend thousands more lavishing their pup with clothes and accessories.Theyll even strap their hairy pup into a pram and take it out for walks - often attracting horried stares from passers-by.And for many parents, the dolls have become as real as human babies, with the community of ownerstaking to Facebook groups to share parenting tips with other mums and dads.If youre currently screwing your face up in confusion, then youre not alone.Even Holly and Phil struggled to hide their bafflement when the proud owner of a family of WerePups appeared on This Morning to talk about her hairy brood.The first time I saw a WerePup I did a quadruple take, admitted Yvette, from Burbank, Calornia who has nine pups and spent spent more than £, on accessories alone.I had to keep turning around and looking because I wasnt quite sure what I was seeing, she added. Then I realised: thats a little werewolf baby. And I just fell in love.Like many wolf parents, Yvette first laid eyes on one of the hairy little critters at a horror convention.Its here where many fans fall for the kooky creatures, which are often either bought as a rare accessory or as an unconventional substitute for a real baby. Some buyers have even asked for wolves modelled on lost pets.Theyre expensive - I didnt get one right away, Yvette says. But I eventually got one, and now I have a whole family of them.One of her babies was made with her own hair, which she lost while undergoing chemotherapy, while another was custom-made to include a pair of real teeth from a cat skeleton she had found.WerePups naturally attract a lot of attention in public, particularly when their owners are carrying them around asthey are real babies.Earlier this year, a WerePup parent freaked out an entire carriage full of passengers on the Subway when he was spotted cradling one of the creatures on his lap.As Yvette says: A lot of people dont say anything -  they just stare. Its always nice when people do come up and say something.WerePups are becoming an international phenomenon, but their biggest audience is currently in the States.Its here, in a family home in the town of Coaldale, Pennsylvania, where artist Asia Eriksen painstakingly creates every single WerePup by hand.The special effects expert, , casts the baby wolves from a series of moulds before detailing and painting them, and then applying the hair one strand at a time, in a process which can take up to three weeks from start to finish.Its a fairly tedious process, Asia admits. You have to sit with a little needle and plug hair into it. Most of the time I spend doing this - its the longest part.Since , Asia has made and shipped out over  WerePups - and theres currently so much demand for her work that shes had to temporarily stop taking orders.Even the legendary shock rocker Alice Cooper has bought one, although his - complete with his iconic eye make-up - is arguably more creepy than usual.Alice has even used his pup as a tour prop, dangling it from one hand on stage and holding it as he sings.Horror fanatic Asia works from a laboratory in her home, which is scattered with clumps of hair, dismembered wolf heads and clay baby limbs which look eerily like the real deal.These creations look so convincing because they are coated in silicone - the same material used to make sex dolls - to give the skin a lelike feel and to ensure that the wolfs body is weighted like a real babys.When people askWerePups are real, its incredibly rewarding, she says.Just to think that,only for a moment, I somehow made somebody believe in an impossible creature.The idea behind WerePups came from a film called Silver Bullet, where theres a scene which briefly shows a baby werewolf being cradled by its mother.Asia was fascinated by imagining what a werewolf pup would really look like, and so she set about making her own model with a hand from her husband Anders, a fellow special effects artist.She then started putting her creations in nappies and dresses and taking litters of wolves along to horror conventions, where she soon found that people were willing to hand over thousand for their very own bespoke baby monster.Today, with hundreds of WerePups out in the wild, there is a whole community of parents who have bonded over their love for the creepy creatures.A Facebook page called WerePup Mammas and Papas lets people share photos of their pups and discuss caring for them in the same way as the many online communities dedicated to parenting.The only dference is that when these mums and dads talk about their little monsters, they really mean it in a literal sense.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York last month, Macron attacked Trump’s policies on Iran, Arab-Israeli peace, climate change and migration. In a thinly veiled attack on Mr Trump’s America First-style of nationalism, Macron also said: “Nationalism always leads to defeat.“If courage is lacking in the defence of fundamental principles, international order becomes fragile and this can lead as we have already seen twice, to global war. We saw that with our very own eyes.”In his radio interview today a bombastic Macron said: “We need a Europe which defends itself better alone, without just depending on the United States, in a more sovereign manner.”The EU launched a multi-billion-euro defence fund last year designed to develop Europe’s military capacities and make the continent more strategically independent.France has also led the creation of a nine-country force designed to be capable of rapidly mounting a joint military operation.Macron said: “Peace in Europe is precarious.“We have been hit by intrusion attempts in cyber-space and multiple interventions in our democracies.”Marcon also warned of authoritarian powers which are reemerging and rearming within the confines of Europe”.He has noted similarities between the world today and the financial crisis and “the nationalism which played on peoples fears” in the s.The president said: “The peace and prosperity which Europe has enjoyed for  years are a golden moment in our history..”Following the Europe  interview, aides to Mr Macron made it clear that he was not suggesting the USA was a military threat to Europe.Instead, he was highlighting how Mr Trump’s country could no longer be relied upon to defend the continent."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000392903578.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may new energy price cap rise january 2019","story":"Ofgem today confirmed plans to introduce a cap on million standard iable bills – setting the price for January  at £, a year.But Ofgem chief Dermot Nolan said an increase would almost inevitably have to be announced just weeks later given the spiralling cost of electricity on wholesale markets.Under the Government’s new plans the price cap is reviewed every Spring and Autumn.Mr Nolan said: “We will be making an announcement in February and it’s true that the underlying cost of producing electricity has risen.”He insisted Ofgem would only be “passing through costs” and “no company would profiteer”.But analysts said a price rise of £ was on the cards.City experts JP Morgan said: “Ofgem admit that it is likely that in February  it will announce an increase in the level of the cap to take effect in April.“We estimate that the increase, based on wholesale prices today, would be around £, implying a cap from April of £,.”Switching site LookAfterMyBills said the rise could be closer to £.The revelation threatens to humiliate the Government – given its vow that the new cap was being introduced to protect customers from eye-watering tarfs.Theresa May last year vowed the price cap would SAVE families £ a year by ending a £.billion rip-off.Energy Minister Claire Perry yesterday insisted the Government had “delivered on its promise”.

Fresh concerns have been raised over a nursing shortfall post-Brexit according to a review. In England, the latest nursing vacancy rate figure is ,. But analysis shows this could rise by , after we leave the EU meaning an overall shortfall of more than ,. The authors of the report from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, explored the trends in the health and social care sectors workforce, including the role of European nationals working for the NHS.  It estimates that in the short run, the UK may have an additional shortage of around , nurses. And projecting this shortfall over the remaining period of Brexit transition to , there maybe a shortfall of , to , nurses. There are also concerns about the immigration system for EU nationals after we leave.At the moment many social care and health jobs do not fulfil the requirements for the minimum skills or salary levels of the current system for wokers from outside the EU. The report, which was commissioned by the Cavendish Coalition of  health and care charities, also warns that waiting times for patients are increasing in NHS Trusts which are losing more European workers, particularly nurses. The Royal College of Nursing has repeatedly warned that Brexit is likely to exacerbate the nursing shortfall. In the  months since the referendum, before the UK has formally left the bloc, the number of EEA nurse joiners to the NHS in England fell by .% while the number of leavers rose by .%. These startling figures should be taken extremely seriously by those negotiating our departure from the EU, said Danny Mortimer, co-convenor of the coalition and chief executive of the NHS Employers organisation.  The health and social care sector is deeply reliant on talented colleagues from across Europe and the rest of the world so it is deeply disheartening to see these projected workforce gaps at a time of rising demand for services. The government has said that all EU nationals in the UK before the leave date of  March  will have a right to stay. Those that have been here for five years can apply for settled status meaning they can stay here indefinitely. But so far around , people – just .% of the total number of EU citizens in the UK – have been granted settled status. The report calls for the Home Office to guarantee that its settled status programme for EU nationals will be honoured in the event of a no-deal Brexit. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: We greatly value the contribution of nurses to the NHS and we hope those from the EU will take up the early opportunity to secure their future in the UK.

But in todays epic meeting - which did not make a single decision - she tried to bat away talk of compromise. Tory Brexiteers fear the UK will agree a backstopthat keeps us tied to EU customs rules with no clear way of pulling out. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab is said to have demanded the power to unilaterally quit the backstop - an idea Ireland branded unacceptable. Now Mrs May has attempted to unite her ministers at a y meeting of the Cabinet in Downing Street.  She told them % of a withdrawal agreement was complete.But on the backstop - which would kick intheres no deal to avoid border checks in Northern Ireland - many issues need work, she said. These are the most dficult, Mrs Mays official spokesman told journalists today. It was a long discussion - every member of Cabinet spoke. The spokesman insisted Mrs May agreed there must be a mechanism to ensure the UK could not be held in a backstop indefinitely.  She said that while the UK should aim to secure a withdrawal agreement as soon as possible, this should not be done at any cost, the spokesman said. Mrs May stressed that any orce deal would be subject to the EU and UK finalising a framework on their future relationship in areas like trade and security. This is now expected to be set out in a separate political declaration. Mrs May assured ministers that there would be another meeting of Cabinet before any withdrawal agreement is sealed.The Spectator today reported the second meeting could happen later this week.  But her spokesman said no extra meeting has yet been scheduled ahead of the weekly gathering next Tuesday. Ministers also discussed how town halls were preparing for a no-deal exit and the importance of “making everyone aware of their responsibilities”. It comes after the Mirror reported town halls have been warned to brace for three months of disruption with runs on fuel and food. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell warned any decision to extend customs rules across the UK must be permanent.  The Labour MP said: I think the key issue now is the Customs Union, its permanency. If its not permanent I cant see how business, investors or anyone can take a view that they can secure long term investment.We couldnt support anything other than a permanent arrangement. Theres been this dispute from what we hear about Raab and his review after  months or  months - that gives no certainty whatsoever.  John McDonnell also compared the PMs vows of a brighter future to Neville Chamberlain proclaiming peace for our time - a year before the Second World War. Its all wish and hope, Mr McDonnell said. Its almost Neville Chamberlain like, Peace in our time, the thing unpicks over a period of time.

The %-% result was predicted by polling firm Survation after it ran the biggest survey in the two years since the vote. Some , people were questioned in a Survation poll for Channel  which estimated  local authority areas that voted Leave in  would now be carried by the Remain side. Channel Four said a multi-level modelling technique, which successfully predicted the  general election result, had been used in the exercise. They excluded those who were undecided in order to deliver the -% breakdown.In a no deal scenario, a majority of voters would back staying in the EU, at least temporarily, according to the poll.  The survey found that in a no deal situation % believe Britain should remain in the EU, while % would want to delay leaving to allow more time for talks, and % would wish to quit the bloc. Asked how they would votethe Government secured a deal and it was put to the people, % said they would reject it, % accept it, % did not know, and % indicated they would not vote.  Justice Secretary David Gauke told the Channel  programme that revealed the results: If we leave on no deal terms theres is no good shying away, it will be very bad for us economically. If we can get a good deal, and that means removing all the frictions. The Chequers-type deal, as I say,we dont have friction with trade, then, economically, I dont think its going to make a particular big dference one way or the other. Figures showed that % of people thought Brexit would be good for immigration levels, while % said it would be bad, and % said it would make no dference.  And % said immigration more generally has had a positive influence on Britain. Former Ukip leader Nigel Farage said: Funny isnt it  On the one hand we are being told Brexit has made people hostile towards migrants, on the other we are told we are more relaxed about it. You cant have it both ways. The truth of it is, the reason those figures have changed is a big chunk of the electorate think the immigration issue has been dealt with because we voted Brexit, and they think our major political parties will carry out their wishes. Actually, the pennys not yet dropped. That there is no intention for this Government or this opposition to deal with open door immigration.  The modelling technique showed that support for leaving the EU has fallen most dramatically in the local authorities areas that saw the highest leave vote shares in . Some % said they would support a second referendum that was a binary choice between a deal and staying in, with % opposing a vote on those terms. However, while it was backed by % of people who voted Remain, it was backed by just % of Leave voters.

National Audit Officehead Sir Amyas told the Commons Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee: We wrote a report recently on Universal Credit where one of the comments in the report that I explicitly, personally, inserted into it was that I didnt think there was any feasible possibility of going back on the Universal Credit project at this time. I believe there were lots of things that could be done, possibly, better in it, but I didnt think one of those things was a meaningful discussion about going back to seven or eight dferent forms of benefit. Id thought wed got past that point. The change process had gone too far for that to happen. The Mirror are demanding a halt to the expansion of Universal Credit and for a review to take place. We say there are three options:Redesign UC to be fit for purpose Axe it in favour of the old systemUC is unfixable Introduce a brand new systemSign our petition to stop the rollout of Universal Credit across Britain and to replace it with a fairer system by signing our petition. When it started there was a very ambitious approach of trying to do everything in an agile basis which clearly didnt work out well and which I think the department had great dficulty executing. Sir Amyas said UC was now moving forward on a test and learn basis.In last weeks budget the Chancellor announced he was pouring an extra poundbillion into Universal Credit after coming under increased pressure from the Mirror and MPs.Announcing the new measures on Monday, Esther McVey s confirmed many struggling families will only have to go three weeks without payment - not five. Debt repayments will be cut, a one-month deadline to switch benefits will be extended to three and help for the self-employed will be increased. But the government have stopped short of agreeing to move benefit claimants to UC automatically - instead they will have to file a new claim.

Weve called on top chefs from Toby Carvery and - with this Sunday being Remembrance Sunday - The Royal Navy, who between them serve up thousands of roast dinners for hungry civvies and troops every week. Toby Carvery - the Home of the Roast - has long been a supporter of the armed forces, offering free meals to troops on Armed Forces Day.  So we arranged for Toby Carvery Chef Trainer James Smith to visit The Royal Navys galley on board HMS Northumberland to help rally the troops with a bumper feast alongside the Royal Navys Chef Mitchell - and give the rest of us a lesson in cooking the perfect roasties in the exclusive behind-the-scenes video above. Toby Carvery Chef Trainer James said he was proud of his restaurants long-standing commitment to the armed forces and championed the importance of people getting together to enjoy a meal - be it at home, away serving for their country or at their local Toby Carvery. He said: For many families, roast dinners are that one time everybody gets around that dining table. A really good roast dinner is just like having a really big hug on a plate! And he went on to reveal the secret Toby twist to cooking the perfect roast potatoes.  Its all about the ruffling, he explains, shaking a tray of uncooked but peeled and chopped spuds. You want to shake them up and make sure you break the edges of the potatoes up. Then that will give us a really nice, crisp roast potato.  The Royal Navys Chef Mitchell also lets viewers in on how to make fantastic gravy. He says: We always go for a nice smooth, thick gravy. We normally put in a bit of red wine to give it a dferent taste. Ive even put Marmite in! Chef James finally lts the lid on how knock up fantastic Yorkshire puddings in the clip, adding: The trick to Yorkshires is making sure youve got really hot oil.

Researchers who polled , mums and dads who have weaned their baby within the last five years found today’s youngsters are getting their first taste of more exotic foods at just months old - and are enjoying it. Around one in seven babies also love the taste of houmous, while one in twenty even loved to tuck into quinoa. Others enjoyed cous cous, aubergine and even lemon on the first try. It’s not all modern foods though, with toad in the holeand chicken kormapopular meals to serve up for babies. But Brussel sprouts are most likely to leave babies screwing their face up in disgust.  It also emerged  per cent of parents felt confused about what foods they should be feeding their baby in the early months, with  per cent overwhelmed by conflicting advice about when they should begin weaning. David Lawlor, from WaterWipes, which commissioned the research to mark the new wipes with added Soapberry, said: “Far from being fussy, millennial babies love tucking into a iety of unusual dishes and exciting flavours. “With the iation in our diets now, and exotic food more readily available than ever before, a baby’s first foods are changing. “But as any parent will tell you, a baby enjoying a meal can be a messy experience. No matter how much they are loving the taste, most of it will still end up anywhere but in their mouth.  Researchers who polled parents from the UK and Irish parents also found that on average, parents begin to wean their children around six months old. But convenience is key - while  per cent of parents served their babies home-cooked meals from scratch when weaning,  per cent simply mashed or pureed whatever food they had for their own meal. And after feeding their youngsters, parents have found food in some unexpected places. A third found food on the kitchen wall , a fth found some in their bra or under their topand some even found that food had made its way to the hallway after mealtime had ended .  Forty-six per cent of babies also ended up with food under their bottom,  per cent had some behind their ears and  per cent were left with food under their feet. As a result, almost six in  parents admitted there were times when they chose what to feed their child based on the amount of mess it would make, opting for the least-messiest meal. One in twenty even said the mess that comes with feeding babies is one of the biggest challenges about weaning. Pre-planning what to cook, preparing the meal and getting the baby to eat what you make are also among the challenges that parents face when it comes to feeding their babies.  To celebrate the launch of WaterWipes with Soapberry, the company has teamed up with parenting influencer and recipe expert Natasha Corrett to create the ultimate “messy menu” of five dishes for parents to try as inspiration during the weaning stage. Lawlor added: “We’re really proud to launch WaterWipes with Soapberry so we can help parents during this exciting, but messy stage in their baby’s le. “We believe there is never a good time to put chemicals on your skin.These recipes can be found on the WaterWipes Facebook page. foods babies like on the first tasteYoghurt Mashed banana Pasta Mashed sweet potato Steamed veggies Stewed apple Rusks Soft cheese Meatballs Mangos Mashed Butternut squash Mashed fish Tomatoes Peanut butter Avocados Salmon Houmous Cous Cous Pumpkin Soup LentilsTop  disliked foodsBrussel Sprouts Lemon Mushrooms Eggs Broccoli Grapefruit Fish Meat Pesto"},{"url":null,"title":"mum 31 says shes ageing","story":"NewsMum, , says shes ageing backwards and is the real-le Benjamin ButtonAlice Dawson, from Colchester, Essex, claims people mistake her for a teenager - and she evens gets asked to show ID for drinks on nights outShareCommentsByBradley Jolly:,  NOV NewsThe mum, pictured now, says coconut oil and a healthy lestyle has helped her maintain her looks \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mum who claims she is ageing backwards regularly gets mistaken for a teenager and asked to show ID for drinks on nights out. Alice Dawson, , says her skincare routine, drinking plenty of water and eating a healthy diet has led to strangers believing she is as young as . But bizarrely, the mother-of-two admits she was often mistaken for a middle-aged woman when she was actually a teenager. Alice, from Colchester, Essex, said: I agree that I have an element of Benjamin Button about me. I do suppose I am going backwards. I dont really know why I look older in that picture than I do in the now picture. Its a really bad, bad look.  I know there will come a point where I wont look younger and Ill start to look older but at the moment I think Im doing quite well. A lot of people have said I look older in the other photo. I find that quite surprising because in person I think Ive aged quite badly from sun beds and things like that. The stay-at-home mum swears by coconut oil as her go-to skin care product. She also avoids fried food and drinks just water throughout the day to keep herself refreshed.  Alice continued: A lot of people do say I do look young for my age so I cant look that bad. I used to get IDed every time up until two years ago, and now I only get IDed every time I go out out. Ive never been accused of having fake ID but some people have looked up and gone really . They do look surprised when they see my birthday. I quite like being thought of as younger. Sometimes it annoys me a little bit because I feel like I look too young. I know that sounds stupid, but I just say I wish people would take me seriously like Im an adult.  I never felt like I looked older when I was younger. Even my mum used to say to me that I have a young face. Back in the day we didnt have contouring and all that stuff we do now. I had no clue how to do makeup and that kind of thing so maybe thats why I look older.I think my face has slimmed out a bit and my features show out a bit more too. I dont knowthats why I look younger now. But Alice admits she has wrinkles, and believes everyone should celebrate their imperfections. You can see imperfections in yourself more than other people can. I definitely have some around my eyes but I suppose everyone does really. Theyre your laughing lines. I really hope I carry on ageing well.

There were two members of staff right there but they ignored me when I fell - when I approached them, they just offered me some tissue.

They told me there is no CCTV footage which I find hard to believe since I was close to the alcohol aisle. I have only received generic email responses apologising for the incident.  I was very upset - I just want them to take ownership of their actions. The situation now has caused me more stress than the actual incident.

She had ballooned to st lb at her heaviest but now weighs st fraclbs. The qualied nursery practitioner this week was crowned Slimming World’s Woman of the Year  at a glamorous event in central London.  Maxine, from Chester-le-Street, County Durham, said: I didn’t want to die on the operating table and never meet my nephew, so I decided to join Slimming World instead and I’m so glad I did. Even though I knew people who had been successful with Slimming World, I was still petried and it took me three weeks to actually walk through the doors. I worried the other members would stare at me or that I was so big I’d break the scales. This was my last chance though and I had to do it. Everyone was really friendly so I had nothing to worry about and I lost a massive lbs in my first week – for the first time in my le I felt like there was light at the end of the tunnel.

Maxine has struggled with her weight since a very young age after being born with a rare bone disease, called Blount’s disease, which affected her mobility. She said she is hugely grateful for the support at her slimming classes.  She continued: It’s not a diet because there’s nothing you can’t have and there’s no need to go hungry. I’ve learned how to make the healthiest choices and can even eat outI want to. My favourite dish has to be a Slimming World-style kebab, it’s really satisfying and tastes so naughty but it’s not at all. My husband John enjoys the same meals too now. I hope I’m proof to people that there’s never any amount of weight you can’t lose. Everything’s changed. I don’t hide away anymore.

The giant low pressure vortex could see mm of rain dumped and gusts of mph, disrupting the south and west from tomorrow until the weekend, with wet and windy conditions continuing into next week. The Met Office issued a yellow weather warning for rain, with heavy showers mainly expected to affect south Wales and southwest England early on Wednesday.

Ex-BBC and Met Office forecaster John Hammond said: “This week, a huge vortex of low pressure in the eastern Atlantic will see the jet stream fling a succession of wet and windy spells towards UK. “The potential for disruptive winds needs to be watched.

So far three storms have hit the country this Autumn, with Ali and Bronagh arriving in September and Callum the month after.

Ellen Santana, , scooped the top prize at the sexiest backside competition at the grand finale of the world famous competition in Satildeo Paulo. But before the surprise winner was able to give her victory speech, bitter rival Aline Uva ran on stage and ripped the winner’s ribbon from her body. Amid boos and catcalls from the crowd and other contestants she then launched into a tirade against the winner accusing her of having a “plastic” bottom. Aline, representing Rio Grande do Sul state, came into the Miss Bumbum final as favourite to clinch the title after polling the most online votes.But a  of judges in the live final placed her twelth.  Aline, , who refused to give back the winner’s ribbon, later told journalists: “I’m the only woman who deserves to be the winner.I played by the rules, and my bumbum is  per cent natural, unlike the winner who has a plastic bottom. “Miss Bumbum is a complete farce, and I’ve proved it. If it was a serious competition I would have won.” Winner Ellen later denied she had enhanced her cm-wide bottom with surgery, saying: “She took my ribbon but she can never take away my title. “I deserve this title because my butt is the firmest. But it’s not just about the bottom, it’s about character too, which I have and she doesn’t. “Now I want to be an inspiration to women around the world, to show them that they can achieve everything they dream of, whatever adversaries they face.” Second place in the world-famous bottom competition went to -year-old Flaacutevia Tamaio, an estate agent representing Brazil’s Distrito Federal.  And the first transexual ever to compete, Paula Oliveira, , came third - despite other contestants claiming she should never have been allowed to enter the competition, after she underwent sex change surgery six years ago.

Each judge gave a score between  and  for each of the women’s two appearances before votes were counted. But confusion broke out after the Ellen Santana, representing the state of Rondocircnia, was named the last contest’s surprise victor. As organisers tried to persuade bitter rival Aline to hand back the winner’s ribbon, the other women shouted: “Accept it, you lost. Ellen’s the champion. You’re a bad loser.”  Founder Cacau Oliver later said: “This is a competition where feelings run high, these fights are part of it. But it will be bad for her and for usshe doesn’t give back her winner’s ribbon.” Miss Bumbum has gained worldwide notoriety since the competition began in , with winners catapulted to overnight fame in Brazil. Each year thousands of women are whittled down to , each representing a Brazilian state, before a public vote sends  through to the live final.

The first Miss Bumbum World is also due to take place in Moscow next May, where the planet’s sexiest bottom will be crowned. Explaining why Miss Bumbum has come to an end in Brazil, Cacau said: “Miss Bumbum has become Brazil’s biggest beauty competition, and one of the most famous in the world. “Only the Rio carnival gets more media coverage, and our winners have gone on to become household names, ambassadors of the Brazilian bottom around the world. “But all good things come to an end.

Unite had no prior knowledge to the company’s announcement.#The flexibility agreement proposes a potential two-phase plan, which would be monitored on an annual basis.In the first year , the plan would have seen the workforce voluntarily reduce by a number of jobs and a move to a dferent production regime of four set shts.The current sht pattern is five set sht rotation on a monthly basis.In year two ,market conditions had not improved, then Unite’s plan included an option of further voluntary redundancies and a move to a three set sht pattern.The flexibility agreement plan ensured no reduction in terms and conditions over this period for the remaining workforce.At the end of this period, Unite and the company would re-assess the market situation.During talks today, it was agreed to set up an action group of interested parties to explore all options to secure a sustainable future for the site.The statement added: #Unite has also today held meetings with the cabinet secretary for finance, economy and fair Work, Derek MacKay, and Dundee City Council to discuss the immediate establishment of an Action Group that will work towards keeping the Michelin factory open.#In addition, Unite has held further meetings on site with company management and the Cabinet Secretary.#Marc Jackson, Unite Michelin convener said: “It is important to stress to the workforce and the wider community in Dundee that Unite has a viable plan on the table. It is a plan that can work for the workforce and the company.#The flexibility agreement, which we believed would be signed-off this week, takes into consideration the current challenging market conditions but we have a plan in place to manage this situation over the coming years.”“The creation of an action group involving Unite and other key stakeholders is an important and positive step forward.#The workforce can be assured that Unite will work tirelessly to ensure that this flexibility agreement is reconsidered by the Michelin Group and that the factory can stay open.”STATEMENT: Action group formed to stop closure of Michelin Dundee factory\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph    union-retains-hope-for-michelin-staff-after-closure-announcement embed # secretgyqDlne\" data-secret\"gyqDlne\" width\"\" \"\" title\"#STATEMENT: Action group formed to stop closure of Michelin Dundee factory# # Evening \" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Michelin to CLOSE its Dundee factory with  jobs set to be lost\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp michelin-to-close-its-dundee-factory-with--jobs-set-to-be-lost embed # secretiYqVetks\" data-secret\"iYqVetks\" width\"\" \"\" title\"#Michelin to CLOSE its Dundee factory with  jobs set to be lost# # Evening \" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"VIDEO: Michelin workers angered after being told of Dundee closure by text message\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp video-michelin-workers-angered-after-being-told-of-dundee-closure-by-text-message embed # secretlCjKDPHmz\" data-secret\"lCjKDPHmz\" width\"\" \"\" title\"#VIDEO: Michelin workers angered after being told of Dundee closure by text message# # Evening \" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\""},{"url":null,"title":"wetherspoons-bans-dogs-from-all-pubs","story":"POPULAR pub chain Wetherspoons has banned dogs from all of its branches."},{"url":null,"title":"mobile-providers-charging-customers-for-phones-already-paid-off","story":"AN estimated four million UK mobile phone users have been charged pound million for handsets they already own, a charity has warned."},{"url":null,"title":"hydro-turns-five-meet-the-head-of-entertainment-who-spoke-on-anniversary","story":"OVER five million concert-goers in five years have visited the SSE Hydro...a figure which has exceeded the expectations of the woman responsible for bringing some of the worlds biggest acts to Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-takeaway-launches-deep-fried-mars-bar-calzone","story":"A GLASGOW takeaway has launched one of the worlds unhealthiest pizzas -

This is due to one of the two bidders withdrawing from the competition and therefore the competition has been closed and procurement is progressing under a new procedure, ‘negotiation without prior publication’.“Due to the revised procurement, it is estimated that this will add eight weeks to the procurement process.”Transport chiefs previously said the demolition work is expected to be completed by the end of the year, with the main construction of the project to get under way once the AWPR is open to traffic.The scheme will see a new link road built to take pressure off the roundabout, allowing drivers to travel from North Anderson Drive directly to Auchmill Road.Aberdeen City Council’s transport spokesman Ross Grant said: “This marks the total failure of the Scottish Government to deliver on their promises.“We have seen delay after delay on the AWPR and now we are seeing further delay on the vital Haudagain roundabout upgrade, which will now not finish till .“Citizens will remember that in  the SNP via Kevin Stewart MSP took an urgent decision to move forward with the Haudagain roundabout improvement, however, it now looks like it will be  years after the original urgent motion.”Jackie Dunbar, SNP councillor for the ward: “There are still a few families in the area so, while it is disappointing that there appears to be an eight-week delay, this will hopefully allow the council additional time to help relocate them to new homes.”Responding to the delayed projects contained within the progress update, Scottish Conservative shadow finance secretary Murdo Fraser said: “It’s understandable that there will always be the odd delay to major projects, which can occur for a range of issues.“But under the SNP this appears to have become the norm.”He added: “As ever with the SNP, warm words are not backed up by action, and the result of that is a decade of delays on key infrastructure projects.”Spokesman for Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said of the Tory party: “They didn’t mention the projects which were completed well ahead of schedule under this government, such as the M extension, nor did they acknowledge their own failure to deliver on many of these projects during their decades in power – most notably with the AWPR, which was first mooted in the s but is only now becoming a reality under the SNP.”"},{"url":null,"title":"vehicle lands on roof on north east road","story":"A vehicle has landed on its roof on a north-east road.Emergency services have been called to the unnamed road at Peathill near Fraserburgh this morning.It is understood that no one was hurt in the incident.A spokesman for Police Scotland said: #We received the call at .am this morning.#It is on a unnamed stretch of road at Peathill that joins up with the B.#A vehicle has ended up on its roof and both the ambulance service and fire crews are in attendance.#There doesn#t appear to be any injuries.#"},{"url":null,"title":"mcinally wants blue toon to stay top of pile","story":"After reaching the top of League Two, Peterhead boss Jim McInally has urged his team not to relinquish the position.The Blue Toon ed to the summit with a - win over Albion Rovers at Balmoor which took them top after Edinburgh City lost - at home to Clyde.Going to the top of the table was reward for the Buchan team’s fine recent form.They have won six league games in a row which kept the pressure on City who had enjoyed a fine start to the season.Balmoor gaffer McInally is pleased to be top of the pile instead of chasing other teams.That ultimately caught up with Peterhead in last season’s failed promotion attempt as they couldn’t overhaul Montrose and then lost to Stenhousemuir in the play-offs.McInally, pictured, hopes his team can learn from those experiences.He said: “We want to be there to be shot at rather than have to be chasing other teams.“If you are up there and keep winning then somebody  can make a mistake and you can increase the gap.“We have to look to keep kicking on.

Boyle was struggling with an ankle knock.Having the pair available would have helped the Blue Toon on Saturday with defending dficult in the second half due to strong winds at Balmoor.McInally added: “We were missing Mick Dunlop and Paddy Boyle and they are crucial to us.“Particularly in a game like it was on Saturday where it was dficult to defend with the strong wind.“They would have been massive for us.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

So many of our players have had really big matches for their clubs in the lead up to the international but they are done now and our total focus is on Ireland this Saturday.#The spine of the squad is from Newtonmore and that should not be any surprise given they have just won the treble.#There are a few Argyll representatives aside from the team captain. Irvine#s Kyles team-mate Roddy MacDonald has also been selected and there are places for Oban Camanachd duo Lorne Dickie and Andrew MacCuish.The Scottish mantra in recent games has been to keep the ball on the ground and to use the wide open spaces to stretch the Irish defence and not allow the hurlers to build up a head of steam with their aerial game.Caberfeidh’s dead-ball expert Kevin Bartlett will again be key and he scored twelve of Scotland’s eighteen points a year ago.There are no rule changes as such this year but there will be an Irish referee, John Keane, which brings its own dimension.Garry Reid added: #The interpretation of the rules will be key.

Following Seiber’s ‘Four French Folksongs’ the audience was treated to the accomplished Savolini playing two solo pieces – originally Schubert lieder # now arranged for guitar. Although he only had six strings on his guitar, Savolini was still able to capture the rippling of water under the melody. The first act was finished with a light contrast of Scots songs including ‘Dream Angus’ and was met with murmurs of agreement in the audience.The second act began with a piece by Marco Ramelli by the name of ‘Moon’. The text was taken from a th century poet yet the music was modern and fresh. After three Spanish songs by Joaquin Rodrigo during which the audience was told stories of a youthful girl’s wish to be picked as a companion for the king and a miller#s we staying true to her husband although her offer may be tempting, the two performed three of Granados  Tondillas. This was followed by a sentimental and personal depiction of Spain in Granados ‘Dance Española’s No.’ played by Sasha Savolini.McNeill and her partner finished with two Spanish songs by Turina, the first being an earthy and dramatic prayer to the virgin of hope and the second a feisty scorned woman with underlaying tones of sadness. Yet the audience was surprised to an encore of a beautully soft rendition ‘St Columba’s Prayer’.This was an entertaining afternoon enjoyed by everyone in Ardrishaig Public Hall."},{"url":null,"title":"etive tests loch fyne anglers","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowLoch Fyne Sea Angling Club held its annual #blind pairs# competition out of Airds Bay on Loch Etive recently in testing conditions.The strong wind and heavy rain made it a dficult day for the anglers, but they made the best of it fishing from the small self drive boats.Loch Etive produced the usual species of spurs, whiting and dogfish with a total of  fish caught and ed.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"calls find money build new","story":"NewsCalls to find money to build a new community hub to replace John Pollock CentrePopular facility described as \"not fit for purpose\"ShareByGary Fanning:,  NOV NewsJohn Pollock Centre, South Ayrshire Council.\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCalls have been made to find cash to build a new community hub for people in the north of Ayr. The plea comes as the John Pollock Centre, which has been described as “unfit for purpose”, is facing an uncertain future. And it is feared that the Mainholm Road facility may only have a year left before it is closed. The issue was raised at this month’s North Ayr Community Council that was attended by councillors Ian Cavana and Ian Davis and senior council officer Mark Baker. Robert Green, secretary of the community, insisted there was a desperate need for a community hub in the north of Ayr. And he asked: “Can councillors tell me about the John Pollock Centre being bulldozed ” Tory councillor Ian Davis replied: “I don’t think there is much we can say.” Mr Green added: “How can you guide the community council to get funds for a community hub  “It could be on similar lines as the new one in Maybole.” Mr Baker said a few community groups in the area had been raising the same issue. He revealed that there were a few options to consider but the council would need to engage with the community first. “We need to find out what spaces and places are available and what is required,” he added. “We need to get groups together to find what the solution is.” Mr Green said his preferred option would be to build a new facility in the existing grounds of the John Pollock Centre and that would be an ideal location for people living in Lochside, Dalmilling, Whitletts and Craigie. Labour councillor Ian Cavana said the John Pollock Centre was given a “state of execution” after council’s plans for moving local authority workers into the proposed controversial Riverside development was axed in the summer. “This time next year the John Pollock Centre would really be under pressure,” he declared. “I would love to see a new complex built to the right of the existing John Pollock Centre.” The community council heard that the John Pollock Centre is a well-used community facility for groups including line dancing, netball, keep fit, bingo and other activities. Councillor Cavana added: “It is the hub of the community. But it needs a new build. There is no definite plan just now but time is ticking. “The building is not fit for modern days.” Mr Green asked for the council’s help to access funds to build a new community hub.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnLabour PartyAyrSouth Ayrshire Council"},{"url":null,"title":"council chiefs apologise after sports","story":"NewsCouncil chiefs apologise after sports facility was dug up without warningResidents in Murkirk were left frustrated and helpless as their only sports facility was taken away due to wear and tear.ShareByPippa Smith:,  NOV News \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCouncil chiefs have apologised after AstroTurf was dug up without warning.

The former Aberdeen man has formed an impressive defensive partnership with Jamie Adams - and once again the pair were fantastic at Firhill.

McCall made his feelings on the whistler well known after Ayrs trip to Ibrox earlier this season - and United were on the end of a string of hotly disputed calls here. Madden waved away two first half penalty shouts and angered Ayr with a number of other baffling calls which threatened to send the game past boiling point in the second half.  McCall wins battle of the bosses On a day when all eyes were on the Thistle dugout and Gary Caldwell making his home debut, Ian McCall made yet another triumphantto his old stomping ground.

was later discovered by the director of the Sting who heard it being played by his son one day, a film that won an Oscar for its musical song score.Music by Claude Debussy followed-a sandwich of Le Petit Negre Syrinx Gollywogs cakewalk.Syrinx was very atmospheric-the lights went out and Annersquos flute could be heard imitating the Greek God Pan playing the reeds from Greek Mythology.The versatile Anne played Rosemary by Frank Bridge on piano next-quite beautully-this surely must have been a piece about the love of his le.Dick then brought out the bass clarinet and introduced his own compositions - Pontefiore and Tarantella.Pontefiore was composed for a stage production set in the South of Italy in which a Private Angelo finds a little peace amongst the conflict of war.Tarantella is a   time dance which victims dance when bitten by a tarantula!Then it was time for the interval and for Anne and Dick to enjoy a well earned brew.After the tea break the audience were introduced to the saxophone and it was explained that it was invented by Adolf Sax and fully intended to be a very loud marching band instrument.Peqena Czarda by Pedro Iturralde showcased the saxophone wonderfully with its hints of Spanish Tango. Lover Man - a sultry nocturne followed made famous by pianist and composer Ram Ramirez.Then it was time for another of Dicks own compositions on the bass clarinet.In Blues for Jimmy the scene was set in the deep South of America from around  with the deep tones of the bass clarinet echoing the African American blues.A tongue in cheek Stranger on the Shore came next complete with seagulls. Acker Bilk originally composed it as a lullaby for his daughter before being tempted commercially to change its name.My personal highlight of the evening was Lady be Good by George Gershwin - Anne on piano and Dick on clarinet played with verve and swing.Body and Soul by Green and made famous by Colman Hawkins was just that! Jumpinrsquo at the Woodside by Count Basie did indeed jump!The final treat of the evening was Henry Mancinirsquos Pink Panther.Dick wondered whether there was any need for him to work again after composing this particular piece.Next months concert is on Sunday, November  at . pm.

IIn the final minutes the Pupils were denied what seemed a stonewall penalty.Who knows what the score would have beenit had been given and converted.Looking forward to a better team performance, Campbeltown Pupils travel to play Easthall in the league tomorrow.Gary Grumoli was in the thick of the action till going off injured in the closing moments. _cpupilsSary Rahma caught in a balletic move in front of the Neilston goal. _cpupils"},{"url":null,"title":"letter campbeltowns role in the perisher","story":"Shortly before the war ended in , HMS Thames, the submarine depot ship, arrived at Campbeltown with her attendant submarines.The Thames was the base for the Periscope School which trained submarine commanding officers in the principles of attacking.The submarines were used to put theory into practice.

The remains of the castle are ancient and the oldest part is called Goblin Ha. It is partly underground, and its name means Goblin Hall.According to legend, a wizard named Hugh de Gford made a deal with the Devil nearly  years ago, and inan army of goblins swarmed up from hell and built Yester Castle for him. Goblin Ha is the part of the castle dating from that time and thatrsquos how it got its name.It is said goblins lurk in the shadows of the ruins, and especially in Goblin Ha itself. At sunset, when night falls, they come out of their hiding places and crawl about in the darkness.One autumn day quite recently a dad decided to take his two children on a trip to find Yester Castle. He worked long hours during the week so he kept weekends for his children.His daughter Suzie had just turned  and his son Jake was eight. Jake was mad about Harry Potter and wizards, and when he discovered there was a castle nearby made by goblins for a wizard he begged his dad to take him. Suzie was given the choice to stay at home with her mum, but at the last minute she decided to come.It was sunny when they set off. ldquoA perfect day to explore a castle made by goblins, said the dad jokingly. They parked at the golf course and walked towards the woods.ldquoMaybe the goblins play golf, Suzie joked to her wee brother.ldquoYou shouldnrsquot make fun, they might hear you, he said.They finally reached the edge of the wood and peered into it. Suzie found the bridge over the ravine that led to the ruins but then Jake ran ahead very excited, looking for goblins.It was dficult to imagine what the castle had originally looked like because it was so ruined. Jake said it reminded him of the ancient ruined temple in The Jungle Book movie. But one thing was for sure: it had an eerie atmosphere. As they explored, the dad walked under an archway and suddenly felt a shiver down his spine. He turned round and saw something move in the shadows.For a moment they stood absolutely still. Then a bird flew out, giving them a fright. The dad and Suzie burst into laughter.ldquoJust a stupid bird! said Jake, disappointed.After a careful search they found the entrance to Goblin Ha. It was a small entrance leading to a low, dark passageway. Jake bravely led the way, with his sister and dad close behind.A cold and damp atmosphere hit them as soon as they entered the chamber. Although it was dark, two windows above gave just enough light to see.ldquoSo all this was supposed to have been made by goblins  asked Suzie.ldquoYeah, said Jake, who was still getting over the excitement that he was actually in Goblin Ha, ldquoand they came from hell up that stairway. He pointed to the dark steps in the corner.All three stood peering into the dark stairway which plunged deep into the ground.ldquoAccording to the legend, this stairway was made by the Devil after he had done a deal with the wizard and it leads to hell. But itrsquos blocked up now, explained Jake. He looked at his father: ldquoCan we go down dad, please!ldquoSeems a bit dangerous to me son.ldquoAw, come on dad, said Suzie, ldquowe canrsquot come all this way and then not go down the stairway to hell.ldquoVery well, but Irsquoll go first and wersquoll use the torches on our phones, said the dad.Slowly they began to climb down the stairs. The light from their mobiles lit up the old walls and ancient worn steps as they descended. Suzie took photos in the darkness, although the flash wasnrsquot powerful enough to light up everything.Eventually they reached a point where great stones blocked the way so they couldnrsquot go any further. ldquoThey were put there to keep out the goblins, said Jake. His sister was now feeling a bit uneasy: ldquoCan we go now, dad  Itrsquos too spooky down here.ldquoScared of the goblins are we  her wee brother mocked.ldquoYes, letrsquos go back up, said the dad. Jake led the way up to Goblin Ha. ldquoItrsquos time we should be going, wersquove found the place so mission accomplished. Itrsquoll be dark soon, letrsquos go now while therersquos still good day light.So they left the ruins and walked back across the golf course, laughing and talking and admiring the beginnings of a sunset and a full moon in the darkening sky. They were at the car when Suzie realised she didnrsquot have her mobile phone.ldquoIt was in my back pocket, it mustrsquove fallen out, she insisted.ldquoAw no Suzie, it could be anywhere, her dad said, annoyed.ldquoDad, we have to go back to get it, please. I know I had it in Goblin Ha, it might have even fallen out there. The dad wasnrsquot happy but the mobile was expensive and so reluctantly he agreed.They retraced their steps all the way back to the castle. It had only been  minutes since they had left the ruins but the atmosphere in the dim twilight was very dferent.Finally they reached the entrance to Goblin Ha.ldquoYou go first, dad, said both children at the same time.And so the dad put on his torch and entered. His children followed close behind.When they emerged into Goblin Ha it was dark so the dad shone his torch on the ground, searching. ldquoWhere could you have left it  he asked Suzie.ldquoAnywhere, she replied, shrugging her shoulders.They couldnrsquot phone it as there was no reception, so they kept searching.It was Jake who heard it first: a faint sound coming from the dark stairway. He lted his head and looked in its direction but it was too dark to see anything. There it was again, it sounded like breathing.Jake froze in real terror. ldquoDadhellip he whispered, ldquodad, therersquos something there.ldquoStop it you wee bam, said his sister, ldquoyoursquore just trying to spook us. But then she heard it too. It was louder this time, a strange breathing sound. It was definitely coming from the stairway.Intrigued, the dad shone his light down the steps, although the mobilersquos torch wasnrsquot strong enough to completely light up the dark.Then suddenly a pair of red eyes appeared, staring back at him.The dad screamed, making his two children scream as well, and they instinctively ran for the exit. But it was dark and they couldnrsquot see the way.ldquoDad, for Godrsquos sake shine it over here, cried Suzie, now completely terried.The dad shone the torch and they ran through the passageway in a total panic. Once outside there was more light, from the full moon.ldquoWhy did you scream, you scared the hell out of me! Suzie shouted angrily at her dad.ldquoIrsquom sorry Suzie, it just gave me a fright, I didnrsquot mean to scare you, he said.ldquoWhat gave you a fright, what did you see dad  asked Jake, who was now scared himself despite his earlier bravado.ldquoNot sure really, I thought I saw, erhellipldquoYes, yes what  asked Suzie stretching out her arms impatiently.The dad hesitated, then said: ldquoWell it looked like eyes.ldquoI am now officially freaked out, said Suzie, ldquoplease letrsquos just get out of here, never mind the sodding phone.ldquoIrsquom sure it was some kind of animal, maybe a fox or even an owl, said her dad, trying to reassure her, ldquobut yes itrsquos too dark now, we should go back to the car and maybe we can come back tomorrow in the light to look for your mobile.Jake was suddenly distracted. He saw something in the passageway.ldquoDadhellip dad, whatever it is, itrsquos coming after us, look!The shadow of some creature was in the passageway, moving towards them.Both Suzie and Jake were now in a state of complete terror and they ran.ldquoNo, no, itrsquos dangerous, therersquos a steep fall there, donrsquot run! called out the dad.The kids stopped just in time. In the moonlight they could see they were standing on the edge of a steep fall. Their dad caught up with them and took their hands. They walked together carefully with hearts racing through the trees towards the bridge that led to the golf course.Behind them, a dark shadow came out of the entrance and crawled into the wood.They were just past the arched wall when they saw the dark shadow move in front of them, blocking the way. The dad shone his torch directly at it, and for a split second he saw it before it vanished into the darkness. He looked shocked.ldquoWhat the hell was that, dad  shrieked Suzie.ldquoI honestly donrsquot know, he saidWhatever it was, it was still in the woods, moving in the darkness. Then it came towards them once again, this time making strange noises.Jake suddenly yelled out: ldquoOur father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come thy will be done, in heaven as it is on earthhellip Whatever it was made a sound like a scream and retreated back into the dark wood towards Goblin Ha. Jake continued the prayer and finished with a loud ldquoamen.ldquoLetrsquos get out of here, said the dad. All three ran in the moonlight out of the shadows of the wood onto the golf course. They kept running until they reached the car park, legs aching and completely breathless.The dad fumbled for his keys while the children stared at the golf course, looking for a moving shadow.Finally the dad found his keys and they were in the car and away as fast as possible.Suzie was the first to speak: ldquoI ask again, what was it ldquoI think the dark was playing tricks on us, said her dad, ldquoit was an animal of some sort.ldquoBut what about that horrible scream  she asked.ldquoFoxes can make a strange screeching noise at night, Suzie, thatrsquos what I think it was, said her dad, trying to reassure her.ldquoIt was a goblin, wasnrsquot it dad  asked Jake.ldquoAye right, replied his sister sarcastically, ldquoyou read too much Harry Potter. And what was all that praying about  That was just weird.ldquoIt was a redcap goblin, said Jake, ldquoyou canrsquot outrun them and the Lordrsquos Prayer is the only thing that will stop them. I had memorised it before our visit, just in case.ldquoHowrsquod you know that  asked SuzieldquoI read about it, said Jake.Suzie was just about to say something when her dad winked at her and interrupted: ldquoWellit was a redcap then the prayer seemed to work. He hoped this would stop them arguing. And it did. Jake smiled and put on his earphones.ldquoIrsquom sure it was a fox, whispered the dad to his daughter, ldquoor maybe a big rat, but just let Jake think it was a goblin.They got home with a story to tell their mum!In a quiet moment, when the children were busy, she asked the dad: ldquoSo what was it you saw He hesitated to answer the question, ashe wouldnrsquot be believed.ldquoTo be honest, I donrsquot know, he said. ldquoI told the kids it was a fox because I didnrsquot want to spook them, but I really canrsquot say.Who knows the truth of it all  If Suziersquos phone is ever found, the photos she took in the dark stairway might reveal what was really hiding in the darkness on that day."},{"url":null,"title":"be-prepared-for-next-beast-from-the-east-says-council-emergency-planner","story":"Severe weather is the biggest risk to people living in East Lothian, according to Sandy Baptie.And he has issued advice ahead of a one-day workshop to help communities prepare for any future emergencies.It includes going back to old-fashioned handsets in a time when more people rely on mobile phones.Mr Baptie, East Lothian Councilrsquos emergency planning, risk and resilience manager, has been visiting community councils and groups in the wake of the lsquoBeast from the Eastrsquo snowstorm, which brought much of the country to a standstill in February and March this year.Heavy snowfalls and strong winds caused chaos on the roads and left many people stranded in their homes.It also saw a surge in community spirit, with tales of people helping neighbours and looking after the more vulnerable people.Now Mr Baptie is hoping that spirit will help all communities prepare a Community Resilience Plan which they can use in case another severe weather front hits the county.And he has issued some advice for people to prepare in their own home for what could happen.He said: ldquoSevere weather is the biggest risk to East Lothian.ldquoBeing prepared for it is important and people can do things themselves, such as keeping an old-fashioned phone in their house in case mobile signal is lost, having a torch to hand in case power goes.ldquoIt is also important to stock up on food when warnings that severe weather is on its way are issued.More than  people are expected to attend the community resilience workshop at The Brunton, Musselburgh, on Saturday.The one-day event, which is being funded by EDF Energy and the Scottish Government, will bring together representatives from community councils, groups and schools.Advice on a range of aspects of drawing up community resilience plans will be available, including ensuring groups who take on responsibility are covered by insurance.It will also inform people of services they can sign up to with energy companies to ensure they receive a phone callpower goes out.North Berwick Community Council, which already has a plan and implemented it successfully during the Beast from the East, will be there to talk about how they did it and what worked.Mr Baptie hopes the event will result in community plans from across the county, with each one appointing a Single Person of Contact or SPOC.He said: ldquoThe idea of a SPOC is that there is one point of contact between each community and the council so we can get information to them and they can let us know what is happening, for examplepower has gone out in one area.ldquoThe plans are about drawing up lists of vulnerable people in the community, finding out who has a x and can get medicine to people or take them to hospital or the doctor.ldquoIt is about being prepared.

This is a very concerning piece of news, especially given the fact that the Tesco bus also serves the health centre.ldquoIt comes at a time when we are being told that we need to use public transport more because of dire warnings about the impact of climate change and when massive house building will lead to gridlock unless newcomers can be persuaded onto buses.Mr Turner added: ldquoEast Lothian generally, and Musselburgh in particular, is now renowned for its excellent bus services so this announcement comes as a blow and runs counter to all that has been achieved on the public transport front in the last few of years.ldquoLetrsquos hope that the council, working with the operators, can come up with a proposal to replace the extremely useful Tesco bus, and in doing so letrsquos try to serve some places that are currently remote from buses ndash Edenhall Road and the Muckletts, for example, both had buses until a few years ago and theirwould, I am sure, be welcomed by elderly residents.ldquoI think the Tesco bus should be replaced by something very similar, perhaps marketed as the Musselburgh community bus.

She is originally from another European country but has made Haddington her home, with her husband and two wonderful children.Her explorations of nearby woods led her to discover an unusual grave amongst the trees. It is a grave of a horse, buried in the th century. It was this grave she had offered to show me. To get there we had a beautul walk along a secluded section of the banks of the Tyne. It was the trees I noticed first, of course, which were dotted along the banks of the river.Autumn was just then beginning to brush the trees with its colour, and it was one of those evenings when the setting sun seemed to take its time, bathing the land in bright streaks of orange light. Along the way, Marije paused and said: ldquoThis is my tree.It was a beech tree of signicant age, its branches arching over the Tyne, asfishing. She showed me her sitting place, underneath its embracing canopy. Here the roots curved to make a natural seat. Her older son spoke of seeing kingfishers, and sure enough, this was a perfect place to absorb the majesty of the Tyne as it flowed towards Haddington. Another beech of similar age grew close by. Their branches entwined, making it look like they were sisters holding hands.But I sensed then there was more to Marijersquos connection to this place, although I then had no idea just how powerful her story was.When we finally got to our destination in the woods further upriver, the light was too weak to penetrate the trees. The old grave of the horse was shrouded in darkness.Yet with the help of mobile torches we could view it, and for sure the grave was interesting and worth a story in its own right. I vowed to find out more about its background as we headed back to Marijersquos house in the dying embers of a sunset.When we reached her house we were treated to wonderful hospitality. It was then that Marije told her story of the beech tree.Not long ago she had been diagnosed with cancer. She faced the possibility of being taken by this cruel disease. Numbness and disbelief at first overcame her, then there was the realisation that le might be very short and she would have to leave her two young children.She walked to the beech tree soon after her diagnosis and sat cradled by its roots. Despite having family and friends whose love and support was invaluable, Marije explained it can also be a desperately lonely feeling. ldquoWe all know we canrsquot live forever, she told me, ldquobut to face the reality of my end at such a young age and with children was unbearable.ldquoI went on that walk to the tree in the most dire situation, she told me. ldquoI felt a connection as I sat under the tree, I really felt her old wisdom and energy.Her love for her young children is what gave her strength in the worst of times. The tree seemed to symbolise this powerful bond, its roots deeply holding it safe.ldquoPeople talk about mother nature, Marije said, ldquoand I understand why. When my hair fell out, I lsquogave it backrsquo to nature, underneath the beech. I know it makes me sound weird, but it really helped me.It is not weird, of course. Trees are full of wisdom, not in the sense of actual words but in the spiritual sense. Beech is said to be the matriarch of the wood, sometimes called the mother of the forest. It is a good listener. Our best ideas and inner reflections can come when we sit under the embrace of an old tree even science tells us this now.Sadly not everyone wins the fight against cancer, but thankfully Marije recovered after treatment. The experience has left her treasuring every single day and taking no sunrise for granted. And she is thankful to her beech tree, which was her companion and confidant in those times of emotional agony. It remains for her a place of contemplation and peace, where she can give thanks and absorb the joy of being alive.ldquoI cherish every day now in ways I didnrsquot before, she told me. ldquoI think it is important to allow our kids to feel the connection with nature. That means being in nature, and respecting it. After all, we are all part of it.This was the real story of that walk on that day a story of incredible bravery, pain, love and determination by a young mum I now have the privilege to call a friend."},{"url":null,"title":"labour-ties-bring-meeting-to-a-halt","story":"Prestonpans businessman Ferhan Ashiq had applied to increase the size of an alcohol display ndashand for a name change ndash at one of his stores.But Councillor Jim Goodfellowimmediately recused himself from the application because of his friendship with Mr Ashiq, who is a member of East Lothian Labour Party.After a short adjournment, Councillor Fiona Dugdale , convenor, also declared an interest.Remaining Labour councillor John McMillan, however, said he did not believe his relationship with Mr Ashiq, who has shops in Musselburgh and Prestonpans, could have an impact on his ability to make a decision, while Conservative councillor Jane Henderson said she did not know him.The boardrsquos legal adviser described the situation as ldquounusual but said the board was no longer quorate and Mr Ashiqrsquos application would have to be continued to the next licensing board for a decision.But a bemused Mr Ashiq noted: ldquoWhen it comes to the next meeting I will know most of the board members there.Legal adviser Carlo Grilli advised Mr Ashiq to send his father, whose name was on the application, and an agent instead.The application was to change the name of Mr Ashiqrsquos Prestonpans store on Redburn Road from Day-Today to Day Todayand increase the alcohol display from . square metres to . square metres."},{"url":null,"title":"rare-bottle-of-whisky-to-be-auctioned-for-combat-stress-charity","story":"It is one of only , matured in an American bourbon barrel for eight years, with a cask strength of  per cent alcohol.The auction is part of a fundraiser for Combat Stress, the veteransrsquo mental health charity, and is being organised by the music group the Flying Aspidistras ahead of their concert of remembrance, Now the Guns are Silent, at Gosford House on Sunday.The occasion will be a reflection on the harsh reality of war and the suffering felt beyond the battlefield.Kilchoman distillery on Islay has bottled this special single cask to coincide with the centenary of the end of the First World War.More poignantly, it is also to commemorate the sinking of two troopships, the SS Tuscania and the HMS Otranto, with the loss of nearly  men, in the waters around Islay in .Ailsa Fortune, the events organiser, said: \"The war affected every community in Scotland, from Islay to East Lothian.\"The end of any war leaves many broken lives.

network was a ldquodirect result of cuts to local authority funding by the Scottish Government.He said: ldquoThe condition of roads is a problem across Scotland. This is a direct result of the Scottish Government slashing council funding over this period, with East Lothian Council having suffered cuts of around pound million in the last five years.ldquoEast Lothian Council has done its utmost to protect the budget.ldquoThe Scottish Government needs to recognise the impact its cuts are having and give local authorities the funding they need to protect services, including road maintenance.The county is currently covered by km of roads, ranging from class A routes to unclassied lanes.And an Annual Status and Options Report, produced on behalf of East Lothian Council, has revealed that  per cent are currently in need of repair.The report, which looks at the impact of future funding on network maintenance in the long term, warns that the current level of investment of pound.million a year will mean that more than  per cent of the roads will be in a state of disrepair in  yearsrsquo time.And it reveals that, as an asset, East Lothian Councilrsquos carriageways depreciate in value by poundmillion every year.It also found that nearly km of rural public roads in the county were in poor condition and needed immediate investigation and possible treatment.The report said: ldquoThe level of investment on public roads in East Lothian has not been sufficient to limit the decline in the overall condition of the network.It revealed that additional investment of pound.million over the next  years could signicantlyimprove the state of the roads, with fewer than  per cent likely to need repairs by the end of the decade.Peter Forsyth, asset manager for East Lothian Council, said that the recommendation for operating the carriageways following the report was to continue with the current level of investment.In a report to the councilrsquos policy and performance review committee, he said the costs of corrective treatments, in particular carriageway reconstruction, were ldquoprohibitive and a preventative treatment approach should ldquomitigate the need to invest signicantly.But he warned: ldquoShort-term under-investment could result in major long-term expenditure necessary to recty major defects which could have been addressed earlier.Councillor Jane Henderson , leader of the opposition, said: ldquoOur road infrastructure assets are vital and dficult decisions will need to be made.ldquoWithout investment now the amount of money needed in the future will be a greater problem the old expression of lsquoa stitch in time saves ninersquo was never so apt.ldquoThe decision on how much to spend on roads now will inevitably mean choices.

The charger is offered on condition users take up a ScottishPowers competitive renewable electricity tarf.

He [Dr Naji Al Arfaj] was paying him big amounts from the petty cash when you shouldnrsquot pay this amount from petty cash, you should use cheques.ldquoInvoices were also not provided for the work.The tribunal heard that the petty cash issue was one of the points Mr Barry, who was appointed to the pound,-a-year role in December , raised with the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator.On his whistleblowing form he claimed payments totalling around pound had been paid out of petty cash.Mr Werfali told the tribunal that he discussed his concerns about the finances with Mr Barry.Mr Lawson asked the witness why he took issue with the way the petty cash was being used.He replied that it created an issue over ldquotransparency for the mosque.The witness added: ldquoHanding over large amounts of money without getting a quotation or an invoice, this is not good practice for a charity.The accountant said he was also concerned about the handling of money raised by the mosque via its car park, which generates income of around pound each week.He said Dr Al Arfaj allowed ious volunteers to deal with this cash, instead of officials from the mosque, which, he claimed, was ldquoagainst the Muslim World League handbook.Mr Werfali added that, at the time he left in the mosque in March last year, it was in a good financial position.The tribunal also heard from psychotherapist Khalid Shakir, who was involved in a mental health and wellbeing group at the mosque.He told how during one meeting with officials, the group - including the imam - was told the mosque was facing financial dficulties and had a deficit of pound,.Mr Shakir said Mr Barry ldquochallenged that statement during the meeting.He also told how a donation of pound was given to the group, but was never made available to them.Mosque officials went on to disband the group, claiming members were conducting ldquopsychological experiments.Asked how he felt about that decision, Mr Shakir replied: ldquoI certainly wasnrsquot happy about it.

We need to stop before it is too late.\"Insisting that the UK should \"junk\" any solution keeping it in the EUs customs union, he said: \"Brexit was meant to be about taking back control. Under this plan we surrender control to Brussels.\"As soon as MPs understand what is really at stake, I have no doubt that they will throw this deal out.\"The leader of the Best for Britain campaign for a second referendum, Eloise Todd, said: \"When the history of Brexit is written in a few years time the backstop and the UKs decisions around it will be held up as an example of how not to negotiate.\"The Government can call it whatever they want, but their plan of a unilaterally revocable backstop is dead in the water. It will not happen.\"Trying to appease the right of the Tory Party has failed.\""},{"url":null,"title":"margaret-taylor-a-tory-mp-making-a-stand-for-the-poor-dont-bet-on-it","story":"Thank goodness for Tracey Crouch, then, the Conservative MP for Chatham and Aylesford who resigned as sports minister last week in protest at what she said was an ldquounjustiable delay to a policy aimed at tackling the scourge of problem gambling. Having long campaigned for the maximum bet that can be placed via bookie-shop slot machines to be reduced from pound to pound, Ms Crouch said she was taking a stand after Chancellor Philip Hammond announced that the change will be introduced in October next year and not April as she had been expecting.The effects of this, she said, will be profound, with pound. billion expected to be lost on these machines between May , when the reduction was agreed, and October , when it will now take effect. Worse still, she wrote in her resignation letter, ldquoa signicant amount of the total will be lost ldquoin our most deprived areas.It is no secret that gambling and hardship go hand in hand, with the Scottish Government as long ago as  issuing a report that found that ldquodisadvantaged social groups who experience poverty, unemployment, dependence on welfare, and low levels of education and household income are most likely to suffer the adverse consequences of increased gambling. The clustering of betting shops in areas of deprivation such as Glasgowrsquos Dumbarton Road has long been a cause for concern and that report, which was written by University of Glasgow professor Gerda Reith, whose research focuses on problematic forms of consumption, also found that ldquoavailability and convenience are strongly associated with problem gambling.Having been introduced after then Chancellor Gordon Brown abolished betting duties in , the so-called fixed-odds betting terminalsMs Crouch has resigned over were still in their infancy when Professor Reithrsquos report was issued. In the years since, though, they have come to represent all that is wrong with the gambling industry, not least because they enable customers to place pound bets every  seconds, leading some to lose thousands in a single sitting.In Scotland, which, according to Gambling Commission figures, not only has more gamblers as a proportion of the population than Britain as a whole but more problem gamblers too, FOBTs are seen as such an issue that the Scottish Government - which cannot set gambling legislation - was given special powers under the  Scotland Act to limit their prevalence. Yet while Holyrood has been able to cap the number of machines installed in new betting shops for the past two years it has not yet taken action to do so, preferring instead to wait for the UK Government to show its hand on maximum stakes first - a decision that is looking less sound in light of the Westminster delay.Given this proleration of issues it is no wonder that Ms Crouch has been so roundly praised for taking a stand on the delay to implementing reduced FOBT stakes, with commentators from across the political spectrum highlighting not just the passion and courage that led her to make the move but her principles and morals too. Even the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, took to Twitter to praise her ldquocommitment to doing right.Yet as Ms Crouchrsquos parliamentary voting record makes clear, this is not a politician who usually cares so deeply about doing what is right for those living in deprivation, but rather someone who is usually happy to toe the Nasty Party line. Indeed, according to parliamentary monitoring website They Work For You, while Ms Crouch has consistently voted in favour of tax breaks for higher-rate taxpayers and against taxing bankersrsquo bonuses, she has also been consistent in her opposition to using public money to create jobs for young people in long-term unemployment and in her support of reducing welfare spending and restricting the scope of legal aid. She has even voted against giving local authorities the power to regulate the use of FOBTs and opposed a plan that would have required online bookies to automatically ban any problem gambler who had registered for self-exclusion.Put in that context the motivation behind Ms Crouchrsquos resignation is harder to fathom, particularly as her parliamentary colleagues have rubbished the claim that the rule change was due to come in in April anyway. One thing is clear, though: this is not a rogue Tory whose moral compass has led her to care more about social justice and deprivation prevention than her own party and career. Sure Ms Crouch is to be admired for taking a stand on problem gambling, butevery other political decision she makes is to the detriment of those whose plight she is supposedly trying to highlight, who, ultimately, stands to benefit "},{"url":null,"title":"theatre-vulcan-7-kings-edinburgh-three-stars","story":"Vulcan Kingrsquos Theatre, EdinburghNeil Cooper, Three starsAn actorrsquos le can go in many ways.

We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Tuesday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : pmWork is underway to repair a fibre optic cable, following widespread disruption to Orkney Islands Council#s IT services.

The project is supported by Orkney Islands Council’s Arts Development team.It will run on a loop eight times from pm each evening between now and Remembrance Day on November .At around .pm each night it will come to a rest on the final image — a tree, made up of the names of Orcadians who died in WWI, in a field of poppies.Glasgow-based specialists Playdead were engaged to create the film and pupils from Glaitness Primary and Kirkwall Grammar schools were involved in the creation of the work.Kevin McCrae, creative director and founder of Playdead, said: “After speaking to local people and school children about what they’d like to see and seeing what we could draw on from archives as well, we thought it would be good to develop a series of sequences which looked at the war and its impacts in Orkney from a range of angles.“Spectators will see snippets of what soldiers would have experienced, but also there are scenes which explore how farmers and school children would have been affected, as well as a look at what propaganda people here would have seen, and images from after the war of how the end of the conflict was celebrated and how it was commemorated.“There are some big technical challenges associated with projecting onto a surface like the St Magnus Cathedral. It’s such an iconic building in the heart of Kirkwall and we wanted to do justice to it # so we have done a lot of work to take into account the uneven surfaces and to choose a colour palette that would really work with the beautul red stone.The Great War: An Orkney Memorial Experience will run for the final time between pm and pm on Remembrance Day,  November.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Now in its seventh consecutive season, the Sanday Sealcam is online once again.A camera has been set up overlooking two small coves in a part of the island that is rarely visited — except by seals, otters, rabbits and birds.Set up with the kind permission of local landowners, the Towrie family, the camera is linked to a radio dish that transmits the signal, by line of sight, to a distant receiving dish, and the apparatus is powered by solar batteries — and this year for the first time, a supplementary wind-generator # at the site.Here, the live action is streamed to the internet and can be watched by anyone who logs on to the sealcam website.Sandra Towrie, Chair of Sanday Development Trust said: “Sanday Development Trust is delighted to work with Triscom as it is a hard task to stream the camera using remote, rural broadband and get high-quality live footage successfully being streamed onto the web. The Sanday sealcam allows visitors a unique opportunity to see Orkney’s amazing wildle up close and personal, and follow the highs and lows of an Orkney seal colony during pupping season from the comfort of their armchair — perfect for those unable to visit the island in person.”In recent years, Northlink Ferries have part-sponsored the Sealcam, while Sanday Development Trust continues to fund repairs, replacements and maintenance of the equipment and the time involved in camera control.Thousands of people, from all over the world, have looked at Sanday Sealcam. From the comfort of your computer-desk, or even your laptop in an armchair by the fire, the website brings you the sights and sounds of seals on an Orkney beach.

We are hopeful however that the Scottish Government will pass on the additional money.\"Over the period   to   the Highland Council has already had to implement budget savings of pound. million and council tax rises of % in each of the last two years in order to deliver a balanced budget.

She said: \"Our children are subject to appalling conditions. Only today my daughter had to sit in her classroom with her coat and hat on as it was so cold. A classroom that incorporates the staff toilet and staff room. To avoid the staff room, children are having to go in and out of the classroom via outdoors.\"Dingwall and Seaforth ward councillor Angela MacLean invited childrenrsquos minister Maree Todd and the arearsquos MSP, Kate Forbes, to support a push for funding for a replacement. Ms MacLean said: \"I think the staff do a fantastic job and it is incumbent on us to try and get a solution and all work together. Having it on the capital programme with a reduced capital budget has been dficult but everyone who has seen it knows it is badly needing replaced. Whether it be Scottish Government or Highland Council we all have to work together. Given the children that go to St Clementrsquos, it does make it more urgent because they are our most vulnerable young people.\"Mrs Todd, a Ross-shire-based Highlands and Islands MSP, declared the school not fit for purpose when she visited this year.She said shersquod be \"more than happy\" to meet local councillors but added: \"As a member of the ruling administration, Ms MacLean will know that St Clementrsquos had not previously been prioritised by Highland Council in their capital spending plans.\"Since my visit to St Clementrsquos this year Highland Council has now prioritised it. Should they require my support in making further progress, I am happy to help.\"Dingwall-based MSP Kate Forbes previously described the school \"as like something out of Oliver Twist\".She said: \"Highland Councilrsquos plans for school buildings seem to be entirely reliant on additional Scottish Government funding when it is the council who has statutory responsibility for school buildings and their annual budget settlement recognises that.\"Shesaid Highland Council had been the second highest beneficiary of the Scottish Governmentrsquos Schools for the Future funding scheme, receiving poundmillion. The next school buildings funding programme is expected by the end of the year.Renewing an appeal for progress, Ms Ferguson warned of \"promises broken and deadlines long passed\" and accused the council of breaking the law over conditions.

We should have something similar around the Firth. You see people driving past Kirkmichael slowing down to take a look because it looks interesting. People are drawn in and genuinely interested by what they see.\"Irsquom not really all that comfortable with heritage being competitive but this does mean the community, which has been supporting this for close on  years, can be recognised. Five years ago we were at the point of giving up when the roof literally fell in. We had a meeting with the community and they urged us to push on.\"The Federation of Small Businessesrsquo Highlands and Islands development manager, David Richardson, hailed the Trust for \"working wonders\" on the kirk, graveyards and mediaeval stones.\"Visiting old graveyards is not just of interest to locals and those with ancestors buried in them it is also very popular with many visitors interested in soaking up more of the local atmosphere and history and in reading the stories written on the older the stones.\"Including interpretive  that explain more of the history and expand on these stories makes the whole experience even more powerful.\"Dr Mackayrsquos suggestion that a Highland graveyard heritage trail should be created is excellent surely an idea whose time has come  Itrsquos certainly well worth further exploration and discussion.\"Kate Forbes MSP, whose constituency takes in the Black Isle, said: \"I love what the Kirkmichael Trust has done to repair the graveyard and draw in locals and visitors.

We have a whole plan of engagement throughout the year that will do that, starting later this week.\"And at the same time to listen to the public and to hear the views of what the council is doing really well, what everyone believes the council could be doing better in terms of delivering services and the important part of that is that we go across the Highlands to hear those views.\"The first thing is about listening to people, the second most important thing is about going back and saying to people lsquoyou said and we willrsquo or lsquowe are not able to becausersquo.\"The councilis due tostart a \"public budget engagement process\" tomorrow, designed to help the local authority make decisions to balance its books.\"It is really important that we listen throughout the month of November,\" Mrs Manson said. \"Then we will go back and give feedback on what the suggestions are.\"Mrs Manson was upbeat about the local authorityrsquos financial woes that have seen it stumble from one unpopular cutback to another over several months amid a flurry of resignation threats from within the administration.\"I am quite positive about our budget situation here in the Highlands ndash I think we are in a fair place,\" she said. \"There are places where we will be able to make efficiencies and our officer team and our members are working on that all the time, day-in, day-out behind the scenes.\"However, Mrs Manson did accept that \"there are some challenging areas in there, such as what our priorities for resource and for spend are, and I think it is very important to take a transparent approach so that when we do take decisions in February [when the council budget is decided] we can actually evidence it comes after listening to people.\"One of the answers to those challenges, according to the chief executive, is to rely on the \"many talented staff who believe in the values of public service and that we are here to make a dference\" and to capitalise on an upsurge in community involvement.\"I genuinely believe that many, many people that I have been speaking to over the last few months in dferent parts of the Highlands have really good ideas,\" she said. \"They see where the council can become more efficient.\"But equally so, I think that people can be more understanding of the challenges that we face.\"The local authority has made pound. million of savings since  and raised council tax by three per cent in each of the last two years.Budget leader Alister Mackinnon said: \"We have to do more with less money and our costs are rising for things like fuel, pay and cost of living.\"We are working with services to produce comprehensive information on our current spending profiles, to identy where there are opportunities for efficiencies and any commercial opportunities. Our focus will be on directing our resources to those areas which will give us the best outcomes and deliver value for money.\"Depute budget leader Matthew Reiss said: \"It will not be easy to find more savings on top of those we have already made. Income generation, commercialisation and efficiencies become even more vital in this context in order to protect essential services and we do not have the luxury of the signicant reserves we once had to give us any room for manoeuvre.\"It is undoubtedly the case that there will be very hard decisions to make and we will begin a process of engagement to help us make the right decisions and do the best we can.\"Tuesday  Nov  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Some  people are employed at the plant, which has been a presence in the city since . The French firm said that despite efforts to make the factory “economically sustainable,” it was now considered “unsuitable,” with the prospect of its conversion not “financially viable.” However, unions described the closure as a “hammer blow” and “devastating,” and pledged to fight “tooth and nail” to save the factory.The impending closure of the plant, which manufactures  inch and smaller tyres for cars, is likely to spark a political row. Only last June, the firm received £.m of taxpayers’ money to bankroll an expansion programme, with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon hailing Michelin’s “continued commitment.” Since  , it has received a further eight grants from Scottish Enterprise totalling more than £.m. The majority came via the business quango’s regional selective assistance scheme. In a statement issued on its website, Michelin said the Dundee site has “faced serious dficulties in recent years,” with an “accelerated sht” in the market towards what it described as “low cost, entry level products from Asia.” It stated: “Despite the group’s continuous efforts, and the factory employees’ dedication to making the site economically sustainable through the implementation of several action plans – €mhas been invested in recent years to modernise the site – the accelerated market transformation has made the plant unsuitable and its conversion is not financially viable. “Against this backdrop, the Michelin group has had to announce its intention to employees to close the Dundee factory by mid . “The priority now is to provide the  employees of the factory with the most effective support possible to enable them to face the consequences of this dficult decision.”It said measures would include enhanced redundancy packages and early retirement, with a “comprehensive plan” to help employees due to be put in place “as quickly as possible.”Pat Rafferty, Scottish secretary of the Unite union, said: “Unite has been aware of the challenging market situation facing the Michelin group. This has been primarily due to the cheap foreign imports from Asia and as a result falling demand for premium tyres in smaller dimensions, which the Dundee factory specialises in producing. “If the media reports are confirmed by Michelin, this will be hammer blow for Dundee. It would be devastating and a betrayal of the workforce who have made major changes to working practices at the site in order to secure its long-term future. “The workforce can be assured Unite will fight tooth and nail to save our factory, we will leave no stone unturned to keep this factory open. Unite will work day and night to ensure that all options remain on the table.”Shona Robison, the SNP MSP for Dundee, descibrd the news as “deeply upsetting for the city and in particular for the workforce and their families.” Stating that she would be seeking “urgent clarication” from the company about its plans, she added: “If this speculation is true, I will work with the Scottish Government, Dundee City Council and any others to ensure that we do everything possible to secure a future for the Michelin plant and its workforce.”Richard Leonard, the leader of Scottish Labour, said: “This is devastating news for the Michelin workforce and their families, the city of Dundee and the wider Tayside community. My thoughts are with them.“The Michelin factory in Dundee has provided not just hundreds of well paid jobs, but much needed skills and training to a city which has suffered greatly as a result of deindustrialisation.“It is now key that the Scottish Government does everything it possibly can to keep the factory open and protect jobs. This should include working closely with Michelin, trade unions and the Dundee community to provide urgent clarity on the current situation.“Scottish Labour stands ready to provide constructive support to help Michelin workers and keep the factory open.”Last June, Ms Sturgeon announced Scottish Enterprise would commit £.m in the form of an environmental protection grant towards a £.m investment in the facility, with the company making up the remainder of the funding. The investment was the latest in a series of major cash injections for the factory in recent years and was expected to secure the workforce for the next  to  years.The Scottish Government said the money, earmarked for additional premises and new manufacturing equipment, would pave the way for a new manufacturing technique that would help reduce CO emissions by , tonnes per year. Speaking while on a tour of the plant at the time, Ms Sturgeon said: “Michelin is a global leader in developing the latest technology and this investment in making the next generation of fuel efficient tyres is another great example of a highly innovative company.“This commitment and investment in the Dundee site will support the  fantastic, skilled workers here to remain at the cutting edge of their industry and help the worldwide drive to the low carbon economy.”She added: “Michelin’s investment in Scotland is testament to our thriving manufacturing industry and its position as a key growth sector for the economy. Their continued commitment is proof of the skill and value of the Scottish workforce.”In September, the company - headquartered in Clermont-Ferrand in the Auvergne region of France - said the Dundee factory was continuing to face “extremely challenging trading conditions,” in large part due to the influx from cheap tyres from Asia, and falling demand for smaller, premium tyres. It said that production was forecast to reach . million tyres a year over the next three years, a number that was “signicantly below capacity.” It is understood the plant’s peak production capacity exceeds seven million tyres a year. However, it did not raise the possibility of the factory’s closure, stating only that it would “explore all options to maximise the efficiency of the plant,” which included the prospect of a reduced headcount and restructured working patterns. ©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4824482.1541414183!/image/image.jpg","title":"call for action as new car sales stuck in reverse","story":"Motor industry leaders have called for government policies that #encourage rather than confuse# after a further fall in car sales.New figures show that overall UK registrations reversed . per cent last month to about , vehicles, compared with , in October .Registrations are down . per cent this year compared with the first ten months of last year, according to the latest data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders .Sales of diesels suffered another mauling last month, tumbling . per cent, year-on-year.The SMMT said there had been a shortage of some car brands caused by backlogs at testing centres, amid tougher emissions regulations introduced in the European Union.There has also been growing concern about the impact of diesel car emissions on air quality and uncertainty about what taxes and restrictions will be introduced on them.Demand for alternatively fuelled vehiclessuch as hybrids and pure electrics increased by . per cent to take a market share of . per cent. This was partly boosted by the news that grants for AFVs are set to be cut, drawing forward sales.SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said: “Vehicle excise duty upheaval, regulatory changes and confusion over diesel have all made their mark on the market this year so it’s good to see plug-in registrations buck the trend.“Demand is still far from the levels needed to offset losses where, however, and is making government’s decision to remove purchase incentives even more baffling.“We’ve always said that world-class ambitions require world-class incentives and, even before the cuts to the grant, those ambitions were challenging. We need policies that encourage rather than confuse.”Alex Buttle, director at car buying comparison website Motorway, said: “These latest figures suggest new car sales are entrenched at a sub-par level for the long term. The industry is gearing up for a cold, hard winter that could stretch long into  and beyond. “A fatal combo of interest rate fears, Brexit concerns and confusion over fuel types sees the industry locked in the deep freeze and in a perpetual battle to pick itself up off the floor. “AFV sales, after spluttering a little in September, did at least get back on the right track in October, and a  per cent rise does suggest some cause for optimism. However, the government’s bizarre decision to cut funding towards the Plug-in Car Grant could well blunt that growth in months ahead.”The Ford Fiesta was the best-selling model last month, following by the Volkswagen Golf and Mercedes-Benz A-Class in second and third places, respectively.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4824844.1541449413!/image/image.jpg","title":"how brexit could spark new highland clearances paris gourtsoyannis","story":"Farmers and crofters are warning that a row over subsidies in post-Brexit Britain threatens rural le in Scotland, writes Paris Gourtsoyannis.Farmers, by and large, are a stoic bunch. So when a  of Scottish farming and crofting leaders came to Westminster last week to warn that much of their way of le could be lost, you’d imagine people would sit up and listen.The other thing farmers are known for is spending their money. It doesn’t sit long in their pockets. Cash from the livestock market is spent at the feed mart and, like blood pumped from the heart, flows into a dozen other local businesses that keep small communities going. Tourism is the other big industry in rural Scotland, but farming arguably does more to keep families, and therefore vital services, in rural towns and villages year-round.Certain sections of the commentariat scoffed when the Scottish Government complained of a ‘power grab’ by the UK Government. Powers that had been held in Brussels were coming back to the UK, so the SNP had nothing to complain about, it was argued.Except it isn’t just the SNP complaining – it’s farmers, not normally given to nationalist hysteria and grievance. The Agriculture Bill currently before the House of Commons doesn’t plan out in detail what agricultural subsidies and regulations will look like after Brexit, but it does put in place some of the legal scaffolding that will determine how a replacement for the Common Agricultural Policywill be built. Because the Scottish Government refused to sign off on the Brexit legislation that underpins the sharing of responsibility in devolved areas, it contains no specic provisions for Scotland. Farmers are therefore left wondering which government to look to when the transition to a new subsidy regime takes place in the mid-s.The Scottish Government says authority to design its own scheme resides in the Continuity Bill, a piece of Holyrood legislation awaiting a ruling on its legality from the Supreme Court following a UK challenge. The decision is expected this month. Meanwhile, the Agriculture Bill has farming interests in Scotland worried. Appearing before the Commons’ Scottish Affairs Committee last week, Scottish farmers and crofters made clear their needs were determined by a very dferent landscape – literally – than in the rest of the UK.Michael Gove, the UK Environment Secretary, has signalled that he wants subsidies paid in future based on the improvements farmers make to the environment on their land – reducing the impact on landscapes and soils, improving bioersity, and so on. Funds may no longer be paid simply to support the core business of farming.: Theresa May ‘strikes secret Brexit deal over customs union’“If we took a similar approach in Scotland, that would be extremely detrimental, in many senses, to huge tracts of Scottish agriculture,” warned Johnnie Hall, the policy director for the National Farmers’ Union Scotland . In Scotland,  per cent of farmland qualies for support under the EU’s ‘Less Favoured Area’ scheme, designed for less productive, dficult terrain and soils. No other part of the UK is eligible. Rural businesses in more forgiving areas can be improved and ersied, but “there are no alternatives” to the way things are done in large parts of Scotland, the chair of the Scottish Crofting Federation, Russell Smith, told MPs.“If you don’t support, in this case, stock rearing in the north and the west, then you lose the population, the economy and everything that goes with that and supports it,” he warned.“In our croft, what we get from selling sheep and from our basic payment covers the costs of running the unit,” Smith added. Support under the Less Favoured Area scheme “is the profit”. Without it or an equivalent successor, “we would stop”. Without a separate scheme supporting specic types of livestock rearing, “we will see even more abandonment of the hills”.The NFUS has commissioned academic and legal opinion thatthe Agriculture Bill is the last word on how subsidies will be designed, that would give Gove “unilateral control over allocations of funding for certain types of support measure”, according to Hall.: Brian Monteith: Why independence and Brexit are not the sameEventhis gets straightened out eventually, it might be too late, MPs were reminded. “Farming and crofting is a long-term game,” Hall said. “It takes years and years. Decisions made today might not see afor some time to come.”This is existential stuff not just for farmers, but also for Scottish Tories, who represent a sizeable chunk of Scotland’s uplands in the Borders. Yet it was clear from the way Conservative MPs on the committee interacted with the witnesses that there was greater interest in convincing them they should be happy powers are ing from Brussels than engaging with fears about the detail of a future payments system.Like a tired marriage, EU farm subsidies are little loved, but impossible to imagine le without. The NFUS’ Hall called the CAP a “straightjacket” holding back innovation and preventing fresh blood from getting into farming, one of the UK’s fastest ageing industries.Some environmentalists believe hill farming is an ecological disaster, particularly in the Scottish Highlands, where before human intervention, a temperate rainforest covered much of the landscape. Eurosceptics on the right and the left see the CAP as the worst example of Brussels waste, and farmers as subsidy junkies. Free market evangelists claim the CAP and other initiatives like geographic indicators, protecting European produce from Parmesan cheese to Stornoway black pudding, are barriers to international trade.ButBrexit and the rise of populism are a response to the way globalisation lays waste to working-class communities and devalues traditional British ways of le, then protecting Scotland’s most precarious communities must be a priority. Farmers believe the Scottish Government, closer to their interests than Whitehall, is best placed to do that. The risk of families abandoning the Highlands should be enough to get the politicians to agree a solution.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4824699.1541429657!/image/image.jpg","title":"midterms voters should heed words of past presidents henry mcleish","story":"America goes to the polls in the midterm elections today after a nightmare week in which the President has unleashed, even by his own standards, a visceral assault on the qualities of respect, tolerance and justice that are necessary to support a reasonable level of civility and informed political discourse in any modern country. This has been an ugly week for America.Disappointed by his loss of momentum, angered by other serious issues hogging the limelight and dominating the news to his exclusion – such as the worst massacre of Jews ever in the US – and panicked by the prospect of his base not having enough raw red meat, Trump has drawn upon all of his worst traits of nationalism, authoritarianism and nativism.Trump’s campaign is racially charged and anti-immigration, deliberately raising the fear of a non-White America. Maybe, for the first time since , Trump’s narcissism and his own deep insecurity and fear are defining his closing argument. As a result, he has imprinted his own uniquely toxic brand of anger, hate and racism on the final days of the campaign. This may be a step too far for much of America. But do Democrats continue to underestimate Trump’s political strategy and the cultural wars that are tearing the US apart  The President is unapologetic. He believes the US is at war with migrants and he seems keen to deploy the full military might of the US on the Mexican border: and even after the synagogue massacre he gave credence to claims by the far-right that Jews are organising and financing the migrant caravans by suggesting liberal billionaire George Soros was behind the current one!These are seriously deranged utterances. There are few words to explain this political stunt and the lies on which it is based. Sadly, both the Republican party and the presidency are increasingly defined by lies.Trump’s laser-like focus on immigration is unnerving some Republicans in Congress and reluctant supporters who feel he may be taking them and their party over the edge. For Democrats, his behaviour only serves to confirm their worst fears that he is risking unrest and violence by his incendiary remarks and his failure to denounce white nationalism. For Trump’s base, this is the America they want. For them, he is a modern American hero!But, for many, he has simply failed to transition from being a stump candidate to a President. Mood and momentum are crucial in the run-up to polling day. Trump has held about ten rant-fueled rallies in the last week. These are worrying reminders of a fanatical base lapping up every morsel of his “them-and-us politics”.: US midterms: Regiment of women march on monstrous trump – Susan DalgetyThe big question is whether the Trump base remains strong enough and – bearing in mind the usual low turnout in midterm elections – whether there is any haemorrhaging of the less extreme but still apparently loyal Republican vote. Polls suggest a signicant sht away from Trump in suburban areas and amongst educated white women. Buyer’s remorse is growing. After focusing his wrath on the so-called caravan of migrants heading towards the US from Latin America, Trump in the last few days has raised the stakes by ordering more than , troops to the Mexican border and promising to increase this figure to ,, more than the deployment of US troops to Afghanistan! This announcement was accompanied by lurid headlines, on Fox News – the mouthpiece of the Trump White House – and other right-wing social media outlets of “invaders” threatening the US, representing an “infestation” bringing small pox and other diseases.For most Americans, this is a new low in the demonisation of men, women and children seeking a better le free from the crime, poverty and corrupt regimes. Putting America on a war-footing is not a rational response but it was never intended to be.Trump’s ego and much of his base are still remarkably in tune. Stopping short of “fight them on the beaches”, his rhetoric is making a mockery of his office and taking the American people for fools.Causing even more disquiet, Trump claimed he could defy the Constitution and end birthright citizenship via an executive order. The consensus among legal scholars and the view of Paul Ryan, the Republican Speaker of the House, is that the President cannot do this. To end this right, Trump would have to find a way around the th Amendment to the Constitution in a naked attempt to hijack the midterms as a vehicle for un-American racist ideals.: US midterms are crucial for Trump and the world – Christine JardineShortly before polling day, the Trump Republican campaign released a multi-million dollar political ad that, in the words of Stephen Collinson of CNN, accused the Democrats of “plotting to help people they depict as central American invaders” overrunning the nation with “cop killers”.This in a country desperately in need of both a political and spiritual uplt, a softening of its hard, abrasive and intolerant obsessions and a more measured discourse about the real issues facing the US and the wider world. America needs a healer, not a hater a commander-in-chief, not a scaremonger-in-chief and a President, not a rabble-rouser.Trump’s first electoral setback since November  may be on the cards, but he is already positioning himself to wash his hands of any losses. Despite appealing to his base to vote ashis name was on the ballot paper in every House, Senate and Gubernatorial race, Trump has said he will not take any responsibility for any Republican failure.It remains to be seen whether or not a sufficient drubbing for mainstream Republican candidates –that happens – will end their complicity and loyalty to someone whose demons and paranoia are destroying respect for the US abroad and reinforcing a bitter ide at home.One thing stands out amidst this election despair. In a White House where one lie is trumped by another, there is one hugely signicant issue which mustn’t be air-brushed out of the wider picture. The deaths of Americans and the spread of terror – in Kentucky, Washington and Pittsburgh – in the last two weeks was the result of home-grown white nationalism, not migrants, Muslims or Mexicans. This is the biggest threat to the stability and security of the US. Trump was unwittingly honest when asked about the lies he tells, saying, “I always like to tell the truth, when I can”!But, after the polls close later tonight, will fake news be the winner  Fear is a powerful and highly destructive emotion. US President Franklin Roosevelt said at his first inauguration: “So first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself – nameless, unreasoning, unjustied terror, which paralyses needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.” Ronald Reagan famously said: “America is a shining city upon a hill whose beacon light guides freedom-loving people everywhere.”Today, US citizens have the chance to advance or retreat further into a dark political place where the very ideals of US democracy are at risk and where the moral and political decline of America continues apace.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests.

They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that. There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff. This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Tuesday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118063.jpg","title":"Green light for Dalwhinnie quarry work","story":"Gavin MusgroveA quarry operator has said that measures are in place to allay concerns that their excavation plans could lead to a surge in speeding lorries in a Badenoch village.Leithshas been given the green light by the Cairngorms National Park Authorityrsquos planning committee to recommence operations at the site at Carn Dhomhnuill Bhain on the doorstep of Dalwhinnie.The company has said that it is not contingent on winning a contract to supply aggregate to the dualling of the A but that the produce will be used for housebuilding and other local construction projects.The firm was granted temporary permission for  yearsatthe CNPArsquoslatest planning committee meeting at Boat of Garten Community Hall.Production will be stepped up dramatically at the quarry around one mile north of Dalwhinnie by the A.It was previously in operation up to .But now Leiths has permission to extend the site from two to  hectares.

Ms Blessington revealed: \"It was handmade by Hamish Stone, of Nethy Bridge, and he painstakingly followed the  pages of directions from online to create the pizza oven from the redundant interior walls of the railway station.\"Another attraction is the purpose built Highland games field. Mr Garman has competed for many years on the circuit in his native United States and now nearer to his Revack home although injury prevented him this past season.There will be games demonstrations with the Grantown East staff getting involved too.The venue is horseshoe shaped to allow maximum viewing pleasure. Mr Garman said: \"I have been to hundreds of Highland games fields and the only thing I have always found is the spectators can not get high enough to see what is going on and also get good pictures.\"We will be staging demonstrations as many times as we possible can. We are cross-training all of the staff interested in the Highland games to be demonstrators so they can share the sports in a safe and informative manner too.\"The couple admit it has taken a while to see the light at the end of the tunnel.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service. That support is urgently required."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018-mod-gold-medals-e1539885405814.jpg","title":"thursday at the mod skye and lochalsh gold medal","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThere was a Skye and Lochalsh double in the premier singing competition at this year’s National Mòd in Dunoon.In Wednesday night’s final Ceitidh Campbell from Kyle of Lochalsh won the women’s Gold Medal, while the men’s medal went to Ruairidh Cormack from Portree.Both singers are following in family footsteps in landing the prestigious honour, which is presented by Mòd organisers An Comunn Gàidhealach.Ceitidh’s mother, Barbara Smith, won the Gold Medal when the Mòd was held in Skye in .

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27481  ","story":"• Mícheál Mac Donncha and Robert Ballagh Mícheál Mac Donnchaby Robert Ballagh published by Head of Zeus. back in the late s. For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future. It is time to lay the foundations for reconciliation andhealing, and to open up a new phase of the peace process. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27486  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National Chairperson“The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27492  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaAt the start of the th century women began to campaign actively against the denial of their right to vote. In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option for making change in the north. - Declan Kearney MLAThe publication of an open letter to An Taoiseach, LeoVaradkar from over one thousand signatories in the Irish News is a powerfulintervention supporting the rights of Irish citizens in the north of Ireland. December that Irish citizens in the north “would never again be left behind by anIrish government”.These Irish citizens have explicitly urged Leo Varadkar toadhere to his expressed commitment from last year, “and to redouble yourefforts, and the efforts of your government to ensure that our rights areprotected”.Their intervention comes at a time of deepening politicalcrisis, and increased uncertainty and instability caused by the continueddenial of citizens’ rights, and the fast approaching Brexit catastrophe.This initiative indicates the frustration and anger amongrepublicans and nationalists and other progressive minded people about thedenial of rights here, and which are taken for granted where throughoutthese islands.It is outrageous that the northern state remains a rightsback water where language, marriage equality, womens reproductive health andlegacy justice rights, as well as a Bill of Rights are blocked.Northern nationalists are absolutely incensed with thecontinued denial of democracy and democratic rights.They are not prepared to put up with their Irish identitybeing treated with disrespect and contempt.Some of the signatories who have backed this highlysignicant intervention were active supporters of, and participants in theoriginal Civil Rights Movement  years ago.But many more are the children and grandchildren of those whocampaigned and marched in support of modest civil rights reforms and who werebeaten and shot off the streets and roads in the north because the unioniststate refused to deliver equality and rights.These citizens reflect the ersity, depth, confidence andstrength of those who identy as Irish citizens in the north.They represent tens of thousands of others in the north, andfrom right across Ireland, who have invested in the promise and ambition of theIrish Peace Process and Good Friday Agreement . They are articulatingthe voice of a progressive silent majority.However, they also persony a fundamental realignment withinnationalist and progressive opinion, including some sections of civic unionism.A new dangerous tipping point has been created in thepolitical process due to the destructive bigotry of the DUP the combinedefforts of both the DUP and British Government to systematically undermine theGFA, and to impose Brexit and, as a result of their toxic pact.The GFA guaranteed the delivery of equality, rights, parityof esteem and mutual respect.The DUP and others in political unionism have consistentlyopposed it from .Twenty years after the signing of the GFA it has still to befully implemented despite its status as an internationally binding agreement whichhas been laid with the United Nations.As a consequence, both the British and Irish Governments haveobligations as co-guarantors to ensure its implementation.However, the British Tory government turned its back on theGFA since it took power in .Now the DUP, British government and the most extreme elementsin political unionism are engaged in a full frontal assault against theAgreement. Brexit is the antithesis of the GFA.Its imposition will deepen the rights deficit in the northand will further destabilise the political process.That reality goes to the very heart of the existing politicalcrisis in the North, and which blocks the political institutions from beingre-established.A wreckers’ agenda is being driven by the DUP and Torygovernment. They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1106582.jpg--.jpg?1540373104000\n","title":"allen s meats moves to larger premises in cullybackey","story":"AFTER  years serving the people of Ahoghill Allens Meats has moved to larger premises to meet the demands of the growing business.The butchers shop has relocated to Cullybackey to take over the former Lamont Butchers at  Main Street in the village.Allens Meats needed to acquire larger premises and decided to make the move to Cullybackey after David Lamont retired.Lamont Butchers has been based in Cullybackey since  and Derek Allen and his team will continue to provide the same excellent customer service and top quality produce.Derek said: “The business is growing and we needed more space to enable us to offer a wider range of products.“We would like to thank all our customers in Ahoghill for their support over the last  years.

A founding member of the Ballymurphy Massacre campaign and member of Relatives for Justice, Carmel will ask for American support for the campaign at public events and Congressional meetings. MPs have called for an end of former British troopers being “hounded and pursued” by murder investigations, while Theresa May praised the “heroism” of British crown forces who “upheld the law”. RFJ believes that while not specically referring to Ballymurphy, such claims may impact an inquest considering whether British forces upheld the rule of law in the case.AOH Freedom for All Ireland Chair Martin Galvin said: “The Ballymurphy Massacre is a fundamental test of Britain#s ability to give legacy justice. If victims cannot get justice where  people, including a Catholic priest and mother of eight children were killed by British troops, how can we expect justice in any killings or collusion murders where British forces were involved AOH National Vice-President Danny O#Connell and National Secretary Jere Cole recently promised the Ballymurphy families that America would stand behind them in their battle for justice.

The De La Salle student will travel to London on Friday and fly out to St Petersburg on Saturday. The preliminaries for the rd FIG Trampoline Gymnastics World Championships take place Wednesday, November  with the finals taking place two days later on Friday, November .Devine came out on top of a high-class field in the senior men’s DMT competition in Birmingham at the end of September to win his first British title and secure his place in the World Championships. His coach, Simon Flannery, was delighted with his performance in Birmingham and is hoping some adjustments to his routines will yield a further improvement in Russia next week. “Each competitor completes two routines and the top eight go through to the final,” stated Flannery.“The routines he did in the preliminaries for the British Championships are the routines he will now in the prelims in Russia. “Those routines would have placed him second in the prelims for last year. “We know he is in around the area he needs to be to make it to the final. “He was brilliant in Birmingham. He had a tough build-up to the Championships. The routines we wanted to do at the Championships weren’t quite there yet, so we had to make a decision not to compete with those. It paid off because he done a modied last routine and he done it really well and won.”He added: “Since then, we have upgraded those routines and he is looking phenomenal. He had a training camp last week with the GB team and he smashed all his classes. “In our sport, it comes down to tenths of points, so every step you take, or wobble, or bend of the arms can cost you. “Every tenth you lose is tripled because the three judges scores are counted.“The last training camp is about fine-tuning the little details to maximise your score.”As British champion, Devine will have high hopes of continuing his rapid rise in the sport by securing a medal. Flannery believes Devine has the ability to progress to next Friday’s finals and is hopeful of another fine showing from the West Belfast prospect. “He is hoping to get into the finals, which is the main thing,” said Flannery.“I think his routines will easily put him into the top five. “We’d love to come away with a medal.“He is excited and a little bit nervous, but he turns that into a real positive. He gets adrenaline from it.” Flannery, who recently relocated Andersonstown Trampoline Club to Mallusk to merge with Flight Gymnastics, also revealed that Devine will be targeting Olympic qualication in the New Year. The -year-old will have a well-earned break from competition after the World Championships in Russia before embarking on a two-year goal to qualy for Tokyo in . “We have got a break after Russia then, next year, the qualication starts for the Olympic Games ,” added the Flight Gymnastic coach. “It starts in February and he has to compete in a run of events over the next two years. Only the top  men and the top  women make the Olympics. “We are working very hard to get him into the top  so he can qualy for the Olympics.“If you take out the Russians and the Chinese, then a lot of dferent counties can make up that top . It comes down to whoever is the most consistent during the qualication events. “He has shown this year that he is very consistent in the top competitions so hopefully he can get a spot.#"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-02-at-09.52.44.png","title":"last chance to cast your vote for our inspirational youth","story":"WITH just hours to go until voting comes to a close for the Inspirational Youth of the West awards, rest assured – there is still time to cast your vote.With over , online votes so far counted across  categories, our youth and their sterling work and endeavours will be honoured on Friday, November  at the Devenish Complex for the gala congratulatory evening hosted by Pamela Ballantine.

In addition, UK won’t have to pay a penny more to EU, which means big increase for Dublin. Can’t understand why Irish Government seems so intent on this course.”Looks like we’re heading for no deal.

Something Number  dismissed as speculation.It was rumoured Mrs May could propose an EU summit for the end of the month to gather European leaders to seal an agreement. Deal on Irish border not close, says Michel BarnierOn Tuesday the Prime Minister assured ministers there would be another meeting of Cabinet before any withdrawal agreement is sealed, but her spokesman said that no extra meeting has yet been scheduled ahead of the regular gathering in Downing Street next Tuesday.The issue of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic has proved a near-impossible obstacle to overcome.The EU is determined to include a backstop which would see Northern Ireland remain as part of a customs union and single market with the EU, to prevent a need for infrastructure at the border in the event of a no deal.However, the UK Government would consider this as establishing an Irish Sea border and separate NI from the rest of the UK and instead is pushing for a UK-wide backstop arrangement.The EUs chief negotiator Michel Barnier said on Tuesday a resolution to the border issue was not close.\"We are still negotiating and I am not able to tell you that we are close to reaching an agreement, since there is still a real point of ergence on the way of guaranteeing peace in Ireland, that there are no borders in Ireland, while protecting the integrity of the single market,” he said.Theresa May attempts to defuse tension with Varadkar on border issue "},{"url":null,"title":"council took their eyes off the rules over 20m hotel jim allister","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This is particularly worrying as I remain unconvinced that the current site can accommodate an extra  or  students, without this having a detrimental effect on their wellbeing and the quality of teaching.ldquoI also have signicant concerns about the impact the single site option would have on traffic in the Saul Road area, given the congestion issues and poor infrastructure already in the town.He said he was ldquoworried about the impact that moving teachers and pupils, which he argued would be inevitable in the transitional phase, would have on timetabling.Cllr Brown said he was ldquoslightly more enthusiastic about a two-school option, though he claimed there was ldquostill a lack of clarity from CCMS about how this would work in practice.He added: ldquoI hope the CCMS can produce more detail on this during the post-consultation stage. Officials have informed us that they hope to implement this amalgamation as early as September .ldquoIf that is the case, much work needs to be done to assuage the concerns of parents, secure long term capital funding mdash and potentially a new site mdash and ensure the inevitable challenges occurring during the transitional period do not become permanent fixtures of any new school.Mr Lyttle said that while Alliance was strongly opposed to academic selection and believed in the need for integration and rationalisation of schools across the province, ldquothese changes must always be made while putting the wellbeing and educational outcomes of children first.He added: ldquoThere does appear to be practical concerns with this proposal, particularly regarding implementation which will need to be addressedany amalgamation is to be delivered in a way that will benefit all pupils.ldquoIt is vital that the concerns of parents and other stakeholders are considered and the change management process is handled in a way which delivers for everyone in the community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Annsborough school forms community forum group  ","story":"A NEW community engagement forum has been launched at Annsborough Integrated Primary School.This exciting new development will involve parents, governors, staff and past pupils working with officers from the Northern Ireland Council for Integrated Education, supported by investment from the Integrated Education Fund.Speaking at the launch last Thursday, Lynda Brown, school principal, said she was pleased at the investment and support being offered by NICIE and the IEF.ldquoThere is a great buzz in the school tonight and itrsquos lovely to see so many parents, governors and families attending from within our local community, she remarked.Ms Brown welcomed Tina Merron, Chief Executive Officer of the IEF, Roisin Marshall, CEO of NICIE, and Denise Morgan, Senior Development Officer with NICIE.She said the school community looked forward to working with them to build on the Integrated education being offered at Annsborough IPS.ldquoWe are keen to work with our local community to ensure that integrated provision is available for all who desire it in future, she added.Ms Marshall said she was ldquodelighted to be at the school to discuss the future growth of integrated education in the area.She remarked: ldquoItrsquos always really nice to get the chance to meet people who are committed to working together for their local communities to ensure that children and adults can have opportunities to work together under one roof mdash Protestant,Catholic, other faiths and none.

Little was seen of Ards attack in the first half, but with  minutes gone Nathan McShane had to be alert to head an in-swinging corner from Brian Cabraley off the line.McGrady, Branagan and Telford continued to give the Ards defence plenty to think about and with  minutes gone Downpatrick made it -. Branagan worked his way into a good position on the right and fired over a tempting cross that flew into the top left hand corner of the net, giving the visiting goalkeeper no chance.Downpatrick went in at the break, worthy of their three-goal advantage, but they were unable to kick on from there in the second half.Ards were the more aggressive after the break and Downpatrick were put under a certain amount of pressure, but Anthony Doherty, Conor Moore, Nathan McShane and Caolan Logue all defended superbly and provided resolute cover to captain Kieran Gordon in goal.Gordon was only beaten once and that was in the th minute when McCleary tucked away a cross from Dunlop in a clever move.Ards continued to push and probe, but a hard-working Downpatrick side refused to give way and thoroughly deserved their first three points of the season.Downpatrick FC: K Gordon, C Logue, N McShane, C Moore, A Doherty, J Branagan, C McGrady, Adrian McCoubrey, M McGarritty, Andrew McCoubrey, P Telford.

A wayward box kick from Rhys OrsquoDonnell allowed Buccaneers to pile on the pressure and when flanker Oli Loughead collapsed a driving maul, he received a yellow card and the visitors eventually scored a soft try from a five metre scrum after another maul was well defended.The home side then took control of the match, scoring two fine tries before half-time.Rory Butler recovered an OrsquoDonnell kick and multiple phases later was on hand to put Richard Reaney in for the score to take the lead and when Buccaneers were turned over as they tried to play out of defence, excellent interplay between centres Butler and Callum McLaughlin enabled Boomer to release Kelly, who finished well in the corner to leave the half-time score at -.Early Buccaneers pressure in the second half was well defended on their own line by the lsquoHinch forwards, with OrsquoToole and Boomer prominent and when skipper Aaron Cairns put in a great kick down the line, lsquoHinch pressure on the line out led to an attacking scrum.OrsquoDonnell scored as the lsquoHinch pack drove their opponents over the line for the bonus point score. Cairns then scored the try of the match with a brilliant line close to the ruck near the halfway line taking him into space.He then accelerated round the opposition defence to score. It was all lsquoHinch at this point and as the men from Athlone began to chase the game, a loose pass gave Reaney the opportunity to hack the ball through for the sixth lsquoHinch try. Reaney then turned provider with a fine break leading to OrsquoDonnellrsquos second score as the home side stretched their lead out to -.With the result secured, lsquoHinch management emptied the bench and consequently lost some of their intensity, but there was still time for Reaney to complete his hat-trick with a well-finished score after some excellent offloading between forwards and backs.To their credit, Buccaneers never gave up and they were rewarded with an unlikely bonus point as they took full advantage of some poor defending at the set piece from a lsquoHinch team which had clearly switched off to score three late converted tries and bring respectability to the scoreboard.Ballynahinch move up to third in the table and will travel to Naas at the weekend in good form.They will know that after missing seven out of eight conversions, more success from the kicking tee will be required in tighter matches, but will hope to kick on as the season comes to the boil in the run up to Christmas.Ballynahinch Buccaneers AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Reception for Shine charity to recognise group’s work  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council hosted a reception last to highlight the work of Shine, a UK wide charity which provides specialist advice and support for spina bida and hydrocephalus in the council area.The councilrsquos vice-chairperson, Osanka McMahon, expressed her admiration for the members and families of Shine and thanked Shine staff for their invaluable contribution.

It was a conflict in which his uncle, Charlie Dunbar had been persuaded to volunteer for ldquoto fight for his religion.But the experience of what Charlie saw left a deep scar and changed him forever.Adrian was the focus of the ldquoWho Do You Think You Are  on RTE on Sunday evening, and it was a fascinating watch.As we all get a little older, many of us seem to have an increasing interest in our own past, especially our own family history. In Ireland, family is still a powerfully symbolic and emotive part of our DNA, and the programme often reveals some interesting context for inidual celebrities.As Adrian said: ldquoAll of us are interested in our backgrounds where we come from and what yoursquore born into. Those things shape who you are.Therersquos no doubt that we will have been particularly interested in Dunbarrsquos journey into his background after all hersquos one of our own.But the interest in the programme went much deeper and much more meaningful. With several little vignettes showing the complexity of identity in Ireland.A word used frequently these days in all sorts of context is binary, meaning only two parts or ision into two groups. Itrsquos particularly apt to the world view of Northern Ireland. Protestant equals Unionist British, Catholic equals Nationalist Irish, would be the perception.It isnrsquot the case, of course, and shouldnrsquot be. But the troubled th century in Ireland, particularly the last quarter of it, saw both groups driven further into a silo mentality.Irsquove always felt that there was a certain irony in the fact that a violent Republican campaign to achieve Irish unity did, actually, create more ision.Now, the current circumstance of changing demographics in the north combined with the Brexit crisis are focusing on identity as we go forward.Adrian Dunbar is a clever inidual and, indeed, a perceptive one and the story of his family background in the programme was punctuated with comments which should evoke some thought about the past, present and future.Adrian was brought up in Enniskillen in a mainly Nationalist area, though for a few years the family moved to Portadown, Garvaghey Road in fact, where he recalls loyalist paramilitaries parading close by in a show of strength to people in Nationalist areas to know their place. The memory of two communities living apart is eloquently described by Adrian as ldquosocial engineering to suit sectarianism. While Enniskillen was much less hostile, the time, the place and the neighbourhood environment where he and his siblings grew up were far from ideal recruiting ground for the British military.And yet, on his mother Pauline Camplingrsquos side, there is an incredibly strong link and a history of service going back three generations.Adrian visited St. Michaelrsquos Church where Frankie Roofe was able to give him intriguing detail of his great-great-grandfather coming to Enniskillen as a soldier from England and converting from Church of England to Catholicism.Recounting some of the history of the Inniskilling Fusiliers, when the regiment ldquoheld the line for Wellington at Waterloo about half of the  men were killed, Adrian himself pointed out that about a third of the men spoke only in Irish. Itrsquos a quirk of how history develops that hundreds of years later the native tongue of men who died serving the British Army is somehow portrayed controversially as anti-British.Adrianrsquos grandfather, Walter Campling served in the Inniskillings, and three of his sonshad distinguished service in the British military in world war.The programme shows Adrian coming home to Enniskillen to discuss this with his brother Liam.Interestingly, though, Liam said that because they were brought up in Nationalist areas they didnrsquot go round talking about their ancestorsrsquo British military service. And Adrian himself said that the idea that he and his siblings would have followed the tradition of their three previous generations had gone.Such service to the British military by Catholic Nationalist families was common, as a look at the names of both communities on the Enniskillen War Memorial show.Yet, it was a feature not talked about in recent history and illustrates the complexities of identity that weave their way through our communities.Conversely, of course, the perception suggests that all Protestants consider themselves ldquoas British as Finchley and thatrsquos just as much an oversimplication. Surely the two identities donrsquot slot handily into their own homogeneous monolith There were a couple of telling moments, I thought, in the Dunbar programme.His uncle Charlie, whom Adrian remembers fondly dishing out sixpences, had been convinced in the late s to join the Irish brigade fighting for the fascist Franco in the Spanish Civil War under the guise of fighting to preserve the Catholic religion against the evils of Communism.On hearing some of the shocking atrocities that his uncle witnessed, Adrian reflected: ldquoPeople do a lot of things in the name of religion, donrsquot they  Sadly, as we know only too well in the north.And he added: ldquoThe combination of religion and politics is not a good one.And there was another line which struck me. Adrian was shown a photo of Queen Victoriarsquos state visit to Dublin in  when the city was still under British rule.He was shown the regimental band, including his grandfather, and considering the protest and fight for independence in Ireland which was about to change everything, Adrian referred to his grandfather and other comrades as being ldquoon the wrong side of history.A century on from that Royal visit, the country saw a war of independence, a civil war, decades of conflict in this part of the island and more recently more Royal visits by the current Queen both north and south of the Border.And now itrsquos a pertinent question to ask what side of history the ious identities are on now.The confusion and uncertainty over future membership of the European Union has thrown the subject of identity to the forefront, and there is the suggestionthat the issue of Irish unity is firmly on the agenda.To be honest, I donrsquot think evena Border poll was held that it would result in unity just now.But herersquos a thing. On Sky News last week, journalist Adam Boulton was interviewing Scottish Deputy First Minister, John Swiney and his opening question was: ldquoWhat do you think is more likely to happen first, a united Ireland or an independent Scotland The fact that he asked it seriously is telling, as is Swineyrsquos serious reply which began, ldquoItrsquos a close run thinghellip.In the current political climate, the DUP say they are engaged in a ldquobattle for the Union. Aside from the fact that all politics here seems to boil down to that, in this case the DUP may well be right.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I have been moved to tears by so many honest and heart-wrenching accounts.I canrsquot even begin to imagine the pain of losing a child at any stage of le it is inconceivable for those who have never suffered such a loss. But sadly, itrsquos more common that we imagine.It is estimated that one in four pregnancies in the UK ends in miscarriage, defined as a loss of pregnancy up to a gestation of  weeks and  days. A loss after that is considered stillbirth and in  there were , stillbirths ndash thatrsquos nine babies stillborn every day ndash and , neonatal deaths.As part of baby loss awareness week, bereaved parents, along with their families and friends have been coming together, joining with others across the world, to commemorate their babiesrsquo lives.The campaign was started  years ago and yet the fact remains that in our society, it is really only in the last couple of years that we have started to talk openly about baby loss.Indeed it remains a subject that few of us feel completely comfortable navigating. I will admit that before I became a mother three years ago, I had conversations with women who lost their baby during pregnancy and I know I didnrsquot handle those conversations very well.Maybe there isnrsquot a right thing to say, but I recognise now that that I, like so many of us do, shied away from much,any, conversation. Despite knowing that the phrase ldquoIrsquom so sorry was lacking, I refrained from empathising any further or asking questions because I felt I didnrsquot have the right words, I was afraid of saying too much, of saying the wrong thing, of being insensitive, and most of all I was afraid of upsetting that mother.But what I have learned since is that many women ndash and men ndash who have said goodbye to a child in pregnancy or during birth, want to talk about the loss. They donrsquot want you to cross the street to avoid them. Many want you to askthat baby had a name, or when his or her birthday would have been. Of course, itrsquos hard to know any of this unless we have the opportunity to have open and transparent conversations about such a sensitive and dficult issue.Talking about the subject of death is still quite taboo in our society, particularly when it is the death of a baby. But we shouldnrsquot underestimate the importance of talking about baby loss. Not only does it help those who are grieving, helping them to process what has happened, to stop blaming themselves and feel less alone in what can be an emotional and physical rollercoaster, it also gives us all the opportunity to develop the tools and language to discuss this emotive subject with greater understanding, helping to normalise something that is common - and indeed normal - but not talked about enough.Itrsquos ironic and perhaps a cruel reality of social norms that women are encouraged not to tell people about pregnancy until after the first trimester when sickness abates and the risk of miscarriage is greatly reduced. Surely the early stage is when pregnant women need compassion and understanding. The expectation to remain silent during the first  weeks of pregnancy means many couples faced with loss are left to grieve without the support that they need. After all, it doesnrsquot matter whether the loss of a baby is at eight weeks gestation or  weeks, the trauma felt by those who loved and wanted each child are the same. They had imagined their new family they had probably considered whether that baby was a boy or a girl and all sorts of other exciting plans.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This campaign is aided and supported by a number of the Prime Ministerrsquos own Conservative Party members.Sadly, what we are witnessing from many sections is an anti-British position rather than a debate based on any sound principles as to why there are not more pragmatic positions on providing a good deal for everyone involved.As someone who voted to remain within the EU I am extremely disturbed at the antagonistic stance being displayed by the European Union towards the democratic wish of the majority of the citizens of the United KingdomThis has brought me to thinking thatthis is their attitude in general to the UK, then we are better out of this vastly over regulated group. What is even more surprising is the attitude of the Irish Government. They are our near neighbours and have signicant trade with the UK, but are certainly making no attempt to have a conciliatory attitude to finding a positive deal.Given the potential economic loss to the Republic of Ireland, Irsquom curious as to why they are not attempting to use their influence, by their public utterances and in discussions with other EU members, to provide a more assuaging attitude to the situation. This I feel would be more conducive to sustaining beneficial trading relations between the two nations post Brexit.Thankfully the United Kingdom has a strong economy which has supported and assisted many smaller nations, including the Republic of Ireland in the EU for many years.It is hugely positive that Northern Ireland is part of the UK, the fth largest economy in the world.

It is the issue over which the whole Withdrawal Agreement could collapse, leaving all of us in the mire of a lsquoNo Dealrsquo outcome.ldquoIt is therefore very important that all judgements of the backstop are based on a clear and accurate understanding of what it actually means, unclouded by hyperbole.And it is in relation to the backstop where Dr Hayward, who is a Fellow in the Senator George J. Mitchell Institute for Global Peace, Security and Justice, took most issue with Mrs Foster analysis:ldquoFoster claims that Northern Irelandrsquos access to the UK single market would be restricted. In actual fact this is entirely in the hands of the British government ndash it is a domestic issue unrelated to UK-EU negotiations, the Queens Reader asserted, before adding:ldquoSecondly, Foster says that lsquoEU access, comes with the requirement for Northern Ireland to fully adopt and implement EU regulations with no changesrsquo. But it is not necessary to have full regulatory alignment with the EU in order to have tarf free access to its market. That would be like saying wed have to have all our laws imposed by Beijingwe are to get tarf-free access to China.Dr Hayward does however admit that major ergence would require an operational backstop:ldquoThat said,the UK erges widely from the lsquocommon rulebookrsquo of the EUrsquos single market, it would not be possible for goods produced in Northern Ireland to have free movement around the single market as is currently the case. It would be in just such an instance that the backstop could come into play. This would not mean that all EU laws would apply in Northern Ireland but rather that goods produced here could be considered to be of EU standardcertain procedures are followed.In her opinion piece last week Mrs Foster stated that:ldquoFree Trade Agreements donrsquot just cover regulation but tarfs too. This would require not just being in the single market but in the customs union. In other words, a total sea Border descending between Northern Ireland and its largest market, Great Britain.Dr Hayward does not agree however and says ldquothere is absolutely no prospect of a total sea border under any scenario.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Lagan Valley MP, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson The Lagan Valley MP’sremarks came after Irish deputy prime minister Simon Coveney rejected a time-limited backstop or a backstop that could be ended unilaterallyby the UK.The backstop is designed to ensure there is no hard border on the island of Irelandthe UK and EU fail to reach a broader trade deal.In a phone conversation with the Irish taoiseach on Monday, Prime Minister Theresa May said any agreement would have to include a review mechanism to bring an end to the backstop.But Mr Coveney tweeted today: “These ideas are not backstops at all and don’t deliver on previous UK commitments.”In response, Sir Jeffrey said Dublin’s stance was making a no-deal Brexit likely.“Looks like we’re heading for no deal,” he tweeted.“Such an outcome will have serious consequences for the economy of the Republic. In addition, the UK won’t have to pay a penny more to EU, which means big increase for Dublin. “Can’t understand why Irish Government seems so intent on this course.”His party colleague, Jim Shannon MP said it was time for the Republic to “get real or face having to pay the price”.He told the News Letter: “If Dublin wants to play hard ball, then they need to be prepared to put in place the new security arrangements across the border.“It will be them introducing border controls, not the UK, and there will be a cost.Primark confirms date for reopening of Belfast storeCouncil cleansing operative John Winton dies after being struck by bin lorry Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“Every time sensible proposals are put forward, they shoot them down. “It is about time the caught themselves on and stopped showboating.”Taoiseach Leo Varadkar told Mrs May on Monday that he was ready to consider a review mechanism as part of a backstop arrangement to keep the border with Northern Ireland open after Brexit.But he made clear that he would not accept an arrangement which gave the UK unilateral powers to ditch the customs union without the agreement of Brussels.Mrs May is understood to view the mechanism as a means of allaying the concerns of Conservative and DUP MPs, who want guarantees that any future membership of a customs union is temporary.Speaking to the News Letter on Monday, DUP Brexit spokesperson Sammy Wilson said his party would not support “any mechanism that gives a veto to the EU or the Irish”, adding:“We could be stuck with this arrangement forever, this eternal backstop.” He also warned thatMr Varadkar continues with his hard-line approach, he will ensure there is no deal agreed in the House of Commons, adding: “The Irish republic will live with the consequences of that,”try catch     .               ..

In a statement yesterday, she added: “Despite all the controversy over the previous refusal to fund Seachtain na Gaeilge or even to engage with the Irish language community to discuss this, it appears that some members of the council have learned nothing.”But DUP Councillor Gregg McKeen said Conradh na Gaelige had been treated “the same as any other group” who had made a funding request, by pointing them towards the council’s grants programme.He told the News Letter: “They will be assessed under the same criteria as everyone . It is not that they are being refused funding, but they need to go through the same process as everyone . We don’t want to set them on a pedestal above other groups.”Earlier this year, an Irish language event hosted by then DUP Mayor of Mid and East Antrim was commended by Irish language groups.Primark confirms date for reopening of Belfast store Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

A petition has also been sent in to the National Assembly.Many local residents from Penarth, Barry, Cardf and further afield have shared their frustrations over the sediment being dumped off the coast.Penarth man Anthony Slaughter, who is the Cardf and the Vale Green Partyrsquos campaigns officer and also the chairman of Gwyrddio Penarth Greening, said: ldquoWe understand and share local residentsrsquo concerns over the dumping of this potentially hazardous mud in the Severn estuary.ldquoIn addition to any possible risks associated with this waste we are opposed to any action that enables the development of the Hinkley C nuclear power station.ldquoAs the only political party in Wales that is completely and unambiguously opposed to all nuclear power we do not support the plans for either Hinkley C or Wylfa B power stations.Even rock musician and anti-nuclear campaigner Cian Ciaran, who is the keyboard player for the band Super Furry Animals, has come out against the matter.The musician lodged papers at the High Court seeking an injunction to stop the dumping and said that the ldquonuclear establishment cannot be trusted.ldquoAbsence of evidence is not the evidence of absence, and therefore the precautionary principle should dictate a rethink, said Mr Ciaran. ldquoA rethink by our politicians and policy makers to do the right think by its people.ldquoThe implications and consequences of this dredging could be far reaching.South Wales Central AM Neil McEvoy has set up a CrowdFunder page to raise pound, for the protest as he believes there may be a judicial review.He said: ldquoOur initial target of pound, was so that we could carry out an interim injunction in order to temporarily halt the dumping of the Hinkley nuclear reactor mud.ldquoHowever, in order to stop the mud dump for good we will need toto court, which could lead to a judicial review. Judicial reviews are very costly and so extra funding will be required. This will be used for court fees and to put together a strong legal challenge against the mud being dumped in Wales.ldquoIrsquom concerned because I do not believe enough testing has been done. Wersquore talking about mud being dredged from outside a nuclear reactor.Energy company EDF are dredging the mud ahead of building two new nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point C in Somerset.

A petition has also been sent in to the National Assembly.Many local residents from Penarth, Barry, Cardf and further afield have shared their frustrations over the sediment being dumped off the coast.Penarth man Anthony Slaughter, who is the Cardf and the Vale Green Partyrsquos campaigns officer and also the chairman of Gwyrddio Penarth Greening, said: ldquoWe understand and share local residentsrsquo concerns over the dumping of this potentially hazardous mud in the Severn estuary.ldquoIn addition to any possible risks associated with this waste we are opposed to any action that enables the development of the Hinkley C nuclear power station.ldquoAs the only political party in Wales that is completely and unambiguously opposed to all nuclear power we do not support the plans for either Hinkley C or Wylfa B power stations.Even rock musician and anti-nuclear campaigner Cian Ciaran, who is the keyboard player for the band Super Furry Animals, has come out against the matter.The musician lodged papers at the High Court seeking an injunction to stop the dumping and said that the ldquonuclear establishment cannot be trusted.ldquoAbsence of evidence is not the evidence of absence, and therefore the precautionary principle should dictate a rethink, said Mr Ciaran. ldquoA rethink by our politicians and policy makers to do the right think by its people.ldquoThe implications and consequences of this dredging could be far reaching.South Wales Central AM Neil McEvoy has set up a CrowdFunder page to raise pound, for the protest as he believes there may be a judicial review.He said: ldquoOur initial target of pound, was so that we could carry out an interim injunction in order to temporarily halt the dumping of the Hinkley nuclear reactor mud.ldquoHowever, in order to stop the mud dump for good we will need toto court, which could lead to a judicial review. Judicial reviews are very costly and so extra funding will be required. This will be used for court fees and to put together a strong legal challenge against the mud being dumped in Wales.ldquoIrsquom concerned because I do not believe enough testing has been done.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Belfast City Council’s planning committee approved Primark’s listed building consent application for the Bank Buildings. It means the conservation-led works to take down the top two floors of Bank Buildings can now begin. “Once these unstable elements are removed, works can take place to install a facade retention scheme,” the council said. “It will also make it possible to reduce the cordon and restore pedestrian access between Royal Avenue and Donegall Place, subject to health and safety considerations as work takes place.” It also means Primark will be able to open up once again, at the building’s new extension. Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium , said: \"This is terric news for Primark and for the retail hub of Belfast City Centre. Now that planning has been granted they can start the work to bring down the facade and put up the protection that will allow the cordon to reduce and for stores within the cordon to open. “This will be a le line for those traders in the cordon and those without who have seen their footfall drop by over %. We also welcome the news that Primark will open again soon as it will serve as a footfall draw to this part of the city which has been devastated. We now look the Chancellor and his budget next week to seecentral government will step up to support the city centre.” The latest footfall figures from the NIRC showed footfall across the city was down by more than % in September.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"donegall house on sale for m","story":"Posted on Thursday November  by Ulster Business A prominent Belfast building has gone on the market for offers over £.m, it can be revealed.Donegall House, which sits across from City Hall on Donegall Square, is now being marketed by Osborne King and CBRE.Built in , the building was refurbished in . It current plays host to tenants including Nationside, Barclays, Davy and Hays Recruitment.There is also a suggestion that a further , sq ft could be added over the building’s seven storeys, subject to planning permission.Some of the other business tenants include a small Kaffe O coffee kiosk, and Space NK.Gavin Clarke, director of investment at Osborne King, said while a few UK-based investment funds have looked at the building, it could go to someone closer to home.“It’s a landmark building – it’s the first time it’s been on the market in  years.“I thinkcould be local. We have had a few UK-based funds look at it to date. It’s still early days.”Meanwhile, a number of other major commercial property deals were completed in the third quarter of the year, according to a new report from CBRE.That includes Laharna Retail Park in Larne, which sold for £.m.And a number of other large business parks and buildings are also now on sale. That includes Crescent Link Retail Park in Derry, on sale for £.m, Antrim Business Park for £.m and The Boat building in Belfast city centre – on the market for £.m.According to CBRE, there were  major commercial lettings in the third quarter of the year, across , sq ft of space.That included Firstsource, which is taking almost , sq ft of space at - Fountain Street, which had been home to Concentrix.Meanwhile, construction workloads edged upwards in the third quarter of the year, despite a “marked decline in infrastructure and public sector work”.That’s according to the latest survey from RICSand Tughans.Jim Sammon, RICS Northern Ireland construction spokesman, said: “While it is encouraging that we are seeing rises in the private housing, private commercial sector and public housing subsectors, the picture across other areas, particularly infrastructure, continues to cause concern.“The fact that infrastructure and public non housing workloads are in decline gives an indication of the impact the lack of decision-making in government is having on the ground.And Michael McCord, head of construction, Tughans, said: “In some respects it appears that there is a two-tier construction market at present, with some private sector activity forging ahead, while surveyors report declines in infrastructure and other publicly-funded activity”.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Brian-1121.jpg","title":"brian mcgrath we were swept up in a national brexit debate which wasnt relevant for us","story":"Posted on Friday November  by Ulster Business John Mulgrew speaks to Foyle Port chief executive Brian McGrath about sharing UK and Irish waters, the burden of increased bureaucracy but looking at a potential Brexit silver-lining coming down the line There’s a surprising air of optimism surrounding Brian McGrath when it comes to the UK’s exit from the EU.While the Foyle Port chief believes the £m business – which handles around £.bn in commodities each year – could feel the bureaucratic hand of a post-Brexit environment, such as delays, paperwork and a potential “logjam”, that it’s in a unique position, sharing both UK and Irish waters.But he believes the Irish border was a mere “second thought” when Brexit campaigning was at its height – instead, focused around an emotional argument around immigration. A national debate which “we have been swept up in”, he says.While he says there remain serious issues which leave his business, and the rest of Northern Ireland, in the dark, far from seeing the port’s proximity with the border – in fact much of the mass of water is in the Republic – as a negative, Brian believes it could positively position it following Brexit.“We are unique as we are both a UK and European port, which is a fantastic opportunity with Brexit coming up.“We are talking to the City Deal people, the UK and Irish governments along with Donegal.“I think we, along with others, particularly, have an opportunity… there are dficulties we could face, especially with a no deal. We are pleased we can articulate our concerns and still hopefully have practical solutions.“Even in a ‘no deal’ scenario, where we are located, there will need to be good relations. Around %commute from Donegal. They will still need to do that.“In a paradox, it does bring some benefits. We have benefits with this Atlantic gateway – it is under-used, and can be utilised in a way to straddle the border. We are speaking about how we can join the dots.”Brian says the port has been working with Donegal County Council, over plans for its new cruise ship terminal at Greencastle. “We have the ability to import materials into the Irish side in the case of a hard Brexit. It wouldn’t take a huge amount of investment to make that happen.“There’s another dimensioninfrastructure capacity. We have a lot of things in place which is strong.“We have deep water available, and have access to probably the biggest land bank in the British Isles.“Project Kelvin  – the high-speed trans-Atlantic fibre-optic cable connection – runs right past our offices. We have over MW of power right beside us. In terms of the building blocks for basic industrial development, they are all in place.“In effect, a ‘no deal’ hard Brexit would be the ultimate impact… it means additional bureaucracy, would cost our port customers time and money, and might make them look at alternative ports to bring material in.“We are not insulated form the operational side of things. Materials coming in from the rest of the world. What could be an extreme in this, ultimately, it might mean, bringing in two million tonnes a year, % from Europe – that % could be subject to tarfs, or a lot of bureaucracy.”Laying it all out, the key concern ishuge bulk cargo – such as grain or animal feed – has to be ‘unitised’ into separate lorry loads, which require single certication each time.“It could create a fairly substantial bureaucracy around the logistics. That’s the very worst situation.”But business is good. Brian says the port employs  staff directly, but around , indirectly.“The numbers we put out in turnover are really strong, but they are modest in a sense that they don’t reflect the impact of what we do,” he says.“Percentage-wise, it’s mostly about the job creation that comes into the regional economy. “We have reinvested £m in the last few years, have a £m asset base and handle about £.bn in commodities a year.”In the other corner, Brian’s closely involved in Derry’s bid for a City Deal, similar to that submitted by six councils, including Belfast, last month.“We are working really closely with the infrastructure around the City Deal. There are two strands – there is the innovation, which is being led by Ulster University, and there is the infrastructure, which we will be playing a fairly central role in.”So, back to Brexit. What will Brian and his team be doing on the morning of March   “As much as you can do, we will continue as normal,” he said.“We have a number of preparedness scenarios. We are as prepared as I think we can be.“We could be prepared, but log jamsare beyond our control. “I don’t hear anyone talking up, or looking for a no deal outcome. I think Northern Ireland businesses have articulated itvery well, and we are punching above our weight.”The biggest issue is whereby a customer could look to moving where, thus moving trade away from the north west, Brian says.Looking back almost two and half years ago, and examining the current landscape today – whereby the UK is set to leave both the customs union and single market – Brian says: “I would have stayed in the customs union and single market. Our strategy has been to defend and grow – why would anyone want to turn away from the biggest customer base “I am not critical of people who wanted to leave the EU – but the way it has been done has not exactly been helpful. “What we see, in my own personal interpretation, when we talk to politicians, particularly from the UK, that the decision to leave the EU was made onof immigration.“That is what took us on the path. There’s then the second thought of the Irish question. If you can solve the issue for Derry, you can solve it for Dover. I don’t think that was considered when the case for leaving on immigration.“We have been swept up in an alternative, national debate – not something relevant for us.”And what’s next for the port  Brian says it’s been through three successful strategies, so far, in terms of expanding the growth.“It’s about leveraging in the coreand selling out the additional capacity to other capacities.“For example, in our marine, we invested in vessels – dredgers. When not used for our work, we go around the UK and Ireland, and offering expertise to other ports.“The key things we are doing is the strategic aims, to defend and grow – maintaining our core business, with core customers, and then looking to developing the industrial land bank and tourist product.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Danske-cover.jpg","title":"danske bank leading the tech and digital charge","story":"Posted on Monday November  by Ulster Business Danske Bank has taken another leap forward in its support for nurturing and helping to get businesses off the ground. Ulster Business chats to Danske Bank’s Vicky Davies and Richard Caldwell about the bank’s new Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub and ‘Making more possible’ for Northern Ireland businesses When you are already leading the technology and digital race in Northern Ireland banking, where do you go from there  For Danske Bank, its sights were set on something hugely ambitious, and something philanthropic which it believes can help cultivate, boost and grow the next generation of technology and fintech business start-ups in Northern Ireland. Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, run in partnership with Catalyst Inc, is a stunning, modern incubator and hub which will see dozens of entrepreneurs and start-up businesses shape and craft their ideas in the heart of Danske Bank’s own Belfast city centre headquarters. The partnership with Catalyst Inc makes a lot of sense, as it already plays host to dozens of knowledge-based businesses across  acres in the Titanic Quarter, and the Innovation Centre in Londonderry. Vicky Davies is managing director of strategy and corporate development at Danske Bank. “We have a clear ambition to be the best bank in Northern Ireland, and we plan to do that by making more possible for our customers, employees, stakeholders and society”, she says. It’s that message, ‘Making more possible’, that adorns the wall of one of the main meeting rooms in the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. “Banking is changing so fast. It’s relentless in terms of new entrants, innovation and the level of new fintech money coming into the industry.” “We know we need to change at pace, or face being left behind.” “We needed a partner in this venture, and we were looking for someone with reach and expertise,” she said. Following an initial meeting last year with senior management at Catalyst Inc, Vicky says there was an immediate mutual connection, and they went from there. “They have the expertise in running a space like this, and we have access to banking and business expertise – with both of us having great experience in helping businesses to grow. So, every dimension we looked at – it was a really good fit.” The hub is an impressive space, awash with splashes of colour, connectivity, co-working spaces and meeting rooms – including a nod to Princess Leia with an image on a wall – and it is able to play host to around - entrepreneurs and business start-up professionals, with top end cable and fibre internet connections. It’s further evidence of Danske Bank ensuring it’s well ahead of the pack and out in front. It’s about bringing a business from an embryonic start-up, to a thriving company, helping lead the way in its sector. But for Danske, this isn’t all about the bottom line. It’s about creating a thriving hub for the future stars of Northern Ireland’s burgeoning tech sector. And it’s a two-way street – with the bank aiming to learn as much from the start-up businesses nestled in the top-end spacious ground-floor hub, as the other way around. So, what does this mean for Danske Bank in terms of business banking and as an institution further bolstering its credentials in the digital space. Richard Caldwell is managing director of personal banking and small business. “We want to be part of the local fintech journey. We want to help influence and develop ideas,” he says. “There are more than , businesses in Northern Ireland, and we want to continue to support start-ups in general – by putting expertise and support into this partnership, we will help this particular set of small businesses to grow in what is a burgeoning sector.” “Ultimately, real success for us would be seeing products brought to market, and helping businesses grow from an embryonic idea, through to start-up, growth and expansion. With the business maybe ending up as one of our loyal corporate customers in the future.” Richard says research showed that many of Danske Bank’s existing bigger business customers wanted the bank to provide “something more tangible” for start-ups, to grow companies for the future. Although tenants in the new fintech space don’t necessarily have to bank with Danske, the Bank does offer banking support, including everything from a current account, to receiving assistance from a growth adviser to support them with their banking needs. gt “This is a major investment for us,” Richard says. “This is one of the most expensive ground-floor retail premises in Belfast, and we have devoted it to this hub. This is front and centre in the heart of Belfast.” The location of the new hub couldn’t be better – with the new Glider bus linking the hub to Catalyst Inc headquarters in Titanic Quarter. And, as modern tech businesses evolve and reach out to new markets and time zones across the globe, there is also  hour access to the Fintech Hub. The hub has a team of four, two from Danske Bank and two newly recruited by Catalyst Inc. Together Danske Bank and Catalyst Inc have also launched a new online  to help the wider growing number of start-up businesses across Northern Ireland to connect with investors, peers and potential new recruits across Europe - thehub.io helps connect start-ups to relevant resources, such as talent, networks, financing, tools and advice from experts which will help them overcome some of the challenges of scaling up. It is clear that strategically this is a big push by both organisations to play a key supporting role through the provision of both physical and online resources. Digitalisation Richard is keen to point out support for the hubs is just part of a bank-wide digital transformation agenda at Danske. “For example, we want to change the nature of traditional relationship management at the Bank. In addition to managing traditional banking needs as we have always done so well, we are now moving into the added value space. As well as the human touch, customers increasingly want top notch digital solutions to make their lives easier, to give them ease of access and quicker credit decisions.” The digitally-savvy way of thinking is giving Danske Bank competitive advantage, and that is from an already well-established position in the market. Last year they appointed a chief digital officer, who is a member of the Bank’s executive committee. “Our people are still our best asset and will remain so,” Richard said. “We have great people. And customers still highly value that human touch and expert advice. But what the journey looks like for transactions, well we have digital solutions for everything. For your payments, wages, drawing direct debits or paying suppliers. “Right now we are piloting and rolling out digital credit decisions for business customers. This is transforming the credit journey for both our customers and our business relationship managers. For example, one customer recently applied for an overdraft through the digital credit solution and got approval and the funds in their account in  minutes.” Danske Bank was the first of the local Northern Ireland banks to bring in app banking, and solutions such as Samsung Pay, Fitbit Pay and Garmin Pay. And this new Fintech Hub is very much another stride forward. The bank is also leading the pack when it comes to customer satisfaction, right across businesses of all shapes and sizes. “For some time now we have been the market leader in business banking. Research continues to show that our customer satisfaction scores are first for large business, and first for small business,” Richard said. Both Vicky and Richard are keen to see what they predict will be short and long-term benefits from the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub. There’s an organic osmosis, allowing ideas to flow freely between the Danske Bank people visiting from upstairs and those entrepreneurs which it hosts on the ground floor. “The entrepreneurs in the hub bring a fresh mindset, one we can learn from as we continue our own digital journey throughout the bank,” Vicky says. Richard added: “The fintech sector is seen in many quarters as a challenger to traditional banks, but we are embracing it and feel we can grow with it, to the benefit of our customers.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
