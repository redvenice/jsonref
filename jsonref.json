By the time Meghan had become a senior royal, the pair were still no closer than before the 2018. According to one source, Meghan was disappointed that they hadn\u0027t bonded, but was not losing sleep over it.    The book also details one awkward moment at Kensington Palace in 2017 when Kate went alone in her Range Rover while shopping - despite  the fact Meghan was also going to the same street. Though some aides claimed the sisters-in-law \u0027talked and texted regularly\u0027, they had barely spent any time together by the time of Meghan and Harry\u0027s wedding.  The book also reveals how Meghan regarded some commentary and tabloid stories as \u0027sexist\u0027 and \u0027prejudiced\u0027, with ambitious women of colour like her labelled \u0027demanding and aggressive\u0027.  A close friend of Meghan\u0027s told the authors: \u0027Duchess Different. That\u0027s what people have a problem with. She\u0027s the easiest person in the world to work with.

The restructuring firm FRP Advisory is working alongside its management under a “light touch” administration.This means directors are running the business rather than handing it over to the administrators. The chain has already shut 18 stores, with the loss of more than 1,000 jobs in shops and at the headquarters in London. After lease negotiations with landlords, 124 stores are still trading. They reopened on 15 June after the government allowed non-essential retailers to open again following the Covid-19 lockdown.“Now that Debenhams has 124 stores in the UK open and is trading ahead of expectations, the administrators of Debenhams Retail Ltd have initiated a process to assess ways for the business to exit its protective administration,” the company said on Sunday.“There are a range of possible outcomes which could include the current owners retaining the business, potential new joint venture arrangements (with existing and potential new investors) or a sale to a third party, and the administrators will be guided by what delivers the best outcome for creditors.”Like other retailers, Debenhams has been badly hit by the coronavirus lockdown, but was already struggling with a £600m debt pile. It previously went into administration in April 2019, which wiped out its shareholders and transferred ownership to a group of financial investors including US hedge funds managed by Silver Point Capital and GoldenTree Asset Management. Debenhams then underwent a company voluntary arrangement, an insolvency procedure that allowed it to close stores and renegotiate rents.Debenhams’ Irish chain has been placed into liquidation, but a liquidation of the main group is unlikely and would only happen once all other options have been exhausted. Debenhams also owns the Magasin du Nord chain in Denmark.Rival John Lewis plans to close eight of its 50 stores putting 1,300 jobs at risk, while Marks \u0026amp Spencer is cutting 950 jobs as part of a £500m cost-saving drive."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55e01bba63a25ba389e195cceb0306ea08876149/0_53_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8801375dcd6518b45f4c3d134c1728ae","title":"uks full economic recovery could take until 2024 says ey report","story":"The UK’s economic recovery from the Covid-19 crisis could take 18 months longer than expected with hopes of a V-shaped recovery fading fast, according to a leading economic forecaster.Britain’s economic output is not expected to return to its 2019 level until the end of 2024, the EY Item Club said on Monday in its latest projections on the health of the UK economy. It had previously expected GDP to match fourth-quarter 2019 size in early 2023.However, the UK is only slowly emerging from the Covid-19 lockdown, with gyms and swimming pools reopening at the weekend. Non-essential shops were allowed to re-open from 15 June and pubs, restaurants and hairdressers from 4 July.Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY Item Club, said: “Even though lockdown restrictions are easing, consumer caution has been much more pronounced than expected. We believe that consumer confidence is one of three key factors likely to weigh on the UK economy over the rest of the year, alongside the impact of rising unemployment and low levels of business investment.“The UK economy may be past its low point but it is looking increasingly likely that the climb back is going to be a lot longer than expected. May’s growth undershot even the lowest forecasts. By the middle of this year, the economy was a fifth smaller than it was at the start. Such a fall creates more room for rapid growth later, but it will be from a much lower base.”“The labour market’s performance is key to the economy’s prospects over both the short term and further out,” Archer said. “Job losses and poor real wage growth are expected to hold back consumer spending … It is possible that the chancellor will look to provide further help for the labour market in this autumn’s budget.”Mark Gregory, EY UK’s chief economist, said: “Government measures have provided significant short-term support, but many businesses are waiting for more certainty over the economic outlook before making longer term investment decisions.“Policies such as VAT cuts are welcome, but they aren’t a complete solution, as they don’t resolve the concerns consumers may have about going to restaurants and bars in the first place.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de4d80986c1eeee881a9b2a191cfac0c68ca49ee/0_179_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3413049dc4a9426e6a9654b284dfa9e6","title":"china truth coronavirus panorama xi jinping","story":"Our Panorama programme shows how Xi Jinping’s government has tried to hide the truth about the spread of coronavirusFast forward to 2020. The successor to Sars appeared, and has so far caused 600,000 deaths and more than 15 million infections worldwide. The Chinese government says it has been “open, transparent and responsible” throughout its critics say not open, transparent or responsible enough to avert disaster.After Sars, China built a nationwide disease surveillance network and formidable bioscience capacity. It invested in research on bat coronaviruses. Disease control chiefs said it could stop another outbreak. But in 2020 none of these preparations were enough to offset risks coming from other directions: ever more rigid top-down politics inside China and a globetrotting population with direct international flights from Wuhan.Last December patients started turning up in Wuhan’s hospitals with pneumonia symptoms that didn’t respond to treatment. Doctors were quick to send samples for genetic sequencing which soon revealed a coronavirus closely resembling Sars. Chinese scientists warned the new virus was also contagious, spread by respiratory droplets and on surfaces. But both in Wuhan and in Beijing, health authorities sought to minimise the story, first insisting there was no reason to suspect the virus was transmitted by humans and later that the risk was low.Frontline doctors didn’t agree. They tried to warn each other on social media, but were swiftly silenced, some forced to sign police confessions that they had spread misinformation.The Hong Kong microbiologist Prof Yuen Kwok-yung had helped to identify Sars back in 2003. As soon as he saw the social media posts from Wuhan, he urged the Hong Kong government to take public health precautions. He told Panorama: “If you don’t make use of every hour, you are in big, big trouble.”Instead, from 31 December to 20 January, China’s political leaders played down the risks of the virus, squandering the lead their doctors and scientists had given them.Beijing is naturally sensitive about its early handling of what has gone on to become a global catastrophe. At home its censorship is so overwhelming that it can control the timeline and edit the facts to suit its narrative. Since January, censors have assiduously deleted documentary evidence and added events and comments retrospectively to suggest leadership engagement. Seven months on, the silencing of doctors and scientists continues, while some Chinese citizens who have tried to preserve inconvenient facts or present a different version of the narrative have disappeared.As a result, there is no meaningful challenge inside China to the official version of events. According to this version, as soon as Beijing had clear evidence of human transmission of the virus it publicly announced it, and prepared tough control measures including the lockdown of Wuhan on 23 January.The truth is more complex. For example, Beijing certainly had a key part of its evidence on human transmission a week earlier than the official version admits. On 12 January, Yuen diagnosed a family with the novel coronavirus in Shenzhen, 700 miles from Wuhan. Only some members of the family had been to Wuhan. Yuen immediately alerted authorities in Beijing.The Chinese ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, told the BBC: “The Chinese health authorities notified WHO on 31 December in the shortest possible time.” In fact it was the WHO that had picked up reports of the outbreak on the internet – and on 1 January sought answers from the Chinese government. China responded two days later.China’s response time has been much faster than during the Sars outbreak 17 years ago, but most close observers of the Chinese Communist party say full transparency is never its first instinct and that under the leadership of Xi Jinping, information control has grown ever tighter. Challenged on the silencing of doctors and scientists in early January, a key government adviser, Prof Li Lanjuan, told us: “To announce its contagiousness, if it is not yet confirmed, would cause public panic. Therefore we must be responsible to the public, and ascertain the facts first.”Some governments have demanded an international investigation in China to determine the origins and early spread of the virus. The Chinese government says it will join a global inquiry into the pandemic but only when the crisis is over. It says it should not be blamed as it is a victim too, and that its tough measures to combat the Wuhan outbreak prevented hundreds of thousands of infections and bought the world time.But what consequences? The WHO’s regulations on protecting against the international spread of disease are legally binding, but there are no sanctions for countries that fail to adhere to them. In recent weeks, western governments have begun adopting a tougher tone towards Beijing on a range of issues, but there is little sign of a concerted international push for new WHO inspection powers to tackle future disease outbreaks. Indeed, the US has just withdrawn funding for the WHO, alleging that the global health body served as Beijing’s puppet during the early stages of coronavirus.For now, we are left hoping that China’s leadership has learned its own lessons about the need to act faster to protect its own public and the world.• Carrie Gracie is a BBC newsreader and presenter and former China editor for BBC NewsPanorama: China’s Coronavirus Cover-Up is on BBC One, Monday 27 July, 7.30pm"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f361e76a5d1fe02c1fdf3e1fa8607c8339ac85c2/0_70_3726_2235/master/3726.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06be0cc7749718242154a5f64ac35ae4","title":"schoolgirls in england have you been informally excluded","story":"We’d like to hear from girls – or their parents – who have been excluded from a school in England via informal methods Girls are being informally excluded at a higher rate than boys from some schools in England, according to a study by not-for-profit group Social Finance.While boys are much more likely to be formally excluded, research shows girls are being excluded through moves to other schools or by leaving one school before the end of year 11 and not finishing their studies elsewhere.

The centre is backed by government research grants and industry partners including Tesco, Sainsbury’s and John Lewis.The catenary cables, powered by the national electricity grid, would link to lorries driving in the inside lanes on 4,300 miles (7,000km) of UK roads through an extendable rig known as a pantograph – similar to those on the top of electric trains. The electricity would power the lorry’s electric motor, as well as recharging an onboard electric battery that would power them to their destinations beyond the electrified roads.The engineering company Siemens and the lorrymaker Scania have already carried out extensive tests of e-highway electric road systems in Germany, Sweden and the US.Officials from the UK’s Department for Transport were scheduled to visit the test sites in Germany in March, but the trip was postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic.Battery-powered electric lorries and vans are already viable options for the short-range deliveries in urban areas that make up about a third of road freight usage. However, the other two-thirds – long-haul deliveries by lorries – are difficult to decarbonise because of range and weight requirements. The lithium ion batteries used in electric cars do not currently have a high enough energy density to be viable for long-distance haulage, meaning trucks such as Tesla’s planned Semi could require tonnes of batteries, denting their efficiency and raising their cost.In contrast, a lorry fitted for electric roads would only require a battery of similar size to an existing Tesla car to be able to cover the vast majority of the UK, according to David Cebon, a professor of mechanical engineering at Cambridge University who co-authored the study.Multiple lorrymakers are developing lorries running on hydrogen fuel cells, but the authors of the study argue that “green” hydrogen trucks would use three times more energy than an electric road system. This is because energy is lost at every conversion: using solar energy to make hydrogen and then a fuel cell to generate electricity again.The electric road system would also have a major advantage over alternatives in that it would be possible to tax the electricity used by lorries, enabling the government to easily replace revenues lost from taxing diesel fuel, the report said.The report suggests that a first phase of building work on the busiest roads could take two years, costing £5.6bn. However, electrifying those most popular routes alone would cover almost a third of the miles travelled by heavy goods vehicles in the UK. Later stages would bring the total cost to £19.3bn.Lower energy costs are predicted to pay back vehicle operators for the investment in new vehicles within 18 months, while electrification infrastructure could pay back its investors – either government or private – within 15 years, the report said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47a83356eeeeea2d1bc752d6cb474a30d018f7df/40_194_4921_2952/master/4921.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4046e2b76ffad880ea267619f9d831ae","title":"uk electricity grids carbon emissions could turn negative by 2033 says national grid","story":"Operator says UK can tap carbon capture and renewables to help meet UK’s targetsCarbon emissions from Britain’s electricity system could turn negative by as early as 2033 if the UK uses carbon capture technology alongside more renewable energy to reach its climate targets, according to a report from National Grid.The electricity network operator on Monday set out its vision for an “emissions negative” grid that would include 30m electric vehicles on UK roads, and 8m heat pumps used to replace gas boilers in energy-efficient homes.In National Grid’s most progressive vision for Britain’s pathway towards its 2050 climate targets it claims that net carbon emissions from the electricity sector could turn negative within 13 years by using carbon capture technology alongside bioenergy sources.Mark Herring, the head of strategy at National Grid ESO, said three of the report’s four most-credible pathwaysto a net-zero economy by 2050 meant relying heavily on low-carbon electricity.National Grid expects a boom in renewable energy projects, including at least 3GW of new windpower capacity and 1.4GW of solar generation every year from now until 2050, alongside a widespread rollout of electric vehicles, which will effectively act as smart-charging “batteries” to help balance the electricity grid.It also expects a revolution in consumer energy use, including significantly better energy efficiency and the end of gas boilers. Instead, millions of homes will consume less than a third of the energy used today, and will rely on heat pumps fitted with thermal “heat batteries”.“Across all scenarios, we see growth in renewable energy generation, including significant expansion in installed offshore wind capacity. There is widespread uptake in domestic electric vehicles, and growth and investment in hydrogen and carbon capture technologies too,” Herring said.“Although these are not firm predictions, we’ve talked to over 600 industry experts to build this insight and it’s clear while net zero is achievable, there are significant changes ahead,” he added.The report warned that the UK will not meet its legally binding ambition to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2050 without “immediate action” from the government on key energy policies, and the negative emissions from bioenergy combined with carbon capture and storage.Bioenergy is considered by many to be carbon neutral because the emissions produced from burning wood pellets in a power plant is offset by the carbon dioxide absorbed by sustainably managed forests when the trees are growing.The “carbon accounting” is, however, disputed by some academics and environmentalists.Carbon capture is also expected to play a major role in removing the greenhouse gases from North Sea gas to produce clean-burning hydrogen for Britain’s factories, steel works and power plants. This could mean that by 2035 the amount of gas burned to produce electricity without carbon capture technology may halve, according to National Grid.Herring said that it was too soon to determine the impact of the coronavirus crisis on Britain’s energy future, but many are hopeful that the pandemic may hasten the UK’s climate ambitions by using government stimulus packages for clean energy and energy efficiency measures to spur a green economic recovery.“While Covid-19 came too late to be factored into this year’s analysis many of the areas highlighted will be crucial in a green recovery from the pandemic, particularly improving energy efficiency across all sectors and significant investment in low carbon electricity generation,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/595cc69dcd5ef6769823ca6588df43976cd4d3d0/5_107_3401_2041/master/3401.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=015a7ff5f71c8fbe701acc1fb98bd81a","title":"nightmare on elm streets john saxon a life in pictures","story":"From teen movies to westerns to horror, the American actor, who has died aged 83, appeared in almost 200 movies during a career that ned seven decades"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c93f11339d6a29da97d57843f9c4e723ab7d01d5/100_103_2948_1769/master/2948.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2fa272de5c657029902f60dc50e08fce","title":"solskjaer manchester united leicester champions league","story":"The win at Leicester offered few thrills but the no-frills way it clinched Champions League football will do United no harmThey’re back, baby, they’re back. Back with a whimper perhaps, at the end of an edgy, sluggish, winning performance at the King Power Stadium. But Manchester United are back in the Champions League all the same, a top-four place secured with a slow-burn 2-0 defeat of Leicester City.This being planet Earth in the year 2020, it came in the strangest of circumstances. Seven minutes into injury time on a muggy late-July day Jesse Lingard could be seen rolling the ball into an empty net in front of a row of inspirational tarpaulins.Moments later the final whistle euthanised this distended league season out of existence. It was greeted by shouts and shrieks from the scattered United staff, and by the sight of the accidental saviour Ole Gunnar Solskjær bowling out on to the pitch looking wide-eyed and very slightly overcome in his skinny black suit and white shirt.Eleven months, one global shutdown and an economic collapse in the making, the news is at least reassuringly samey from the Premier League. The four wealthiest clubs in England will now take up those four spots and compete in the world’s glitziest midweek league. The teams who are usually the teams are once again the teams. Dissent, unrest and social revolution may come and go, but the Premier League remains, for now, largely unmoved.There was still an element of genuine jeopardy here, not least for Solskjær himself. Rarely has the line between over-promoted company man and curator of the thrilling new red dawn seemed so fine. But such are the margins at times. Football may be theatre. But nobody ever said it was subtle theatre.To his credit Solskjær played all his strongest cards from the start. Rightly so, as there has been tangible progress on the pitch in the last few months. Pogba-Fernandes-Matic is the most engaging midfield United have had since the Ferguson endgame. Rashford-Martial has become a potent partnership. Mason Greenwood is that rare thing, a genuine, believe-the-hype prodigy of the kind that speaks in direct, seductive tones to United’s own self-mythologising.Still, there was an awkwardness to the occasion as Leicester sat deep in the opening moments and allowed United’s passing to stall in front of them. The gameplan seemed clear enough: wait for the mistake, counterattack at speed. Harry Maguire has many qualities as a defender but he also turns like a waterlogged fishing dinghy and runs toward his own goal with all the easy grace of a heavily laden suburban milk float.For a while the game was scrappy. Occasionally United’s bravura front three clicked into motion, then seemed to lose their timing, like men communicating via a low-bandwidth internet conference call. In the past three months Marcus Rashford has played 10 games and organised a policy-changing child welfare campaign. He is probably allowed to feel a little tired.Paul Pogba was prominent but never quite in the command seat. Bruno Fernandes was poor, as he has been occasionally a midfielder hoist as a panacea to successive seasons of incoherent squad-building, and now already facing a world record new-signing backlash. Football has always been a skittish, impatient business, but Fernandes has barely finished holding up the shirt and grinning beneath a scarf.By half-time there was still a sense of the day waiting to take shape. Finally, with 67 minutes gone, a kind of deliverance arrived. The impressive Hamza Choudhury gave the ball away. Greenwood played a cute, instant forward pass, a rare act of precision in a sea of vagueness. Anthony Martial was brought down by a double judo-trip move from Wes Morgan and Jonny Evans.Up stepped the leg-weary Fernandes. On the bench Solskjær looked like a man trying very hard not to vomit over the deck-rail. The kick was tucked gently into the corner. And that was pretty much that, as Leicester’s endless season, not to mention their six missing first-team players, finally caught up with them.What does it all mean? There is of course a degree of confected tension about all this. But even for a club of such enduring heft a return to the Champions League will affect every aspect of Manchester United.For Solskjær this is now a mini-era in its own right: if not a new dawn, then at least a first chink of light beneath the curtain. And it is worth being kind here. Despite the anxieties of the last three games there has been a genuine vim and snap about United’s attacking play of late.Not to mention a rare sense of clarity. If there is little remarkable in Solskjær’s management, this is a virtue in itself. United’s manager has one outstanding quality: his lack of any obvious outstanding qualities, a simplicity that is in itself a very useful asset.Let’s face it, this vast sporting machine doesn’t actually need any additional fuel, any complex characters or interfering egos. At times something this large and complex just needs to be steered in the right direction, to be demystified and untangled rather than overthought.Solskjær has imposed a simple system and made some demands about fitness. United’s zany playing squad has been clarified. The best players tend to end up on the pitch. Half of the outfield 10 were Solskjær players to some degree. Two thirds of a decent team is in place here. Better still, this feels like something else. For all the wariness of the King Power in late July, there is hope here – not to mention, for the first time in some time, a sense of lightness too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c79e7271739f81ac95dbceb4ce743de875febab2/0_0_2952_1772/master/2952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e066539534c562929b4a93722df26833","title":"happy to work from home for ever six ways to win over your boss","story":"We’re still delivering on the work front but without the pressures of the daily commute, little wonder so many of us want to hang on to our newly flexible livesBosses used to assume that flexible working meant their employees were watching daytime TV and sending the odd “reply all” email to look busy.

I think they’ll find employees have been doing their best in very challenging circumstances.”People are working smarterA huge amount of time during the office working day is wasted on interruptions and unnecessary meetings. “We all know the stress of presenteeism, of having to sit in a meeting room for an hour while someone drones on – it drains activity,” says Tracey Follows, founder of the strategy consultancy Futuremade. “Working from home allows you to take control of how and when you use your energy,” she says. This in turn can lead to increased efficiency.It makes employees happy You want to jump on a video call from the park? Download documents at the beach? Thanks to Vodafone’s unlimited data, you can. Helping employees to achieve a better work-life balance is an obvious way to support them and encourage their loyalty. “Flexible working means the employer gets an engaged, happy employee who is able to concentrate on their job while they’re working because they can also plan for the school pick-up or to visit elderly relatives,” says Bhutta. “When people have autonomy they are loyal and committed, which leads to benefits in terms of productivity.”The traditional office is outdatedOne look at the deserted skyscrapers in our cities shows that it’s time to retire any romantic attachment to Mad Men-style central offices. Especially now that screen partitions between desks, regular deep cleaning and one-way traffic systems will need to be implemented to help prevent future waves of coronavirus. Offices could well transform into occasional spaces where people meet for training days or to collaborate on projects. Even the CEO of Barclays Bank, Jes Staley, has acknowledged that “the notion of putting 7,000 people in a building may be a thing of the past”. While, sadly, this might signal the end of the office biscuit tin, it could save employers hundreds of millions pounds in annual office costs.Businesses can access more talentSaying goodbye to the traditional office means an opportunity to welcome in new staff, talent and ideas from all over the world. “Flexibility opens up the workforce to many more people,” says Follows. “It gives opportunities for talented people who live far from big cities, who are from different socioeconomic backgrounds or have disabilities. It’s an opportunity to be grasped.”Employers get to be human tooDuring this crisis, thanks to all the video meetings, we’ve got to know our colleagues and bosses as actual people who have overloaded bookshelves, home schooled kids and cute puppies in their lives. Employers have become relatable, not just an intimidating presence at board meetings. “Seeing people’s kids and dogs popping up on video calls has meant that people’s responsibilities have become visible in the world of work, in a way that they weren’t before,” says Bhutta. “It’s been a real opportunity to see people beyond their role at work. And that’s something we don’t want to turn the clock back on.”From uninterrupted video meetings to deciding when and where you work best, getting the most from your mobile data has never been more important.Keep connecting with our unlimited data plans.

And it’s a trend that’s set to continueIt doesn’t take a statistician to work out that we’ve all been online a lot in the last few months. From home schooling and streaming to ensuring your household has all the essentials (which may or may not have been purchased from Deliveroo), the number of gigabytes we’ve used and the time we’ve spent online has ticked ever upwards.But exactly how much more are we online now? What’s using up most of our data? And what will happen as lockdown ends? Turns out it does take statisticians to work all that out – which is why we’ve looked at their reports to compile this list of five facts about you, the internet and your data usage. You’re welcome.1. In lockdown, we’ve each been online for four hours and two minutes a dayYou always knew you had it in you to be a record breaker, didn’t you? You were right. According to Ofcom’s new Online Nation 2020 report, an annual survey looking at how the UK’s internet usage is changing, the four hours and two minutes we’ve averaged online during lockdown is a new high. And it’s an increase of 37 minutes a day per online adult compared with January 2020.Even without lockdown, we’ve been using the internet more than ever before. In the past year before we were locked down, we were online for 17 minutes a day more than the previous year. The biggest users? 18 to 24 year olds, who logged on for an hour more each day than adults overall.“That’s one of the more interesting stats that we found,” says Jory MacKay, RescueTime’s marketing manager. “This means that essentially each time you look at your phone you’ve got a 5050 chance of setting off a chain reaction of phone check ins.”5. Why unlimited data deals are great for familiesYou know that feeling when your work Zoom call’s audio goes so robotic and stuttery it’s like a Daft Punk remix? And on investigation, it turns out that the rest of your household is variously streaming video, online gaming and generally draining so much of your bandwidth that they might as well have attached a tap and be dispensing pints of it in the street?“As households are doing their learning, communicating, streaming – everything – online, that puts more pressure on the home internet,” says Gilani. “One answer is to have your own separate connection – whether through your phone or a dedicated mobile broadband connection – which means you can do what you need to do without interrupting what the rest of the family does. You can then get on with client calls while another family member is playing Fortnite.” In a pandemic, these are good problems to have.Staying connected has never been more vital – and it often seems that everyone in the family wants to be online at the same time.

Thousands of university students have been forced to return to their childhood bedrooms after their first taste of freedom was well and truly curtailed. Younger teens have had school unceremoniously cancelled, and others have not been able to leave the house at all due to health concerns. But the good news is, with lockdown easing, things are finally changing.Here three young people, with very different experiences of lockdown, describe what life feels like now they are recovering some of their much-yearned-for freedom …‘Our phones are what connect us’Anya, 19, BristolI always thought the phrase ‘absence makes the heart grow fonder’ was a bit of a cliche but my boyfriend and I are absolute proof that it’s true. Luke and I have been a couple longer in lockdown than out of it. We met in January and went from sleeping at each other’s houses five nights a week to not physically touching each other since 16 March.I have cystic fibrosis so I have had to shield at home with my mum we even disinfect food packets when they come into the house. But despite our physical distance, Luke, who’s 23, and I are closer than ever. These extraordinary times have meant we can really focus on getting to know each other at a deeper level. He makes me feel good and takes me away from the mundanity of every day. We’ve had the time and space to really talk about what’s important to us and best of all we make each other laugh.In early lockdown we’d FaceTime from the moment we woke up to when we went to sleep. I’d walk around the house with him in my hand Mum got totally used to him being here with us and has got to know him too. We’d even have date nights watching the same film on Netflix from our bedrooms.More recently we’ve made our first tentative steps into the outside world together, albeit still being physically apart. We have to take things slowly as I’m still shielding but I have driven over and had a barbecue with his family in his garden, even if I do take my own chair and plate and cutlery to be safe.We are taking it a day at a time but for now, I’m so relieved he is always by my side thanks to our phones.‘My friendships mean more to me than ever’ Carrie, 14, MacclesfieldFriendship has become even more important since March. I speak to my best friend Yaz most days and if I didn’t have her I don’t know what I’d do. We just get each other.I get on really well with my family but you talk to friends in a different way. I’ve used my phone more since lockdown than ever before. But when you’ve suddenly had all your freedom taken away it’s hardly surprising. I spend hours chatting on social media or FaceTime. Some days I look back and see I’ve been on my phone for eight hours.Before lockdown hit I loved my own space. I’m a keen mountain biker so I’d be out in the woods with friends or hanging out at mates’ houses, or a coffee shop.Now lockdown has eased, I’m out and about more so I use a lot of data. I go mountain biking and while there are more people on the trails we always do our best to socially distance. I like to meet friends in the park or go to a place nearby to wild swim. I always have my phone to reassure my mum I’m safe.But I miss socialising without having to think so carefully about it. I never thought I’d say it, but I can’t wait to go back to school.An unexpected bonus of this year is I’m getting on really well with my brother Dan, who’s 18. We used to bicker but now we really talk to each other. The other day he even invited me to join his friends around the firepit in the garden.‘I’m finally getting some freedom back’George, 21, Bishop SuttonThe second year of university is known as the party year, you’re in the swing of student life, there are no exams and just plenty of socialising and nights out. So I never imagined I’d be driving back to my family home at 1am on a March morning, as lockdown hit, and then spending the majority of the year back in my childhood bedroom. It has been hard to take, as up until March, I hadn’t spent more than three weeks consecutively at home since finishing my A-levels. On the plus side, I have enjoyed being close with my family again.I’m studying modern languages at the University of Oxford and suddenly my academic world has been taken completely online with seminars and tutorials. It has definitely been a challenge getting used to a new normal but I’m trying to remain positive.One benefit has been changing the way I work. When I was at uni it was like we were always working, doing snippets here and there. But now I’ve learned to work more intensely and so I get the work done faster. It means I have more free time.While I’m not seeing much of my uni friends I’m finally able to get out and catch up with local friends. We’ve met up for fish and chips near a local lake and have enjoyed river swims and socially distanced drinks at the harbourside. When the weather is good, life almost feels normal again as we sit in parks and chill together.But we can’t be spontaneous any more, we actually have to plan to meet up. In the old days we would just float around town and see who was around. I’m certainly more reliant on my phone and it’s useful having unlimited data. I’m used to crashing at a friend’s house if I’m visiting but now I have to think about getting home instead.It’s my year abroad next year and I’m lucky as I have got a job and am heading to Berlin. For those who are staying here, university is going to feel very different.When you can’t see the people you care about as much as you’d like, staying connected is more important than ever.

This week: a pink flowering dogwood tree in Nevada City, CaliforniaEllen Reynard moved to Nevada City, California, from San Francisco seven years ago. One of her favourite things about her new home was the tree in the corner of her front garden. “This pink dogwood bloomed so beautifully that it took my breath away,” she says. “It has done so every spring since then.”The retired magazine editor was devastated when the local power company told her this year that she would have to chop down the tree so that it could move the overhead power line to her house. “The thought of cutting down that beautiful tree made me very sad. It had been there for many years.”Reynard, 72, asked her landscape gardener, Carlos, if they could save the tree. They decided to transplant it in April, a process that involved “a lot of digging through hard clay soil to disengage the roots”. The roots were then wrapped up in tough plastic sheeting.The tree was lifted and carried to the middle of the garden. It was then carefully lowered into a specially prepared new hole, which was filled with nutritious planting soil. “I was transfixed by the whole process,” says Reynard. “It was very impressive.”Once the tree was in its new location, it was watered and fed with vitamin B. During the transplant, it did not lose a single leaf, but it has had a few cosmetic changes since its big move. “The trunk was heavily blanketed in moss before I moved the tree, but now it is mostly clean except for a small coating of moss on an upper branch.” The trunk remains one of the features of the dogwood that Reynard most loves. “The bark is cracked and wrinkled, like an old face that has been weathered by many years of hardship.”Carlos and his team have since landscaped the front garden with the dogwood tree as the centrepiece. “When I first stood next to it after it was transplanted, I could feel its life like a hum. I touched the leaves to feel if they had suffered from the move, and they were supple and shimmery in the breeze.” Reynard’s neighbours like to drop by to admire the revamped garden. “Some have asked where the beautiful tree came from.”Reynard spends her days writing poetry and fiction. She likes to sit in the cooling shade under the dogwood in the late mornings waiting for inspiration to strike. “Each time I look at the tree, it is with joy and appreciation.”• Tell us about your favourite tree by filling in this form."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7d2b03eaadd3e807c3cd043a428f341c9f55b02/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9a815232d726aeb305ece131b165af8","title":"why did the dvla go into communication lockdown","story":"I have tried to get my car logbook sorted with the driving agency but there’s no way to get throughI am puzzled and frustrated by the DVLA failing to respond to any communication.

Safety does come first – it’s about protecting people.“There is no greater day than seeing a packed chamber with everybody jostling to be in there. That’s what brings this House alive, that’s what makes this House. But that won’t happen until we know it’s safe.”Hoyle said he was keen to return to a system where MPs must make all contributions in person, rather than virtually, but said he “can’t see that happening tomorrow … I think we’re a little bit further away from normality as we knew it.”Hoyle, the MP for Chorley, said as a Lancastrian it would be “hard to stomach being the Speaker in York” but said he was also serious in his concern about moving parliament out of London – something which has been proposed by Boris Johnson.MPs are set to decant from Westminster for lengthy restoration works on the crumbling palace. “Joking apart, I think it is important that you’re in the capital city. I think this is the home of parliament,” he said, adding that MPs and peers would ultimately decide the location.“The one thing all of us can agree on is that we need to get on with doing some repairs. We need to make this place safe, we’ve got to make it fit for purpose. So something will have to happen. But it’s not for me to decide – it’s for the House to decide.”Hoyle said he was not prepared to relax the 2-metre distancing in parliament for the time being. “I have a duty of care to staff of this House, staff of MPs and MPs themselves … I wanted to hold the rules – people wanted to take the 2-metre rule down – I think it’s been the right thing to do.”Hoyle said he had been disturbed over recent months about decisions by Downing Street to announce major new policies at press briefings rather than in the Commons.“If there’s something new to come out and you want to tell the world, tell parliament and let the world watch it from parliament’s eyes,” he said.“We’re elected to scrutinise. Members are elected to hold the government to account and we’ve got to allow them to do so. And if you’re briefing the press first, that’s not the way forward. It’s not good for Downing Street, it’s not good for relations and it doesn’t endear your own backbenchers. They want to know that they count and that they matter. And I think that’s the way forward for all of us.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f914f5d227664ff672e5cfd5f3035f752445bc5d/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0964dc7e9a0f86fd982056b4ade7ccb9","title":"can you solve it the pyramid puzzle","story":"It is a truism to say that once you know the answer to a puzzle it becomes trivially easy. Yet this statement is especially true when it comes to geometrical problems, which are often solved with a single insight that, once you know it, seems so forehead-slappingly obvious.Both of today’s two puzzles are unravelled with a joyous ‘aha’. I hope you find them for yourselves.1. A 12cm x 12cm square piece of paper is marked as below.If you fold along the dotted lines and position the white triangles upwards so they touch, you get a pyramid with height h.2. The second problem involves the equilateral triangle below. It has side length 6cm, and is cut by two straight lines through the triangle’s centre. One of them cuts the bottom edge 1cm along, and they intersect at a 60 degree angle.What is the ratio of the total area of the two red regions to the total area of the two blue regions?Both of today’s puzzles were written by Manfred Pietch, a retired maths teacher from Düren in Germany. Danke!NO SPOILERS. I’ll be back at 5pm UK with the solutions.Before I go, two updates on the locks problem from two columns ago.Here’s the original problem:The three directors of a bank are deeply suspicious of one another, and agree a system of locks and keys for the bank’s safe, such that:What is the smallest number of locks and keys they need to open the safe, and how do they distribute them?My answer was three locks and six keys (two per lock). If the locks are A, B and C, then the keys need to be distributed as follows: A and B to one director, B and C to another, and A and C to the third. In this way, no single director can open the safe, but any combination of two directors can.Last column I featured a better solution using three locks and three keys, which was based on the Borromean rings. Today, two more ingenious solutions sent in by readers: another one with three locks and three keys, and one with two locks and three keys.Richard Seaby proposes a system in which a bar runs though two sets of hoops, with three padlocks: at either end and in the middle, as shown below. (The locks are the red cable ties.) If only one padlock is removed, the bar cannot be taken out. But if any two padlocks are, the bar can be taken out. (The bar would have to be short enough that it can be taken out when both side locks are removed.) Nice!Even simpler is the following solution from Joffrey Joly, who pointed out that the puzzle does not specify that the keys or locks needed to be different. If they can be identical, then all you need is two identical locks, and three identical keys, such that when a key is in a lock it cannot be removed without relocking the safe. In this case, a director on their own cannot open the safe, but two together can.This ruse, however, only works if the directors are not able to duplicate the keys. The set-up made no mention of key duplication, so I am happy to accept Joffrey’s solution.More lock puzzle news as it breaks…I set a puzzle here every two weeks on a Monday.

The agreement, which came together after years of diplomacy by the Obama administration and other global leaders, commits 200 countries to chart a new course in efforts to combat climate change.But very soon the United States may not be one of them.The Paris climate agreement sets out a global framework to try to avoid dangerous climate change and, for the first time, all the major carbon emitters stood side by side and committed to do better. But just months after he took office Donald Trump announced that the US would withdraw from the agreement and would no longer take collective responsibility for the future of the planet.Since then he has continued to actively work against measures that could tackle the climate crisis. His administration has removed countless environmental protections, boosted the fossil fuel industry, buried the federally mandated National Climate Assessment report, disappeared climate change science from US government websites and helped foster an anti-science atmosphere throughout his administration.America’s modern commitment to environmentalism took root exactly 50 years ago when Earth Day protests led to the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Clean Air and Water Act. In just four years the Trump administration has set about dismantling much of the progress that has been made. By withdrawing from the Paris agreement it will now weaken the global resolve to tackle the climate crisis.The stakes could scarcely be higher and with your help we can put this issue at the center of our 2020 election coverage. The election will be a referendum on the future of democracy, racial justice, the supreme court and so much more. But hovering over all of these is whether the US will play its role in helping take collective responsibility for the future of the planet.The period since the Paris agreement was signed has seen the five hottest years on record. If carbon emissions continue substantial climate change is unavoidable. The most impacted communities will also be the most vulnerable.Over the next 100 days, the  US will publish a series of stories about the many impacts of the climate crisis. The series will focus on people of color and vulnerable communities across the globe, who are uniquely vulnerable to the dangers of a heating planet. We will examine Joe Biden’s proposals to tackle climate change and whether they are up to the task. And we will elevate the young people whose entire futures will be shaped by the crisis and the world’s response to it. The series is sponsored by We Are Still In and We Mean Business, but the content is editorially independent from the sponsors.On 21 September, during Climate Week, we will join with Covering Climate Now and some of the world’s leading media organizations to spotlight first-time voters facing a future of environmental peril.

The AI model was developed to recognise iniduals simply from a photograph of their backs while they were busy nest-building.Together with researchers at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behaviour, in Germany, Ferreira then demonstrated that the technology can be applied to two of the most commonly-studied species in Europe: wild great tits and captive zebra finches.For AI models to accurately identify iniduals they must be trained with thousands of labelled images. This is easy for companies such as Facebook with access to millions of pictures of people voluntarily tagged by users, but acquiring labelled photographs of birds or animals is more difficult.The researchers, also from institutes in Portugal and South Africa, overcame this challenge by building feeders with camera traps and sensors. Most birds in the study populations already carried a tag similar to microchips which are implanted in cats and dogs. Antennae on the bird feeders read the identity of the bird from these tags and triggered the cameras.While some larger inidual animals can be recognised by the human eye because of distinctive patterns – a leopard’s spots, or a pine marten’s chest markings, for example – AI models have previously been used to identify inidual primates, pigs and elephants. But the potential of the models had not been explored in smaller creatures outside the laboratory, such as birds.According to Ferreira, the lead author of the study, the use of cameras and AI computer models could save on expensive fieldwork, spare animals from procedures such as catching and marking them, and enable much longer-term studies.“It is not very expensive to put a remote camera on a study population for eight years but for somebody to stay there and do the fieldwork for that long is not always possible,” he said. “It removes the need for the human to be a data collector so researchers can spend more time thinking about the questions instead of collecting the data.”The AI model is currently only able to re-identify iniduals it has been shown before. But the researchers are now trying to build more powerful AI models that can identify larger study groups of birds, and distinguish iniduals even if they have never seen them before. This would enable new iniduals without tags to be recorded by the cameras and recognised by the computers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e69b1aad89c3924c29cd95b7b4f0ec200c720bb8/744_958_4804_2882/master/4804.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=e50d5b557513ef1697a6e297e3cd103e","title":"face mask wearers do not stop washing hands study suggests","story":"Scientists say people unlikely to reduce one Covid-19 measure when adopting anotherWearing face coverings does not appear to lead people to abandon hand hygiene, researchers say, suggesting people may not trade off the benefits of one public health measure against another.Face coverings are now mandatory in many parts of the world, and in England must be worn not only on public transport but also in many shops.While there is little evidence that cloth face coverings protect the wearer from Covid-19, experts say a growing body of research suggests they help to reduce transmission, limiting its spread from wearers to others.Some scientists have raised concerns that the use of face coverings could give wearers a false sense of security and make them less likely to engage in other behaviours that could reduce the spread of coronavirus, such as handwashing and social distancing – a phenomenon known as “risk compensation”.However, researchers say they have looked at existing studies and found little sign that wearing masks reduces adherence to hand hygiene.Some countries and states have been recommending that everybody wears face masks in indoor settings where social distancing is difficult or impossible. They have been made mandatory on public transport or in shops in many countries.According to guidance from the World Health Organization, people over 60 or with health issues should wear a medical-grade mask when they are out and cannot socially distance, while all others should wear a three-layer fabric mask.The WHO guidance, announced on 5 June, is a result of research commissioned by the organisation. It is still unknown whether the wearers of masks are protected, say its experts, but the new design it advocates does give protection to other people if properly used.The WHO says masks should be made of three layers – with cotton closest to the face, followed by a polypropylene layer and then a synthetic layer that is fluid-resistant. These are no substitute for physical distancing and hand hygiene, it says, but should be worn in situations where distancing is difficult, such as on public transport and at mass demonstrations.The WHO has been reluctant to commit to recommending face coverings, firstly because the evidence on whether they offer any protection to the public is limited and – more importantly – because it was afraid it would lead to shortages of medical-grade masks for health workers.Writing in the journal BMJ Analysis, the team report how they looked at 22 systematic reviews exploring the impact of mask wearing on the rate of respiratory viruses other than Covid-19, including flu, finding within them six randomised controlled trials that also looked at hand hygiene.“We don’t have any direct evidence from the current pandemic, so all we have done is look at ‘well what existing evidence is there?’” said Prof Dame Theresa Marteau, a co-author of the research from the University of Cambridge.While the six studies were not specifically designed to look at whether wearing masks influenced handwashing, the team say none showed evidence that mask-wearing was linked to a reduction in hand hygiene – as measured by self report and also, in four of the studies, by the volume of soap or sanitiser used. Indeed two of the studies suggested mask-wearing may even increase hand hygiene.Marteau said while the research only covered six studies, the results chimed with other research, also highlighted by the team, that found no clear evidence that interventions such as the use of helmets when skiing or cycling increased risky behaviours.“That’s not to say risk compensation doesn’t exist – it certainly exists at an inidual level … But we can’t find any good evidence for risk compensation happening at a population level,” she said. She said there was no sign that wearing face coverings increased transmission of Covid-19, as may be expected if risk compensation was rife.“The concept of risk compensation, rather than risk compensation itself, seems the greater threat to public health through delaying potentially effective interventions,” the team wrote.Trish Greenhalgh, a professor of primary care health sciences at the University of Oxford, welcomed the study.Dr Julian Tang, an honorary associate professor in respiratory sciences at the University of Leicester, said the research was important in raising awareness of the “myth” of risk compensation for mask-wearing.“Whilst the authors accept that inidual variation is possible, the overall impact of mask-wearing to the population is more likely to be more beneficial than not,” he said.However, some warn there has been little research into people’s behaviour regarding actions such as mask-wearing and social distancing – or how different behaviours influence each other – and it is not clear how the team picked the studies.Robert Dingwall, a professor of sociology at Nottingham Trent University, was among those sounding a note of caution: “It certainly seems premature to claim that risk compensation theory has been ‘laid to rest’ or that the concern should not be taken seriously in better-designed and more balanced studies of this intervention.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74466f3282dde87338d01aeeaf1803ab8e11784f/0_0_2939_1764/master/2939.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e29e937f19122ac33637961d53fc87d0","title":"germany most admired country in the world as us china and russia vie for second place gallup poll","story":"Annual Gallup survey casts doubt on Mike Pompeo’s claim that the US is ‘perfectly positioned’ to lead the free world in rivalry with China Germany is the most admired country in the world for the third year running, leaving the US in a tight battle for distant second place with China and Russia, according to a new global leadership poll.The annual poll, conducted by Gallup, casts more doubt on US secretary of state Mike Pompeo’s claim on Friday that the US was “perfectly positioned” to lead the free world in a new ideological rivalry with the Chinese Communist Party.The survey of a thousand adults in each of 135 countries was carried out around the world in 2019, before coronavirus struck.

I’m equally sceptical about the (polls) that are high as the ones that are low,” she said.“We have seen high support for the government ... but these are pretty extraordinary times.

The youngest was just 12.The Crown argued there was a pattern to Matamata’s offending, with him bringing small groups of people to New Zealand over the 25-year period for his “own financial benefit”.He promised paid horticultural work or schooling in New Zealand and paid for their flights, visas and passports. But upon arrival they worked long hours, often seven days a week, for no pay while “bags of cash” were handed over to Matamata, Crown prosecutor Clayton Walker said.Matamata’s lawyer argued his chiefly status meant he had a responsibility to look after the whole family and it was typical in Samoan culture for all members of a household to pool their wages to help everyone.All 13 victims, who gave evidence through translators in court, said they worked without pay and had to do chores around Matamata’s house where they lived behind a tall perimeter fence and a locked gate. They were not allowed to leave, or speak to anyone at work or church, or even their families in Samoa, without his permission.They were also subjected to regular verbal and physical abuse if they worked too slowly or did not perform their chores to his standards, claims which Matamata denied.He said the men and women came to New Zealand on holiday and he had no control over those who ran away and became overstayers.All Matamata’s victims said they were too scared to complain about their treatment, given Matamata’s matai or chiefly status, which commanded absolute obedience.In New Zealand, slavery carries a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison. The human trafficking charges carried a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison or a NZ$500,000 fine."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4cd820650cdb7793756bf1dfae9de6eb4c16c03/0_192_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=243583fd12619b4a35eb20b0c1688340","title":"south korea says defector who fled to north did not have covid 19","story":"The case has triggered an emergency lockdown in the North, but officials in Seoul say the man had no record of infection or contact South Korea has said that a defector who recently fled to the North does not appear to have contracted Covid-19, a day after Pyongyang imposed a lockdown near the border, claiming the man was its first recorded case of the illness.North Korean state media reported on Sunday that the 24-year-old man, who was reportedly in quarantine, was displaying symptoms of coronavirus after returning to his homeland across the border separating the two Koreas last week.The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, declared a state of “maximum emergency” and ordered the border town of Kaesong, where the defector was discovered, to go into lockdown, the state-run KCNA news agency said.KCNA did not say if the man had been tested for Covid-19, but said an “uncertain result was made from several medical check-ups of the secretion of that person’s upper respiratory organ and blood”, prompting officials to quarantine the person and investigate anyone he may have been in contact with.But on Monday, health authorities in the South said there was no evidence that the defector had contracted the illness.“The person is neither registered as a Covid-19 patient nor classified as a person who came in contact with virus patients,” Yoon Tae-ho, a senior health official, said in a press briefing, according to the Yonhap news agency.The Korean Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said two people who had been in close contact with the defector both tested negative, Yoon said, according to Yonhap.South Korea’s military said the defector was believed to have swum to North Korea from the western border island of Ganghwa – the same route he took when he defected three years ago – after passing beneath barbed wire via a drain to evade South Korean security guards.Only a small number of the estimated 33,000 North Koreans to have defected to the South since the end of the 1950-53 Korean war return to the North. Some wished to see their families before they die, while other have grown disillusioned with life in the South, where they face discrimination in education and employment.North Korea has not responded to South Korean claims that the defector, whom media reports have referred to only as “Kim”, does not have Covid-19.Yonhap reported that the man had been under investigation for the alleged rape of a female defector last month.South Korea managed to contain the virus in April through a combination of mass testing, tracing and isolation, but has struggled to suppress smaller outbreaks in the Seoul metropolitan area since late May.On Monday, the KCDC reported 25 new infections, bringing the country’s total to 14,175, with 299 deaths. The new cases included 16 among people who had recently arrived from overseas.Until the weekend, North Korea insisted that it had not discovered a single case of Covid-19 – a claim disputed by South Korean officials and some health experts.According to KCNA, Kim Jong-un told an emergency meeting of the ruling party’s politburo on Sunday that “a critical situation” had developed “in which the vicious virus could be said to have entered the country”.Some analysts believed the North’s “admission” that the virus had finally arrived in the country could indicate that it needed help tackling the virus.“It’s an ice-breaking moment for North Korea to admit a case,” Choo Jae-woo, a professor at Kyung Hee University, told Reuters. “It could be reaching out to the world for help. Perhaps for humanitarian assistance.”North Korea closed its borders, cancelled international flights and quarantined thousands of people soon after the outbreak was first reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan early this year.Experts have warned that the North’s creaking health infrastructure is ill-equipped to respond to a major outbreak.There is speculation that Kim Jong-un, whose long absence from public life earlier this year sparked rumours that he was suffering from a serious heart condition, was in fact self-isolating."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/377fa2a2e2be59c8c20fd3a67de3acd31335287b/0_0_3133_1880/master/3133.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=9ba0b30179dce5961d68a1cda55b31b3","title":"europe coronavirus planet climate","story":"European countries are spending big to revive their economies, but they will have no legitimacy with young people if they ignore the climateThe future of Europe depends on climate action. This is the resounding message that young Europeans have delivered to their leaders over the past two years. To be sure, the wave of young climate activists across the continent, from Fridays for Future to Extinction Rebellion, is part of a global response to the climate crisis. But for the EU in particular, it is also a warning from a new generation of Europeans to their leaders: our European identity hinges on your climate policies.For our parents’ generation, the European Union defined itself as a protector of peace, a fortress against fascism and a society of (relative) social security. For our generation – we are in our mid-20s – this narrative does not resonate. We came of age in a Europe of crises: a financial collapse, a panic over migration, a surge of populism. These formative moments gave the lie to the notion of a united European identity. To many of us, the EU appeared less a project of democracy, ersity or solidarity than one of bureaucracy, xenophobia and fracture. What is more, Europe’s responses to these crises were hardly material for a new common narrative. Just the opposite: the responses were the crises.Hollow narratives cannot endure they undermine themselves. If EU leaders and national governments continue to soft-pedal and greenwash, they will forfeit the already fragile faith of our generation. This loss of faith has already begun: our generation has not failed to notice the discrepancy between EU leaders’ exemplary commitment to climate action on paper and their delays and obfuscations in practice. Our polling for Europe’s Stories suggests that just over half of young Europeans think authoritarian states are better equipped to tackle the climate crisis than democracies – a worrisome but perhaps unsurprising trend that speaks to how urgently young Europeans want climate action, and to the failure of European democracies to meet the moment.These measures would set Europe on a path to a just transition: from the third-largest polluter in the world to a genuine climate leader.

Photograph: Orla Murray If there is any silver lining for Dublin to the health and economic disaster of the coronavirus pandemic, it has to be the emergence of measures to improve life for pedestrians and cyclists.Dublin City Council was first out of the traps in the repurposing of road space, annexing on-street parking spaces to widen footpaths and installing segregated cycle paths throughout the city, most notably on the Liffey quays, a scheme it had failed to get going for the previous eight years. The Office of Public Works (OPW) closed all but two of the Phoenix Park gates and banned all parking in the park at the end of March. Initially this was not a cycling or walking-driven measure, but to deter people from breaking the 2km travel restriction. However, as Covid-19 restrictions eased it became more about creating a better atmosphere for people to enjoy the park’s amenities. This was made most explicit when it decided not to reopen the peripheral gates as planned on June 29th to “curb traffic volumes” and maintain “safe, quiet, open spaces for pedestrians and cyclists to enjoy”.However, less than two weeks later, on a Thursday evening, the OPW announced the peripheral gates would reopen the following morning. This decision, made by the newly-appointed Minister of State for the OPW Patrick O’Donovan, was never about facilitating access to the park.What the closure of the gates did make less attractive was the use of the park as a rat run or a commuter route. That this was the real focus of the reversal was made clear when O’Donovan said the park was a thoroughfare in to the city for motorists from as far away as Longford and Westmeath. As the city and country reopens, perhaps it is understandable car users would rail against the very considerable changes to their pre-pandemic routine. Anne Crawford owns one of the few businesses operating in the Phoenix Park, an afterschool childcare service located in the special school on the north side of the park, close to the Hole in the Wall pub. She agrees the gate closures had limited impact on those coming to the park for leisure trips, but says they represented a serious inconvenience for working people.Many of these parents would come from the Navan Road direction, so would have no reason to venture into the centre of the park when they can use the Cabra and Ashtown gates, she said.“All the parents were going ballistic. These people sitting in traffic jams are the people going to work and paying taxes for the upkeep of the park, not the people sitting in the park on the €350 pandemic payment saying it’s all so lovely without the cars.”Crawford also runs afterschool facilities in nearby Castleknock and Ashtown and said traffic on the roads around both areas improved when the gates reopened. It would be “fair enough” to close the gates if there were adequate public transport options, she said. “The 37 bus only comes every 20 minutes and even before Covid the trains were packed and now the capacity is reduced. Working people need to be able to drive from one side of the park to the other, not just from Castleknock to Parkgate Street.”While the reopening of the gates has come as a great relief, she is concerned there may be attempts to reverse the decision. “I know the Green Party wants to close them again, but there will be uproar if they do, particularly when the schools – Mount Sackville and Castleknock College – reopen.”Crawford says she doesn’t really understand the argument for banning cars from peripheral roads and gates. “There are 1,700 acres here and only very few roads. You don’t have to be anywhere near the cars if you don’t want to be.” Fine Gael Senator Emer Currie said the singular focus on the gates as a solution to traffic management in the park has been misguided.“The conversation has become quite polarised, you’re either for or against the gates being open, when it should be a conversation about how to retain the best of the park while making sure it is accessible.”Sudden changes to park access without consultation and the continuing use of what had been billed as an emergency measure at the start of the pandemic travel restrictions, was what had annoyed residents, she said.“The OPW can’t just close the gates and hope for the best. They must develop a transport strategy for the park that includes public transport options to minimise people’s need to drive in the park. Last year they said they would conduct a mobility strategy for the park, they need to do that and start the public consultation on that as soon as possible.”Currie said she did not directly advise O’Donovan of her concerns regarding the gates but did speak in the Seanad on the matter.In Chapelizod, another community on the periphery of the park, some residents started an online petition, a week or so before the Minister made his decision, calling for the gates to be reopened. They cited traffic congestion outside and inside the park, as well as suggesting the lack of cars in the park would mean parts of the park would become “no-go areas due to their isolation”.The petition attracted more than 1,600 signatures, with more added since the gates reopened. Green Party Councillor Michael Pidgeon had earlier in the pandemic used the same online platform to seek support to end through traffic in the park. His petition secured more than 7,500 signatures and also continues to attract more. He was disappointed by O’Donovan’s decision. “The OPW had been extolling the benefits of keeping the gates closed, so it’s clear that the Minister ordered the change personally.”He agrees with Currie that an “onoff approach to the park isn’t in anyone’s interest” and says a short consultation process based on an options paper should be pursued. Pidgeon remains of the view that most people, on all sides of the debate, want to see less traffic in the park, insisting that the Phoenix Park is “not just some roads with trees on the side”.Not all local residents’ groups wanted the gates reopened. Pat Allison of the Navan Road Community Council, which has represented residents living to the north of the park for more than 50 years, said local traffic build-up appeared to be more a result of shops reopening than the gates being closed. Some of those arguing for the reopening may have simply wanted to avoid the M50 toll, she said. “The park is not a thoroughfare. It is a garden for the city of Dublin, much appreciated by many families confined to flatland.” MalahideIn a similar spirit of sunny optimism, Fingal County Council took the decision to pedestrianise a street in Malahide as part of its Covid- 19 mobility measures.While the council has converted parking spaces into footpaths to enable social distancing and improved cycling infrastructure in a number of towns and villages, New Street in the north Dublin village is the only one to be fully pedestrianised. The council’s senior executive engineer Andrew Nolan said the project involved considerable research, planning and consultation. Vehicular access for emergency services, deliveries, residents and businesses with private off-street parking was maintained, and additional parking spaces were provided in a nearby car park to compensate for the lack of on-street parking. There was “extensive daily on-site engagement with residents’ businesses” as planters and outdoor seating was installed, he said.Malahide Chamber of Commerce president Derek Fowler, who owns a pub on New Street, said the pedestrianisation has made a dramatic difference to the street. “It’s given it a real facelift and brought many more people to the street. I’ve never seen as many people on the street and they all seem really happy.”The street certainly looks vibrant, with an almost continental feel when the sun is shining and people are eating at outdoor tables. However, the atmosphere is somewhat dampened by the red and yellow Save Malahide Village posters in many windows.New Street pharmacist Áine McCabe said more than 40 local businesses wanted the pedestrianisation ended because of what they said are “significant knock-on traffic problems”.Shop Malahide, the advocacy group behind the campaign, is not “anti-cycling or anti-walking”, she insisted. “That could not be further from the truth. We very much welcome the visitors and residents who cycle and walk to the village and the custom they bring. We believe there is a balance to be struck between facilitating the needs of cyclists and ensuring that traffic flows easily.”The campaign had advocated for a “shared space” scheme, where car parking would be removed and space reallocated to cyclists and walkers. However consultation was “inadequate” she says and the scheme was presented as a “fait accompli” to businesses. “This is a plan they’ve had in their back pocket for a long time and they are using the guise of Covid to push it through.”The council’s director of services David Storey is flummoxed by the group’s opposition. “Shop Malahide were at a stakeholders’ meeting on May 19th where this was approved. They were in favour of it and subsequently they came out a week later and went a different route. We are the ones being vilified but they are the ones who changed their mind. It’s completely disingenuous.”The pedestrianisation of New Street is currently midway through a 10-week trial. “We are actively looking to work with stakeholders and if there was agreement, I would like to continue it beyond the 10 weeks,” Mr Storey said.The council began the Blackrock scheme at the end of May. After seeking public feedback on the progress to date, it said three quarters of submissions were positive and fewer than 20 per cent negative.The Dublin Cycling Campaign, always first in the crosshairs if there are shots to be fired at cyclists, has also encountered surprisingly little negative reaction.“There has been a small amount of negative feedback online, but the majority has been overwhelmingly positive,” said Oisín O’Connor, the campaign’s Dún Laoghaire Rathdown spokesman.“There was a bit of grumbling about traffic issues in Dún Laoghaire, but that’s to be expected while there are roadworks ongoing. They’ve had to close both sides of the coast road in some sections to be able to do the works safely. Once the works are finished, the one lane along the coast will reopen and things will get better as people get used to it.”Retail Excellence managing director Duncan Graham puts the success of the measures down to consultation, and maintaining accessibility.“There has to be engagement with stakeholders, meaningful consultation with traders if any of these schemes are going to work. In Blackrock, traders could see wider footpaths for queuing outside shops were needed, and everyone got a new bike during lockdown, it was like Christmas,” he said.“So it was easy to get across the logic of better spaces for pedestrians and cyclists. But crucially, even though it is one way, there is still ample street parking and accessibility has been maintained.”Dublin City Council, which trialled the pedestrianisation of several streets around Grafton Street at the weekend, has not had to deal with any serious opposition to its pedestrian and cycle measures so far, apart from the odd legal letter from multistorey car park owners. However, as Fingal and the OPW have seen, opposition might be festering, even if the sores have yet to break out.Suggestions that could change Dublin for the better"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"One Change: Litter in space is a growing problem, and represents a long-standing indifference to caring for the environmentMinister wants local authorities to re-orientate streets towards pedestrians, cyclists and public transportIreland is set to retrofit 500,000 homes and install 400,000 heat pumps by 2030"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needs"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: GettyThe country’s two largest teacher unions have expressed optimism that the Government’s plans to allow schools reopen at the end of August, which are due to be announced later today, will enable all teachers and students to operate in a safe environment.Leaders of the Irish National Teachers’ Organisation and Association of Secondary Teachers’ Ireland have welcomed the outline of the €350 million plan due to be signed off at this afternoon’s meeting of the Cabinet but expressed concern that the funding would be adequate.INTO general secretary, John Boyle, said the Government’s plan was very detailed but he was uncertain about the breakdown of funding which would be available to schools.The package is understood to include hundreds of additional teachers and alterations to classrooms, along with administrative supports for principals.Mr Boyle said boards of management and principals would be under huge pressure to deliver on the plan through carrying out risk assessments, ordering PPE supplies to allow 600,000 staff and pupils return to school at the end of August after missing 60 school days in the recent school year.Speaking on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland, Mr Boyle acknowledged it was “a big ask” but felt it could be done because of the detailed plan that has been formulated.However, he said he was worried that funding for the resource package could run out in a number of weeks with the risk of classes having to be split if substitute teachers were not available.Mr O’Boyle added: “It is ironic that it has taken a pandemic for us to realise that education cannot work on a shoestring.”The INTO has sought assurance that supply panels of teachers modelled on a successful pilot scheme which was trialled last year will be established around the country to allow substitute teachers to be deployed at short notice.Mr Boyle also called for measures to ensure the country’s 1,700 teaching principals would be allowed to oversee the health and safety measures needed in their schools once they reopened.“It is absolutely imperative that they be given the space to leave their classrooms,” said Mr O’Boyle.AdviceASTI president, Deirdre McDonald, said the plan must be in line with the public health advice on safe working conditions.“We do hope that what is necessary will be put in place. If it’s not, we won’t be back,” she added.Ms McDonald said she was very hopeful that all schools could reopen as planned as the teachers’ unions had made it extremely clear to the Department of Education what was needed.Speaking on Newstalk Breakfast, Ms McDonald said it was crucial that the plan would be sustainable and take account of the increased need for substitute teachers.The ASTI president said the amount of money available for additional staff, cleaning of schools and adaption of school buildings would be key.“We don’t know how much will be needed but we know it needs to be adequate and we know it needs to be sustainable,” said Ms McDonald.Ms McDonald said the situation had been made more difficult than it needed to be by the Government introducing lower pay rates for new teachers and falling numbers entering the profession.“The under-spend on education is coming home to roost now,” said Ms McDonald.Both teacher union leaders noted the irony of the recent controversial decision by the Government to bring in legislation to ensure three super junior ministers each got a €16,288 supplement when they had been engaged in a campaign for several years to have equal pay for teachersMeanwhile, the head of Tullow Community School in Tullow, Co Carlow said the Government’s plan to have a social distancing rule of one metre in schools once they reopen is going to have huge implications for schools.Speaking on KCFM, the school’s principal, Paul Thornton estimated the cost of replacing the school’s double-desks with over 650 single desks to ensure social distancing would be over €30,000.“If they’re talking about classroom infrastructure changes, then you’re talking about planning permission, you’re talking about architecture and then trying to find builders in three weeks to knock out the walls and extend the classroom.

Photograph: Ellen O’Riordan Summer would not be complete for 73-year-old Val Dempsey without a venture up Ireland’s holiest mountain on the last weekend of July.From Minane Bridge, in Cork, Mr Dempsey has travelled to Mayo for Reek Sunday for more than 30 years, including in 2015 when pilgrims were warned to stay away due to wild weather.“Once I came here I just kept coming,” he said, sipping a coffee at the mountain’s base next to his wife Mary Dempsey.“There are often days where you come and you cannot see the top of the mountain at all due to the mist. Today the weather is fantastic,” he said.Factoring in Covid-19 restrictions this year, the pair decided to do “just a little bit of the mountain for the exercise and the tradition.”Reek Sunday usually brings thousands of pilgrims - many of them barefoot - to climb Croagh Patrick each year.However, Archbishop of Tuam Michael Neary had encouraged people to attend a local Mass this Reek Sunday rather than take part in the traditional ascent.Echoing the sentiments of local church leaders, gardaí, Mayo Mountain Rescue and locals in Murrisk asked people to stay away after deciding the normal infrastructure and hundreds of volunteers could not be deployed due to Covid-19.John Graham (60) only realised it was Reek Sunday upon arriving at the foot of the mountain. From Belfast, the “regular walker” had not heard the warnings to stay away and has been enjoying climbing a number of mountains as coronavirus restrictions have eased.“It is outside, it is not hard to stay two metres apart,” he said. “ I am fairly risk-averse so I wouldn’t come if I thought it wasn’t safe.”Among those who opted to climb was a group of five men from Co Meath who came to Westport for a weekend staycation.“This has been on our bucket list. I wasn’t aware Reek Sunday existed,” Allan El Atrash (28) said. “If there was some sort of Garda brigade here we would have turned around.”Working at a tea and coffee stand beside the walkway, Jackie O’Grady said the place was “much quieter” than on a usual Reek Sunday.“Usually it is mental. The car park would be full and they have to open fields for extra parking. It would be just crowds and crowds of people,” she said.As the morning wore into afternoon, about 100 people carrying tricolours and “Irish Republic” flags arrived to protest the official cancellation of the Reek Sunday pilgrimage.News of a “rally by the reek” had been spread on social media and encouraged “patriotic pilgrims” to “protect our Christian heritage”.One protester, who gave her name only as Bridget, said she had travelled from Dublin and was attempting the pilgrimage for the first time. She said it was “disgusting” that pilgrims were being asked to stay away.“Why would they stop people from coming?” she asked.Anti-lockdown and anti-immigration activists Gemma O’Doherty and John Waters addressed the protesters, who cheered loudly when told Irish people will “take their country back”.In a lengthy speech about immigration, Ms O’Doherty claimed Ireland’s culture, heritage and Christian faith is being “wiped out” and said people are terrified to question what she called the coronavirus “scamdemic”.After speeches and a rendition of the national anthem, many protesters started to climb.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4314028.1595783452!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"almost 6 000 people a day arriving into ireland by air","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAt Shannon Airport, weekly passenger numbers jumped more than 80 per cent, from 836 to 1,522. Photograph: Arthur EllisPress22Almost 6,000 air passengers are flying into Ireland every day, with nearly a third of arrivals travelling from the UK, latest official figures disclose.While numbers are dramatically lower than normal for the time of year, there has been a steady increase over recent weeks in visitors arriving through Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports.In the week July 13th to July 19th, at least 36, 931 passengers touched down at Dublin Airport, from 35 different countries, including the UK (10,743), Spain (4,965), France (2,137) and the Netherlands (2,041).Some 1,122 passengers arrived from the US at Dublin Airport during the period.The overall number of arrivals was up almost 30 per cent from the previous week (28,603) and up nearly 60 per cent on the preceding week (23,156), when more flights were put on at the beginning of the month.The numbers only cover those who are visiting Ireland and do not include other passengers who are transferring through Dublin onto onward flights.During the same week, some 2,846 passengers arrived at Cork Airport –- more than half (1,566) from the UK, with Spain (450), Poland (363) and France (120) the next most popular departure countries. Overall weekly arrival numbers at Cork have increased almost 65 per cent since the first week of the month (1,731).At Shannon Airport, weekly passenger numbers jumped more than 80 per cent over the same time period, from 836 to 1,522. Again, the UK (772) accounted for the largest number of arrivals, followed by Spain (332), Poland (238) and Lithuania (70).Parliamentary questionThe figures were released by Minister for Transport Tourism and Sport Eamon Ryan in response to a parliamentary question by Kerry TD Michael Healy-Rae.Mr Ryan said State airports remained open during the Covid-19 crisis “to ensure critical supply chains have been able to remain operational, and citizens have been able to return home”.He was unable to provide a breakdown of the arrivals into Ireland by those who were returning home and those who were foreign visitors.“While our three State airports have seen some increases in operations since more passenger flights resumed on the first of July, passenger numbers still remain low,” he said. At Dublin Airport, nine million passengers are expected in 2020 (compared to over 32 million passengers in 2019).He said numbers at both Cork and Shannon were down by about 90 per cent over the same time last year.Mr Ryan was also unable to detail the original departure countries of nearly 14,000 passengers who arrived in Ireland through sea ports in recent weeks.Between June 29th and July 12th, some 10,046 passengers disembarked ferries from the UK at Dublin Port. Another 2,264 arrived at Rosslare from the UK, while 1,483 visitors got off ferries from Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Spain at either Rosslare or Cork.Last week, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney suggested further travel restrictions could be introduced for visitors arriving from Covid-19 “hot spots”.Currently, visitors from all but 15 European countries and territories on the so-called “green list” published earlier this month only have to fill out a passenger locator form and agree to spend 14 days in quarantine at a confirmed address on arriving in Ireland.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Move is seen as a retaliation for China\u0026rsquos removal from its consulate in Houston, TexasThere is a real fear in China that things are starting to spin out of controlRecord 10 deaths confirmed as Victoria\u0026rsquos second wave is driven by workplace spreadLockdown declared in border town as \u0026lsquorunaway\u0026rsquo returns from South - state media\u0026lsquoWhy are they playing Radiohead?

Meanwhile, an investigation by El País newspaper published on Sunday showed that Spain’s Covid-19 death toll could be nearly 60 per cent higher than the official figure of 28,432.In the US, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Sunday reported 4,163,892 cases of coronavirus, an increase of 64,582 cases from its previous daily count, and said the number of deaths from the disease had risen by 929 to 145,942. Prior to Sunday the US had recorded more than 1,000 deaths a day from Covid-19 for five days running.The US state of Florida recorded 9,300 new coronavirus cases, becoming the second state after California to overtake New York, which was the worst-hit state in terms of cases at the start of the US outbreak, according to a Reuters tally. President Donald Trump’s fellow Republicans in the Senate are set to unveil a $1 trillion US coronavirus relief Bill on Monday that includes reduced federal unemployment benefits, with treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin saying he believes they can work with Democrats to move quickly on the legislation.Meanwhile, the health minister of the Mexican state of Chihuahua, Dr Jesus Grajeda, has died, Chihuahua’s governor said on Sunday, nearly two weeks after Dr Grajeda was hospitalised with Covid-19. Tourist seasonThe latest uptick in cases in many European countries appears to have coincided with the start of the summer tourist season. The surge highlights the dilemma facing policymakers: on one hand they fear reimposing a shutdown that has devastated their economies, but on the other they worry the return of mass travel will trigger a second wave of the pandemic.In North Korea, leader Kim Jong-un said he believes “the vicious virus” may have entered the country, and placed the city of Kaesong, near the border with South Korea, under total lockdown after a person was found with suspected Covid-19 symptoms.Mr Kim convened an emergency politburo meeting in response to what he called a “critical situation in which the vicious virus could be said to have entered the country”, the North’s KCNA state news reported.A person who defected to South Korea three years ago returned across the fortified border that ides the two Koreas to the town of Kaesong this month with symptoms of Covid-19, KCNA reported.“An emergency event happened in Kaesong city where a runaway who went to the South three years ago, a person who is suspected to have been infected with the vicious virus, returned on July 19th after illegally crossing the demarcation line,” KCNA said.China reported 46 new Covid-19 cases on Sunday, its highest such daily tally in more than a month, as it took steps to stem recent outbreaks that have infected more than 160 people at opposite ends of the country.China has recorded 83,830 cases and 4,634 deaths since the pandemic began. The National Health Commission said that 288 patients remain in treatment, including 18 in a critical condition.Record tollIn Australia, Victoria state recorded 10 deaths overnight – its highest such daily toll amid a continuing surge in cases.State premier Daniel Andrews said the deaths included seven men and three women, including a man in his 40s.Elsewhere, Vietnam reintroduced social distancing measures in the central city of Danang after the country reported four locally transmitted coronavirus cases over the past two days.Iran on Sunday reported another 216 fatalities and 2,333 new cases of coronavirus in the past 24 hours, raising its death toll to 15,700 from 291,172 known cases. The level of infection is “red” over most of Iran, as one in five deaths in the country is linked to Covid-19, deputy health minister Iraj Harirchi said on state TV.Morocco will stop people entering and leaving some of its biggest cities from midnight to contain a surge in Covid-19 cases, the interior and health ministries said on Sunday. The cities to be locked down include the economic powerhouse of Casablanca as well as Tangier, Marrakech, Fez and Meknes. The country eased a nationwide lockdown a month ago, though international flights are still suspended, except for special flights by national airlines carrying Moroccans or foreign residents. On Sunday, the Moroccan health ministry said 633 new Covid-19 cases were recorded, one of its biggest daily rises so far, bringing the total number of confirmed infections in the country to 20,278, with 313 deaths. – AgenciesEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"King Abdullah warns move could destabilise not only the kingdom but the entire regionPrime minister Omar Razzaz says Israel\u0026rsquos annexation plan would destabilise regionRampant inflation and 30 per cent unemployment places huge strain on societyHopewell Chin\u0026rsquoono seized as part of a crackdown on anti-corruption protestersIsraeli prime minister still awaiting final approval from Washington for implementation of controversial planGovernment under pressure as initial lifting of restrictions now seen as having been too rapidEndeavour intended to stoke Arab and Muslim pride over rich heritage of discoveryCases confirmed in doctors and nurse with concern virus will move fast through campsHealth officials say country in \u0026lsquodangerous place\u0026rsquo after early success in curbing epidemicSpeculation grows that \u0026lsquofire\u0026rsquo may have been deliberate attack on facilityIsrael\u0026rsquos move on West Bank and Trump peace plan blocked by Palestinian rivals\u0026lsquoDefender of Israel\u0026rsquo Boris Johnson says move would be \u0026lsquoviolation of international law\u0026rsquoPlan to annex parts of West Bank condemned by UN commissioner as \u0026lsquodisastrous\u0026rsquoSome 9.3m Syrians are now food insecure, an increase of 1.4m in past six monthsSeparatist insurgents from Balochistan province claim responsibility for attackNo group claimed responsibility for the attack and Taliban has denied involvementThousands of children could die from preventable diseases because of dire state of healthcare, UN warnsArab world unites in opposition and warns of dire consequences if annexation proceedsOnly under-65s can take part and pilgrims will be quarantined before and after pilgrimageStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4312065.1595526228!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"barnier says trade agreement unlikely between eu and uk","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Boris Johnson holding  crabs  at Stromness harbour during a visit to the Scottish Highlands and Northern Isles. Photograph:   Robert PerryPA WireBritain’s refusal to compromise on fisheries and level playing field guarantees of fair competition have made a trade agreement unlikely, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator said on Thursday. Speaking at the end of a round of talks in London, Mr Barnier said that although there was some progress in certain areas there was none on the key issue of a level playing field on state aid.“By its current refusal to commit to conditions of open and fair competition and to a balanced agreement on fisheries, the UK makes a trade agreement, at this point, unlikely,” he said.Britain’s chief negotiator David Frost blamed the EU, asserting that its proposals did not respect the red lines Boris Johnson identified in a meeting with the presidents of the EU institutions last month.“Considerable gaps remain in the most difficult areas, that is, the so-called level playing field and on fisheries.\u0026nbspWe have always been clear that our principles in these areas are not simple negotiating positions but expressions of the reality that we will be a fully independent country at the end of the transition period,” he said.Mr Frost said the EU had listened to Britain’s concerns about the role of the European Court of Justice in any future agreement and Britain has dropped its demand for a complex suite of separate agreements like those the EU has with Switzerland. However, the issue of state aid remains a stumbling block, and Mr Barnier complained on Thursday that Britain had not yet published details of the state aid regime it plans to introduce from January next year.“We have no visibility on the UK’s intention on its future domestic subsidy control regime. We respect the UK political debate but the time for answers is quickly running out,” he said.A senior British official close to the talks dismissed Mr Barnier’s demand for details of the state aid regime, and said Britain would not commit to any regime as part of its treaty with the EU.“We’re a bit puzzled by this, to be honest, because we don’t quite see why. What is significant about the subsidy regime compared to lots of other areas of domestic policy? “They aren’t asking us to pre-publish in these areas or to kind of pre-commit to future agreements forever in the treaty. And we don’t really see why this is the case either in this area. All we need is a mechanism to resolve disputes between you if there are felt to be unfair subsidies,” the official said.“We’re not going to pre-commit to a particular kind of regime in the treaty with the EU. That’s just not how we’re going to do things.” Second referendumDuring a visit to Scotland on Thursday, Mr Johnson was met by protesters calling for a second referendum on Scottish independence. During a visit to Orkney and the north of Scotland, the prime minister said the response to the coronavirus had shown the strength of the union.However, Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon , who has won praise for her handling of the pandemic, said Mr Johnson should not be exploiting it to make a political point.“I don’t think any of us should be championing or celebrating a pandemic that has taken thousands of lives as some example of the pre-existing political case we want to make. This has been a heart-breaking crisis that we’re not out of yet. Too many people died,” she said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUS Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez –  “so full of natural political talent, burning so bright, that the 2020 field seems dull next to her lustre”. Photograph: David Dee DelgadoNew York TimesPresident Donald Trump is oh so proud of having mastered the ability to intone, “Person. Woman. Man. Camera. TV.” But the more pressing issue is whether he is a person who can master talking to women through a TV camera without sounding like a caveman.We continually debate whether Trump is a madman, but there’s no doubt he’s a Mad Man. He’s a ring-a-ding-ding guy, stuck in a time warp redolent of Vegas with the Rat Pack in 1959, talking about how “broads” and “skirts” rate. He was in his element bro-ing out with Dave Portnoy in an interview for Barstool Sports that aired on Friday.Trump’s idea of wooing the women’s vote, which is decisive in this election, was to tweet out a New York Post story headlined “Joe Biden’s disastrous plans for America’s suburbs” with the directive: “The Suburban Housewives of America must read this article.”Clearly, the 74-year-old president thinks that American women are in the kitchen clutching their pearls, a la June Cleaver sheltered in the ’burbs in their gingham aprons waiting for their big, brave breadwinners to come home after a hard day’s work manhandling their secretaries.Trump believes that the coveted electoral cohort that used to be known as soccer moms are actually sucker moms, naive enough to fall for his shtick that the unleashed forces of urban America are marching towards their manicured lawns. How perfect that the president – whose personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, got in trouble over his boss’s porn-star payout – wants to protect the desperate housewives of America.In a speech on drug prices last Friday, Trump took his strange brand of feminism for a spin, pausing while he talked about middlemen profiting in the Big Pharma arena to say “and women, I guess”. On the Bulwark, a conservative website, Sarah Longwell wrote about her three years’ worth of focus groups with women who voted for Trump in 2016.Lack of compassionShe found that they chose Trump over Hillary Clinton because they did not like Clinton and because they felt that Bill Clinton’s bad behaviour with women cancelled out Trump’s bad behaviour with women. But the relationship with women voters has soured, not only because of his pugnacity and bullying but also because of his lack of compassion and competence dealing with the coronavirus and painful issues about race.“They don’t see Trump as someone who can protect them from the chaos,” Longwell wrote. “They think he’s the source of it.” And his party is on board with the antediluvian vibe. R-Misogyny. Even on the 100th anniversary of women getting the vote, Republicans can’t help themselves. It feels strange to be typing something positive in a sentence with the word Cheney in it, but it was disturbing to see a bunch of MAGA bros in Congress beat up on Liz Cheney because, among other offences to the cult of Trump, she defended Dr Anthony Fauci and shaded Trump on his denial regarding the virus by tweeting a picture of her father in a mask with the hashtag “realmenwearmasks”.One Trump disciple in the House, Republican Matt Gaetz, tweeted that “Liz Cheney has worked behind the scenes (and now in public) against @realDonald Trump and his agenda.” He added, “Liz Cheney should step down or be removed.”Donald Trump jnr chimed in on Twitter, “We already have one Mitt Romney, we don’t need another.” (Of course, while it feels strange to be typing something positive in a sentence with the word Trump in it, Donald Trump jnr was right in his second point: “We also don’t need the endless wars she advocates for.” That point was echoed by the president on Twitter. I would never agree with a Cheney’s mindless hawkishness.)‘F***ing bitch’As Republicans sniped, one Democrat soared. Ted Yoho, a Florida Republican, tried to slap down Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. A reporter overheard him muttering that the congresswoman was “a f***ing bitch” as Yoho walked away after having an argument with her about crime and policing on the steps of the Capitol. Yoho denies he said it.The youngest woman to ever serve in Congress is so full of natural political talent, burning so bright, that the 2020 field seems dull next to her lustre. It was a remarkable moment on Capitol Hill, where for years superachieving women have let such sexist remarks slide.She went to the House floor on Thursday and schooled Yoho the Yahoo and the retrograde crowd. “Mr Yoho mentioned that he has a wife and two daughters,” she said. “I am two years younger than Mr Yoho’s youngest daughter. I am someone’s daughter, too.” She added, “I am here because I have to show my parents that I am their daughter and that they did not raise me to accept abuse from men.”Showing her skill in a generational dimension foreign to Congress until now, AOC posted a video of herself on Instagram Stories strutting to the rap tune Boss Bitch by Doja Cat, her long hair whipping to the music, with the Capitol in the background. “I’m a bitch and a boss, I’m a-shine like gloss.” She captioned it: “Shine on, fight for others, and let the haters stay mad.”And that’s the way you make Paleolithic men understand that they are history.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4314504.1595838482!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"us cities in bind as turmoil spreads far beyond portland","story":"Peaceful protests in the US were already happening for weeks when federal officers arrived on July 4th, investigations have since shown how president Donald Trump’s deployment ignited chaos. Video: NYT \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSeattle police officers deploy pepper spray as they clash with protesters. Photograph: Jason RedmondAFPGetty ImagesA series of strident new protests over police misconduct rattled cities across the country over the weekend, creating a new dilemma for state and local leaders who had succeeded in easing some of the turbulence in their streets until a showdown over the use of federal agents in Oregon stirred fresh outrage.With some demonstrators embracing destructive protest methods and police often using aggressive tactics to subdue both them and others who are demonstrating peacefully, the scenes on Saturday night in places like Seattle, Oakland, California, and Los Angeles recalled the volatile early days of the protests after the death of George Floyd at the end of May.The latest catalyst was the deployment of federal law enforcement agents in Portland, Oregon, whose militarised efforts to subdue protests around the federal courthouse have sparked mass demonstrations and nightly clashes there. They have also inspired new protests of solidarity in other cities, where people have expressed deep concern about the federal government exercising such extensive authority in a city that has made it clear it opposes the presence of federal agents.US president Donald Trump has seized on the scenes of national unrest – statues toppled and windows smashed – to build a law-and-order message for his reelection campaign, spending more than $26 million on television ads depicting a lawless dystopia of empty police stations and 911 answering services that he argues might be left in a nation headed by his Democratic rival, Joe Biden.PledgeMr Biden insisted last week that the president’s pledge to inject a federal law-and-order presence into the already volatile issue of policing shows that he is “determined to sow chaos and ision. To make matters worse instead of better.” The situation has left city leaders, now watching the backlash unfold on their streets, outraged and caught in the middle. Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan said in an interview Sunday that the city is in the middle of a self-fulfilling prophecy, with protesters infuriated by the federal presence in Portland smashing windows and setting fires, the very images of “anarchy” that the president has warned about.“There is no question that the actions in Portland have escalated things, not just in Seattle, but nationwide,” Ms Durkan said. At the same time, a new round of street unrest could intensify differences among local officials over how best to address the complaints of demonstrators and respond to vandalism and violence. In June, amid a wide-ranging police reform movement, the Seattle City Council banned the use of tear gas and other crowd control tactics, including pepper spray. The police chief has objected, and the US department of justice intervened with a lawsuit, winning a temporary restraining order Friday blocking implementation of that ban. Over the weekend, Seattle officers used pepper spray and flash-grenades to disperse protesters.ArrestsOver the weekend, dozens of people were arrested in Seattle. Protesters in Los Angeles clashed with officers in front of the city’s federal courthouse downtown. Police also made arrests at protests in smaller cities, such as Omaha, Nebraska, and Richmond, Virginia.In Oakland, what had been a peaceful protest led in part by a group of mothers proclaiming “Cops And Feds Off Our Streets” devolved after dark as another set of protesters smashed windows at the county courthouse and lit a fire inside. An armed protester was shot and killed in Austin, Texas, by a motorist whose car, according to witnesses and police, had been aimed toward a group of demonstrators also protesting the federal presence in Portland. The protests continued in Portland on Sunday as the city neared its 60th straight day of demonstrations. As crowds gathered once again near the federal courthouse, the Portland Police Bureau said that a shooting had occurred about a block away. Officers took two people into custody, and one person showed up at a hospital with an apparent gunshot wound that was not life-threatening, the bureau said in a statement.In Seattle on Sunday night, hundreds of protesters returned to the area around a police station in the Capitol Hill neighbourhood. The gathering remained peaceful. Some cities had welcomed Trump’s offer to send additional law federal law enforcement agents in to help combat escalating gang violence and drug crime, but insisted they would brook no federal agents on their streets arresting and tear gassing protesters.Push backDemocratic city and state leaders pushed back against the new federal presence, but also expressed frustration that some on the streets were going too far and playing into the president’s gambit. “I’m furious that Oakland may have played right into Donald Trump’s twisted campaign strategy,” Oakland’s mayor, Libby Schaaf, said in an interview on Sunday. “Images of a vandalized downtown is exactly what he wants to whip up his base and to potentially justify sending in federal troops that will only incite more unrest.”In Chicago, Mayor Lori Lightfoot, a Democrat who has repeatedly clashed with Trump, had said she welcomed the president’s intervention on enacting gun control and investing in community programs. “Any other form of militarized assistance within our borders that would not be within our control or within the direct command of the Chicago Police Department would spell disaster,” she said in a letter to the president last week. New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham on Sunday called the administration’s decision to send law enforcement agents to the state ? a measure the administration has sought to distinguish from the agents sent to guard federal property in Portland ? as “a bit suspect.”“They have not provided the federal funding that was promised to Albuquerque for police and crime interventions,” she said in an appearance on ABC’s “This Week.” She said that the state would work with federal agents if they folded into existing efforts to address violent crime. But, she said, “If we’re going to incentivise unrest, then that’s something altogether different.”Portland has been the epicentre of the most recent protests. After the initial mass demonstrations in the aftermath of Mr Floyd’s death, protests in the city continued each night, although in smaller numbers. Police have said there was persistent vandalism, people pointing lasers at law enforcement agents, and protesters who threw objects such as commercial-grade fireworks at officers, including those protecting the federal courthouse.UnrestMr Trump’s campaign has sought to capitalise on the unrest to reassure voters that he will bring an end to the turbulence. “If there is a danger for Democrats generically, it is if the Republicans are able to define them as being on the side of the anarchists in Portland,” said Scott Jennings, a veteran Republican strategist. But he said that Mr Trump’s heated and broad-brush rhetoric has made the Republican cause harder. “The bottom line is it’s a situation that requires nuance and it’s a presidency that has not engaged in a lot of nuance.”Democratic strategists and Biden officials expressed confidence that Mr Trump’s attacks posed little immediate political risk even as street protests escalated. For one, they said, the president’s warning of a dark Democratic-run future is in stark dissonance with the reality that the unrest is happening under his own administration. They said the police issue was being treated by many voters as a distraction by Mr Trump from his faltering coronavirus pandemic response and the struggling economy.“No matter how many troops Donald Trump sends into American cities, it’s not going to distract them from their primary concern which is the coronavirus and their health,” said Jared Leopold, a Democratic strategist. – New York TimesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"jacinda ardern takes new zealand labour party record popularity","story":"New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s Labour Party now has the popularity to govern the country alone, according to latest polling.The latest Newshub-Reid Research poll has Ms Ardern’s party soaring to nearly 60.9 per cent of the vote, up from up from 56.5 per cent in the last poll. That result would allow Labour to govern alone – the first time that has happened under New Zealand’s Mixed Member Proportional system.The poll also showed support for the opposition National Party has slumped to 25.1 per cent. It is more than five points down on the previous poll in May, and follows two leadership changes in the past two months.Ms Ardern’s personal rating as preferred prime minister was also high, sitting at 62 per cent, up 2.5 points. The National Party’s new leader, Judith Collins’ rating was 14.6 per cent.Ms Ardern told The AM Show on Monday she keeps up a “healthy skepticsm” around polls.“I do keep an eye on trends though. I\u0027d like to think the trend, or at least what message we can take from this, is general support for the government\u0027s Covid recovery and response plan.”New Zealand has staved off community transmission of Covid-19, which came after a several week lockdown during March and April.The county, which has a population of five million people, has recorded 1,206 Covid-19 cases and 22 deaths.Citizens now enjoy far fewer restrictions than most other countries, according to Oxford University\u0027s Government Response Stringency Index.However, Ms Ardern, who turned 40 on Sunday, said she was “never complacent”.“This is a really crucial time for New Zealand - we need to keep demonstrating that we\u0027re focused, and we\u0027ll be doing that every day of the election.With the poll result, Labour would bring 77 MPs into the 120-seat Parliament and be able to comfortably govern alone. Currently, Labour forms a coalition with the NZ First Party and the Greens. National would have just 32 MPs.In a statement, National campaign chair Gerry Brownlee said the poll was rogue.These numbers aren\u0027t even in the same ballpark as our internal polls, other public polls and the hugely positive public response to our Leader Judith Collins.”Ms Collins was elected leader after its former leader Simon Bridges stood down, followed by another leader Todd Muller only weeks later.The country’s general election is on September 19.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 27th july 2020","story":"Andrew Naylor (13) of Halifax, West Yorkshire, who plays tenor horn in his local Scout band, and is the youngest member of nearby Friendly Brass Band.

Take a walk at Virginia WaterSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis spectacular destination is only part of a vast, aristocratic pleasure ground of woodlands, parks and meadows that would take weeks to fully explore on foot.The 4.5-mile circuit of the lake takes you past an eclectic mix of attractions, including an ornamental cascade waterfall, Roman ruins brought from Libya and an authentic 100ft-high totem pole gifted by British Columbia.With so much space, there is plenty of room for a secluded picnic too.See windsorgreatpark for more information.2. Cycle the New ForestWhether you discovered a love of cycling thanks to the lockdown or have been a convert for many years, the traffic-free and waymarked trails of the New Forest make it an enticing spot for all levels of rider.If you want to leave your wheels at home, there are plenty of local bike-hire options, which can also provide advice on the best routes for your party – from easy family jaunts to long-distance challenges.See thenewforest for information on cycling routes.3. Hike through the Chilterns Stay safe and have fun with this important travel guidance:Only travel in a car with members of your household andor support bubbleAlways wear a face covering or mask on public transportWash your hands before putting on your face covering and after you’ve taken it offWash your face covering dailyWhere possible, leave the car behind and reach your destination by walking or cyclingChef Tom Kerridge on reopening his Michelin-starred pub safelyAn area of outstanding natural beauty with rolling hills (such as Coombe Hill, above, the highest vantage point in the area), the sparkling chalk streams and ancient woodlands right on London’s doorstep sounds too good to be true, but the Chilterns offer precisely that.With over 300 square miles of scenery and attractions to absorb the crowds, a quiet route is also a walker\u0027s goal. The Chilterns Conservation Board and Chiltern Society have developed a series of 23 walks across the Chilterns which are social-distance-friendly, taking in hill climbs and gentle ambles.Visit chilternsaonb.org for more details about their social-distance-friendly walks.4. Kitesurf at Camber SandsCamber Sands has over two miles of beach to absorb the post-lockdown crowds. The eastern end, marked with black and white flags, is reserved for activities such as kitesurfing, and there is plenty of space for novices to learn how to handle a power kite on land or water.An introduction from The Kitesurf Centre covers the fundamentals and can be booked as one-to-one coaching, as a single group from the same household, or in groups of up to three people from separate households.The nearest train station is in Rye, four miles away. A six-hour introduction to kitesurfing course starts at £99, minimum age 12. See thekitesurfcentre for details.With the pools closed and the seaside crowded, many swimmers are looking elsewhere to take a dip. Far from the chlorinated confines of the local swimming bath, a fresh water reservoir, lake or river can be an exhilarating alternative, but there are many safety issues to consider before getting wet in the wild, so make sure you read up on the hazards first.​See outdoorswimmingsociety for advice and a directory of open-water swimming lakes to explore.6. Learn to jet skiThe beaches could be busy, but you can leave the crowds in your wake after completing a Royal Yachting Association (RYA) personal watercraft course that, in just one day, provides you with all you need to safely helm a jet ski inland or on the coast.There are plenty of places in the UK that can teach you – such as Jetski Safaris in Poole – and no experience is necessary.Visit jetskiandpowerboattraining for more information. Single-person RYA proficiency course for jet skis from £180.7. Ride on an Olympic bike trackThe Hadleigh mountain bike track hosted the London 2012 Olympics and has evolved since then into one of the premier cross-country destinations in the UK.Hadleigh Country Park also provides one of the largest green spaces in Essex, with plenty of opportunities to explore the coast from Southend-on-Sea to Benfleet. The nearby castle ruins offer panoramic views of the River Thames and Kent on the opposite shore.Leigh-on-Sea or Benfleet stations are the closest to the country park. It’s a 10 to 20-minute ride from there to the track. See explore-essex for details.Meet the kayaking instructor...Having been cooped up during lockdown, it’s safe to say that large numbers are wanting to experience the great outdoors like never before now businesses are reopening.“We\u0027ve been ridiculously busy,” says Adrian Fall, below, owner of Brighton-based The Kayak Coach. “People have been so excited about being on the water.”Fall\u0027s passion is teaching people how to kayak, canoe and paddleboard – then leading them on trips up Sussex\u0027s beautiful estuaries and rivers.He set up The Kayak Coach almost 12 years ago and has just taken on two extra staff to add to the three he already employs teaching and guiding on the water: “I love being outside and now\u0027s the time to meet people again and introduce them to the sport I love,” he says.Reopening the business required important changes, as per Government guidelines. Group sizes have been reduced from eight to five to comply with social distancing – “It\u0027s actually a nicer experience for everybody,” Fall adds – and all equipment (boat, buoyancy aid, helmet) is cleaned and sterilised after each use.A one-way system has also been added to its training centre at Ashurst. “We\u0027ve made changes to what we do. But we\u0027re almost back to normal in terms of what we can offer,” Fall explains. Additionally, barrels of water are provided for sailors to wash their hands before and after each session. Fall admits that the past three months of enforced closure have been tough for the business and lovers of the outdoor life, but that people are “having to look locally because they\u0027re not going to France or America”. He adds: “They didn\u0027t know we were here, but they\u0027re excited about accessing the river on our doorstep.”See thekayakcoach for more detailsTo help plan your trip visit Know Before You Go Please keep in mind that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently have different guidelines, advice and timelines for reopening tourism. So do please make sure you check the respective official sources for information before you travel.Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

This is by no means a downgrade – after all, international tourists marvel at the UK’s impressive array of country house hotels, seaside cottages, boutique hotels, traditional inns, pubs-with-rooms and campsites on offer. But for a holiday to remember, a spot of glamping is hard to beat.For those of us who’ve had our appreciation for nature reawakened by lockdown, a glamping stay at a British yurt, gypsy caravan, shepherd’s hut or barn delivers a change of scene, outdoorsy activities, locally-sourced food, charming surroundings, luxury and comfort. Here are some key things to think about before your book...A beginners\u0027 guide to glamping Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesGiven the wide range of accommodation on offer, there really is a British glampsite perfect for every traveller. Just make sure you ask yourself a few simple questions before you book.For example, is there phone signal or Wi-Fi? A forced digital detox could be stressful if you’d hoped to stay contactable, but some travellers will consider it a bonus to be out of reach.Also, is there a pub, cafe or shop within walking distance, or will you need to arrive fully self-sufficient? Strolling to a local farm shop for daily provisions adds to the charm of glamping, whereas driving 30 minutes to the nearest supermarket is less of a joy.Equally importantly, what are your rainy options? This might be anything from a Scrabble marathon with a bottle of Merlot, or an underground caving adventure.Stay safe and have fun with this important travel guidance:Only travel in a car with members of your household andor support bubbleAlways wear a face covering or mask on public transportWash your hands before putting on your face covering and after you’ve taken it offWash your face covering dailyWhere possible, leave the car behind and reach your destination by walking or cyclingThe joy of glamping is that you can be packed in under half an hour – there’s no need to spend hours decanting instant coffee into tiny containers, searching for your head torch in the loft, and spending the drive wondering if you forgot the tent pegs. Bad weather is less of a concern too: a week under canvas isn’t much of a holiday, but cosying up in a gypsy caravan or yurt during a storm can be downright romantic.It\u0027s this convenience, comfort and peace of mind that you’re paying for when you book a glampsite, so don’t overthink the trip or stress about your packing list. Leave that to the camping crew.Whether you\u0027re an extrovert adventurer or a laid-back stargazer, there\u0027s a glamping holiday in the UK for you. Here are great staycation selections to inspire you...Go back to your rootsThe Faraway Treehouse in Cumbria is straight out of a fairy tale, with plush velvet curtains, a roll top bath and a balcony to spot deer from during the day. The treehouse is bound to be a hit with families, but it’s a ridiculously romantic getaway for couples too.Faraway Treehouse sleeps two (with space for two children at no additional charge), from £165 per night.Get away from it allTo really get away from it all, take the ferry to the Isle of Skye and bunker down in a beautifully decorated yurt from Skye Yurts. Be sure to stay for at least five nights to hike this gorgeous island, kayak the coves, dine at the Michelin-starred Kinloch Lodge and generally feel a world away from reality.Base rate is £80 per night for two people.Step back in time – with modern comfortsLawnsgate Camping in the North York Moors offers glamping options including a yurt, gypsy caravan (pictured above) and cabin, as well as conventional tent pitchesThis is a working farm that has been in the family for generations, so it’s the real deal, and the picturesque nearby villages and on-site llama-trekking means there’s plenty to do.The Yurt is from £90 per night The Gypsy Caravan is £55 per night and The Game Larder is £60 per night. Watch the starsThe popular glampsite Finn Lough in Enniskillen offers superb stargazing opportunities through the transparent walls of the camping ‘bubbles’.Kayaking, hiking, wakeboarding and other outdoor activities are available nearby, and this scenic corner of Northern Ireland is also well worth exploring by bike or car.Prices start at £265 per night for domes or £145 for suites.Talk with the animalsYou don’t need to splurge on an African safari to spend the night surrounded by lions, tigers and bears.Glamping prices start from £350 per night.How Gilcombe Farm got ready to welcome glampers When events had to be postponed, Amelia Griffin and husband Simon Gerrard, pictured above, sought a new venture to add to their Crescent Moon events company.The solution? A glamping site on 300-acre Gilcombe Farm just outside Bruton in Somerset, near where they live. “It’s lovely countryside,” Griffin says. “There’s loads of gorgeous walks, and people can come just to enjoy the great outdoors.”The site hosts 10 Lotus Belle tents with comfortable Moroccan-style interiors, each eight metres apart with their own designated toilet and mini kitchen. “We could have put more tents in, but didn’t want to because of the present situation,” Griffin explains.Four-day bookings from Thursday to Monday enable the tents to be cleaned and left empty for a few days, and hand sanitiser is widely available on the site.The farm shop offers local produce and delivers to the tents. The couple have also added yoga classes, and outdoor film screenings when all 10 tents are booked.Your staycation checklist: know before you goMany locations across the UK are reopening but are restricting visitor numbers and offering pre-booked time slots.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Several areas in England are experiencing a surge in new coronavirus cases, with places in the North West appearing most at risk to a second wave of infections similar to the one seen in Leicester.The latest figures from Public Health England reveal Bradford and neighbouring Kirklees in West Yorkshire have seen high numbers of daily confirmed cases in recent days.Higher infection rates in Leicester prompted the government to introduce a local lockdown just weeks after nationwide containment measures first began to ease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFollowing Leicester’s lockdown last week, epidemiologist Professor Neil Ferguson warned that more localised lockdowns in the UK are “inevitable”.The former government adviser said that an estimated 8 per cent of the UK population has so far been infected, and that the pandemic is still in its “early stages”.Leicester remains the worst affected area in England in terms of cumulative case rate, with more than 1,000 people per 100,000 residents having been infected by Covid-19.Other areas to have experienced similarly high case rates include Ashford in Kent and Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, however both places have seen new cases fall substantially since May.The rate of new coronavirus infections in Ashford began to flatten off in early June, according to data collected by PHE. By contrast, daily cases in Leicester appeared to accelerate at around the same time.A similar surge occurred in Kirklees, despite the curve initially appearing to flatten one month ago. The number of new daily cases consistently fell below 20 in the first week of June, before spiking to more than 40 on 11 June.In Bradford, the number of new cases fell significantly in late May, before rising again throughout June. Unlike Kirklees, however, the rate of new infections appears to be once again slowing.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them.

Today we are taking one more step on the road towards giving women a voice and eradicating these harmful practices,” the future prime minister pledged.The unit has been funded through the Department for Education’s children’s social care innovation programme.Since 2015, it has supported more than 1,000 survivors or potential victims of FGM and secured 41 applications for protection orders, which can force the surrender of passports or other travel documents.Around 18,000 social workers, teachers, police and legal professionals have been trained by the centre. In October 2017, its remit was expanded to include breast flattening and child abuse linked to faith or belief.The closure threat is revealed after evidence of an explosion in cases of forced marriage and honour-based abuse during the lockdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic.Karma Nirvana, a group training the police, NHS and social services, reported a 200 per cent surge in helpline calls in March and April.A government spokesperson said funding for the centre was “time-limited while we worked on more permanent solution to tackle this terrible practice”.“We have also introduced tough safeguarding laws to compel certain professionals to report if they have encountered cases of FGM in under 18s, provided funding for charities to support victims of FGM and, through our new relationships, health and sex education curriculum, we are teaching pupils about the emotional and physical damage of FGM in an age-appropriate way, as well as teaching that it is a crime,” the spokesperson said.Department for Education\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

As well as two Michelin-starred pubs – The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach – he also opened a traditional butcher and founded Pub in the Park, the biggest food and music festival tour in the UK.During lockdown, staff from Kerridge’s businesses were volunteering to help a new charity called Meals from Marlow which delivers free food to NHS staff, key workers and people in need. This started small in early April and with support from over 1,000 donors, it recently ended up serving its 75,000th meal.From 4 July, both The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach have reopened fully in Marlow to welcome back hungry diners.7 great summer days out for the familyThe team have prepared a comprehensive Covid-19 policy document with a number of measures to protect the health and safety of guests and staff. Measures include daily staff temperature checks, hands-free antibacterial gel dispensers, one-way systems, private sole-use of bathrooms, cleaning touchpoints and toilets every 20 minutes, and even sanitising deliveries.Kerridge is also working with a company that provides protection against a wide range of pathogens, including Covid-19, using a sanitising treatment applied through fogging machines to provide an even coat on all surfaces, followed by manual application to hot spots, such as door handles.Form a bubble with a one-adult householdVisit your local salon, restaurant or bar, following UK Government guidelinesMeet in private gardens with up to six peopleTravel on public transport without a face covering or maskShare a car with people outside of your householdFor more information, visit gov.ukcoronavirus“Welcoming, safeguarding and taking care of others is at the very heart of what we do, says Kerridge. The last few months have been such a challenging time and we have been eagerly waiting to establish a little normality back into everyone’s lives, and get back to what we do best – providing great hospitality and food.”Kerridge\u0027s pubs have also been altered to make sure that spacing is as per UK Government guidelines. Partitions have been placed to ensure people have privacy and are able to enjoy their experience in the same way as before.Following the success of Meals from Marlow, it has now become a permanent charity and is set to provide 30,000+ meals a year to local people. “I know the people of Marlow are a very generous group but I’m astonished by the speed and the level of kindness, says Kerridge. Thank you, Marlow, I’m proud of you.”Colin Steele and Jade Windsor, pub landlords of the Falcon InnColin Steele and Jade Windsor, pictured below, took over the Falcon Inn five months before lockdown, restoring the pub as a community hub at the heart of the village of Fawley, Hampshire. After coronavirus threw a ner in the works, they were eager to reopen last weekend. “We have social distancing, hand sanitisers and a booking system, so our locals get a guaranteed spot,” says Windsor.The couple made the most of the lockdown by revamping the pub, painting the interiors and outside fencing, and putting up a pergola in the garden for some weather protection. “Because of lockdown we had the time to give the garden the love and attention it really needed,” says Steele. “Painting the fence outside has meant that we\u0027ve been able to interact with the village as they walk past. We\u0027ve been trying to bring that community spirit back.” To keep business going, they opened their car park for plant sales and teamed up with local company HMS Spirits to serve takeaway cocktails on Friday nights, which they will continue on weekends throughout the summer. “It kept us doing what we love, says Windsor, and keeping in contact with our customers.” They also recruited a chef with the goal of making back some of the lost income from closure and the now-reduced capacity that allows for distancing. Where they once accommodated 150 inside, now they can host 40. The team have ramped up hygiene measures: doors are wiped every half hour screens at the bar and face shields protect staff. Additional outdoor seating means that everyone is seated, and a new app will enable customers to order food from their tables. “We\u0027re a family-run business and everyone just wants us to succeed,” says Steele.Windsor adds: “I\u0027m sure we will come across a few issues, it’s something that no one\u0027s ever had to deal with before. I want my pub back the way it was more than anyone, but we\u0027ve all got to deal with it together.”Sarah Bentley, owner of The Cutting Room unisex salon As a small village salon that’s been open for 16 years, it’s little wonder that The Cutting Room’s loyal clientele had been keenly anticipating its reopening after temporarily closing back in March.A tight-knit team with great customer relationships, Bentley and her employees were excited to get back to a sense of normality. After a meeting last week, they felt reassured about the safety precautions put in place for their return. “It was a bit of relief coming back from staff training and just seeing everybody’s face light up and looking forward to being back,” she says. “We’ve had Zoom meetings discussing all the guidelines.”The salon may have been closed, but plenty was going on in the background to ensure that the premises and the team were as prepared as possible for a safe reopening.For example, they worked hard to keep customers informed about changes to their haircutting experience: as well as the salon now being appointment-only, clients have been informed that they are not able to enter the premises before their appointment, as well being asked to wear a face covering.“Because we are such a small salon, we have screens up between all our sections,” Bentley explains, adding that their booking and payment system has been made completely contactless.Though refreshments or magazines can no longer be provided, The Cutting Room has set up its outdoor space for clients to sit in a socially-distanced manner.The Cutting Room\u0027s kit used has also changed: “We’ve got disposable gowns, towels – everybody’s got all their completely own equipment it’s all labelled in their name – their own trollies, Bentley adds.Ultimately, safety is The Cutting Room’s number-one priority. “It’s there to keep us and the clients and my staff safe – and if I felt that they weren’t safe, I would shut the salon tomorrow,” Bentley says. “Everybody’s health comes first.Keeping you safe: a selection of guidelines for UK businesses All businesses are required to be Covid-19-secure in order to help protect their staff and customers. Here are some of the guidelines that salons, pubs and restaurants have been provided with:All businesses will have conducted a risk assessmentThorough and enhanced cleaning facilities will be available for staff and customersBookings will be limited to ensure social distancing and risk mitigationCustomers will be provided with guidance prior to their visitWorkers in continuous close contact to clients, such as hairdressers, will wear visors to promote safetyStaff will be split into teams or shift groups where possible to limit contactIndoor and outdoor seating will be reconfigured to maintain social distancing guidelinesStaggering entry times and introducing one-way systems throughout venuesContact between kitchen staff and front of house staff will be minimisedTo find out more about business guidelines, visit gov.ukguidanceworking-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Former IMF chief Christine Lagarde has praised female leaders around the world for their “stunning” response to the coronavirus pandemic, especially when compared to their male counterparts.Ms Lagarde, who now heads the European Central Bank, said the policies adopted by female heads of state were proactive and their communication style was clear.“I would say that for myself I’ve learned that women tend to do a better job,” she said. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe added: “This is my woman’s bias and I indulge in ceding to this bias.”The top 10 worst affected countries are all led by men, both in terms of total number of cases and cases per million people.It is difficult to make a like-for-like comparison without considering factors like health expenditure, tourism and population density. There are also far fewer women in positions of power, with only around 10 per cent of countries having a female leader.A recently released study attempted to factor in these variables, finding that on every metric female-led countries performed better than male-led countries.When comparing countries with similar population sizes, such as Ireland and New Zealand, the researchers found that countries with women in charge experienced far fewer cases.The paper, written by economists Supriya Garikipati and Uma Kambhampati, hypothesised that female-led countries fared better due to qualities shared by female leaders.Previous studies have found that women are more risk averse and favour a style of leadership that is empathetic and science-based.The researchers suggested that these traits meant women leaders are risk averse with regard to lives, but prepared to take significant risks with their economies by locking down early.Prioritising economic outcomes has been one of the reasons for the US not imposing a nationwide lockdown, which has contributed to surging case numbers.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is a small, temporary price for theof greater normality.But we do ask this of Boris Johnson: When can we chuck them away again  How low must infections and deaths fall You need a firm exit plan, PM.  IT should morty the Tories that just one in  crimes now results in a charge.The “law and order” party is presiding over an era in which the public has lost faith in our police and courts.It is the legacy of a decade in which previous Tory Governments saw crime fall year after year and complacently cut police numbers, only to be caught short when offences exploded again.Now they are desperate to recruit , officers. But that will only take us back where we once were and progress towards even that is painfully slow. So is the Royal Commission on justice they have also promised.Cops themselves cannot dodge some of the blame­ — not when Twitter-addict police chiefs ignore burglaries while wasting manpower chasing non-existent offences against wokeness.The overall result of all this is too many victims being denied justice, while others have too little confidence in the justice system even to help cops pursue prosecutions.The Home Office needs rapid solutions.OUR struggling firms should now prepare as best they can for there being no quick free trade deal with the EU.Talks are at a stalemate and we cannot see a solution unless Brussels budges.It still simply refuses to accept Britain as an independent nation with our own economic rules and full sovereignty over our waters, setting limits annually on EU fishing catches.It pretends to respect our repeated pro-Brexit votes, then insists our negotiators must surrender fundamental rights, which would make a nonsense of them.Chief negotiator David Frost has commendably stood firm on the key issues.The EU does not make these demands of other major nations it negotiates deals with.

But no one’s paying the slightest bit of attention.⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesHand sanitiser  That’s what homeless people drink, isn’t it People roar up to me all the time, flinging their arms round my shoulders and asking for a selfie. And they look genuinely perplexed when I ask them politely to back up a bit.At the TV studios where I’m working, there’s a one-way system that’s not being used, electronic ­temper- ature checks that are covered in cobwebs and endless signs telling people to keep apart. Which no one can read because of the huddle they’re in.At breakfast in the hotel where I’m staying, no one’s wearing a mask and in the city’s restaurants it’s business as usual.The only slight change is that because so many are working from home, the girls have plenty of spare time to take off even more clothes than usual before going out.Face masks  Ha. You must be ­joking. They’re not wearing anything at all.The problem is that social distancing simply doesn’t work in the North, where people are naturally friendly. Asking a Manc to scuttle about with his head down and his eyes locked in the straight-ahead position is like asking a fish to tap-dance.They’re also a pretty sensible bunch. Did you know thatsomeone had the virus in March, and was killed last week by falling out of a tree, they are still chalked up as a “Covid death”  Well they do up here. They know that this pandemic is a wave that’s passed.In London and the South East, meanwhile, it’s a very dferent story. There are Covid Nazis at every turn, telling people to keep apart and everyone is happy to oblige.Face masks are everywhere and no one is punctual for their Zoom calls because they’ve just spent two hours washing their hands.There’s a simple reason for this. In London, no one has ever wanted to talk to their neighbour and now they have an excuse.The reaction to Covid is almost tailor-made for the capital. Because all the guidelines are basically giving people permission to do what they’ve always done.“What  No one is allowed to sit next to me on the Tube  Excellent.”On balance, I’ve got to say, I ­prefer it in Manchester.LAST autumn was the wettest for  years. The spring was the hottest and driest ever. And July is on course to be the coldest for  years.It seems that every single day a new weather record is broken, which suggests the climate is changing.Which makes me wonder. Why did no one see this coming Andthey did, why were they so quiet about it Yes, and now he’s the Democratic candidate in this year’s presidential elections.HAVING done Covid- vaccine tests on , ­volunteers, a team of ­British boffins in Oxford has announced that the initial results are “encouraging”.That’s pathetic. “Encouraging” is completely the wrong word. It’s what teachers write on a fat kid’s school report after he’s managed to come second to last in the  metres sack race.The fact is that Oxford is in a fight to develop this vaccine with an American biotech company, and you can be certain Hank won’t ever describe his progress as “encouraging”.He’s already said it’s “robust” and soon he’ll be saying his medicine “kicks ass” and that it’s “hammer time”. Evenit’s causing people’s penises to fall off.The British have always been good at understatement. I once saw survivors being interviewed after a tornado had ripped the heart out of a small town in Oklahoma in the US.The Americans were hysterical, sobbing and saying: “The wind speed was, like, , miles an hour and I saw God himself reach down and take our house.”Whereas a British man, visiting on business, said when the cameras were poked in his face that it had been “a trle breezy”.That was charming, but whoever develops a vaccine will bring billions into the country, so we don’t want charm. We want our scientists to develop an American gung-ho, up-and-at-’em attitude.They can start by dropping this “encouraging” nonsense and describing their results as “awesome”.This seemed odd, because fitting windows to a submarine is as daft as fitting a coffee machine to a duck.I therefore did some checking and it turns out they’re there so that when the sub is on the surface, the crew don’t have to go outside to see where they are going. Which means they won’t get cold.Diddums. And we thought these guys were tough.I’VE often wonderedit’s ­possible to put something into Google search engine and get no results at all.I’ve tried quite often with phrases like “Piers Morgan fans” or “Alicia Vikander ugly tree”.But I’ve never managed it.Well, this week I needed to attach a snow plough to the front of my tractor – don’t ask – and had no idea how it could be done.So I googled “Front linkage Lamborghini .R”.And there it was. “Your search did not match any ­documents”.WE learned this week that there’s been a  per cent surge in the sales of cassette tapes.Couple of points on that. First of all, why  The sound quality on a cassette is so bad that for many years I thought that the Bee Gees had done a song called Bald Headed Woman, that the Police had sung about Sue Lawley and that Desmond Dekker had been saying: “My ears are alight.”Point number two is: what happened to the massive collection of cassettes we all used to have in the Seventies They can’t all have ended up wrapped round single shoes on the motorway’s central reservation.That’ll give me something to do tonight, I guess. Finding all the mixtapes I made for girlfriends who’d just left me, and reliving the sadness to the accompaniment of Phil Collins.DAVID BECKHAM wishes to build a pond in his back garden, which is good news for insects, birds and wildle in general, but apparently it’s not such good news for his neighbours, who say there are already too many ponds in the area so another is not neededToo many ponds  I think what they meant to say is: “We are bitter and so twisted with jealousy that we want to make Mr Beckham’s le as miserable as ours have turned out to be.”OVER the past few years, cigarette sales in Britain have plummeted by million a month.Experts are struggling to understand why there has been such a massive fall and why it happened so quickly.Some say the health warnings are being effective.

He’s not said anything to a soul.”Our source said Portuguese detectives, who have repeatedly clashed with their German counterparts, were privately “relieved”.“The Portuguse officers have made it clear from the start they didn’t believe Christian B was involved,” he added. “He was on the radar at the time and ruled out quickly. It would have been deeply embarrassing had it later turned out that Christian B was indeed the person who took Madeleine.”Christian B, , is currently serving a -month sentence in his home country of Germany for drug offences.The serial sex offender is also facing a separate sentence for the rape of a -year-old American woman on a waterfront villa less than a mile from where Madeleine went missing in Portugal in .Although he was convicted in December , he appealed against his seven-year sentence and so it cannot be imposed until his appeal avenues are exhausted. However, there remains hope that police may be able to bring a case against Christian B.Mr Hofman said: In my view, there is no doubt he was at the scene.“Mobile phone data proves he was by the apartments. Also, his record fits the profile.“I’m sure the prosecutor will pull an ace from up his sleeve and have more than we know so far.”Hans Christian Wolters, the chief prosecutor in the case, has insisted that the Christian B is their man and they can place him at the scene.However, no charges have yet been filed against Christian B, who has a record of sex offences and is now being linked to other missing children.Madeleine is believed to have been snatched from the Ocean Club apartment where she was sleeping alongside her twin siblings Sean and Amelie on May , , in Praia du Luz.Described as a twisted loner, the sex offender is understood to have been a kind of drter around the resort at the time.Christian B was first linked to the Madeleine case after he allegedly made a drunken boast he snatched her while in a bar on the tenth anniversary of the crime.Madeleine would have turned  last month, and the family have described the identication of Christian B as potentially very signicant.Experts have said Christian B matches the profile of a Jimmy Savile-style “paraphiliac”, who targets victims of all ages.His ex-lawyer Serafim Vieira has described him as having psychopathic traits and admitted he could be responsible for Madeleines abduction.Christian B had a rundown and dilapidated shack only two miles away from the McCanns holiday let - and is known to have owned a mobile home he boasted could carry drugs and children.However, a series of bungles in the police investigation have cast doubt over whether prosecutors can secure a conviction.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But just hours later, newly single Meghan declared to a girlfriend: “Do I sound crazy when I say this could have legs ”Pals told authors of the book, serialised in The Times and The Sunday Times, the pair were smitten.The biography, Finding Freedom: Harry and Meghan and the Making of A Modern Royal Family, below, reveals: “‘Almost immediately they were obsessed with each other,’ a friend said. ‘It was asHarry was in a trance’.”Harry and Meghan quickly made plans to meet again just  hours later, this time “for a romantic ­dinner” at the same venue.The book reveals: “No front entrance for the pair. They were given directions for how to get into the building using a discreet door away from prying eyes — and familiar only to staff and delivery trucks bringing in produce and fresh fish from Billingsgate Market. A glamorous start, it was not.”Just the one “trusted” waiter served them and the night ended “chastely” again.But another friend told the biography: “Harry knew they would be together at that point. She was ticking every box fast.”Meghan had also begun to follow Harry’s @SpikeyMau Instagram account, the authors say.A third evening saw Meghan get a cab from her hotel to Kensington Palace in secret, going through the visitors’ entrance. But such low-key meetings were ditched six weeks later when Harry told her to “arrive in London and he would handle the rest”. The prince, , and Meghan, , boarded a flight to Johannesburg the next morning and, after a switch to a ­private plane, arrived in Botswana’s Okavango Delta.The book notes: “They stayed for most of the trip in one of the , -a-night deluxe tents.”Pals tell the book Meghan “came back smiling and just completely spellbound”. They “would have happily spent the entire summer there together”, sources tell the biography.Bombshell book claims include:Scobie and Durand say Meghan told a pal: “I’ve never felt that safe, that close to someone in such a short time.”Their syrupy romance is summed up by another friend, who told the biographers: “Technically the getaway was just their third date but by then they were each already dancing around the idea that this just may be a forever thing.”A series of secret meets followed, with Harry jetting to Canada ­frequently to stay at Meghan’s two-storey Toronto townhouse.“For Meghan,” the book claims, “she was all in”. But pals warned her about getting involved with Harry, pointing out his mother Diana’s treatment at the hands of the Royal Family. In another extract, the biography reveals: “Three months into their relationship, a Meghan friend said they had already begun swapping the words, ‘I love you’.“It was Harry who said it first, but Meghan immediately replied, ‘I love you, too.’“From there it didn’t take long for them to begin talking in non- oblique terms about their future.”The couple went to great s to keep their relationship a secret until October , when news first broke that they were an item.In what now seems like a fateful comment, a royal insider insisted at the time: “Meghan is a very confident and intelligent woman and she’s not overawed mixing with royalty. That’s one of the things Harry admires about her.”Another senior royal allegedly called the Duchess of Sussex “Harry’s showgirl”, with an aide warning she “comes with a lot of baggage”, it is claimed.Despite worldwide coverage, ­stubborn Harry refused to budge from Meghan’s townhouse, where he was staying at the time.Worried aides said it would be best for him tohome, “his minimal security now something of an issue”, the book claims.News of the relationship also led to Harry’s first experience of race-hate trolls targeting Meghan online.Some used the “n-word”, the book says. It goes on: “Harry was incandescent with rage. While it might have been new territory for Harry, bias — both unconscious and intentional — had always been a part of Meghan’s le.”The book also claims Harry and Meghan secretly got engaged in Botswana — months before they officially told the world they would wed. In August , The Sun’s exclusive photos showed them arriving on holiday in Africa.At the time, a royal source told us: “Who knows what will happen when they’re watching a sensational African sunset together  Maybe he’ll get down on one knee.”And yesterday the Sunday Times said Harry’s relationship with his brother began to falter “shortly before” the couple got engaged.The book claims Harry felt ­William acted like a snob over Meghan. The Duke of Cambridge is also said to have referred to Meghan as “this girl” and angered Harry by warning him not to rush into a relationship with the actress.Further details of the Harry and Meghan’s Africa trip are likely to emerge when the book is published on August . In our report at the time we told how Meghan had flown to London from Toronto after filming the last episode of what would be her final series of Suits. Until now the couple have always claimed their engagement took place over a low-key roast chicken dinner in November .But the book is expected to reveal their wedding plans were already a done deal.Quizzed by BBC’s Mishal Husain, Harry claimed: “It happened earlier this month, just a standard typical night.” Meghan replied: “We were just roasting chicken.”Later she added: “It was just an amazing surprise, it was so sweet and natural and very romantic. He got on one knee.” Harry laughed and replied: “Of course!”Meanwhile, William and Kate hit back at the weekend at claims they snubbed Meghan.

Im going to be staying at home this summer.France lamented the situation as cases surge across the continent, saying there has been a clear increase since the lting of lockdown.The health ministry said: We have ed to levels comparable with those at the end of the lockdown period.We have thus erased a good part of the progress made during the initial weeks since the lockdown was lted.Its more essential than ever to reimpose our collective discipline.European nations had been hopeful of reopening after being ravaged by the virus in March and April as the epicenter of the pandemic shted to South America and the US.Back in May, Dr Andrea Ammon, director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control urged EU leaders to prepare for resurgence in coronavirus cases.She warned that a lack of immunity could mean the second wave could be even worse than the first for Europe.The disease expert said that only between two per cent and  per cent of the populations of European countries had been infected with coronavirus.Former Prime Minister Tony Blair also warned the world will have to live with the virus as he called for long-term face mask rules.He said Covid- is not going to be eliminated any time soon and warned of a   chance the virus is going towith a vengeance in the autumn.Prime Minister Boris Johnson has insisted the UK is taking every reasonable step to prepare for a surge in virus cases in the autumn.Mr Johnson has previously described coronavirus as a circling shark in the water as he urged people to take precautions amid fears of a second wave in the UK - with scientists warning it could kill ,.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The proposals include a ban on TV and online adverts until after the pm watershed and an end to buy-one-get-one-free promotions on unhealthy foods. Cafe, takeaway or restaurant chains with more than  staff will be ordered to publish calorie counts on menus while alcoholic drinks will have to display hidden aposliquid caloriesapos.GPs will be encouraged to prescribe cycling as a way for patients to lose weight amid growing evidence that excess weight is associated with a higher risks from coronavirus.The new Better Health campaign will provide advice to around  million Brits, including setting out a -week diet plan to help them lose weight. The plan comes as evidence mounts on the link between excess weight and a higher risk of severe illness from coronavirus. A Public Health Englandstudy published at the weekend discovered that being classed as medically obese increased the risk of death from coronavirus by %. Almost two thirdsof adults in England are overweight or living with obesity, with obesity-related illnesses costing the NHS £ billion a year. A worrying one in three children leave primary school overweight or obese.The highly-interventionist approach marks a major u-turn from Boris Johnson, who until recently has been a vocal opponent of sin taxes and nanny state interventions on public health. The PM, who has lost a stone and a bit in his own brush with the deadly disease, said: “Losing weight is hard but with some small changes we can all feel fitter and healthier. If we all do our bit, we can reduce our health risks and protect ourselves against coronavirus – as well as taking pressure off the NHS.” Research shows that many adults are consuming - extra calories a day above recommended guidelines, with overweight children consuming up to  calories more than needed. The Government plans to consult on whether the junk food ban on online adverts should apply at all times of day. New laws will restrict the promotion of foods high in fat, sugar, such as ‘buy one get one free’ offers - and they will be banned from checkouts and shop entrances. Shops will be encouraged to offer more discounts on healthier food like fruit and vegetables. A second consultation will look at plans to provide calorie labelling on alcohol, which is estimated to account for nearly % of the calorie intake of those who drink.

Disastrously mishandling coronavirus, a world-beating failure in terms of fatality counts and economic impact, is a symptom of a more ­fundamental sickness.

Buy one, get one free promotions on foods high in fat and sugar will end in supermarkets in future under the governmentaposs new obesity crackdown.Yet the announcement comes seven days before a new £m aposEat Out to Help Outapos scheme launches to save restaurants from the impact of coronavirus.The scheme will allow diners to get % off meals, up to £ per head, in participating restaurants on every Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday in August. Care minister Helen Whately was challenged by LBC radio about whether the two schemes were mixed messaging. Told firms like Burger King, McDonaldaposs and Nandoaposs were all taking part, she said: So the Chancellor and the government have taken steps to support the hospitality sector, which we know has been very hard hit by coronavirus, by the lockdown. What we’re saying to the restaurants like Burger King and Nando’s is they need to put the calories for the dferent meals on their menus, so that when you eat out you can make an informed choice. When you’re eating out you can choose what you have and you’ve got the information there to enable you to choose a lower-calorie option. Asked to name a healthy dish from Nando’s she said: “I don’t know the Nandos menu off by heart”. But she added: If you look at the McDonald’s menu, and you can look at this online, you will find that a bigger burger with more patties in it has got far more calories in it than a smaller burger, for instance.  The ban on buy one, get one free offers is one of a string of measures announced today as part of the governmentaposs obesity strategy. There will also be a ban on high-fat, high-sugar items being placed in prominent locations like checkouts and entracnes.

Now, when I hear a new dog is coming into my le I can barely sleep. I am so excited. What will they look like  How will their personality be  What challenges will I need to help them overcome  I’ve always been a dog lover, but was never allowed one when I was growing up in Essex. Then in my late teens, I met a guy who did not like dogs – our relationship lasted  years, so getting a four-legged friend had not been an option. When he and I eventually split in , he moved out of our Gloucestershire cottage, and I thought, ‘Sod it! I’ve only myself to please now.’  It was back in September, soon after the break-up, when I contacted the Dogs Trust and applied to be a foster carer. As a single woman I couldn’t afford to buy a dog, and the beauty of volunteering to foster means that the charity covers the cost of food and anything  you need to buy for the dog while in your care, including any vet bills. Interview stage There were interviews, home visits and paperwork – I passed all the requirements. As a gardener, I can take a dog with me to work most days, so it wouldn’t be left alone, plus I have a garden and live near the Forest of Dean, perfect for walking. And I don’t have children or any other pets to worry about, so I was seen as a good option. From a selfish point of view, I was looking forward to sharing my empty home with someone  again. Another warm body on the sofa next to me.  It was in March, just as coronavirus was sweeping the nation, when Dogs Trust Evesham rang. They had a nine-month-old Collie cross-breed who’d been rescued from dire conditions where  dogs had been kept in a barn. Could I take her in until they found her a permanent home  Melted my heart Well, they brought Athena to my garden and my heart just melted at the first sight of her pretty face. She wasn’t used to human contact, so I didn’t make a huge fuss. I let her snf around my garden as I drank a cup of tea, just watching her. By that first evening she was laying her head in my lap. I had to toilet train her, which involved heaps of praise when she went outside. If she had accidents inside I never told her off, I just quickly cleaned it up. I got through plenty of cleaning products, but after a week she’d got the hang of it. As I busily worked in clients’ gardens, I listened to audiobooks on dog behaviours and training to educate myself. Athena stayed for three and a half weeks before it was time for her to leave to be with her permanent owner. I cried when she left, but felt so happy that I’d been able to help her. Being toilet trained makes a dog far more appealing to adoptees.  Aries came next, a two-year-old cross-breed. He hated the noise of the bin men, all the crashing around and the flashing lights, but quickly learned to walk on the lead. I began chatting to new people on our walks. Having a dog gave my le structure, some company, and – I know this sounds silly – but I felt myself healing after the split, I got healthier and stronger. I would have felt so isolated in lockdown otherwise. How long you have a dog totally depends on how soon they are re-homed, so it can be anything from a few days to several weeks. Joy and fulfilment I really fell in love with Hermes, my next dog. He was also from the same barn, and terried of everything. He freaked out indoors and would scrabble to escape out of a window, then whimper. I would stand outside and keep an eye on him from the window, gradually building up the time he could be left. It was a complete buzz seeing his behaviour change. It was hard kissing Hermes goodbye, he’d become my buddy, but I know my time with him had changed his le prospects. My fourth dog was an adorable, problem-free Maltese puppy, Bea. I’ve never had one try to bite me. The most damage they’ve caused is chewing a wooden coffee table leg, but I am not precious about these things.  I’m having a few days away now, but I can’t wait to welcome a new dog into my le when I’m back. I bumped into my ex the other day and he remarked how happy I seemed now. Who knows, maybe one day I’ll be out walking and meet someone new  But I’m happy being single now, the dogs have brought me more joy and fulfilment than I thought possible. What is dog fostering  ● The Home From Home fostering scheme finds temporary homes for dogs that need a little extra TLC, such as young puppies, older dogs and those who would find the hustle and bustle of kennels stressful. ● Fostering is completely voluntary, and Dogs Trust provides essentials, such as food and bedding, and provides -hour guidance and training advice. ● Adam Clowes, Dogs Trust operations director, says: ‘Being a foster carer gives you all the joy of adopting without the long-term commitment. It’s perfect for dog lovers who aren’t ready to adopt yet. aposJust as importantly, becoming a foster carer means helping fellow dog lovers who have no other choice than to permanently give up their dog. You’ll be giving a dog a loving home when they need it most. Every dog in foster care allows us to take in another dog in need.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"britains biggest family radfords first","story":"NewsBritains biggest family the Radfords on first holiday of  with friendsParents Sue, , and Noel, , shared details of their trip to Scotland and informed their followers theyd visited the KelpiesShareCommentsByDanya BazaraaSenior News Reporter:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsThe family are on a trip to Scotland \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

According to Finding Freedom, the couple were dismayed when no picture of them and their son Archie was visible on the desk in the Green Drawing Room at Buckingham Palace, where the Queen records her annual speech. In , Harry and Meghan appeared in a photo with William and Kate as the Queen read her Christmas message. Authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand write that Harry and Meghan felt they had long been sidelined by the institution and were not a fundamental part of its future. The absence of their photo was yet another sign that they needed to consider their own path, the book says. According to palace sources quoted in the book, the Royal Family wanted to illustrate the line of succession. Harry and Meghan were not completely disregarded in the Christmas Day speech, however. Footage of the Queen and Prince Philip meeting Archie for the first time was included, with footage showing Harry, Meghan and Meghan’s mum, Doria Ragland, watching on. I have been delighted to welcome our eighth great-grandchild, the Queen said at the time.  In the Queenaposs  Christmas Day speech, Her Majesty can be seen sitting in the Green Drawing Room of the palace beside a table with framed pictures. Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall appear in a photo which marked the th anniversary of his investiture as Prince of Wales. A lovely family portrait of William, Kate, George, Charlotte and Louis stands in the middle. Thereaposs also a photograph of King George VI from  as well as one of the Duke of Edinburgh from the Queenaposs private collection. But notably, Harry, Meghan and their son Archie are no where to be seen. Royal commentator Ingrid Seward said at the time it was unlikely the Queen’s photo selections represented a deliberate snub to Harry and Meghan. But she said: “It does seem to represent the idea of a slimmed-down monarchy.” Ms Seward added: “All the media problems with Harry and Meghan must have worried her. However, she would never be so underhand as to deliberately omit their picture.” Prince Andrew, forced to quit royal duties over his aposcar crashapos Newsnight interview over his ­friendship with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, was also absent from the photos.As the Queenaposs Christmas Day speech was aired to millions across the world, Meghan and Harry were spending the Christmas break in Canada with their young son."},{"url":null,"title":"meghan harry were obsessed each","story":"NewsMeghan and Harrys romantic first dates where they were so obsessed they forgot to eatWhile Meghan Markle visited London in  and posted arty snaps to her Instagram and blog, she also found time for a very exclusive first date with Harry where the couple spoke about their \"passions for wanting to make change for good\" over cocktailsShareCommentsByAbigail OLeary:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsMeghan and Harry announcing their engagement in a televised interview in  \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand wrote that there was no goodbye kiss, no expectation, just a hint something was there and they hoped to see each other again soon. Both Meghan and Harry were said to have confided in friends about their feelings, with Harry telling friends he had to aposup his gameapos and sit down and make sure Iaposve got good chat.Meanwhile Meghan, who was fresh out of a two-year relationship, reportedly told friends she thought the relationship could have legs and asked palsshe apossounded crazyapos.

Just three months into their relationship Harry told Meghan that he loved her. Thankfully for the bowled over monarch Meghan immediately ed the compliment.

The gesture came amid mounting speculation that the women had become the “duelling duchesses” as relations between them were so frosty.While palace aides briefed royal reporters that Prince Harry ’s we Meghan and Prince William’s we Kate were in contact by phone and text, they were unable to disguise the fact that they were far from close.Kate’s attempt to build bridges, reported in Vanity Fair, was not mentioned in Finding Freedom, the book about the royals by Meghan’s pal Omid Scobie, and Carolyn Durand. It does say that Meghan got flowers from Kate for her birthday. But it adds: “Flowers for her birthday were nice, but Meghan would far rather have had Kate check in on her during the most dficult times.” Friends of Kate and William have hit out at the book, describing claims the Cambridges snubbed Meghan as “plain wrong”. The book says: “Meghan was disappointed that she and Kate hadn’t bonded over the position they shared, but she wasn’t losing sleep over it. According to a source, Kate felt they didn’t have much in common ‘other than the fact that they lived at Kensington Palace’.” The book also claims Prince Harry, , was “p***ed off” when his “snobby” brother William, , cautioned him not to rush into marrying “that girl”. Pals say the Cambridges had “done all they possibly could” to welcome actress Meghan, , into the royal fold.  They insist the couple “rolled out the red carpet” and “welcomed Meghan with open arms”. Meghan was invited to Anmer Hall, the Cambridges’ family home in Norfolk, where Kate, , cooked vegan meals for Harry’s then-fiancee. They also hosted Meghan’s bridal party before her wedding in May , and Kate asked her to join her in the Royal Box at Wimbledon for two successive years. A friend told a Sunday newspaper: “It’s just completely wrong to suggest they didn’t talk and plain wrong to say the Cambridges weren’t welcoming. “How can you say they weren’t warm or welcoming when they hosted Meghan for Christmas, invited her into their totally private inner sanctum at Anmer Hall and did everything they could to make her feel at home  They personally cooked her favourite vegan food, they couldn’t have been more welcoming.”  Scobie and Durand claim in the book that Meghan was subjected to several snubs by Kate. They recall an awkward moment when they crossed paths at Kensington Palace, heading out to the same street to shop. Kate jumped into her Range Rover and left Meghan to go shopping alone. The book also accuses Kate of ignoring her sister-in-law at Meghan and Harry’s farewell as senior royals. The book claims the couples hardly spoke at the Commonwealth Service at Westminster Abbey this March. Harry and Meghan had walked ahead of the main royal party, including William and Kate, after being removed from the prime line-up. A friend of Harry and Meghan said: “It felt intentional. Harry was more than disappointed. He spoke up, but the damage had already been done.”  In an interview, Scobie said that during the service, “Meghan tried to make eye contact with Kate, but the Duchess barely acknowledged her. To purposefully snub your sister-in-law. I don’t think it left a great taste.” During a polo match in July , Meghan and Kate were described as having a “cordial but distant rapport”. It was the first time the Cambridges and Sussexes had been seen together as families since the birth of Harry and Meghan’s son Archie that May. The book says: “While the doting mothers were photographed next to each other with their children, the two appeared to barely exchange a word. “The truth was Meghan and Kate just didn’t know each other that well.” Scobie, described as a “Meghan apostle”, and Durand dismiss rumours that Meghan made Kate cry during a bridesmaid’s dress fitting for Princess Charlotte. A source who was allegedly at the fitting said: “Some of the ­children weren’t co-operating. There were no tears from anyone. Kate and Meghan were both a little stressed but professional in the room.” The book, being serialised in the Times and Sunday Times, also says reports of Meghan shouting at a member of Kate’s team were also untrue. The story allegedly related to Kensington Palace deputy communications secretary Katrina McKeever, who left her post in September .

Rachel Riley is one of the famous faces backing the awards, which will for the first time recognise the amazing work of iniduals from National Lottery-funded projects across the nation.  Rachel says: “Thanks to National Lot­­tery players, some £million has gone to support communities in the crisis. “But this year we want to honour the people within those projects who adapted so quickly and gave extra help. “It’s a real chance to say thank you. The winners in each category will win £, for their organisation and a National Lottery Award trophy.” Nominations are open- and the stories of some of the heroes already put forward showcase the commitment and sacrice so many people have been making during these troubled times.  Take actress and theatre director Moji Elufowoju, the founder of Sheffield-based Utopia Theatre Company. She has just been nominated for a National Lottery Award, thanks to the incredible Creative Hub initiative she has been running during lockdown. Now , Moji swapped a career as a paralegal to study drama in her forties before founding Utopia Theatre in . And as a British-born, Nigerian-raised performer, Moji says she had to battle discrimination in an industry where ethnic minorities have struggled for opportunities. She broke through after “continually banging my head against a brick wall and refusing to take no for an answer”. She is now determined to inspire a new generation of black artists.  “There’s a white middle-class club in British theatre and it can make the industry inaccessible to others – whether that’s performing, playwriting or simply being in the audience,” says Moji. “You can feel invisible, and I know a lot of black creatives with mental health issues as a result. “Utopia Theatre is all about giving erse people a voice. We showcase African culture and traditions, through classic plays and new material.” Last month, Utopia Theatre launched the Creative Hub, a free six-month programme of virtual workshops to combat the devastating effects of lockdown on the profession.

But the timing of his youngest sonaposs statement, in which Harry accused the media of racial undertones at the same time as confirming his new relationship, meant it dominated the news cycle. Royal authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand also claim Harry, , gave his dad just  minutes notice before releasing the statement in November . At the time, Charles was rounding off a delicate tour in the Persian Gulf sovereign state which he hoped would be covered signicantly. Finding Freedom: Harry and Meghan and the Making of a Modern Royal Family: It was a critical moment that had been in the works for months. A statement from Kensington Palace condemning the Press and, in the same breath, confirming Harry’s new girlfriend would all but eliminate coverage of Prince Charles’s tour of the Gulf. Royal authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand claim: “The team at Clarence House, which had spent months putting together Prince Charles’ tour in the hopes that it would be covered signicantly, was crushed.” The book goes on to say Harry was lashing out at anyone who questioned his new relationship. “He would wonder, ‘Is this about race  Is it snobbery ’ the authors wrote.  Harry had allegedly cut ties with a friend for gossiping about Meghan and was poised for an outright war with the media. However, the book insists Charles understood that the situation with Meghan had reached a tipping point despite being disappointed by the timing of his sonaposs statement. Other extracts from the book - to be released August  - claim Harry felt brother William behaved like a snob as his new romance blossomed.  The authors says the protective older brother told the Duke of Sussex not to rush the relationship in a heart-to-heart nine months after he began dating US actress Meghan. He is said to have told his brother: Donapost feel you need to rush this. Take as much time as you need to get to know this girl. Harry was reportedly left fuming by Williamaposs choice of words, and the pair hardly spoke for months afterwards.

BBC forecaster Louise Lear said C is expected in London on Friday - the first time the temperature has gone above the s this month and weaposll have to wait until the final day. This yearaposs July has been a far cry from  when July  saw .C in Cambridge. And the meteorologist warned the extreme heat is not going to stay with us with no signs of anything settled, warm and sunny for the start of August. She said the second half of the weekend will be a bit more comfortable as temperatures dip but there will be ato wetter weather into the northwest. And into next week it looks like that gear change is set to continue with low pressure moving in from the Atlantic, a westerly feed set to dominate.  One low clears away only to be replaced by yet another. In the meantime, Monday is set for heavy rain in Wales and northern England, as well as some pretty gusty winds. Gales could reach as high as mph in the south west and while central and southern regions should avoid the worst of it the weather will still feel a bit disappointing under the cloud, the rain, the wind direction. Twenty-one degrees is possible in parts of the south, but the excessive winds are quite unusual for the latter stages of July, added Ms Lear.  The weather is expected to quieten down on Tuesday but temperatures will remain down on where they should be for the time of year. But from Wednesday, high pressure will start to settle in, with temperatures peaking at C while on Thursday weaposll really start to see the signs of change. Southerly winds will allow temperatures to hit highs of C by the afternoon and that southerly wind will remain into the weekend.

The woman was booted off the American Airlines flight travelling from Ohio to North Carolina on July . Video footage taken by passenger Jordan Slade and shared on social media shows the moment the woman made her way off the plane. After the woman picked up her three bags and started to exit the aircraft, other passengers began to cheer and clap. The woman angrily turned around and shouted: You can clap all you want. A passenger responded by saying: Just leave. We have flights to get. Jesus.  All adult passengers travelling on American Airlines flights are required to wear a face covering due to the coronavirus pandmic.Ms Slade said the woman claimed she wasnapost wearing a mask because of a medical condition.The witness told the Daily Mail: She was argumentative from the gate. She demanded to be boarded first and was causing an obvious scene. Once boarded she was making phone calls and arguing with the attendant when asked to put her phone away. Ms Slade added: She also refused to wear a mask putting others on the flight at risk... Another passenger even got up to confront her about her behavior with no mask. A number of passengers reportedly spoke to flight attendants on the plane to voice concerns that they may miss their connecting flights. The incident took up so much time that after the woman was kicked off the flight the plane had to go back to the airport to refuel.    Ms Slade uploaded the video of passengers clapping and cheering the woman, branded a aposKarenapos, off the flight to Tik Tok, where it has been watched hundreds of thousands of times. Currently, more than , people have liked the video.  Clapping was % necessary, one person commented. Another said: The person beside her was literally wearing a mask and a face shield. If you canapost wear a mask on the plane then just drive wherever you need to go.The video was also shared on Twitter, where a number of users were quick to slam the woman.One said: Why the hell would someone pay for a flight and then forfeit their seat because they’re too stubborn to wear a mask  Why bother buying a ticket  How long was this flight  Surely it couldnapost be more than a few hours  Crazy. Another added: FANTASTIC! She had a choice - wear the mask or get off the plane - she made her choice to be selfish and self centered and not wear a mask for the safety of others on the plane - good riddance!  From July , American Airlines will require all customers over the age of two to wear face coverings on board planes and at airports. The company said passengers must keep their masks on from the time they enter their departure airport to the time they exit their arrival airport, except for while eating or drinking. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention one of the best ways we can slow the spread of Covid- is to wear a face covering, said Alison Taylor, chief customer officer of American Airlines.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAvril Lockhart from Cairnbaan sent us this week#s photograph.Taken at Bellanoch, the photo shows the bike that Avril, as a key worker, has been lent by Alec Ohnstad of the Ardrishaig Bothy.

However, there are still numerous restrictions in place, including no operation of locks and bridges, limited services and limited staff available on the ground. This remains the position.#We are, however, pleased to let you know that Scottish Canals is planning to re-open canals to navigation in line with the announcement that Scotland’s tourism sector is preparing to reopen during phase three of the Scottish Government route map on July .

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future. It has taken a national emergency to get the government to acknowledge that it needs our compliance and, for that, must give us the information we need.Suddenly the choices we make are seen as vitally important, and we have a part to play in achieving success for ourselves and our community. Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary. In this pandemic Nicola Sturgeon has said that we have behaved in a way that saved lives and protected the NHS.When this is over we could be at the beginning of another le-altering journey.It will demand a huge sht in expectations. There is an amazing bias in society towards the idea of decrepitude and dependency in old age, when in fact encouraging dependency increases a slide into that very state. During past months many of these attitudes have been exposed and caused outrage but they are long standing and deep seated.If you have been trying to escape into fiction you might have no better idea of what is possible.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them. And many will have seen footage of the animals and creatures that tentatively stepped into urban settings whilst humankind remained under lockdown.But that is changing as we ease back into a new normality.Economics and peoples’ livelihoods are, of course, firmly entwined with modern day living, human survival and wellbeing it is extremely important that we find a route to recovery and many are suffering deeply. But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry.

Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

Instead, they were directed at some national policies and how they impacted on rural development.Argyll and Bute Council had been #more than helpful# to local businesses in the recovery from lockdown, the company added.Mr MacLeod also suggested Scottish Water should be encouraged to allow small developments to be served by inidual septic tanks or bio-discs.In addition, the provision of water and electricity to remote rural locations should be subsidised by the Scottish Government, he added, which would help make projects more affordable.Furthermore, the cost of #impact studies,# should not fall on the developer, he said.Another issue was the requirement of registered social landlords that housing is built to extremely high specications, he said.Mr MacLeod said: #That high standard does, of course, ensure that the houses are well insulated and easily maintained. The standard, however, drives costs up dramatically and can make small, rural developments unaffordable.Careful planning of the specication could reduce building costs but still produce warm, highly insulated and comfortable homes.#While there is Scottish Government funding for affordable housing and funding through the Highlands and Islands Enterprise Agency for workshop units, there is no funding for #combined# units which incorporate a home and a workspace.This would allow young entrepreneurs to acquire a starter home or a home worker to relocate.Argyll and Bute Council has one of the highest approval rates for new planning applications in Scotland.It said: #Masterplans are rarely implemented in Argyll and Bute but they are used occasionally to enable the partial development of larger areas of land.#Infrastructure costs make up a signicant proportion of the cost of new build housing particularly in smaller scale developments.#"},{"url":null,"title":"five-instagram-worthy-views-scotland","story":"THIS week marked the reopening of Scotlands tourism industry.After months of uncertainty during the coronavirus lockdown, our countrys hotels, pubs, restaurants and other sectors reopen - with the virus suppressed to low levels acoss Scotland.To mark the news, weve pulled together five of the best on a range of topics.Here arefive of the best views in Scotland:Scottrsquos View, theBordersTake the B road from St Boswells to Kelso, following the signs for Dryburgh Abbey, and then turn onto the B to reach what is said to be Sir Walter Scottrsquos favourite view.A panorama of the River Tweed and the Eildon Hills, the latter a volcanic remnant that was once both home to ancient Romans and Iron Age people, itrsquos a vision that offers an impressive welcome to Scotland.However, Pete Irvine, of Scotland the Best fame, maintains that there is a better view across the road and up the hill, one that takes in the ldquofull panorama from the Cheviots to the Lammermuirs.You could always take in both, of course.Queenrsquos View, PerthshireHead along the B westwards from Pitlochry to get to the Queenrsquos View, which offers an impressive vista of Loch Tummel and beyond to Schiehallion.Queen Victoria was a fan, although, despite what she believed, informed sources suggest the viewpoint is, in fact, named not after her, but for Isabella, the first we of Robert the Bruce.\" alt\"Border : Queens View \" class\"editor-image\"Queens View In any case, you donrsquot have to be a royal to enjoy the panorama, and, as it is located on the eastern edge of the Tay Forest park, there are plenty of woodland walks to enjoy once yoursquove had enough of the visual splendour.Dunnet Head, CaithnessJohn OrsquoGroats might get all the attention, but Dunnet Head, at the end of the B, is the most northernmost point of mainland Scotland.As an added bonus, it has its own lighthouse and plenty of opportunities for birdwatchers as its part of a RSPB reserve.Weather permitting, you can look out to Stroma, Hoy and the Orkney mainland on a good day.And the sea clfs arenrsquot bad either.

An MOT test will check the general condition of a tyre as well as the amount of tread it has, so its important to give them a thorough looking over. Make sure theyre inflated to the correct pressure too.The legal minimum tyre tread depth in the UK is .mm throughout a continuous band in the middle of the tyre. Tread gauges are the best way to check the depth, but you can use a p piece too - put the coin into a groove and the outer rim of the p piece is obscured, the tyre has enough tread. If you can see the outer rim, its definitely time for some new rubber.NUMBER PLATEIt can be easy to forget to check the number plate, but its an area which is checked during the test. Ensure its the right colour and that its fully legible too. It must also be the right size, too.HEADLIGHTS AND INDICATORSHeadlights and indicators are crucial to remaining safe on the road, which is why theyre a key part of the MOT test. Ensure theyre all working, and dont forget to test the hazard lights too!BRAKE LIGHTSIf you want to let people know that youre slowing down, then brake lights are a key - and legal - must. One of the easiest ways to check them over is to reverse up to a reflective surface - such as a window or shiny garage door - then press the brake pedal and check in the rear-view mirror to ensure theyre working.SEATS AND SEAT BELTSFront seats should have a good range of motion, so slide them forward and back to make sure everything is moving freely and easily. Seat belts should be checked over properly too pull them in and out to check theyre operating correctly and give them a sharp tug as well to make sure that they react as they should doa crash were to occur.HORNWhile youre inside the car, test out the horn and make sure it works - this is something that testers will check straight away.SCREENWASHThe majority of the checks on this list are easy to work out, but checking the screenwash is something that many people forget to do. An MOT centre can fail a cartheres not enough screenwash in the bottle ndash so its crucial that you check to see its filled to the proper level.WINDSCREENAnd while were on the subject of being able to see out of a car properly, its a good time to check over the windscreen. Any damage larger than mm will result in a fail, so look out for any stone chips or cracks.WINDSCREEN WIPERSWhile youre checking over the windscreen, give the wipers a thorough look too. They should be able to effectively clear the screen, leaving no streaks or making a rubbing noise. If thats the case, replace them ndash its a two-minute job on the vast majority of cars.ENGINE FLUIDS AND LEVELSIts best to make sure your car has plenty of fuel in the tank before you put it into its MOT, and its possible that you could be turned away from the test centreit doesnt have enough petrol or diesel. The same goes for engine oil ndash so check the levels of this are correct too."},{"url":null,"title":"absolutely-vital-shop-local-save-high-streets","story":"The Scotland Loves Local campaign has launched across the country to encourage Scots to go back to their roots, think local first and support their local high streets safely and in line with public healthguidelines.The Coronaviruspandemic has hit high streets and local businesses hard - now is the time to support them to get back on their feet.

There are a lot of young people for whom the real world is more amazing than anything you could make up.\"Again, thats another thing were born with that gets beaten out of us, and we start using the word ordinary ndash and theres nothing ordinary.\"Were surrounded by magic. You think Harry Potters magic  Just look around you.\"That curiosity is our biggest asset because thats how we learn to adapt, thats how we learn to survive, thats how we learn to cope with the world around us as it changes.\"Lloyd, who previously worked as a Sunday Timesjournalist, was inspired to begin a career as a childrens author after seeing the joy his children experienced when they learnt new things during their years in home-schooling.Particularly that of one of his daughters who was astonished to learn all about Antarctica ndash home of her then favourite animal, the penguin.\"I believe fundamentally, especially now having done thousands of talks in schools and festivals over the last  years, that humans generally reach peak curiosity at the age of nine or ,\" Lloyd said.\"Then things start to get in the way, like puberty and your friendship groups change and going from primary to secondary school.\"But at the age of nine or  youve got that purity of curiosity where youre old enough to know that you have an identity and youre curious enough to want to know where you fit in.\"Theres nothing you cant talk to a nine or -year-old about ndash provided you dont patronise them, provided you dont have an expectation of them that they cant meet.\"If you can meet them as fellow kindred spirits on this rock travelling around the sun, in this incredible galaxy, and here we are, face to face, learning about it and discovering things together, then there is nothing more inspiring than engaging with a nine or -year-old.\"Chris Lloyds Humanimalbook event will be

consulted with DF groups and worked closely with new partners such as Alzheimer Scotland.A portfolio showcasing the initiative was created and sent to Paths for All, which awarded Ageing Well the accreditation for Dementia FriendlyWalking, which could be rolled out across East Lothian subject to volunteer training.Parvine, who is based at Meadowmill Sports Centre, near Tranent, said: ldquoOver the past year, Ageing Well has been working very hard on the new project. We already run  health walks in East Lothian.ldquoTo make our walks even more inclusive, we wanted to ensure everyone and anyone could access them.ldquoWe have now been awarded our accreditation. This is such a great achievement for the Ageing Well project.She added: ldquoThe accreditation is a way of recognising the work of the Walking for Health projects that have made changes to support people, who are living well in the community with dementia, to engage in walking. The DF project team at Paths For All gave guidance and support to me throughout the year. The walks can now be classed as DF and will be continuing once this crisis has passed.ldquoI just want to say a massive thank you to everyone who has supported this project, especially the walk leaders. We could not have done this without them.ldquoIt has been a busy year but the hard work has paid off.ldquoAlthough our health walks may not be operating at the moment, I hope people are able to find some time to enjoy a walk close to home.Parvine said it was also hoped to introduce health walks for East Lothian residents with cancer as part of the Macmillan Move More Scotland programme after the Covid- crisis.She has also been working in partnership with CHANGES, a Musselburgh-based community health project, as the two organisations run similar walking programmes.They are hoping to launch dementia-friendly buddy walks across the county in the future. These would offer people who donrsquot like the thought of walking in a big group another option."},{"url":null,"title":"5-000-raised-annual-christian-aid-collection","story":"Christian Aid Week, which took place in May, saw Haddingtonrsquos churches coming together in a bid to raise money for the global charity.However, where usually that would mean door-to-door collections, the collectors were faced with a new challenge as coronavirus restrictions saw the campaign move online.John Weierter, from Haddingtonrsquos Christian Aid group, said: ldquoNationally Christian Aid built an interactive site with streamed worship and ious other activities.ldquoLocally we set up a JustGiving page for the Haddington churches and made arrangements to receive cheques posted directly to Janet Chrystal of St Maryrsquos, or to Graham Coe of the West Church.ldquoWe then had to wait with bated breath for our faithful supporters to come to us instead of us going out to them.\"We neednrsquot have worried ndash pound, in cheques cash was sent to our local collectors, pound, was raised via our JustGiving page and we received an incredibly generous cheque for pound, from the Church of Christ in Haddington, who had sold their buildings and were dispersing their funds.\"They requested the money be used lsquoto help the poor and preach the Gospelrsquo and this is surely what will happen.That took the total to pound,.The grouprsquos JustGiving page remains open until tomorrowand can be accessed via justgiving fundraising haddingtonchurchescagroup"},{"url":null,"title":"margiotta-looking-expand-across-east-lothian","story":"Applying for a change of name for the former Londis Aberlady Village Store and opening hours, an agent for the new owners revealed it was just the first of a number of new ventures planned for the county.Alistair Macdonald, representing JELCM Ltd, which took over the store, said that while the company name might be unfamiliar to East Lothian Licensing Board members, the new shop name would not be.He said: ldquoJELCM is a new company set up by the Margiotta family who are a well-known retail family in Edinburgh.

Tuesday that, as part of ious measures inNorth Berwick to provide extra space for physical distancing to protect public health and suppress a resurgence of Covid-, including widening pavements at the east end of High Street, it would be ldquoconverting part of Elcho Green to a temporary car park to support access to the High Street area.It stated that ldquofollowing a meeting with local traders, North Berwick CommunityCouncil and North Berwick Coastal Area Partnership, agreement has been reached to introduce a number of temporary measures in the town ndash but both the community council and area partnership told the Courier they had not given backing to the Elcho Green changes.The councilrsquos own timetable had Elcho Green car park opening last Friday .An online petition, West Bay not Parking Bay, to ldquoprotect stunning and iconic West Bay in North Berwick, was launched by resident Sarah Russell and had attracted more than , signatures in less than a week.It said: ldquoEast Lothian Council have announced plans to turn Elcho Green into a longstay car park.ldquoWhilst the council state that this is a temporary measure to comply with their Covid Spaces for People initiative, it is greatly feared that this will, in fact, lead to a permanent car park in the most iconic seafront location in East Lothian.\"North Berwick residents and visitors alike will be robbed of the very essence of this beautul recreational space that personies this famous conservation area seafront.ldquoTemporary or otherwise, Elcho Green is not the correct location for any car parking and we would urge you to help us stop this environmental catastrophe.Among those supporting the campaign was world-famous golfer and North Berwick resident Catriona Matthew, captain of Europersquos winning Solheim Cup team.The Courier has been swamped with letters and emails against the plans .The scheme was described as ldquoindefensible and ldquoundemocratic vandalism by some residents, while many asked why there had not been specic consultation on the plan and highlighted that the land had been gted to the town by the late Sir Hew Hamilton-Dalrymple for recreational use in .On Monday, East Lothian Council released a statement that it was placing the ldquoElcho Green temporary car parking proposal on hold to allow us a further opportunity to engage and consult.It is the second time in a month that the councilrsquos plans to transform town centres have hit the buffers.Earlier in July, proposals to suspend parking in town centres were put ldquoon hold after traders and residents in Haddington reacted with anger as cones and parking suspension signs were put up overnight, sparking widespread concern.In Mondayrsquos statement, Councillor Norman Hampshire , environment spokesperson, said: ldquoEast Lothian Council has successfully implemented a number of physical distancing measures on North Berwick High Street to support the need for safe access to the town centre and economic recovery.ldquoA further support for Spaces for People was a proposal to utilise a small part of Elcho Green in North Berwick as a temporary car park.ldquoThe benefit of this would have been a reduction in the number of vehicles circling and queuing for parking spaces, enhanced safety for pedestrians and cyclists within the town centre, and improved air quality.ldquoEast Lothian Council is a listening authority and we are aware of the ious perspectives being raised within the North Berwick community.ldquoAs such, we intend to place the Elcho Green temporary car parking proposal on hold to allow us a further opportunity to engage and consult.\"This delay will also enable us to monitor the impact of increased traffic as a result of visitors and to assess the effectiveness of measures introduced.Councillor Stuart Currie, SNP Group leader, said that recent u-turns were down to a ldquolack of political leadership within the Labour administration.He said he received more than  emails objecting to the Elcho Green plans.He called for a report on the Spaces for People plans, and in particular parking proposals in North Berwick, to be put before a meeting of elected council group leaders in two weeksrsquo time for approval.Under emergency Covid- procedures, normal council business is currently suspended and decisions are taken at monthly meetings of the group leaders and council chief executive.He said: ldquoThe decision must be approved by councillors at the leadersrsquo group meeting and it should be open and transparent and open to the press.Mr Hampshire accused Mr Currie of ldquoplaying politics in ldquoan emergency situation.ldquoWe have allowed him to take part in the meetings with officers at every point during the discussions, said Mr Hampshire.ldquoI have got to say the Conservative Group have been fully behind what we are doing.\"For the SNP to try to play politics in a situation where their own Government is instructing local authorities to create spaces in town centres is unbelievable.Conservative councillor Craig Hoy called on the administration to ldquotake notice of the recent problems caused by parking proposals.He said the Scottish Government had failed to give councils enough time to push through emergency Covid measures in town centres.Councillor Hoy said: \"Scottish Councils are operating under huge pressure with limited resources, but that does not remove the need for them to consult fully and communicate clearly on big issues which impact our communities.\"I hope East Lothian Council and the Labour administration will take notice of the recent problems in North Berwick and fully engage with stakeholders.\"Hilary Smith, chair of North Berwick Coastal Area Partnership, stressed that the area partnership had not attended any meeting regarding Covid- plans for the town or given its approval to the plans.North Berwick Community Council said it had not discussed Elcho Green prior to its meeting on Tuesday.East Lothian Council received pound.million from Scottish Government funding for Spaces for People projects to make social distancing easier in town centres and encourage people

area.But North Berwick residents have not been asked their specic views on Elcho Green car parking.The council said it had given consideration to parking availability at a number of sites in North Berwick.In response to questions from the Courier, the council said: ldquoThe high school and sports centre are both due to re-open in coming weeks so were unsuitable to use.ldquoAn area of Elcho Green is considered suitable to take traffic arriving from the west to park for people visiting the town to intercept the flow of traffic and stop vehicles circulating through the town unnecessarily searching for parking spaces and generating additional traffic pollution.ldquoIt also seemed reasonable considering the area of land is used annually for Fringe by the Sea events.\"A maximum of

In this monthly column, she shares her wildle diary ndash and pictures!DURING lockdown, I was trying to make the most of my free time ndash going on daily walks, working on my website, editing photos from before lockdown, designing my first book and completing A LOT of jigsaws .After the lockdown restrictions started to ease, I was able to spend even more time outdoors than I would normally do. I dedicated June to visiting dferent local sites to watch the kingfisher ndash which you may remember from my previous article ndash a family of wrens and the brown hares.One evening, as I was uploading my photographs on to social media and searching through the pages, I came across a few images of a bird that every birder wanted to see since its influx to the UK was published. It was a rosy starling!The beautul rosy starlinglooks nothing like the starlings we know. It strongly resembles a magpiewith a much shorter tail.This species is unmistakable in its adult plumage. The male has a pale pink body with a black head, wings, and tail. Additionally, during the breeding season the male develops a wispy crest and the black colour becomes glossier with a purplish green or blue sheen.The female is less vibrant than the male. Both sexes appear much duller outside of their breeding season.Furthermore, the rosy starling does not mimic other species, unlike its well-known cousin.What the two species have in common is murmuration ndash an astonishing and mesmerising aerial spectacle large flocks of these birds gather and perform a real show as they swoop, e and swirl across the sky in beautul shape-shting clouds. It is a phenomenon that pleases the eye of every observer.The rosy starlingrsquos breeding area stretches from the Balkans and Turkey to Central Asia and north-west China. It spends winters in India and south-east Arabia. As a strongly migratory species, it can travel outside of its normal breeding range. As a result, there are signicant periodic summer and autumn influxes in western Europe. The causes of such irruptions are not yet fully understood however, it appears to be related to changes in the population of locusts on which the birds feed.Imagine my amazement when I read that one of those birds had landed and made its temporary home in someonersquos garden in Port Seton!The cherry on the cake was that the night when I saw the first images of the rosy starling in East Lothian, I also received an email from Stuart Payne ndash the lucky host of the rosy starling. Stuart invited me to his garden.The next morning, my fianceacute Chris and I rushed to Port Seton. As we were walking towards Stuartrsquos house, we saw another birder looking around hoping to spot the rosy starling. As soon as we arrived at Stuartrsquos house, I saw this magnicent pink bird flying past the house and landing on the bird feeder to start its feast.Stuart and his we Gillian welcomed us in their garden, where I spent half an hour photographing the gorgeous rosy starling and chatting to Stuart and Gillian. I also took some time to admire their beautul dogs Hugo and Hobbes. These dogs were just wonderful, not every day you see dogs as well behaved as these two!My first and, I hope, not last experience with the rosy starling was unforgettable!

make it easier to social distance in town centres and improve cycle and pedestrian paths.And it has revealed that the next phase of work will involve establishing a temporary cycle lane between Prestonpans and Cockenzie, along the main road.It will also see the speed limit on the road, which is normally mph, reduced to mph and speed limits in the twocommunities reduced to just mph.The council has already received two strikes over its ambitious plans to transform its town centres this month, with u-turns made twice on projects.At the start of July it unveiled its plans, which included introducing parking suspensions across town centres as it looked to create more space outside shops and relocate parking away from high streets.In Haddington town centre there was a furious response after cones and parking suspension notices went up over the first weekend of the changes, leaving traders and their customers fuming.Shop owners who had only just opened their doors feared the restrictions would stop costumers fromcoming to the market town and within days the council announced it was putting parking suspensions in all town centres on hold.Then last week, it announced plans to transform tourist hotspot North Berwickrsquos town centre and create a temporary -space car park on its iconic Elcho Green ndash a much-loved publicspace and putting green.The response from the community, including Solheim Cup captain Catriona Matthew, who voiced concern at losing green space like the Green, saw those plans also shelved as the local authority insisted it was a ldquolistening council and would carry out further consultation.The latest plan for a three-metre-wide cycle lane between Prestonpans and Cockenziewill see dozens of painted stones created by local schoolchildren, which line the footpath, moved however, the council said it has agreed with the local community council for them to be collected and relocated across he road.Councillor Norman Hampshire, environment spokesperson, said: ldquoWe received many comments in the public consultation around Spaces for People on the need to provide suitable space for people cycling.ldquoMany people are currently cycling this route and we need to cater for the current increase in cyclists during the Covid- pandemic period.ldquoIn common with other Spaces for People measures, this route is for temporary use as we gradually move out of restrictions and will also provide a viable alternative to the use of the private car and or public transport for shorter-distanced essential or leisure trips in the area.The works will also include the introduction of temporary crossings of Edinburgh Road at either end of the route through the use of lsquobuildoutsrsquo and bolt-down bollards.MrHampshire added: ldquoWe were aware of a collection of painted stones that have been carefully laid by local schoolchildren alongside the existing footway along Edinburgh Road and recognise that these are important to the local community.ldquoThe community council has arranged for these to be carefully collected prior to the start of the works and have been relocated on the other side of the road."},{"url":null,"title":"column-job-figures-worrying","story":"Furloughing has worked but unemployment is creeping up.Keeping folk in work and creating new jobs through investment in necessary

It is a fantastic museum and project that tells the story of the arearsquos extensive industrial history, including of the Tranent-Cockenzie Waggonway, built in  and associated with the coal and salt industries.Nearby sits Cockenzie House, a mansion and gardens dating from the th century. It is now home to a brilliant wee cafe and numerous craft businesses well worth a visit.In between Longniddry and Port Seton sits Seton Colligate Church, considered ldquoone of the finest medieval collegiate churches in Scotland. It was built in the late s by landowner Lord Seton so the community of priests could pray for his familyrsquos salvation.Finally on the coast there is Longniddry Bents, East Lothian largest tourist attraction.

Among the long list of suggestions that Ive given a whirl are eating Marmite sandwiches, spraying a fine mist of Listerine and taking garlic tablets .Smoke can act as a deterrent, which has seen me huddling next to barbecues and bonfires like they are two-bar electric fires on cold winter mornings.Ive donned midge nets that give me the forlorn air of a beekeeper who has lost her hive, or a grieving Victorian widow.

Irsquove looked out my monthly cinema pass in anticipation of re-opening around July .I appreciate not everyone feels this way, but Irsquom ready to start living again. Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus. Uncertainty permeates through every part of our lives now, and we must find ways to live with and even embrace thiswe are to make it through the tough months ahead.

Thus the certainty with which Ms Stephenson presents her ldquocase simply has no basis in reality beyond a convenient conjecture.Her musings about membership of the EU, likewise present another unwarranted certainty. It is certainly the case that member countries have their own currencies , but the fact is that the EU has never faced a situation like Scotlandrsquos and thus any certainty about what it might do is unwarranted. In any event, evenMs Stephenson is correct that the EU would refuse an independent Scotland membershipit lacked its own currency, she writes asone is in the EU or not, when the fact is that, routinely the EU enters into association agreements with applicant states prior to full membership. These, while not according voting rights, could give Scotland much of what we want from membership, such as single market access, participation in EU schemes and freedom of movement.Of course,one starts from the proposition that Scotland should continue to be part of the UK, then any forecast of an independent future will be extremely negative. Naturally, we are all entitled to our point of view, but presenting mere conjectures as facts is disingenuous. Ironically Ms Stephenson considers giving  impressions ldquoworse than irresponsible. She might want to look at her own contributions before being critical in this way of others.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.JILL Stephenson is correct, the British nationalist parties vetoed a currency union between Scotland and rUK, though it could only have worked short term in any case.After the break-up of Czechoslovakia, the establishment of new currencies was achieved quickly and pain-free. So Scotland should establish a new currency as quickly as possible, and as Scotland runs a substantial trade surplus we have a good basis from which to start. I prefer the ldquoNorway Option for Scotland, butwe did join the EU, the euro would be fine an optimal currency in a huge trade block on our doorstep.Would an independent Scotland have a per capita share of the substantial UK assets   If not we would then have no debt to repay . Butwe had Clark Crossrsquos trial run , we would spend our revenue for best Scottish bang-for-our-buck, not paying for expenditure outside Scotland ldquoon our behalf. We would not expect to pay any part of, or incur debt on behalf of, HS or renewing Trident, or the rebuilding of Westminster Palace, or any of the myriad of expenditures south of our border, any more than we would pay for spending programmes in, say, France.Of course, under Mr Crossrsquos suggestion, Scotland would have no way to access the many opportunities that a normal self-governing country has, but it would part the veil of dependency and let us see the most excellent vistarsquos that lie beyond. We only have to vote Yes.GR Weir, Ochiltree.I VERY much doubtClark Crosss proposal that Scotland should be given a two year \"trial run\" at independence would result in the waning of the desire for self-government as he confidently predicts. So far,  countries have gained independence from the UK, none of them has asked to come back and many of them celebrate the day that British colonial powers departed. As for Scotlands sustainability, other nations of similar size in population to Scotland are managing their independence very well, such as Denmark, Ireland, Norway, New Zealand, and Finland and there are plenty of other countries with far smaller populations than Scotland, such as Iceland, who are also thriving with self-respect, self-determination and self-government.Ruth Marr, Stirling.NICOLA Sturgeon often quips that Boris Johnsons a recruiting sergeant for Scottish independence.

Knowledge of geology has never been more important, for understanding and mitigating future climate change and helping Scotland meet the  net-zero emissions target. So it is concerning that the number of applications for geoscience degrees at Scottish universities is in sharp decline.The loss of Higher Geology is undoubtedly a factor, but there are many opportunities within the Curriculum for Excellence and other Highers such as Environmental Science and Geography for pupils to learn how the planet works, and the many dferent ways in which geology and geological processes impact on modern le in Scotland. Organisations such as the Geobus at St Andrews University and Scotlandrsquos Geoparks are doing excellent work in taking geology into the classroom, and placing it in the context of sustainable development. The recent launch of a new charity, the Scottish Geology Trust, recognises the need to support these existing initiatives, and for wider promotion of the importance of geology to Scotland.Angus Miller, Secretary, Scottish Geology Trust, Edinburgh.VIDEO GAGAROBERT McNeils piece on video gaming was embarrassing : there have been holograms with more substance.First, video gaming being for \"loners\": right, so all those adverts with families playing Nintendo Switch games togetherjust passed him by, as did World of Warcraft, Elder Scrolls Online, Rocket League and the umpteen other cooperation games where you have no chance of advancement or success without teamwork.Next, \"all the games had themes of violence and fighting\".

The picture is by no means as clear cut as Mr McKay attempts to present it. While he is obviously familiar with the titles of some of Dickensrsquos novels, he ought to read Martin Chuzzlewit, in which Dickensrsquos horror of slavery is abundantly clear. He should also read the chapter on slavery in American Notes, which shows Dickensrsquos utter revulsion at the manner in which slave owners treated their slaves.As to the assertion that ldquoDickens didnrsquot have much time for Catholics I would suggest that he read Pictures from Italy, where he will learn that Dickens took issue with aspects of ritual, but not with Catholics as people. He might try Barnaby Rudge, which, as he may know, is an account of the ldquoNo Popery Gordon riots of .

In the eighteenth century, the island was home to around fty distillers with each farm on the island operating at least one still producing whisky.This began to decline as tighter regulations from both the estate and the government were introduced. Although a large number of islanders were still making whisky illegally, this industry ceased completely in the nineteenth century.#Tiree Whisky Company Ltd was established by locals Alain Campbell and Ian Smith with the aim of reviving the spirit industry on an island with a rich heritage in the tradition.Local production of Tyree Gin began in February  and, once again, the island was home to an operational distillery - the first in  years.Hebridean Pink Gin is distilled with juniper, raspberries and sweet peels.

They also released Broich Single Estate ndash a limited edition gin featuring tea grown right here in Scotland.Why tea  Because Scotland has many historical links with the tea trade with several stemming from Aberdeenshire which is where the Founders are based. When they discovered the story of James Taylor ndash a young man from the area - who grew the very first commercial tea plantation in British Ceylon, they worked with tea consultant Beverly Wainwright to source a special loose leaf tea from the Amba Estate in Sri Lanka.It is both hand-picked and hand-rolled ndash much in the same way Taylor produced his first batches  years ago on the island.When distilled, the tea provides fabulous citrus notes of blood orange along with a minty sweetness. These flavours are paired with more classic gin botanicals such as juniper, coriander seed, dried orange peel, angelica and orris root and a sprinkle of rose petals to create a smooth and fresh juniper-led gin with a citrusy lingering sweetness.The Teasmith Gin doesnrsquot disappoint. A truly smooth classic dry style gin packaged in a beautully simple bottle with lots of hidden hand-finishes ndash it ticks all the boxes.Serve this gin with copious ice, a premium quality tonic and sprig of fresh mint for a truly crisp and refreshing GT.

Westminster hasnrsquot balanced the books for years and the impending disaster caused by Brexit will only make things worse, we understand all of that. We also know that the devolved Scottish Government balances its budget and has no control over and is incapable of directly adding to the UK national debt. Any money Scotland gets from Westminster through the Barnett formula is not English largesse but simply some of our taxes being ed to where they were gathered.I reverse the question on our Unionist friends. What we Scots want to know is what England is going to do about the financial mismanagement of the UK economy, because the elected representatives we send to Westminster to reflect the views of the Scottish people simply cannot influence in any meaningful way what Westminster does. The facts are glaringly obvious that, despite years of austerity, England has failed to address fundamental flaws in our common economy and has compounded problems that have had and are having a detrimental effect on all the parts of our supposed union of equals. The distribution of wealth and its concentration in south-east England tells one all one needs to know about the role that Westminster plays and who controls it. HS encapsulates Westminster mentality.It may seem a risky gamble for Scotland to become independent, but then again to take to the leboats in the midst of a storm may also seem risky: but the only alternative is to cower onboard and drown with the sinking ship.David J Crawford, Glasgow G.AS the independence drum continues to beat ever louder and coronavirus acts as a possible catalyst or excuse for change around the world, I cant help but feel that the time is ripe to explore what might or should become of the land we now call Scotland.I cant speak for others but, for me, Scotland is ided both culturally and historically between Highland and Lowland, East Coast and West, not to mention the distinct nature of the people of the Northern Isles and the Scottish Borders. Dferent communities with dferent identities and dferent priorities. I do not see one homogenous nation.As a person with very deep roots in the Celtic West I feel far greater affinity with the people of Ireland than I do with many of the communities further east and south. This is not a conscious choice, rather a statement of personal orientation and belonging.The people of the Highlands and Islands have had an exceptionally poor deal from Edinburgh and its Lowland bastions in recent centuries. Infor backing the wrong horse in the , our precious Highland and Hebridean heartland has been decimated, its people and language oppressed, subjugated, burnt out and cleared. Are we supposed to say thank you As we move towards a second defining vote on our constitutional future I wonderI am alone in not wanting to be a pawn in a game that involves Edinburgh replacing Westminster only for Edinburgh then to cede power to Brussels  Why would you do that  Why work so hard and build so many expectations only to achieve so little If I am to vote for change then it has to mean something tangible and not simply switching one uncaring master for another. I will not be convinced that rejoining the EU is anything other than being party to a European Project that will ultimately lead to the creation of a new country called Europe. Whither Scotia then Can I perhaps dream of a new Atlantic nation from Argyll and the Clyde Islands to Caithness with a border on the Highland line  In control of its own destiny, freed from Lowland control yet living respectfully alongside one another We have great natural resources, pure water, clean air, abundant capacity for energy generation, magnetic scenery to draw the tourists, wide open spaces, world-leading foods and whisky and, above all, brilliant people with global reach. Who knows what we can achievewe can turn dust to seed, reap our own harvest and ring our own till Ill be honest and admit that I have no idea at this stage whether or not the people of the Highlands and Islands remotely share such a vision and how this could work economically but, in an age of iconoclasm and the redefinition of identity, no Lowland politician should assume that an independent Scotland would not, in turn, find itself broken up in time by those of us wishing to assert their fundamental right to self-determination.As the creation of Holyrood emboldened nationalism, so I hope that independence will, in turn, trigger an explosion in regional identity politics within Scotland itself. One step at a time.Fraser Kelly, Millport.THERE is a simple answer to Maggie Chettys questionwhy the Prime Minster wants to hang on to Scotland. It is because that is what the people of Scotland voted for in , in a fair and free democratic referendum. You would think she might remember that.Her letter also includes a fascinating reference to the UK benefiting from ious taxes, although of course the Scottish Governments own figures tell us that Scotland gets more out of the Union by way of revenues than it puts in. The tax mentioned by Ms Chetty that is most intriguing is the one on whisky, which looks an awful lot like the mythical whisky export tax so beloved of nationalist conspiracy theorists. Likewise, she has now added a fish tax and a beef tax.Which all begs a much better question than Ms Chettys:Scottish independence is such a great idea, why do its proponents have to tell so many lies to justy it Peter A Russell, Glasgow G.THERE seems to be growing concern that interpretation of the Hate Crime Bill presently going through Holyrood would have an adverse effect on freedom of speech , particularly as regards the aspect of \"stirring up hatred\" Could those of us who write to The Herald then run the risk of being accused of that crime by the overly sensitive taking offence at our use of language criticising them, their views or their actions and as a consequence stirring up hatred in their own breastnot where  The letterfrom David Stubley provides an interesting case study in what to me appears to be its deliberate use of language chosen in sum to be inflammatory and personally derogatory viz ldquolackeys\", \"toadying\", \"fallacious\", \"lie\", \"charlatan parties and their willing acolytes\", ldquo proven liar\" and \"used car salesman\".

practice ndash which seeks to change someones sexuality or gender identity ndash is a \"risk to public health\" and should be made a criminal offence.It comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson called conversion therapy \"absolutely abhorrent\" and said the UK Government willbring forward plans to ban it.Stars such as Sir Elton John have also recently backed calls to outlaw it.A petition has now been lodged in Holyrood calling on the Scottish Government to take action, attracting thousands of signatures and support from high-profile LGBT organisations.Tristan Gray, one of those named on the petition, said:\"We only discovered that its not already illegal quite recently, and we were quite shocked by it.\"The Scottish Government said conversion therapy is \"unethical, harmful and has no place in Scotland\".However, it said the legislative timetable for the current parliamentary session \"is currently fully committed\".It said it \"fully support moves by the UK Government to end conversion therapy\" and will engage with officials ondevolved and reserved responsibilities.Gray,who is on the Scottish Greens policy committee, said conversion therapy is \"putting someone through a process that would erase their LGBT identity\".He pointed to moves to ban it in Canada, where officials have defined it as seeking \"to change an inidualrsquos sexual orientation to heterosexual, to repress or reduce non-heterosexual attraction or sexual behaviours, or to change an inidualrsquos gender identity to match the sex they were assigned at birth\".The Canadian legislation, which was introduced earlier this year, proposes five new criminal offences related to conversion therapy.These include causing a minor to undergo conversion therapy,causing a person to undergo it against their will and profiting from or advertising conversion therapy.The Holyrood petitioners insist the practice has \"damaged generations of LGBT+ young people and adults and continues to do so\".They quoted a report from the charity Stonewall, which found  per cent of health and care staff had witnessed colleagues expressing the view that lesbian, gay and bisexual people can be ldquocured of their sexual orientation.They also referenced a survey by theOzanne Foundation, which works withreligious organisations to eliminate discrimination based on sexuality or gender.This found .% of respondents had ldquobeen advised to consider attempts to change their sexual orientationand just over one in sevenhad ldquovoluntarily considered it.The petitioners said: \"Concerningly, .% of LGBT+ respondents had been forced to go through attempts to change their sexual orientation.\"Almost two-thirds, .%, had \"suffered from mental health issues\" as a result of the conversion therapy, including nearly a third who said they had attempted suicide.The Holyrood petition notes: \"These responses clearly show that there is a signicant public health case for banning conversion therapy.\"The experiences of those who were put through this practice show that enforcing this ban should fall under criminal law.\"Both of these areas fall within the devolved powers of the Scottish Parliament.\"It said the UK Government has yet to act despite committing to end the practice years ago.It added: \"Given this information, it is clear that conversion therapy is a risk to public health, especially the mental health of vulnerable young adults and children.\"There is broad support for its criminalisation by those who have been subjected to it, and, as healthcare and criminal justice matter, we believe it to be within the scope of the Scottish Governmentrsquos powers to ensure this practice is brought to an end.\"Gray raised concerns the UK plans will be kicked into the long grass.The -year-old said: \"I think it should fall under criminal law, and that is something that is shared by people who have undergone it.\"People who have been through conversion therapy overwhelmingly support it being banned, and I think half of them support it being an area for criminal law.\"I think they are the people who should be listened to on this.\"People who have been subjected to conversion therapy should be the people we listen to most.\"I think it should come down under criminal law, and I think the justication for that partly includes it being a public health issue.\"He said it is an issue that should gain \"universal support\" from Scotlands political parties.Jordan Daly, co-founder of Time for Inclusive Education , a charity working to address anti-LGBT bullying in schools, is one of those backing the petition.He said: ldquoConversion or reparative therapies should have been outlawed a long time ago, and practices which ly claim to change, cure or repair an inidualrsquos sexual orientation or gender identity or expression have been shown time and again to be emotionally and psychologically traumatic on those who have experienced and survived such programs.\"He said practices which rely on \"using emotionally exploitative tactics to encourage feelings of shame and repression in iniduals are active in Scotland right now\".He added: \"We support this petition and the efforts of campaigners to continue raising awareness about the existence of dangerous and shameful practices in our country.\"Scotland has an opportunity to lead the UK here, and ensure that no other LGBT person, young or old, experiences this ndash ministers and parliamentarians should not delay in taking it.SNP equalities minister Christina McKelvie said: ldquoWe do not support or advocate the practice of conversion therapy.\"It is unethical, harmful and has no place in Scotland.\"We fully support moves by the UK Government to end conversion therapy, and are engaging with them as they develop proposals.ldquoThe legislative timetable for the current parliamentary session is currently fully committed.\"We are continuing to engage with officials in the UK Government on their thinking as it develops, and this will include consideration of devolved and reserved responsibilities as they relate to this practice."},{"url":null,"title":"ticket-prices-look-set-soar-venues-look-survive-post-pandemic-landscape","story":"Mass gatherings were the first social events to be banned by the Scottish Government in March as the realities of the Covid- crisis first swept across the country ndash and venues desperate to sell tickets to stay afloat are yet to reopen and havenrsquot even been handed a timescale of when they are likely to begin performances again.Festival bosses in Edinburgh, where all internationally-acclaimed summer events have been scrapped due to the pandemic, have warned MSPs that any

set of guidance and equipment to enable venues to stage mass gatherings safely.The organisation has warned that ticket prices for cultural events could soar to mitigate costs and lack of revenue for venues.They added: ldquoThis may require help with the additional costs of staging safe events, including extra security and stewarding, pre-event checks, accommodation and equipment costs, and increased labour costs. These costs may amount to several pounds per attendee, an additional burden that will be impossible for nearly all venues in the sector to absorb.ldquoTherefore, it may be necessary to establish a subsidy for social measures, recognising venues can only operate at -% capacity at two metres distancing and -% at just one metre.Music venues in particular will struggle to make enough money to be viable with any sort of social distancing being required.Mark Davyd, chief executive of the Music Venue Trust, said: ldquoThe issue of the additional cost per attendee is certainly a concern and needs addressing.ldquoWe would highlight that at one metre, social distancing grass-roots music venues that are able to open, which is approximately one third of the spaces, can operate at an average % capacity.

Ministers have also made a poundm pot of funding available for performing arts venues that have been hit by lockdown.The organisation added: ldquoDespite much in the way of plans and guidance being developed for what a lsquosafersquomay look like, the reality is that it is unlikely to be economically viable for many live venues to open under social distancing guidance.The Royal Scottish National Orchestra has warned that once performances are able to restart, ldquoit is likely that any continued social distancing requirements will impact the size of orchestra we can field.Theatres across Scotland have been severely impacted by lockdown ndash with the Tron Theatre in Glasgow predicting it will lose up to pound, this year.At the Kingrsquos Theatre in Edinburgh, poundm renovation plans are now under threat ndash with poundm of the funding set to come from a levy on non-existent ticket sales.Fiona Gibson, chief executive of Capital Theatres said the project is now at risk as ldquoa large element of the fund will likely be repurposed for the organisationrsquos survival.She added: ldquoIn our view there is no such thing as a socially distant theatre.ldquoFor the last , years, people have got together to share the same experience in the same space at the same time. Theatre buildings are designed on that premise.ldquoTo have performers socially distant would demand creation from scratch of an entirely new repertoire of work right across all performance genres.She added: ldquoFor obvious reasons large gatherings were first to close down, in the same vein we anticipate theatres to be the last to open up again.ldquoFrom having spoken to our network of venue operators across the country, the general consensus, at this point in time, is that March or April  is the most likely date for the theatre industry to restart.ldquoMargins for Capital Theatres, as a large-scale commercial operator, are tight.

I really believe that hersquos the victim, and now I feel sad because I believe hersquos been fully corrupted.The book claims that, after a newspaper revealed the location of his home in , Mr Markle rejected constant media requests with a line prepared for him by royal officials which stated: ldquoI canrsquot speak out of respect for my family.The Duchess and Prince Harry Harry told him to do his best to ignore the press, but ultimately ndash with encouragement from the Duchessrsquos elder half-sister Samantha ndash Mr Markle accepted a proposal from photographer Jeff Rayner, according to the book.Mr Markle agreed to participate in several set-up photographs, including one of him reading a book on British history while at a cafe.

However, a more emotion-centred focus is in evidence north of the Border.While warning against seeing the issue in binary terms, Ruth McKay, headteacher at Portobello High in Edinburgh, one of Scotlandrsquos biggest schools, is following an approach that she acknowledges will be viewed as ldquotowards the relationships end of the spectrum.Ms McKay said a personalised welcome for each pupil at the start of class ndash which could range from a simple hello to a namaste greeting ndash was among measures she hopes will boost emotional connections between teachers and children.ldquoSome of our young people will have been going through very challenging circumstances over the last few months, dealing with issues such as domestic abuse, substance abuse or financial hardship ndash our staff have been delivering food parcels throughout lockdown, she said.ldquoWe know others have felt overwhelmed or isolated. So wersquore anticipating a need for increased additional support for young people as weto school and our staff will be prepared for that.ldquoIf a young person is presenting in a distressed way ndash we wouldnrsquot talk about bad behaviour or challenging behaviour ndash the first question we as staff will ask ourselves is, what has been going on for that young person  And the next one is, how can we support them Ms McKay said a key focus in the coming weeks and months would be strengthening teacher-pupil bonds.ldquoOne of the things that we already ask all staff in the school to do is meet and greet young people when they arrive for lessons during the course of the school day, she said.ldquoRather than the class filing in and sitting down, chatting while they wait for the others to arrive, the teacher is on the door and will greet each young person as they enter. They might ask how that young person is doing, or say lsquoglad to see you backrsquo, or lsquoI loved your essayrsquo. Itrsquos a way of creating microinteractions, of giving teachers a split-second sense about how a pupil is doing.ldquoWhat we will be doing when weis continuing to find ways to create those little interactions. Of course, in the case of the personalised greeting at the start of class, it wonrsquot [because of Covid] be a handshake but it could be simply saying hello, or a namaste greeting ndash the teachers and young people will find ways of doing that.ldquo[In terms of space to address emotions], we run a range of groups and programmes and itrsquos a topic thatrsquos explored in Personal and Social Education, or assemblies, which might run virtually to start with, when wersquoll talk to young people about the emotions that they might be feeling as we re-engage after lockdown.Portobello Highrsquos approach has echoes where in Scotland, with St Bridersquos Primary in Cambuslang making emotional-regulation sessions available to all children, staff and parents.Plans have also been put together to ensure every secondary in Scotland has access to a mental heath counsellor.Writing for TES, developmental psychologist Suzanne Zeedyk describes such initiatives as practical examples of how schools could create ldquospace for talking about feelings and enable children to ldquobe in touch with, and to manage, their emotions.She contrasts this with the views of Tom Bennett, an adviser to the Department for Education at Westminster, who argues that clear expectations and policies on behaviour will be crucial as campuses reopen in the age of Covid.ldquoGood behaviour is the core mission for every school, whatever age or stage, he wrote in a recent online article.ldquoGet behaviour right and everything  is possible. Mr Bennett said students ldquomust be explicitly told the consequences for behaviour that threatens distancing measures, respiratory or tactile hygiene, are very serious indeed, and added that ldquomalicious, deliberate acts of transmissionshould be ldquotreated with the greatest seriousness.Amy Forrester, director of pastoral care in Cockermouth School in Cumbria, has a similar view.ldquoThere is talk of lsquorecovery curricularsquo, lsquoemotional wellbeing daysrsquo and lsquosignicant pastoral timersquo as part of the reopening provision, she wrote in an article for TES.ldquoWhile this is well-intentioned, I passionately believe that focusing on wellbeing interventions is, at best, misguided and, at worst, dangerous. What children need most after a time of signicant disruption to their lives is normality. Pastoral leaders, more than most, know the importance of routine, boundaries and normality following a period of challenge in a young personrsquos le.For Ms McKay, discipline and maintaining a Covid-secure school environment are, of course, vital ndash but so are feelings and relationships.ldquoThe approach that we have built up at Portobello High would generally be seen as more towards the relationships end of the spectrum, she said.ldquoThatrsquos not to say we do not have high expectations of our pupils, itrsquos about how we go about realising those.A Scottish Government spokeswoman said: ldquoThe Deputy First Minister has been clear that in planning for theto school, children and young peoplersquos wellbeing should be at the centre of considerations. Education authorities and schools already have a wide range of approaches and strategies in place to support pupilsrsquo wellbeing and we are committed to strengthening the resources available for that purpose.

And I would say the standard of service offered by RBS, Clydesdale and Bank of Scotland has declined.ldquoMy experience in dealing with them now is that you cannot speak to a bank manager, yoursquore put through to a computer and it says nohellip The standard of service has declined signicantly, I would say.ldquoI think RBS, Clydesdale and Bank Scotland have become much less willing to provide loans to business in Scotland. I just donrsquot see them as active as they were in supporting local industry. They have become more risk-averse.Mr Mackayrsquos criticisms have been strongly rejected by senior figures at industry body Scottish Financial Enterprise. Graeme Jones, the organisationrsquos chief executive, said the sector was ldquohighly regarded within the UK and internationally.He added: ldquoFor the seventh consecutive year, our credentials as a global leader in financial services were further reinforced by securing the most foreign direct investment in the UK after London. We know talented people with sought-after skills is a key factor in firms expanding or relocating their business here, which is vital for economic growth and providing more opportunities for people who live, study and work here.Mr Jones also highlighted Scotlandrsquos strength in developing the technology and software that underpins todayrsquos financial services industry.ldquoOur thriving fintech cluster is one of the strongest in Europe, with the number of fintech SMEs increasing by more than  per cent from  in  to  this year, he said.ldquoAs an industry, we employ more than , people across banking, le and pensions, asset management, and professional services all of whom are working extremely hard to ensure millions of personal and business customers continue to have access to financial services in its many forms during this dficult time, with frontline colleagues, such as those working in branches and contact centres, going above and beyond to support vulnerable people, families and businesses.Natwest Group and Lloyds Banking Group, which is the parent company of Bank of Scotland, declined to comment. Clydesdale Bank was asked for comment."},{"url":null,"title":"mohican-day-crofter-donald-trims-hair-sheep-shears","story":"While the rest of us hijacked partners with scissors to try to tame wayward hairstyles, television crofter Donald ldquoSweeny MacSween opted for something more serious.The result of his attempt to trim his hair using his sheeprsquos shears will be revealed in a new series of BBC Albarsquos An Lot ndash The Croft, which focuses on the Isle of Lewis crofterrsquos experiences during the height of lockdown.And although his experiences with the shears were something of a very close shave, Donald confirms it could have been much worse.ldquoAt least I still have both my ears, eventhe hair was more of a lsquoMohicanrsquo than I meant it to be.Viewers have followed Donald through the highs and lows of running his croft in Ness, on the northern tip of Lewis, for the past five years.The first series saw him turning his passion for crofting le into a full-time occupation as he took over the croft that had been in his family for more than a century.Since then, viewers have witnessed the many challenges of keeping on top of a busy croft, with its  hens, six Highland cows,  sheep and  pigs, and followed him as he branched out into egg production, delivered wood to be made into Harris Tweed and explored how to enter the islandrsquos tourist industry.Far from a romantic look at crofting le, it has exposed how brutal it can be, from raging storms to the loss of livestock in the face of Donaldrsquos efforts to modernise and ersy. Having become used to being followed by the cameras, lockdown restrictions meant he had to take over filming as the crew left just as the croft entered one of its busiest times of the year.In the three-part series, Donald, , is seen trying to take in rapidly changing and momentous global events as the pandemic evolves while getting on with the traditional tasks associated with le on his croft.The three-part series reveals the impact of Covid- as the former young crofter of the year entered a lambing season without help, and his reactions to the crisis as it sparked panic buying in shops, grounded airlines and closed down businesses.ldquoIrsquove watched the programmes now, and itrsquos really interesting to see how scared and confused I was, he said.ldquoTherersquos a point in March when Irsquom filmed asking about what social distancing was. Now, of course, itrsquos part of day to day language but at the time we hadnrsquot heard of it.ldquoYou forget so much of what happened. Now when you look back, itrsquos hard to believe how much has changed.As the rest of the country was came to terms with lockdown restrictions and limited time outdoors, Donald was in the grip of one of the busiest periods of le on the croft.ldquoAs soon as lockdown started, lambing began. I was in a lsquolambing bubblersquo for the first six weeks of lockdown, he recalled.ldquoI was avoiding most of the news because I was so busy. I was concerned and anxious, but I didnrsquot have the time or energy to find out too much about what was going on. ldquoI was probably lucky to have the distraction of lambing.While tackling lambing and other jobs alone left him exhausted, he says he appreciates how lucky crofters and other islanders have been compared to some others.ldquoPeople have really appreciated they were not stuck in a flat somewhere without a garden. We have crofts that we can go outside and work on.The series has shown Donald investing in modern equipment including Shetland-made Polycrubs, tunnels made from redundant pipe from fish farms and designed to withstand harsh island gales, and ersying into new income streams such as meat boxes in order to keep the croft going.However, the latest series concludes with him reflecting on the troubled times caused by the pandemic.Meanwhile, he suggests the croftersrsquo way of le might be one that many will be following to a small extent. ldquoLiving on an island, we spend summer thinking about preparing for winter, he said.ldquoWersquore cutting peat, preparing animal feed, filling our freezers because we know that the ferries arenrsquot always sailing, and you canrsquot always get what you want from the shops. ldquoI wouldnrsquot be surpriseda lot of other people are also thinking about what might happen come winter and are doing the same.An Lot - An Glasadh The Croft - The Lockdown, tonight, .pm.

Currently, we predict a shortfall of income running into tens of millions of pounds.The fears of Glasgowrsquos leaders for its artistic and sporting heritage ndash including its Royal Concert Hall or Fruitmarket with their annual half a million visitors ndash come as it becomes increasingly clear the sectors are being devastated by the pandemic.Yesterday, The Herald on Sunday revealed some performing arts venues will be forced to raise ticket prices to cut the risk of Covid amid concerns there is ldquono such thing as a socially distant theatre.At the beginning of this month, Ms Hyslop announced poundm in targeted support for performance arts venues. The UK Government has pledged another poundm to help keep the arts in Scotland afloat.Sector insiders do not believe this money will be enough, as the scale of Glasgow Lersquos financial problems demonstrates.The charity receives about poundm a year from the council to deliver its core services. But it supplements this core funding with fees for everything from swimming pools and gyms and admissions to concerts and events. Its famous museums do not charge visitors but partly make up for this with money from gt shops, cafes and one-off special exhibitions.Glasgow Le is understood to have offset some of its fixed costs by furloughing hundreds of workers involved in this commercial operation. But it has to cover the full wage bills of its core workers.In their letter, Ms Aitken and Mr McDonald, who chairs Glasgow Le, stressed that Glasgow was far more economically dependent on its arts and sports sector than other parts of Scotland.Moreover, city spending on arts and sports delivers a dramatic multiplier effect.The city leaders wrote: ldquoSince , tourism to Glasgow has grown from . million to . million visitors. Spend has grown from pound million to pound million over the same period, helping sustain more than , jobs in the city.ldquoOne of the major draws for tourists to our city is our world-class civic collection and museums service.ldquoMore people visit Glasgowrsquos museums each year than in any other UK city outside of London, with visits reaching more than four million last year. Our museums service is perhaps the most efficient and effective in the country, delivering nice museums on a budget of pound million, with no national funding: compare that to the National Museums of Scotlandrsquos pound.m budget from Government and . million visitors annually.\"Ms Aitken and Mr McDonald also stressed the value of live music. Glasgow is behind Manchester and London for music tourism but its concerts still generate poundm from visitors to the city every year, they said.Earlier this month Glasgow Le published a schedule for re-opening its venues. Only a third were included in its first phase. Kelvingrove will open its doors in the middle of August the riverside transport museum at the end of the month losing all the income they would have received during the school holidays.This echoes a nationwide pattern. The Association of Scottish Visitor Attractions last month found that nearly half of the nationrsquos museums, galleries, castles and other historic sites may remain closed until .Normally  million people would go through the doors of Glasgow Le venues every year.Mr McDonald told The Herald: ldquoWe have always had a great working relationship with the Scottish Government but now wersquore asking them to step up more, to ensure that the huge contribution Glasgow Le can make to Glasgow and Scotlandrsquos economic and social recovery is fully realised and not held back by the unavoidable financial challenges that have resulted from this global pandemic and lockdown.The city council has been supporting Glasgow Le through the lockdown and is getting some extra money from central governments to cope with extra Covid costs.Insiders stress that local authorities across Scotland have lost substantial revenue while their commercial centres were closed. Glasgowrsquos council-owned City Parking already operates at a loss. But during the lockdown it stopped charging for parking as it tried to help key workers get to their jobs safely. Its very future as an armrsquos- body is now up for debate, insiders say.A Scottish Government spokesperson said it is a ldquohugely challenging and concerning time\" for those in the culture and heritage sector.\"We are doing all we can to support them during the Covid- pandemic,\" added the spokesperson. ldquoYesterday, we announced a new pound million Resilience and Recovery Fund for independent museums and we continue to have discussions with Museums Galleries Scotland to understand the support needs of the wider sector, including local authority museums and arms- external organisations, such as Glasgow Le, which face future funding challenges.ldquoWe are also working closely with other cultural and heritage funders to ensure a co-ordinated response."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : pmADVERTORIAL: £, to companies for every furloughed worker still employed as of  January  £ BILLION Kickstart scheme to create jobs for --year-olds VAT CUT TO % for tourism  hospitality for the next  months With these measures and more, the UK Government is helping protect livelihoods in Scotland and across the rest [hellip]copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Taking a holiday in the United Kingdom offers people the chance to uncover some stunning scenery, wonderful attractions and superb accommodation without having to jump on a plane. Here, we take a look at the type of places you can stay, the rules you need to follow and how to enjoy a great staycation.Scotland’s colourful countryside, breathtaking beaches and glorious gardens are ready to welcome visitors this summer. Many locations are reopening, but have restricted visitor numbers and pre-booked time slots, so we recommend looking at the official websites for attractions and organisations before you travel, so that you’re in the know before you go. The national tourist organisations of Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland have launched a UK-wide industry standard and ‘We’re Good to Go’ mark. The mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective government and public health guidance, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence. Do remember that our four nations have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for reopening tourism. Please respect government guidance on social distancing and also any regional lockdown measures that are provided by the respective nation.Summer is here and Britain is beginning to reopen, providing everyone with the opportunity to start dreaming about a holiday. And this year a staycation could give you some much needed rest and recuperation, while also helping get the holiday industry back up and running. Hotels, campsites, bed and breakfast accommodation and other places to stay are now openingthey can follow the guidelines relevant to their locality to ensure that their guests will be safe to stay and spend days wandering our award-winning coastlines, exploring our green spaces and getting inspired in our cities. Each accommodation provider is unique and those that have reopened have had to adapt depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of accommodation.But these changes mean it is safe for visitors to come and enjoy a change of scenery. But even when we are away from home, we still need to follow the guidelines.Speaking earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months.“They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, BBs, indeed much of our tourism industry.“All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe.“But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.”Mr Johnson emphasised that evenwe are now allowed to spend nights away from our own homes, we must still follow social distancing rules. When out and about, we need to remember to look after ourselves, one another and the environment around us. To make sure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, just follow a few simple steps.When planning your trip, check that important facilities like toilets and car parks are open before you travel. If you have an attraction in mind, check online to seeyou need to pre-book.Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem.Stay socially distanced apart from anyone outside your household while walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing. Wear your face covering at all times when on public transport. Make sure you have a bank card many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments. Take hand sanitiser with you. Leave the car behind where possible and visit nearby attractions by walking, cycling or public transport.Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened their self-catering property on the shores of Loch Lomond and their family-run passenger cruise business, Cruise Loch Lomond. The -person rental property is set in self-contained grounds on the shore of the lake, and the Cordners hope guests will contribute to the local economy while being respectful. They have implemented virus prevention measures in both the property and on the boats, including increased cleaning and social distancing procedures.They have also invested in additional cleaning equipment and training for cleaning staff. Passengers are asked to wear face coverings and book in advance, and capacity has been reduced to allow for social distancing. “We live in a small community but we’re fortunate that there’s a lot of space and our main business is an outdoor activity,” said Mr Cordner.Cool Camping is a curated website of small, independently-run camping and glamping sites across Wales and beyond.Marketing manager James Warner Smith said: “Having campfires, spreading yourself out, being able to chat with the owner of the business who’ll be able to recommend a local pub – they’re all big parts of the appeal of camping. “You’re much more likely to be pitching your tent among shrubs and long grass with a lot of space between you and your neighbours.”The company has been working closely with campsites in Wales to ensure safety guidelines are met. At the moment, only self-contained accommodation can open, so the website only allows those types of sites to be booked. They’ve introduced a new feature on the website where each business can indicate what new safety measures they’ve put in place. Among the most popular places among potential visitors is Pembrokeshire, with secluded spots outside of national parks all proving popular.Northumberland’s oldest castle hotel, Langley Castle near Hexham, has reopened to visitors, with all the appropriate “defences” in place. The castle, which has survived attacks by Border Reivers and a fire that left it as a ruin for centuries, has again been buzzing with guests who have been impressed by the sanitary and social distancing measures that Langley has already put in place. The management team makes many arrangements upfront, such as menu choices and payments, as part of the social distancing procedures that are required. Other changes affect check-in and check-out times, to enable the housekeeping team to carry out deep cleans. Executive general manager Margaret Livingstone-Evans said: “We have stayed upbeat and optimistic and have managed to generate enquiries throughout lockdown, by being creative about the ways in which we can make things happen, in a safe way.” More details at langleycastleFor more information on staying safe, please go to visitscotlandcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The Eco-Schools Programme is the world’s largest Environmental Education programme and aims to make environmental awareness and action an intrinsic part of the le and ethos of a school. Its participatory approach and combination of learning and action makes it an ideal way for schools to begin improving the environments of schools and their local communities. Eco-Schools work through a simple seven-step process resulting in the programme becoming central to the schools ethos. Schools can choose from ten eco-topics ranging from litter and waste to energy, bioersity and transport to name a few. Eco-Schools work towards achieving awards - bronze, silver and the prestigious Green Flag.The internationally recognised Green Flag is this highest award given to Eco-Schools and symbolises excellence in the field of environmental activity. Over the past two years, pupils of Buick Memorial have been working hard on many initiatives in order to address their chosen topics of Waste, Litter and Bioersity. Together with Eco Coordinators Mrs Carleton and Miss Stirling, they have produced policies on printing, recycling and litter for staff and pupils within the school to follow. Their continued commitment to regular Cash for Clobber collections enabled the school to purchase a number of new bins for the playground. Thanks to Catherine Hunter, Mid and East Antrim Education Officer, the children were able to give each class a bin for food waste, allowing the Eco Club to produce compost for their many planting activities. A highlight of the Eco-School endeavours is the annual litter-pick with Cullybackey Community Partnership and thanks must be given in particular to Margaret Murphy who is always keen to help the children in any way she can. The school is extremely grateful to Cranswick Country Foods for providing a superb wooden structure for the ‘plastic bottle greenhouse’ project and to Barry Tapster, Mid and East Antrim Recycling Officer, for his guidance. This year has been exceptionally busy, with the introduction of a termly ‘Walking Week’ which the pupils and parents have strongly supported. The Eco Club have spent a lot of time tending to the school pond area building mini-beast and frog hotels, making bird feeders and planting flowers for pollinators amongst many other tasks. None of these opportunities would have run as smoothly were it not for the unwavering input from Mr Fleckand the dedication of Ms Harkin . The positive attitude and increased awareness of environmental issues is evident within the school from Nursery through to P and this Green Flag is a welcome acknowledgement of the children’s efforts.The International Eco-Schools Programme is operated in Northern Ireland by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul and is a free to enter programme.

Although somewhat daunted by the responsibility which comes with the role of Chair I am nonetheless excited by the prospect for the year ahead. “The ongoing global pandemic undoubtedly brings enormous challenges for our organisation but by embracing the opportunities which technology offers there are ways in which we can keep the spirit of Inner Wheel alive. “I am immensely encouraged by the way in which our members have already adapted to the new normality. The gradual easing of restrictions will hopefully ensure that our ious activities can continue to take place.“As District Chair, I have chosen Special Olympics as my Charity for this year and I look forward to engaging with all of our Clubs in supporting this particular group – as well, of course, as the myriad of local charities which our members support over the years. I look forward to working closely with our friends across the Rotary family. I am also indebted to the members of my local Club for all of their encouragement and support.” Patricia took up her new role on  July and will continue for  months. She is planning to attend the International Inner Wheel Convention in Japur in India next Spring – subject, of course, to easing of travel restrictions.

This year, though, there was a real threat of #The Port# being the town that was all dressed up with nowhere to go.There had been no fanfare Easter weekend opening of family favourite Barry#s Amusements. The caravan parks were shut, hotels closed and apartments unavailable to visitors.Today there are still no screams of fright and delight, as the doors remain firmly shut on the famous old building that has attracted fun lovers through the decades. There#s no ride on the old ghost train. Copper coins will find a dferent home instead of the slots in the arcade.But where in the town the sparkle is starting to .The mums are back, tissues in hand to mop up dribbles of ice-cream from small faces. All the seats along the seafront are taken for a welcome breath of fresh north coast air. If anything, the town is busier than during last July#s Open. No golf to distract, no Barry#s to chuck p coins into those slots in the hope of winning a clatter of copper. Instead, visitors are nose to tail along the main street, and it#s come just in the nick of time for the shops and cafes.Andy Hill has been running Troggs Surf Shop since  and said Monday was one of the best he can remember.It#s incredibly busy. It#s all domestic custom, we#ve hardly seen a foreign tourist, he said.The beaches are very busy indeed. A lot of people were probably going stir crazy at home and just needed to see the ocean and get some salt water therapy.We#re selling an awful lot of body boards, surfboards and wetsuits. The beach is a natural asset that we have and it#s great to see people using it. Of course it#s a huge disappointment that Barry#s isn#t open, but people seem to be making the best of it, and thankfully the weather is helping.Monday was probably one of the busiest days I#ve ever had here. If everyone did holiday at home every year it would be a marvellous boost to the whole economy. Some will be quite surprised when they come here. A lot of visitors have been telling us what a brilliant time they#re having on the north coast.Along the street, Alice Rohdich presides over the family jewellers and souvenir shop, which has been in business since  and has never known a time like it.We#re missing the tourists from further afield, but we#re certainly making up for it with homegrown visitors, she said. The town has had to evolve this year. We can#t change what#s happening.We did invest in more Irish souvenirs this year as we#d expected more people from overseas on the back of the golf last year, but that hasn#t happened. But thankfully we#re getting our share of what#s going and we#re feeling much more positive. We would previously have had early morning and late evening trade, but now, with plenty of day trippers, the middle of the day is when most arrive. You can#t really visit Portrush without grabbing a stick of rock and Ann Lamont has been selling sweets and confectionery at Wilma#s just across from Barry#s.It has really picked up this last week, she said. We do sell some Irish souvenirs, but that#s not what people from Northern Ireland are after and that#s who we#ve had in the town.But they#re still able to get their sweets, buckets and spades.The weather has been good and usually, especially at nighttime, Barrys would be a big draw for us. Most of my family have worked in there at some stage.A few miles# drive along the Atlantic coast, Portstewart has always been known as a quieter seaside town than its neighbour, but it has reawakened with vigour over the past two weeks.There#s the usual crawl of traffic along the ocean front. Across the bay the sun glints once again off the cars lining the famous Strand. Orderly queues form outside the many ice-cream parlours. There are smiles again on faces as they take good of the fresh sea air. And customers are like a breath of fresh air, too, for the myriad of seafront shops.It#s great to have the doors open again and see people out and about again, said Siobhan Farthing at home and lestyle shop A Broader Picture.We#re obviously having to keep numbers down in the shop, but it#s such a relief to get the doors open again. There#s a real psychological boost to being by the sea and so many people have told us they#re delighted to be back.Missing out on their day by the seaside, though, were face coverings. Few and far between along the proms, it seems a decent face mask might be considered a hindrance to getting the full benefit of the sea air.

Northern Ireland will be the first part of the UK to have a contact tracing app.Health officials are working hard to prevent a second deadly surge of the virus, which has claimed more than  lives since it first arrived here. However, concerns have been raised about a lack of information over the location and extent of emerging clusters, particularly as shielding is due to be paused on Friday.Health officials have provided some information to the public about clusters, but have so far only confirmed the location of the cluster arising from the karaoke party.The PHA revealed that since the start of the Limavady cluster  cases have been added to the contact tracing database, while  contacts had been identied.Read More Limavady Covid- spike linked to microphone passed around at house party karaoke sessionThe PHA declined to provide any further information, stating that it may result in people being identied. This is despite growing calls for clarity over the location of clusters to enable the public, particularly those most at risk from the virus, to take additional measures to protect themselves when it is active in their community.Alliance Party MLA Paula Bradshaw, a member of the Stormont health committee, said: I recognise the challenge for the PHA in ensuring that patient confidentiality is assured as part of the contact tracing process and we now have good evidence that contact tracing is fundamentally working in identying and following up clusters.Nevertheless, in a public health emergency we must also have public information so that the public can make decisions about how to go about their daily lives safely.I would still wish to see more information about the locality of clusters immediately when they are identied, and about the nature of clusters in due course, so we can identy clearly what specic activities are leading to #superspreading#.Shielding is pausing on Friday for the , people who were warned their lives are at riskthey become ill with Covid-.They have received limited advice about what is safe from Friday, which includes a recommendation that they should continue to work from home where possible. At the same time it has emerged that  clusters have been identied here since May , with more expected in the coming months.

We will confront them where and when they choose to appear.Connolly Youth Movementsaid its members had also been present and supported the action.Lasair Dhearg was among those that posted the video on its Facebook page.

It has also opposed the extradition from the Republic to Lithuania of Liam Campbell, found liable in a civil court for the  Omagh bomb.The IFP, which was established in  and supports controlled immigration, describes its primary objective as re-establishing the national independence and sovereignty of Ireland and restoring its national democracy by leaving the European Union.It was contacted for a comment but had not responded by the time of going to press.Police are investigating the incident.

It was constructed in  and designed by the most prolic architect of the time, Thomas Jackson.The detached four bay, two storey neo-classical home occupies a fabulous position in the heart of Belmont, is convenient to many schools, Parliament Buildings at Stormont and  minutes from the City Airport.The property, which has been vacant for quite some time, is a blank canvas where the buyer will have full control of the finished product for the asking price of £.m.Michael Young, partner in selling agent Templeton Robinson#s North Down office, said: The template for Hampton House really allows the buyer to decide on the number of bedrooms, bathrooms and reception rooms but there are potentially five bedrooms and three reception rooms.Farran#s Construction, which is selling the house, is offering a choice of kitchen, bathrooms and finishes to the house included in the selling price along with a garage.The buyer has the opportunity to decide which kitchen, bathroom etc they want and it will be fitted but the seller will also be able to upgrade the kitchen or bathroomthey want and pay the additional costs.Included in the price is a choice of tiled flooring to hall, kitchen, utility, toilets, bathroom and ensuites and choice of carpets to lounge, dining, study, family room, bedrooms, stairs and landing. Hampton House has an internal floor space of almost , sq ft and sits on extensive grounds that include planning permission for more properties.There is additional planning for another two houses in the front gardensomeone wanted to add value to the property, Mr Young said. There is also permission to refurbish an old coach house at the rear of the property so in real terms there is potential to build three more propertiesthat is what the buyer wanted.For further information, contact the site manager, Donald Doyle on   or email ddoyle@farrans  Belfast   Related ContentGalleryNorthern Ireland PremiumNI house sales rise after lockdown as , properties put on marketAround , homes are on the market across Northern Ireland as the post-lockdown demand from house buyers to relocate continues.Jobs PremiumFinnebrogue plans to invest £m in new factory for plant-based foodsA top food firm plans to invest up to £m - and create  new jobs - in a huge new factory as it ramps up production of next generation plant-based products, the Belfastcan reveal.Northern Ireland£.m support fund for childcare will help sector reopen for businessChildcare providers impacted by the coronavirus pandemic will be able to apply for financial support from today.Most ReadBelfast cafe owner Whearty angers her former staff over alleged unpaid wagesFormula  legend Eddie Irvine partied with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell in New York and MiamiUVF plays down rt over terror gang exhibition in BelfastThe Earl and Countess of Erne on their magical wedding and le at Crom CastleFace masks  These NI firms have got you coveredyou#re a fashionista,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mr O#Toole said that despite the UK Government#s claims to have prioritised Stormont consent, Mr Gove and his fellow Tories have not even acknowledged the Assembly#s motion calling for a Brexit transition extension.A simultaneous letter sent to the local First Ministers laments the lack of any public advocacy from the leaders of devolved Government on behalf of Northern Ireland#s interests in relation to Brexit. The MLA said there had not been a single update to the Assembly on Brexit preparations despite the huge risk presented to Northern Ireland and the rapidly shortening closing timeframe. The Assembly is due to go into recess later this week. Mr O#Toole said: I have written to both Michael Gove and the First Ministers in growing despair at the total absence of either information or transparency on what is happening in relation to Brexit and the implementation of the Protocol.

Coleraine fans are the same.People were going to organise a Zoom thing to watch it but I said: #No, I#m sitting in the house on my own with no distractions#. And I told my we and our wee girl to go to her mother#s for the night.My phone will be off to watch the game and it#s going to be so surreal not being there. I have never missed a big occasion never, ever, but it#s one of those things.Coleraine superfan Dougie Wilsonhas been attending The Showgrounds for  years and follows Oran Kearney#s side with his family home and away.Despite the disappointment of not being able to head to Windsor Park, Dougie along with his we, two daughters and grandson are joining their fellow Bannsiders at The Showgrounds to watch the game on a big screen.They have described it as a big screen, but how big a screen it is I don#t know, said Dougie, who only ever misses a Coleraine match when he is on holiday.The social club will be open and a few fans will be going for a bit of a day out. Ballymena really take the biscuit with us, but this is what we have been missing for four months now.My grandson is in the  academy at Coleraine and he#s only started training again this week after four months. He was a ball boy at the League Cup final behind the goals, so he had a great time there.Dougie also takes his grandson Jack to football training at the Ulster University in Coleraine and he said the first team players know all their youth players by first name.That#s the sort of club it is, they love us and we love them, he added. We#re just one big family and one big community.Elsewhere, Glentoran supporter Girvan Wiltshire , who has been a member of the Glens# Stormont supporters# club for  years, never misses a game unless he is away enjoying the sun.In fact Girvan only missed three Glens games this season as he was on holiday, but he understands why the semi-final against Cltonville is being played behind closed doors.Of course, with the two matches at the one time it would have been a bit more awkward as well, he said.We#re all in this together but I would be feeling a lot worse about missing itI was ill orit was because I was working or something.With it being live on television it definitely softens the blow instead of trying to keep up to date on social media, especially since the last match was in March.A couple of the boys from the supporters# club will be coming round and we#ll be keeping the numbers down under the current circumstances.We#ll have a couple of beers and maybe a pizza at half-time.Cltonville season ticket holder Pedro Donald, who owns The Sunflower in Belfast city centre and The American Bar in the docks, is planning to meet a few friends and rival Glentoran supporters to watch the game.The first Cltonville game Pedro witnessed was the  Irish Cup final when the Reds beat Portadown - - the last time the north Belfast club lted the trophy.Obviously, we would love to go to the match but with everything going on we can#t, said Pedro. At least it#s on TV and the ones I would regularly go on a Saturday with are all meeting up to watch it, socially-distanced.We#re actually meeting up with some Glentoran fans, so it should be good craicnothing .My first ever football match was the  cup final and we haven#t won the thing since. I thought it was brilliant, and here we are  years later and we haven#t won it since then.Meanwhile, fellow Cltonville season ticket holder Henry McDonald hopes thathis side beat Glentoran today, those who regularly put in a sht at Solitude will be given priority when the small amount of cup final tickets are handed out.The tickets should be given to the people who do the voluntary work at Solitude - the guys who pick up the litter, the guys who do the security, the guys who sell the programmes and work in the club shop, he said.

The test centre was set up at the Judges Road home of City of Derry Rugby Club in April. However, with the rugby club planning toto sporting action soon, a new base has to be found for the testing centre. The Department of Health which operates the local test centre and several others in Northern Ireland confirmed that the local testing centre will no longer be available for testing from the end of July. A Department of Health spokesperson said: “The testing site at City of Derry Rugby Club will no longer be available for testing from the end of July. googletag.cmd.push “Work is underway on behalf of the National Testing Programme to identy an alternative site and an announcement will be made in due course. Initially testing was restricted to health and social care workers, it then accepted key workers and their families who had symptoms and more recently any member of the public with symptoms. These tests can be booked via the Public Health Agency website. Many medical and disease control experts have said that testing and contact tracing is key to tackling the spread of COVID-. The Department has developed a COVID- ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ Strategy which sets out the public health approach to minimising COVID- transmission in the community in Northern Ireland. The key elements of the strategy are testing all people with symptoms of COVID-, contact tracing, providing information and advice on self-isolation, and support to enable people to self-isolate. googletag.cmd.push It says for ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ to work, each citizen in Northern Ireland has a very important role to play. “We must all prepare for the possibility of having to self-isolate and prepare to be tested in order to protect ourselves, our families and our communities. “Symptomatic members of the public are therefore encouraged to get tested early - this will be crucial in controlling the spread of the virus,” a spokesperson added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Coronavirus pandemic has been tough on local businesses and news that Eason closed in Foyleside came as a blow to the city centre. There are however independent businesses who despite the current economic uncertainty are branching out and creating employment in the city. Much loved food truck and eatery Pyke ‘N’ Pommes revealed on social media that it is about to take over a new unit – at the old Primrose cafeacute on the Strand Road. googletag.cmd.push An exciting new project, BROslashN, has also been announced at recently vacated premises on Bishop Street which will house a coffee bar, barista school, restaurant and cocktail bar with locally sourced beer and spirits. Daragh McCauley is the owner of ine Hostages Coffee Company which is based at the top of Waterloo Street. He will run the new venture with business partner Connor Allen who has been manager at Harry’s Shack in Portstewart since it opened. ine Hostages started as a coffee van on the side of the road in Donegal before they opened the shop in Derry towards the end of . googletag.cmd.push “My dream was always to open a coffee shop,” Mr McCauley said. A refined menu at ine Hostages consists of grilled cheese toasties with a choice of good quality local meats and homemade ingredients as well as the best quality bread and baked goods. It was ‘slow going’ at the beginning but the pandemic came as a blow as the business was beginning to gain some traction. With a one-way system in operation they were able to successfully reopen once permission was granted. Mr McCauley believes the quality of coffee sourced from Bailies Coffee Roasters is second to none The most important ingredient is the ‘passion’  Hostages has for all of their products, he added. Anyone using Bailies products in the North West of the country will now be trained at the new Bishop Street premises. BROslashN will offer coffee and food throughout the day and sit-down meals in the evening complemented by craft beers and cocktails. They intend to support local as much as possible through suppliers and employing staff from the North West. “I’ve been working in coffee now for about four and a half years, I’m going to stay managing this shop but will work in BROslashN as well,” Mr McCauley explained. “We’re going to try and create as many jobs as we possibly can. About  people across both businesses. “The barista school will be opened upstairs on Bishop Street. “We’re hoping to open around August  and we’ll know this week whether that’s going to happen. “We’ve a lot of staff hired but are still looking for people with experience.” Mr McCauley said he feels confident opening the new business in the current climate because the people of Derry have done a good job of looking after each other and businesses have been sensible. “Derry has been really, really good so far and the way we will lay the shop out on Bishop Street it held about  people but we’ll be dropping it to  and the tables will be spaced out without losing the atmosphere. “It will be a cosy but modern shop and unless there was a complete lockdown again we’d be very confident with the way we have it laid out that it will work.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Father La rises in the morning at around .am for early morning Mass. Less than an hour later, he is under an open sky as birds fly overhead undertaking the Stations in his bare feet leaving solitary footprints where before many soles left their imprint on the earth. Housemartins A station takes around an hour and ten minutes to do and Father La does so under the swooping wings of the Housemartins amidst a backdrop of blooming nature during these calm but drizzly mornings. googletag.cmd.push At am, the boatmen come onto the island. Each day Thomas Gallagher from Ballyshannon, Reece McGrath from Pettigo and Joe Sheeran from Mountcharles arrive on the island and undertake their own work. They leave at pm. “Really, I can hardly remember the last time in my le I was lonely. I am at ease with my own company,” he said. As they leave the island, Father La is well into his day. “I would be hard pushed to find a time when I have been busier. “People are afraid that I am bored but I’m not. The team are exceptionally busy, they have been putting so much work into alternative ways to keep in touch with pilgrims. We have set ourselves to be in outreach mode,” he said. googletag.cmd.push In the evening, Father La goes up to the Basilica for night prayer. “My thoughts are to honour the rhythm of the pilgrimage season,” he says. This year, those affiliated with the island are busy in new and alternate ways. Father La said that many people have been sending petitions to those on the island: “We get a lot of people who send us petitions asking for prayer for this or that,” Father La said. In his prayers, he remains faithful to those people and the heartfelt petitions that they have undertaken to write and to send to the island. Virtuous pilgrimage On the last weekend in June, Father La invited people to do the full pilgrimage with him from wherever they were. It was not a virtual pilgrimage, he said, but a virtuous one and people did fast and pray asthey were on the island. People signed up online to participate. Father La recalls that the pilgrimage was one where they were not blessed with favourable weather. “The rain was horizontal. It was driving rain and constant wind. “It was relentless during the night. On Saturday we got through reasonably well,” he said. Those who participated were bestowed with a certicate which carries the Lough Derg seal and are signed by the prior. All of the certicates had to be sent out by the team to those who participated. A pilgrimage season did not take place on the island in  as result of a dispute with boatmen. However, many more pilgrims came to the island the following year. Pilgrimage path There is now a newly refurbished path on the lake shore of Lough Derg. The path which was recently relaunched would have been used by pilgrims in the medieval times. In the s pilgrims from as far away as Spain, Italy and Hungary used part of this trail as they made their way to what medieval Europe knew of as St Patrick’s Purgatory. Work was being carried out on the path before the pandemic struck and six new boards were designed and ready to go when the lockdown came into effect. There are now six display boards which bring to le the story of the Pilgrim Path and those who walk the path can enjoy stopping to read the boards. Father La said that the ‘full walk’ is around k along the shore road and to Saints Island. “We went to the point where pilgrims used to cross to Saint’s Monastery where they were given hospitality before being brought to Station Island,” he said. People can also take a shorter loop and everyone can do the walk at their own pace. Some people like to do it in soft contemplation and reflection whilst other people like to absorb the surroundings. Many people enjoy taking photographs in the historic and picturesque surroundings. “I led two guided groups on Saturday and Sunday,” he said. Numbers were limited as a result of the Covid- church and State guidelines, those who took part enjoyed it. One-day retreat Father La said that it remains to be seen whether a one-day retreat will take place on the island this year. “It remains to be seen whether we can open for a one-day retreat at this time,” he said. However, a meeting for the matter to be discussed will take place before the end of the week. August  It is expected that Father La will remain on the island until August . Enjoying his own company, reflection and prayer, Father La seems content during this year’s traditional pilgrimage time. He has now become familiar with a goose who comes onto the island to graze in the grass. The goose can be found behind St Mary’s, at times, and when startled will take off honking at great speeds, at times. His presence is one that the reflective priest appreciates. “I am kind of glad for his company. “It is amazing the company that God sends you when you are on your own,” he fondly says.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He will not be able to call on Shane Lagan after the long-serving defenders retirement. Also gone is Conor McGurk who is still in Australia following the coronavirus pandemic. One man who is back in the fold is Paddy Henry, who has played just one game since the clubs  intermediate championship win. Lavey won the minor football and hurling double last season, but due to the young age profile of the team only minor football skipper Cormac Collins and Ryan McGill have graduated to the senior ranks. googletag.cmd.push He acknowledges the work going on around the club, referencing the U success and a useful U group. “From my point of view, I wish they would come through a bit quicker,” McGarvey jokes. While this weekends opponents have been busy with challenge games, Lavey had just Sundays draw with Carrickmore to help their championship preparation. “Thats all we are going to take,” the Lavey boss stressed, rolling out the names of the dual players in his plans. Fintan Bradley, Dara McPeake, Aidan Toner, the McGill brothers , Liam and Colm Murphy. “I envisage  of our team will be dual players. They wont all start on the football team, but they are aiming to play both,” predicts McGarvey, who leads the management team of Simon Wilson, Ben Dodds, Adie McGill and Mark Hearty. googletag.cmd.push “You are not going to know until you start playing. The boys were glad to get out, but we have a tough schedule because nearly all our players are dual players. We were going four or five times a week and we had to cut it back on them.” On the other side of the coin, Dee Doherty is back in charge of Na Magha, eight years after helping them to an Ulster final where they went down to Bredagh. Galway native Tomaacutes Lally, who has transferred from London club St Gabriels, joins him on the management team. “We are trying to build, like other clubs and counties are doing, to try and progress,” said Doherty, who knows the hurling scene well in his role as physio with Derry senior hurlers. “We want to rise up from being Na Magha, the junior team in Derry. It is a game we are looking forward to, with the incentive of it being your first game at home. We know it is Lavey and we know what we are up against.” It will be a chastening experience for his young side, with many of them going straight in against senior clubs in their first year of adult hurling. Many of his squad work in the retail sector, so balancing shts around training has proved dficult. In a  or  day spell Doherty has juggled challenge games with Donegal sides Burt, St Eunans, Setanta and Buncrana. “We have not been able to get the same team out for any of the games,” said Doherty, who was happy to be working with a group of  plus players. “Of that, nine are first year minors and cant play, but we are thinking down the line to next year and the year after. I have never saw numbers like that at Na Magha in my le,” he said. Having their own base is important, but Doherty points to the efforts of Ciaran McCarron and the coaches who have nurtured the upcoming minor squad. “There is a good group of players there that are interested in playing. You are trying to mix them with the older boys. We want to progress into the intermediate level, thats the aim. “For us to win anything this year, we are going to have to beat one of the senior clubs in the county. If we could win one championship game this year, it would be a result for us and that is the target we set out for ourselves.” It will be a long-term project and continuity will be the key. Home advantage will give Na Magha a familiar surrounding, but Lavey should head back down the Glenshane pass with the points. VERDICT: Lavey RELATED- Sean Leos masterclass not enough to clinch Coleraine win.

The Erins Own side went into an early lead with points from Ryan McGill, Fintan Bradley and Liam Murphy. Deaglan Foley kept the city men in touch and when they got back into the game. It was point for point and the sides were level at the break, - each. Ciaran Hendry, Paddy Henry and Ryan McGill pushed Lavey three points clear and on their way to victory. It was a good workout, Lavey manager Johnny McGarvey said after the game. googletag.cmd.push It was awkward and it was a tough breeze to play in. Theywere fairly physical and we were happy enough to get a win. The Lavey boss referenced his sides lack of composure in front of goal, allowing Na Magha to stay in the game. I would safely say we had  wides and we gave away a lot of frees and eight of their  scores came from frees, McGarvey added.

Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, where Limavady is situated, experienced the largest surge in cases, with an extra  since last Wednesday. A mobile testing unit, situated on the Greystone Road, was deployed to the area in response to the cluster. Only one more case was recorded in the Mid Ulster area, but Derry and Strabane saw fourteen new cases, bringing its total to . Ten local GAA clubs suspended activities as a precautionary measure in response to the cluster, with only St Mary’s GAC, Banagher, confirming a positive case within their members. googletag.cmd.push A club spokesperson said: “All relevant people have been contacted and the Public Health Agency will contact any club memberthey feel there is a concern. “We will keep you up to date of any information received from them. “The GAA has advised the club to continue as normal, although we have decided to cancel all underage training until further notice.” A shop in Claudy, part of the Derry and Strabane district, has also confirmed a member of its staff is currently in isolation after testing positive for Covid-. In a statement, posted online, Centra Claudy said other members of staff have volunteered for testing. googletag.cmd.push “Whilst we do have one staff member who has tested positive for Covid- they are in isolation since they had the test and are following public health advice,” they said. “The public health authority did not contact any of our other staff for testing via track  trace although some have volunteered for testing and all results to date have ed negative. “We can assure you that we have been following very strict Covid guidelines since we entered this pandemic in March. “Our staff have worked tirelessly to provide a service for the local area, and we have appreciated the support  patience from our community in following guidelines when shopping.” A ‘local lockdown’ have been enforced in Leicester, England, after a surge in positive cases, and the Department of Health said the strategy would be ‘considered’ in Northern Ireland. “With lockdown restrictions being eased it is likely that we will see clusters and outbreaks of Covid-,” a DoH spokesperson said. “In circumstances where the number of cases continues to increase a range of measures will be considered, including the introduction of local lockdownsnecessary and depending on the circumstances as they arise.” Sinn Feacutein MLA Caoimhe Archibald. East Derry MLA, Caoimhe Archibald, has urged people not to panic, saying the figures were proof the Test, Trace and Protect system was working. “It is concerning that a cluster has been identied, first and foremost for those iniduals who are affected,” she said. “Hopefully no one is suffering from serious symptoms and will recover quickly, but there is a general concern there in the local community and that’s understandable. “We don’t want people to be alarmed. We have seen the test, trace and isolate system in place, and we can see how that is working. “The cases have been identied and the process is rolling out. That is critical to containing the virus and we see those procedures working effectively. “It’s a timely reminder to us all that we can’t become complacent, that we do need to remain vigilant and practise public health guidance in terms of social distancing, good hygiene and cough etiquette.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

One Big Field Party is being held this Sunday on a large green area beside Creggans Linsfort Drive. The event is free to attend, but donations will be collected for local musicians who have performed for free throughout lockdown to raise money for local charities and people in need. Local charity fundraisers Gavin Gallagher and Steven Gallagher have organised virtual gigs and street parties throughout lockdown with the help of local entertainers which have raised pound, for local good causes. googletag.cmd.push We always wanted to do something like this to say thank you to the local acts who have done so much during lockdown, but we had to wait until the rules had relaxed a bit, explained Gavin Gallagher. Some people have said to us that there have been a few reported cases of coronavirus recently andthat spike continues we will cancel the event. But at the minute we are taking every precaution to make sure everyone is safe, including using  security staff and a team of litter pickers, Mr Gallagher asked those attending the concert to observe social distancing rules. googletag.cmd.push We want people to come and to have a good time but we would ask that they abide by the rules. We are only here to entertain. If everyone does as the security people ask then everyone can have a good time. Lockdown has proved very challenging for Derrys entertainment community, with many losing all their income overnight. I would say about % of the musicians I know do it as their full time job and they lost everything, said Mr Gallagher. Many of those that were eligible for government support got so little that it was hardly worth their while. Despite this, they continued to gig online to keep peoples spirits up and raise money for charity. We hosted street parties across the city that made a really big dference to people in those areas. There was one wee woman of  who stood at her window crying and waving out because she was so happy and then she sent her son out with a donation of pound. Another time we heard about a woman who was turning  and we had singers up performing at her doorstep for an hour.One Big Field Party will take place on Sunday from pm to pm at Linsfort Drive.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

One Big Field Party is being held this Sunday on a large green area beside Creggans Linsfort Drive. The event is free to attend, but donations will be collected for local musicians who have performed for free throughout lockdown to raise money for local charities and people in need. Local charity fundraisers Gavin Gallagher and Steven Gallagher have organised virtual gigs and street parties throughout lockdown with the help of local entertainers which have raised pound, for local good causes. googletag.cmd.push We always wanted to do something like this to say thank you to the local acts who have done so much during lockdown, but we had to wait until the rules had relaxed a bit, explained Gavin Gallagher. Some people have said to us that there have been a few reported cases of coronavirus recently andthat spike continues we will cancel the event. But at the minute we are taking every precaution to make sure everyone is safe, including using  security staff and a team of litter pickers, Mr Gallagher asked those attending the concert to observe social distancing rules. googletag.cmd.push We want people to come and to have a good time but we would ask that they abide by the rules. We are only here to entertain. If everyone does as the security people ask then everyone can have a good time. Lockdown has proved very challenging for Derrys entertainment community, with many losing all their income overnight. I would say about % of the musicians I know do it as their full time job and they lost everything, said Mr Gallagher. Many of those that were eligible for government support got so little that it was hardly worth their while. Despite this, they continued to gig online to keep peoples spirits up and raise money for charity. We hosted street parties across the city that made a really big dference to people in those areas. There was one wee woman of  who stood at her window crying and waving out because she was so happy and then she sent her son out with a donation of pound. Another time we heard about a woman who was turning  and we had singers up performing at her doorstep for an hour.One Big Field Party will take place on Sunday from pm to pm at Linsfort Drive.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A spokesperson for the club confirmed the news last night after a day of uncertainly regarding the potential fixture. Originally scheduled to face League of Ireland champions Dundalk, Celtic were expecting to welcome the Lilywhites to Celtic Park, but quarantine restrictions ended their hopes of playing the game with anyone coming into the Republic from the UK having to self isolate for  days. With the League of Ireland set to start next Friday, that would have been impossible for the champions. googletag.cmd.push That opened the door for Derry City to step into the glamour friendly, with reports suggesting that former Celtic and City star Paddy McCourt was heavily involved in organising the game. The hope was that, as Derry City would only be travelling to another part of the UK from Northern Ireland, they are not bound by the same restrictions. That hope continued into yesterday, with the club hoping to finalise arrangements for the game, but they were dashed by the FAI last night. With City set to travel to Dublin to face St. Patricks Athletic, just eight days after the proposed game in Scotland, the same -day rule which scuppered Dundalks plans, also appear to have stopped Derry, despite technically being in the UK. googletag.cmd.push Instead of Celtic, City hope to finalise their pre-season plans with a game against Northwest neighbours Finn Harps behind closed doors at the Brandywell tomorrow night. Declan Devines men faced Cltonville in midweek and drew -, with the City boss running his eye over three new trialists. The Candystyripes face Sligo Rovers in the resumption of the league season next Friday. Celtic, meanwhile, who now wont have Irish opposition this weekend, finished off their mini tour of France with a - defeat at French giants Paris St-German, with superstars Kylian Mbappe and Neymar both on the scoresheet in the Parc des Princes encounter.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Fortunately, a fire, believed to have spread to undergrowth after an attempt was made to set a speed restriction sign alight, did not develop into a large blaze.The volunteers who run the railway mdash who have launched an urgent appeal to raise pound, mdash are particularly concerned about an attempt to force open the main gates they discovered empty beer cans. First aid boxes at the station were also raided for bandages.Damage at the Loop  was discovered during a recent shunt to test rolling stock and carry out essential track maintenance, with the exercise taking place while visitors were banned from the railway due to lockdown restrictions.Railway officials have reported the incidents to police and have appealed to anyone who can assist officers with their enquiries to come forward.The recent incidents come after the coronavirus lockdown had a massive hit on the railwayrsquos finances.In an online post, officials appealed to young people to ldquoleavethem alone and stop trying to destroy the place, also asking parents do they know where their children are and what they are doing.The hard-working volunteers say they have enough on their plate without having to ldquosort out other peoplersquos mess, expressing concern about people walking along the railway lines which they are not allowed to do.Officials say the ldquostupidity of others is the reason why they hope the local community will support their fundraising appeal to help pay for better security as a bid for financial help from the Northern Ireland Executive proved unsuccessful.A recent bid for support from the Department of Communitiesrsquo Covid- Charities Fund to cover costs racked up to maintain the business which has been mothballed due to lockdown restrictions was unsuccessful.Officials fear that the railway will also miss out on securing a slice of a poundm fund for business start-ups and tourist attraction investment which was announced recently.Railway chairman Robert Gardiner recently wrote an open letter highlighting the railwayrsquos plight and its reluctance to ask for help in the current financial climate.He said coronavirus restrictions have had a ldquodevastating impact on the railwayrsquos operations and its restoration work.Mr Gardiner said the railway was likely to remain closed for the remainder of the year due to the restrictions around Covid-.He said that with no income for the rest of the year, the railway faced ldquomajor challenges.Mr Gardiner said given that the railwayrsquos final attempts at securing Covid- support funding from Stormont failed, it had reluctantly turned to its members and supporters to ask for help.He added: ldquoWe need to raise at least pound, this year just to keep the railway in a good condition and make some progress with essential projects.To date, the railwayrsquos appeal has raised pound,, with anyone interested in making a donation asked to visit www.facebook donate   or text RAIL plus the amount to  or visit www.downrail appeal.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Aarin’s lockdown farm project  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK boy has been enjoying lsquoThe Good Lersquo during the Covid- lockdown.Twelve year-old Aarin Rea has spent the past four months developing a miniature farm, complete with chickens, ducks, doves and even peacocks, in the garden of his Knochnashinna home.Hersquos also growing fruit and vegetables in his allotment and specially built greenhouse, and hersquos also planted apple trees.His family and neighbours will soon be able to share in an abundance of potatoes, cabbages, lettuces, carrots, scallions, broad beans, tomatoes, strawberries and apples, as well as a supply of fresh eggs.Aarinrsquos mum, Karin, says the miniature farm has helped bring the community together during the isolation of lockdown and has lted everyonersquos spirits.ldquoItrsquos all everyone has been talking about lately, she said. ldquoThey are always enquiring as to how the farm is coming along and Aarin couldnrsquot be any prouder at whathe has achieved over the last few months.ldquoAarin has been eager to get out every day to his little farm while he has been off school. He spent the good weather tending and watering his fruit vegetables both in the allotment and in the greenhouse, which his father, Anthony, built for him.Aarin is the proud owner of peacock chicks, which were hatched thanks to a tip from his grandfather, Leslie Rea, who told him to put golf balls underneath the peacocks to encourage them to lay eggs.Aarin, has since given his poultry flock some pretty ingenious names, and he now considers his ducks, James Pond and Quacky Chan, among some of his best friends.Then there are his favourite hens, Henner Lopez, Princess Laya and Fluffy, who are very happy to the strutting around.The newest arrivals are two doves, Holy and Spirit, which are housed in a newly-built dovecote and a turkey chick.However, Aarinrsquos favourite animal is his beloved Jack Russell, Lottie.Aarinrsquos farming skills have come a long way since be began growing potatoes in tubs.ldquoI sell my duck eggs to elderly neighbours who adore their distinct flavour. Our next door neighbour, Tommy Armour, is always giving me little bits of advice to help bring the brood along.

I much prefer spending my time tending to my fruit and vegetables and caring for my new chicks.ldquoSometime my little sister, Grace, helps me. She is nine years old and is learning a lot more about farming than I ever thought she would.Aarin added: ldquoI thought the good weather during lockdown helped my vegetables grow.

That is absolutely essential.Campaigners added: ldquoThe historic underinvestment in the Ambulance Service has been widely known for years.

If there had have been, the guide would have stopped and taken him down.Jules was later told by the Matterhorn Museum that itrsquos believed he was the youngest person ever to have mastered the peak.Chris, now living with his family in the Scottish Highlands where he and his we Mignonne run a gin distillery, Daffyrsquos, said: ldquoJules has always loved climbing since he was able to walk.

He was always very capable as we have always climbed as a family.Chris said that Jules continued to put the work into building up his skills and stamina for the climb mdash even the Covid- could not defeat the  year-oldrsquos determination to climb the mountain.ldquoWe had lined up an American friend of ours to guide us, but he couldnrsquot travel due to the pandemic so we thought we would go with the local mountain guides.ldquoHowever, they told Jules that he couldnrsquot do it until he was  and after he proved himself. We did a lot of high altitude extreme rock climbs. They watched Jules, saw that he was very capable and decided to give him a shot.While Chris was prepared to try and make his sonrsquos ambition to come true, even he was surprised when they safely made the summit and ed back down without incident.ldquoI donrsquot think I fully expected we would make it to the top, admitted Chris. ldquoJules gave me a hug at the very top and said he couldnrsquot believe he had done it. He thought it was incredible but it did take a while for it to sink in afterwards.While Jules may be eligible for an entry into the Guinness Book of Records, his dad said that accolade is not what Jules was about.ldquoHersquos not a glory hunter in any sense, hersquos just appreciative and proud to have done it.

However, the claims have been firmly rejected by local people keen to see the controversial plan aborted.According to the tender documents, CIL wants to replace the existing beam with a more environmentally friendly LED light, maintaining that it can do this while retaining the traditional lens.And CIL says while mercury has been used to rotate large revolving Fresnel lenses since the s, with the system providing a near frictionless environment, it describes mercury as a ldquotoxic substance.While pointing to many years of reliable service, the organisation says there is increasing European and international legislation restricting the use, storage and transport of mercury.CIL maintains while it has no immediate statutory requirement to remove mercury from lighthouses, it has been its policy that where re-engineering capital projects are being carried out at lighthouses, ldquothe opportunity is taken to remove mercury.The organisation says with no other liquid medium available to replace mercury, alternative solutions are designed on a station by station basis to provide visual aid to navigation.CIL claims that trials on an alternative bearing at Tory Island lighthouse which started in  ensures the reliability of the bearing solution proposed for St Johnrsquos Point where it plans to retain the existing Fresnel lens which it recognises as important to the heritage of the station and local area.ldquoAs part of the engineering upgrade works, the mercury will be removed from existing optic installations and will be replaced by a mechanical bearing to provide an alternative rotation mechanism, states the tender documentation. ldquoOnly the liquid mercury will be removed and the remaining apparatus will be retained unchanged.ldquoIt is the intention to award the contracts for mercury removal at Rathlin East and Rathlin West lighthouses initially and appoint the successful tenderer for future removals.A spokeswoman for the Lecale Lightkeepers campaign group battling to retain the lighthouse in its current guise, suggested that local politicians will be ldquoperplexed that CIL has effectively ignored their wishes on the issue and the protection of the iconic sweeping beam.She said Newry, Mourne and Down Council unanimously decided to oppose any changes and was firmly standing alongside the local community on the issue.ldquoThe people and politicians are as one on this issue, the spokeswoman declared. ldquoSt Johnrsquos Point lighthouse is part of the arearsquos unique maritime history and heritage and must not be changed in any way.ldquoWhy is CIL issuing tender documentation when it has not told local politicians and indeed the people of Killough why it is proceeding without further discussion with them  Why is CIL ignoring the wishes of elected representatives She continued: ldquoWe have consistently asked for this beautul lighthouse to be simply left as it is. It is working perfectly andit isnrsquot broke, donrsquot fix it. We have consistently argued that the mercury issue is a red herring and nothing we have seen or heard has made us deviate from this position.ldquoSt Johnrsquos is one of the best ventilated lighthouses of its kind and we are opposed to any orce from the current Fresnel lens and its Burdel rotating mechanism.Campaigners say they hope that politicians will seek an urgent, virtual meeting with CIL to ask why their wishes have been ignored and why they were not formally told that the tendering process had begun.The campaign spokeswoman added: ldquoThe St Johnrsquos Point lighthouse boasts what is widely regarded as a rare bit of engineering excellence which we want retained and maintained. The iconic sweeping beam and rotation system must not be lost at the stroke of a pen and consigned to the pages of history.

Now things have changed signicantly and the hard work of many people, including local MPs, MLAs, councillors and roads officials have paid off, he said.ldquoThere have been many  dawns over the years but we are now at the stage that work could start within a year which is good news. It is a great pity that Vincent is not here to see this happening.For a number of years, Mr Casement and Mr Fullam were the sole flag-bearers for the bypass, ensuring that the project was firmly in the public eye.While the scheme was making slow progress, the regeneration officials refused to concede defeat and organised a number of meetings, inviting business representatives from across South Down. They recognised that the construction of the bypass was as crucially important for hauliers north of Ballynahinch as it was for those as far south as Kilkeel as their lorries were often caught up in traffic hold-ups on the main approaches to and from Ballynahinch.ldquoThe support for the bypass from all quarters was overwhelming, continued Mr Casement.ldquoI have lost count of the number of locally elected and direct rule ministers who came to Ballynahinch to learn more about the bypass. Confirmation that it is now tantalisingly close proves that you must never give up, just keep chipping away and stating your case.The former regeneration official also recalled a suggestion to construct the bypass and recoup the money spent on building it by charging drivers to use it.He said while there were some opposed to the idea, a number of leading hauliers were in favour as it would save them not only time, but fuel costs as lorries would not be sitting in traffic burning diesel.ldquoIt has been a long haul to get to this point and so many people have worked hard on this project. Successive isional roads managers were in favour of the bypass but there was never the money to work on its finer detail and move it to the shovel-ready stage, explained Mr Casement. ldquoThat position subsequently changed and the scheme has now reached a pivotal point.While the primary focus of the bypass is on easing traffic congestion, Mr Casement said the scheme brings with it a number of benefits.ldquoReducing tailbacks will help the environment and perhaps one of the most important aspects of the bypass is that will deter drivers from using a number of heavily populated housing areas as unofficial bypasses, including the Loughside, Carlisle Park and Langley Road areas, he continued.ldquoThe bypass can hopefully kick-start the economic regeneration of Ballynahinch town centre, encouraging new retailers and more shoppers. I believe that the current congestion can deter people who decide to shop where.Mr Casement said the proposed bypass can also benefit the wider South Down area as visitors from Belfast will be able to avoid Ballynahinch town centre.ldquoBallynahinch is regarded as the gateway to the Mournes and that position will be firmly cemented when the new link road opens. The scheme has never been this close in my letime and I hope that it wonrsquot be long before contractors are on the ground.ldquoBallynahinch residents and the townrsquos business community deserve this scheme. It is decades overdue and when it was confirmed recently that the project is well placed on the list of priority government schemes I was delighted.ldquoBut I was conscious that my good friend Vincent was not here to enjoy a moment that he had dedicated a large part of his le to achieving.With all eyes now on the Department for Infrastructure to confirm a bypass start date, Mr Casement hopes that it will be soon.ldquoIt has taken signicantly longer to reach this point than any of us ever imagined, but we have made it, added Mr Casement. ldquoThe icing on the cake will be confirmation of a start date and people are eagerly awaiting this announcement..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Newcastle Lions Club members celebrate 100 years’ service  ","story":"THREE members of Newcastle Lions Club have received longstanding service awards after clocking more than  years of service between them.Club president Marian McGreevy hosted a socially distanced event last Thursday to celebrate the hard-working lions.Some  years ago Michael Niblett and Peter May, along with a host of others in Newcastle, began the Newcastle Lions Club.

This particular facility could also be bulldozed as part of an ambitious redevelopment proposal.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is preparing to press head with investigative work at the prime Central Promenade location mdash including bore hole tests mdash to gather as much information as possible before it presses ahead with a multi-million pound investment.Council officials say that they recognise the need for modern leisure and community facilities at the site of the Newcastle Centre with several options on the table.They include a complete rebuild which include an extension to the existing centre, a complete refurbishment of the complex or partial rebuild and partial refurbishment.Retaining the Tropicana pool would restrict redevelopment proposals and the outdoor facility is most likely to be demolished, with enhanced car parking also set to be a key plank of any new proposal, in tandem with signicant disabled access improvements.A detailed feasibility study looked at a number of potential locations for a new leisure and community facility in the resort, with the Newcastle Centre site emerging as the firm favourite to house the new facility.Council officials say they are looking at a number of possibilities and that ldquoall options for the redevelopment of the town centre site are on the table.The existing Newcastle Centre forms part of the historic Annesley Buildings which enjoys protected status, but itrsquos believed that the cost of redeveloping the property and replacing the old extension at the rear would be signicant.It is also believed that an added problem facing the council is that the size of the existing centrersquos rooms are too small and unsuitable for modern needs.

The party made constraints on ministers one of its centre-piece demands for the restoration of Stormont, yet now, under a dferent leadership, it is helping to push through legislation that will remove those constraintsThis bill, which has been rushed through the assembly in a matter of weeks and has to date received little or no legislative scrutiny, will fundamentally affect decision-making in Northern Ireland.From the public comment on the bill, there is no appreciation of the implications of some of the proposed changes. Instead,MLAs are sleepwalking into making profound constitutional amendments. Twenty years ago ministers enjoyed considerable autonomy in relation to decisions within their department and famously the then minister for education abolished the eleven plus exam on his last day in office without recourse to the executive.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Richard Bullick, a former barrister, was special advisor to Peter Robinson and Arlene Foster as first ministerAllowing ministers such power within their departmental remits did not sit well with democratic accountability or joined up government and the DUP made the reform of these arrangements a centre-piece of its terms for the restoration of devolution. Admittedly, there was also a signicant element of being able to limit the capacity of Sinn Fein ministers to pursue their political and constitutional agenda. In a  policy document, the party argued that legislation “would be required to ensure that ultimate power would rest with the executive as opposed to the inidual departments”. To be clear the DUP’s intention was to ensure that any important decision could be required to secure executive approval and the resulting provisions meant that unionistconsent was required. The provisions that were legislated for were complex and interlocking. The underlying objective was achieved in two carefully worded statutory tests for which decisions would require executive approval. These arrangements operated successfully from  and on only a few occasions did DUP ministers feel compelled to go to court to successfully enforce the arrangements the party had largely devised. The rationale for the present bill arises out of a Court of Appeal decision to the effect that a signicant planning application required executive approval. Understandably, the executive wished to bring forward an amendment to recty that situation, but more controversially it has also chosen to amend a provision relating the carefully calibrated tests for executive approval more generally. There is little evidence that the drafters of the objectionable clauses of the bill were informed of the purpose of the original provisions. As a result the proposed changes seriously undermine the DUP’s claim to have a veto on all important decisions in NI. The essential purpose of the amendment is to redefine a test for full executive consideration in a way which would increase ministerial autonomy. This was done by limiting the meaning of what constitutes a ‘cross-cutting’ matter, reducing the range of decisions that have to come to the executive. Why then are DUP the appearing to be reversing a long-standing policy  My view is that it is not a change of policy but flows from misconceptions in what is a complex area of law.Firstly, there is a custom and practice argument which asserts that the new clause reflects the sort of matters that actually come before the executive for decision. While this may be true, it also entirely misses the point. The real issue is not what normally comes to the executive, but what can be required to come where other ministers take exception to a proposed decision.Secondly, there is the argument that the legislation restores the test for what constitutes cross-cutting to the standard which existed before the Buick decision , but after the changes brought about by the  St Andrews Agreement. The new test for cross-cutting would mean that there would be no requirement for executive agreement, “unless that matter affects the exercise of the statutory responsibilities of one or more other ministers more than incidentally”. Notably, there is no mention of ‘statutory’ responsibilities in paragraph  of the Belfast Agreement. This distinction has signicant application for s where there is no statutory underpinning for what departments do in practice. Even more signicantly the “more than incidentally” requirement, above, is demonstrably a greater level of “cross-cutting” than requirements which have already been found to satisfy the statute by the courts. These include reference to, “touches on” JR  “issues arise in a multitude of less obvious circumstances” Central Craigavon, “engages the responsibility of ious Ministers” Minister for Enterprise Trade and Investment.Self-evidently,the intention of the new clause had been to reflect previous case law, then the language in those judgments could have been deployed for statutory purposes. It was not. Thirdly, misplaced comfort may be taken by what is known as the ‘signicant or controversial’ test, though this simplication ignores a crucial second limb of the provision, which also requires the decision to be ‘clearly outside the scope of the agreed programme’ for government. The boundaries of this limitation are unclear, though unambiguously it weakens the short-hand catch-all test. And fourthly, it has been suggested, both at the Executive Office Committee and in the assembly, that the so-called ‘three minister call in’ provision in the legislation provides an ultimate safety net. This provision, it is said, would allow any three ministers to require a matter to come to the executive and deprive the minister of the authority to take such a decision .As the argument goes, there being four DUP ministers, this provides the needed assurance for unionists fearful of republican ministers going on ‘solo runs’. The logic of this argument is impeccable but for one rather fundamental defect. No such provision exists.This regrettable conclusion is reached, not by recourse to case law or obtuse statutory interpretation, but by a simple Google search of the relevant legislation, namely ‘section  Northern Ireland Act ’. As this safeguard has been widely cited in aid of the new provision, it is safe to assume that the entire bill is predicated upon this mistaken assumption. This is not a solid foundation for constitutional legislation. Problematically for the movers of the bill is that fact that they have to convince assembly members that the legislation, with the amendment, means exactly the same as the legislation did without it. The only intervening event was a judgment by lord chief justice where he interpreted the statute consistent with the approach the DUP have always advocated.All is not yet lost. Doug Beattie MLA has put down amendments to remove the dangerous aspects of the bill, while leaving in place the sensible provisions. These should be supported leaving the contentious aspect the bill to another day.

Please try again later.Submitting...Letter to the editorThe fact that in the second stage debate the primary DUP speaker propagated a  assurance suggests a dearth of consideration by the lead party of unionism. He said, “the “three or more ministers” safeguard remains in place. If ministers are upset or concerned about the implications of a decision that is cross-cutting, three of them are required to ensure that the executive as a whole have a conversation about that decision.”As Richard Bullickpointed out in his powerful article in the News Letter on Friday , this is simply not so. There is no such existing power. Yes, when something gets to the executive three ministers can insist it requires cross-community support. But, there is no power for “three or more ministers” to call something in, despite what Mrs Foster told her committee on st July. It is of itself alarming that the first minister is so misinformed.The right of three ministers to insist on a cross-community vote creates a veto for the DUP , but the supply line to the veto power is cut off by this bill. That is the key point the DUP seems to be missing. Now, any minister can decide matters without recourse to the executive unless it affects the statutory responsibilities of another department “more than incidentally”.So, what was so important at St Andrews to the DUP, is now of no moment. Why It is precisely because the ramications of this bill needed to be teased out in a proper committee stage that I voted against accelerated passage of this legislation. Sadly, I was the only unionist do so. Now, the horse has bolted.Particularly for believers in the absurd Stormont system these should be issues of concern, but seemingly not.Doug Beattie’s amendments seek to limit the change to planning matters. This is sensible. What is not sensible is to use the need for change on planning, flowing from the Buick judgement, to unfetter ministers’ powers across the board.Another option to protect against what may be unintended, but signicant, consequences would, at this late stage, be a petition of concern subjecting the final vote on the bill to cross-community support, that isthe DUP was now to realise what it is doing.Jim Allister QC MLA, Stormont• News story: Crucial ‘veto’ claim now dropped by Arlene Foster, leaked DUP note shows as vote on key bill looms• Doug Beattie: It is madness to hand ministers more unchecked powers, and hard to understand why DUP is backing it • Morning View: MLAs should back Doug Beattie’s amendment today• Richard Bullick: The DUP won key safeguards for unionism, yet seems to be sleepwalking into removing them• News story: Arlene Foster still backs ‘dangerous’ law – but offers no rebuttal of ex-aide’s warning• Sam McBride: With the incurious scrutinising the inept, Stormont is sinking lower into disrepute——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Sir Knight Goody described the experience as “humbling”.A proud family man, he was devoted to his we Heather, children Alison and Andrew, and grandchildren Rachel, David, and Callie.Sovereign Grand Master, Rev William Anderson, a close friend of Sir Knight Goody for many years, said: “Alan was someone who you could trust and who had a great depth of knowledge and experience of our Royal Black Institution. “He had a great eye for detail and was always keen to keep improving how we do things. Nowhere was this more evident than when he was delivering a lecture. He had great empathy with those listening and was a very capable teacher. “He always showed leadership and offered great encouragement to sir knights around him.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityCross Common bridge in Dinas Powys was closed off to drivers in February , after a new access road was built and the safety of the old bridge was questioned.The council abandoned the bridge and put up red and white plastic barriers to stop traffic driving over it.In August last year, the council promised to begin the work to remove the bridge that October mdash after delays in finding a specialist contractor.Now, with the bridge still there a year later, Plaid Cymru community councillors are demanding the council act, and either remove the bridge or turn it into a footpath and clear the debris and plastic barriers.Cllr Chris Franks said: ldquoFor three years, the Vale has said this bridge has got to go. If theyrsquore going to do it, theyrsquove got to get on with it. These ugly barriers are so frustrating, and thousands of people see it.ldquoThey did some excavations and just left the spoil heap. Itrsquos a vast improvement now, but even cleaned up itrsquos still a mess.Jean Webber, who lives nearby on Llwyn Derwen, said she has witnessed a lot of fly-tippers dumping rubbish at the bridge, like fridges, freezers and buildersrsquo rubbish. She said: ldquoI think this end of Dinas has been forgotten. [The council] seems to concentrate on the other end.ldquoI walk past here every day. It wouldnrsquot be so badthey just walled it off. I never complain, but this is just appalling.The council has now promised work will begin to remove the bridge next month, and blamed coronavirus for the most recent delay. The new timetable is to finish the job by this October.A Vale of Glamorgan council spokesperson said: ldquoUnfortunately, the contractor originally appointed to remove the bridge withdrew from the project after agreement couldnrsquot be reached on a claim for additional costs due to the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoThat meant a new contractor had to be found, a process that added to the delay caused by the pandemic itself, which for a period prevented work of this type being carried out.ldquoThe council has now successfully appointed a new contractor and received an indication that work is expected to start in mid-August. It is anticipated the work will be completed by the end of October.But both Cllr Franks and Ms Webber raised doubts about the new timetable. Cllr Franks said: ldquoWe are always told it will start in six to eight weeks. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

With that in mind, it is in everyonersquos interests that the Esplanade remains a safe, family friendly place for everyone to enjoy.ldquoI will soon discuss with my Cabinet colleagues the possibility of introducing a Public Space Protection Order at the Esplanade making it illegal to consume alcohol in public areas.ldquoIn the meantime, Council officers will be carrying out regular checks around this location to make sure alcohol sales comply with the terms of inidual licences and are not contributing to poor behaviour. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

A youth Assembly is a fantastic setting to encourage debate and allow our young people to opportunity to hold their elected representatives to account. They must not be weary of pursuing their own agenda and really making their mark on the issues that matter to them.“Over the coming two year period the Alliance Party is looking forward to engaging further with the Youth Assembly and we hope to see an inclusive body, reflective of our society today.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
