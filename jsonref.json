Back on Earth, she says, it was hard to find authentic relationshipsThere’s something surreal about talking to someone who’s been to space. Italian astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti might be at home in Cologne while I’m Zooming her from London – but there’s still an awareness: those eyes have seen what only a handful of people will ever see. Those hands have been without gravity travelling at 28,000 kilometres an hour.Loved ones gave Cristoforetti trinkets to take to the space station, where she spent 200 days between November 2014 and June 2015. The way she sees it, the rationale is that not many things have ever been to space and “you’re going to see a picture of it floating in front of Earth – it’s a symbolic meaning, added value”.Aware of the distance space travel can create between astronauts and earthlings, in Cristoforetti’s new book, Diary of an Apprentice Astronaut, she worries about the impact that having been to space might have on her life – “as if it weren’t already hard enough, even without the traps of celebrity, to lead a centred, virtuous life”. The idea of minor celebrity is, she concedes, against a neat backdrop of filing cabinets, “a bit scary, yes. People look at you in a different way. It’s less natural and so I find it difficult nowadays to find relationships I feel are authentic.”But life in space is also full of the humdrum. On weekends, Cristoforetti would hoover. She would still need haircuts and enjoy the throaty singing of Italian crooner Paolo Conte. Episodes of Battlestar Galactica would be used as a distraction from time spent running, harnessed to a treadmill.Her book is full of these quotidian quirks. Even the years spent in training are shown in all their pedestrian glory: the Harry Potter audiobooks listened to in Russian for language practice (she still has “a small, but enviable vocabulary of Russian magical terms”), the fretting over the best face moisturiser to take, and her out of office: “I’ll be off the planet for a while, back in May 2015. Unfortunately I won’t read your message.”But unlike on Earth, in space “you go from the total mundane to the sublime in the split of a second,” she says. Chores are interrupted by the sight of an aurora borealis and unfulfilling showers – there is no running water – are set against a backdrop of the “Earth gliding past the large windows”.Her time on the space station was saturated with awe: views of Earth take in 2,000 kilometres in all directions, dawns see the world tinted blue and red, cyclones wreaking havoc below appear as pictures of “quiet strength” from above. Whenever Cristoforetti could, she used to take in views of the Namibian desert, the indigo and emerald Caribbean and uninhabited atolls, and she describes how her eyes were “saturated with sublime beauty, steeped in the splendour of the stars”.The 43-year-old astronaut, who was formerly in the Italian air force, is often asked what impact these sights have had. While the book is full of illuminating observations from what she calls the “cosmic perspective”, “I resist this expectation people have sometimes that you go to space and come back with a new view of life.” In lieu of great epiphanies, Cristoforetti says, “you may catch a glimpse of insight”, plus it “intensifies your sensibility to things that you’re probably very sensible to anyway”.I do, however, ask if it gave her any insight into the current rub between internationalism and nationalism – so much of the book is an exercise in cooperation between scientists in the US and Russia, and she writes of the paradox of feeling connected to Europe when she is floating above the Earth in its entirety. Especially given that, as she puts it, from space differences of “culture, history, habit, material conditions” shrink down to details when compared to the “underlying substance, that kernel of human nature made up of feeling hot and cold, being hungry and thirsty, experiencing joy, pain, fear, wonder and ecstasy”.“When I was up there especially, more than I do now,” she says, “I felt this connection with humanity as a whole.” But, she adds, “that did not prevent me from realising, recognising, honouring that I do come from somewhere.” Equally, she never regarded these two perspectives as being in conflict.“I think that there is a lack of mutual trust between these two sets of people, those who are more international, maybe more urban in lifestyle, and then people who are more tied to local customs, traditions, language … It’s not such a dramatic conflict that we have to make it some kind of civil war … I hope that we move past this moment,” she says.Much was made of the fact that Cristoforetti is a woman – the first female Italian astronaut in space. For the public, she says, “it is a huge deal, especially for young girls and women”. Speaking to her, I remember the excitement of the first British astronaut Helen Sharman visiting my school. No doubt many children will remember Cristoforetti visiting theirs.Ninety per cent of astronauts have been men. There has even been a Barbie crafted in Cristoforetti’s likeness, a bid to encourage more girls to explore a future in science. But Cristoforetti is understandably reluctant to let her gender become too much of the focus. While in the book she concedes that “I have probably experienced discrimination that was subtle enough to have been ambiguous”, she says that pulling on the EMU suits used for spacewalking, which are not designed for the average-sized woman, was the only time she had encountered an obstacle “clearly linked to my being a woman”.There are other instances, but Cristoforetti obviously doesn’t see them as barriers. In one exchange a journalist asks her “in all apparent seriousness how it felt to be going into space with two such attractive men, whose strong shoulders I could lean on”. “That was laughing material for a long time,” she says, laughing again.There are upsides, namely the community who meet and party at ladies’ astronaut night, which she tells me is, beyond the guest list, no different from your average party – “just getting together with some finger food and drinks and chat”. She sought advice from veterans on the best bra to wear in orbit (a bra camisole for daily activities) as well as how best to approach peeing in space. Not a single female colleague had found the special funnel designed for women to be better than the regular version.Astronauts’ lives are full of firsts, opportunities to experience new feelings or do hitherto unperformed tasks – Cristoforetti was the first person to make an espresso in space, for instance. But the most noteworthy of those new feelings is, surely, weightlessness. This experience of feeling “completely unknown sensations”, she says, is part of what those who become astronauts are seeking.Does she miss it? “I do, yeah. I miss that feeling of lightness.” But the feeling she is speaking of seems to go further than a physical lightness. “I really enjoyed life up there. It’s a very simple, fulfilling life, with a lot of purpose in everything that you do.” Her days on the space station were peppered with scientific experiments, taking saliva or blood samples so that scientists back on earth could learn about the impact of x or y on humans. It’s a setup that makes life in space unavoidably meaningful.Coming back is, she says, the hardest part. “The six months after, when you’re still wrapping up the mission … you’re back but you’re not done.” While she writes of feeling at home even as she is about to take off, the “undeniable risk of a sudden and violent death tonight” looming, what she refers to as “ordinary life” is clearly the scary part: “The fact you have to grocery shop, sit in traffic, all those things that you just don’t have up there, cook your food – it’s not just a packet where you add some water and it’s ready.”• Diary of an Apprentice Astronaut by Samantha Cristoforetti is published on 27 August by Allen Lane."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4955a64162081555aaacb58dd29b4313c4f48ac/0_116_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21086f97dee20f49e145a06521ba0edb","title":"appledore shipyard in devon to reopen after 7m infrastrata buyout","story":"Unions welcome deal that will revive historic shipbuilding yard in Bideford A historic shipbuilding yard in north Devon is to reopen after it was bought by the natural gas storage company InfraStrata in a £7m deal on Tuesday.The Appledore Shipyard, in Bideford, closed in March 2019 after its owners, Babcock, said its future was not secure, despite the offer of a £60m Ministry of Defence contract.InfraStrata, which also owns Belfast’s Harland \u0026amp Wolff (H\u0026ampW), said the Appledore yard’s ability to cater for smaller vessels was “a market segment that cannot be ignored”.Boris Johnson visited the site on Tuesday and said ithad a “massive history but it’s also got a great future”.“What we want to do is to ensure that there’s a good enough stream of contracts coming through to drive jobs and growth here in Devon,” he said.Unions welcomed the deal and urged the government to give the yard, which will be renamed H\u0026ampW (Appledore), more orders.InfraStrata said while the yard had been dormant in recent months and the acquisition came with only one employee – the site manager – the workforce could be “very quickly ramped up” if contracts for work were secured. Discussions were under way with the government and private vessel owners, InfraStrata said.John Wood, the company’s chief executive, said: “The acquisition at this point in time is opportunistic for the company and one that should not be missed. It not only gives us a strategic foothold in mainland UK but also makes the overall business highly competitive in the smaller and higher ends of the shipyard market, respectively.”The Appledore Shipyard dates back to 1865, and has built more than 300 vessels, including some of the Royal Navy’s latest aircraft carriers.Ian Waddell, the general secretary of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions, said: “The prospect of Appledore being reopened is great news for British shipbuilding and we welcome its purchase by InfraStrata.“Appledore played a vital role making the complex bows for the aircraft carrier and it could play a similar role building the future solid support ship which the government must build in Britain in order to invest in our regional economies and get the economy back up and running.”The GMB’s union regional organiser, Matt Roberts, said: “We are absolutely delighted with the confirmation that the yard will reopen. We have always firmly believed that the yard can be viable and thrive in the right hands.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb4d1780e1f6418d14e417151e11fe7e094b1a8d/0_97_5169_3101/master/5169.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9251ff8108caa6a3e41b57ab1f845c4c","title":"eat out to help out 64m meals claimed in uk under scheme","story":"The “eat out to help out” scheme encouraged more people into UK restaurants last week, taking the total number of meals claimed since the beginning of August to more than 64m – the equivalent of one for nearly every person in the country.The figures released by HM Revenue \u0026amp Customs suggest the scheme – where diners can claim a half-price discount up to a maximum of £10 per head on food and non-alcoholic drink on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays in August – has provided a much-needed boost for the embattled hospitality sector.In the run-up to the end of the scheme next week, the chancellor said the figures demonstrated how popular it had been so far, with 10.5m meals claimed in the first week, rising to 35m in the second and 64m by the third.“Today’s figures continue to show that Brits are backing hospitality – with more than 64m meals discounted so far, that’s equivalent to nearly every person in the country dining out to protect jobs,” Rishi Sunak said.He said the scheme, announced in his summer statement in July, had helped to protect the jobs of almost 2 million people working in hospitality, adding: “This scheme has reminded us how much we love to dine out.”Restaurants, pubs and cafes apply the discount to a customer’s bill and then claim the money back from the government.In a reflection of its widespread take-up, HMRC said £336m had been claimed so far, indicating that consumers were receiving a discount of about £5.25 per head on average.However, the bill for the Treasury is expected to rise further, with potential to surpass the £500m Sunak had originally budgeted for, as claims are expected to keep rolling in from the 84,000 outlets taking part until a deadline for submissions at the end of September.With the UK economy in the deepest recession since records began, Sunak has come under pressure to extend the scheme to support hospitality firms. Some venues are, however, planning to continue offering discounts once the scheme ends.According to Sky News, the Grosvenor Estate, which owns property in London’s West End, plans to cut rents for restaurants in its buildings that apply £10 per head discounts until the end of September.Visitor numbers to smaller cities and seaside towns have increased most as a result of the scheme, according to a study by the Centre for Cities thinktank. However, the continued absence of office workers from many big cities has meant places like London and Manchester have benefited least.Restaurants, bars and cafes were among the hardest hit businesses by lockdown, with a higher proportion of hospitality workers furloughed than in other sectors.Despite warnings that encouraging people to eat out would accelerate the spread of the virus, the scheme is designed to boost trade as the furlough scheme is wound down."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8f67852308c995d582d6b10e265a3b41ebbd9b2/332_1017_6653_3992/master/6653.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75dfe0b379ae3a8f1e227fd78307b934","title":"uk post lockdown sofa sales surge says dfs","story":"Post-lockdown sales of sofas have surged at the retailer DFS Furniture, as people bought new furnishings after months confined to their homes.“The thing that has been a pleasant surprise for us has been that people seem to be switching their spend into home as opposed to holidays, or leisure, or fashion,” said the DFS chief executive, Tim Stacey.Demand for made-to-order sofas has led to longer waiting times, which have increased from an average of 4-6 weeks usually seen as this time of year to 11-12 weeks.“We have 1,000 people in the UK making sofas every day and we are flat out at the moment,” said Stacey. The company is actively looking at investing in UK manufacturing, he added.However, the chain said it was difficult to forecast longer-term trading, given the ongoing effect of coronavirus on consumer confidence, and the potential impact of Brexit.“A boom in sofa sales makes perfect sense,” said Russ Mould, investment director at stockbroker AJ Bell, “After all, if you’re going to spend so much time at home, why put up with tatty seats, peeling wallpaper and fridges on the blink?”However, Mould cautioned that consumer spending on homewares might not last as people return to their offices, worry about their job security, or if the autumn and winter bring a rise in coronavirus cases.“DFS has effectively had an early Christmas present, and possibly seen a boost normally associated with Boxing Day and New Year sales,” Mould said. “But one has to wonder if DFS has already seen its peak earnings season this year.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39217b317499b6a70bcaf023556bcb83dd804f9a/0_25_4547_2728/master/4547.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=fbcbc026c96c0b78a94f244ad3ab702c","title":"last night proms land hope glory controversy","story":"The rightwing culture warriors are at it again, this time manufacturing a controversy about Land of Hope and GloryBeing British is very embarrassing, isn’t it? I first learned this when I was a child and saw an adult escalate themselves to actual anger over the order in which jam and cream go on a scone (it’s jam first the conversation is now over), and have been reminded of it every time I’ve seen it happen since. We are constantly arguing, asserting and demanding that the strict structure of Britishness is upheld, respected and adhered to, and we turn our heads inside-out with rage when it isn’t.You can set a bomb off in any British conversation with any of the following: “How do you think you say the letter ‘H’?” “If you had to take a knighthood off anybody, who would it be?” “Was my use of ‘off’ in that last sentence grammatically correct, or an unshakeable northernism?” “Do you think we have enough bank holidays?” We reveal who we are by the things we let make us angry.This is, of course, about the Last Night of the Proms, because what in life isn’t? The core of the story is: the Sunday Times reported that some people at the BBC held discussions about whether both Rule, Britannia and Land of Hope and Glory – both decent enough tunes, but no WAP – could be played as part of Last Night of the Proms. After some very mild consideration, the BBC announced that yes, they could. That’s the end of the story and the end of this piece, goodbye.Only, obviously not. We’re somehow now on day three of #Promgate, and the Daily Mail, Express and  – as well as about half of the government – are raging about what the Sunday Times in its headline gently refers to as the “BBC’s ‘Black Lives Matter Proms’”. The Times report hints at two theories as to why the songs might possibly have been up for review, one played on lead violin and one played quietly on the bassoon: either it’s because it’s logistically quite nightmarish to socially distance an 80-piece orchestra and 100 singers (Jan Younghusband, head of BBC music TV commissioning: “We have a lot of problems about how many instruments we can have. It is hard to know whether it is physically possible to do it”), or it’s because of some shady backroom BBC woke junta (a Times source, on Proms conductor Dalia Stasevska: “Dalia is a big supporter of Black Lives Matter and thinks a ceremony without an audience is the perfect moment to bring change.”)In the end, the Sunday Times leaves it open to interpretation. Which is the biggest threat to the fine and hearty tradition of the Proms, do you think? The looming ever-present of coronavirus? Or the completely uninvolved Black Lives Matter movement, which hates this country and the little flags this country insists on waving once a summer?Normal people would not care about any of this, but we do not live in a normal country. That is why we are now almost half a week into being mad about this. Cue the bombast: No 10 signalled, via a spokesperson, that Boris Johnson would be unhappy about changes to the Proms, and that while there are “strong emotions” about the line “Britons never shall be slaves”, “we need to tackle the substance of problems, not the symbols”.The same day the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, got his own flags down from the loft and waved them around as passionately as possible, adding: “Rule, Britannia and Land of Hope and Glory are highlights of the Last Night of the Proms. Confident forward-looking nations don’t erase their history, they add to it.” Nigel Farage looked up from the Wetherspoons app long enough to tweet: “So the BBC may drop Rule, Britannia and Land of Hope and Glory from the Proms because the Finnish conductor is too woke. Why not drop her instead?” Actor Laurence Fox mobilised his army of curious thinkers: “I feel so honoured to be British and part of the incredible and erse modern nation we have become. Without the past, we wouldn’t be where we are today. I wish the BBC would stop hating Britain so much.” Some grey noise from Keir Starmer, if you want to hear it: the “pomp and pageantry” is “a staple of British summer”, apparently.It was all so exciting that we almost missed the BBC confirming that both songs would be would be played, but as orchestral versions only, because there is no crowd to sing along. So, to clarify: it was a complete non-story from the off, an anonymous source said some ambiguous words about the Last Night conductor’s supposed intentions, the prime minister – still buzzing and shaking from a weekend on the Kendal mint cake – rushed to release a statement about it, and now that weird voting bloc of people who don’t watch Little Britain any more but were angry when it got taken off iPlayer are angry about the licence fee all over again.I hate to be the one saying “you know we’re in a pandemic, right?”, but you know we’re in a pandemic, right? If I didn’t know better, I’d think the political right was deftly exploiting our national inability to ignore culture-war bait in order to obfuscate bigger stories, like, I don’t know, the fact that things are going badly for the government, literally all of the time. How many more times do we have to watch this happen? What do four more years of this government have in store for us? Five hundred children somehow catch the plague due to government negligence and the Express front page is “EU demands hungry Brits RENAME Cornish pasties”? After the 2022 banking crash, Boris Johnson stands behind a podium and vows that, despite the rumours, “the woke left will never make poppies illegal”? The 2023 winter crisis in the NHS is so bad that Rishi Sunak is wheeled out to politely announce ITV will run Benny Hill repeats for the whole of autumn because “pinching bottoms is what Britain does best”?This country is just a dim eight-year-old, constantly in a tantrum, being distracted by the same penny-behind-the-ear magic trick and forgetting anything bad ever happened.

Instead they took to the airwaves to say they would stick to their plan for England’s schools to limit the spread of the disease by keeping children unmasked in “small bubbles”.The Scottish government did take the WHO seriously, announcing that secondary school pupils would have to wear face coverings when moving through corridors. This is a sensible strategy. Even homemade face coverings can protect both the wearer and others. Crucially their use helps prevent asymptomatic people from passing on the virus. Even with social distancing and handwashing, the evidence suggests that a face mask can still be effective indoors.Hence cabinet ministers on Tuesday morning were still insisting that there was no need to change the advice to parents and pupils that wearing a face covering was “not recommended” in schools. However, with pressure building from devolved administrations, the prime minister has been forced to U-turn. Gone are the objections. Schools in England can now require face masks and it will be mandatory in areas where Covid is spreading fast. Mr Johnson puts his retreat down to the shifting advice he receives. Yet the only new information is that from the WHO. Building a political project on being leery towards international organisations in the midst of a global pandemic comes at a price.

Director Francis Lee, who broke out with the acclaimed gay romance God’s Own Country, received criticism last year when it was announced that his film would focus on a romance that Anning shared with another woman, Charlotte Murchison, played by Ronan.“I do not believe there is any evidence to back up portraying her as a gay woman,” family member Barbara Anning said to the , calling the decision “sensational”. Another relative, Lorraine Anning, disagreed saying that “as long as it’s well presented and tastefully done” then it doesn’t matter.Lee defended the decision on Twitter writing: “After seeing queer history be routinely ‘straightened’ throughout culture, and given a historical figure where there is no evidence whatsoever of a heterosexual relationship, is it not permissible to view that person within another context?”Earlier this year, Lee also stated that “it’s not a biopic” but is inspired by Anning’s life and also his research into same-sex female relationships of the period. “The idea of two women actually in a relationship together was just not a thought anybody ever had within society,” he said.Anning’s contributions have recently achieved more attention with London’s Natural History Museum naming a room after her. She was also a candidate to have her face included on a £50 note.Ammonite was set to premiere at this year’s Cannes film festival but will now receive its first screening next month as part of this year’s Toronto film festival. It’s set to be one of the first unveiled contenders for an unusual awards season. Ronan has amassed four Oscar nominations, including most recently for Little Women, while Winslet has won one and received another six nods.Ammonite will be released on 13 November."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61ad15bbcd22d8b3272a41b84acbded0b9b3fa64/0_200_2784_1671/master/2784.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTUucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=812083894d02ef34858bd7212c88b3dc","title":"how to store summer flavours for winter cooking kitchen aide","story":"Make flavour while the sun shines in the form of pickled and fermented fruit and vegetables, and conjure up a taste of summer for the dark days of winter • Do you have a culinary dilemma? Email feast@theWhat should I be making batches of now, while it’s still summer, to add flavour to my winter cooking?Ben, SouthportLife is always better when sweet tomatoes and peaches are at hand, so it’s eminently sensible to want to feel their love in the winter dearth, too. August and September are the golden months for preserving a summer glut, so fill your boots and get sterilising those jars.As to what you should be preserving, the short answer, says Kylee Newton, author of The Modern Preserver, is “whatever you can get your hands on”. Tomatoes, however, are a good place to start. She blanches them whole, then peels, cores and covers in a large pan with salted water and boils for five minutes. “Sterilise one-litre jars and add a tablespoon of lemon juice and a teaspoon of sea salt to each,” Newton says, “then pack the still-hot jars with the drained, cooked tomatoes, leaving a 3cm space, cover with the hot cooking brine, 1cm from the rim, and seal with hot lids.”For longevity, Olia Hercules, author of Summer Kitchens, adds a little dash each of raw or good-quality vinegar and oil to jars of brine (25g salt to one litre water), garlic, allspice berries, dill and cherry tomatoes (this works with chillies and peppers, too). All tomatoes are welcome to Hercules’ preserving party: “Big, small, green or firm are also good, so if you’re growing them and they don’t ripen, not to worry.” These “flavour bombs” can then be used as a pickle, blitzed up into a sauce, added to broths (“to give acidity”) or, my personal favourite, “as a snack with vodka”.Courgettes are another go-to for Hercules: “They’re fantastic grated, or sliced thinly, and added to caramelised onions. Just cook it all down until it turns into a paste.” She stores in jars with a little oil on top, then uses as a pasta sauce, in stews, or simply spread on toast.“Stone fruits are also amazing,” Eagle says. “You can cook, dry, freeze or bottle them.” A sweet pickle, though, comes out tops: “Make a syrup but with vinegar – half sugar, half mild cider vinegar – then cook the prepared fruit in that for 30 seconds to a minute, or pour it hot over cherries and leave to steep.” The result? Sweet pickled fruit that’s mild enough to use in desserts but tangy enough to sit alongside cold meats and cheese. “You’ve also got the sweet vinegar, which you can use as a shrub for cordials and cocktails,” Eagle notes.Hercules is also a fan of stone fruit. “In Ukraine, we’re big on preserving peaches whole,” she says. “They’re so easy: make a sugar syrup. add interesting herbs such as lemon verbena or vanilla, then poach them whole. You’re basically making tinned peaches.” Her top serving tip: slice and add to a homemade cake with cream, or folded into the batter. Sounds just, er, peachy.• Do you have a culinary dilemma?

The Argentinian, who lost his job as the manager last November – or, in production terms, midway through episode one of the nine-part series – was not slow in telling Daniel Levy, the chairman, of his misgivings.It was a source of friction yet Levy was determined to press ahead. Perhaps, he was influenced by the money – Amazon paid Spurs around £10m – and, doubtless, his obsession with driving greater visibility for the club in north America came into it.Pochettino is not a fan of this kind of documentary for one simple reason. Footballers are not actors. They do not behave naturally when the camera is on them and so how can the product be authentic? Consequently, we have scenes such as the one at the training ground restaurant the day after Pochettino has been dismissed featuring the best supporting actor nominee, Jan Vertonghen.When Harry Kane says that he spoke to Pochettino the previous night, Vertonghen suggests he and his staff already knew.Kane explains that Pochettino was merely informed that he was “being sacked, you need to pack your things, you leave tonight”. Vertonghen shakes his head slightly and looks lost. And that’s a wrap.The first three episodes are fired mainly by Mourinho and the overarching theme is his mission to transform the Spurs squad from nice boys into “a bunch of cunts” – to use his phrase to harden their mentality to make them winners.Pochettino’s successor is shown settling into his office and unboxing a signed photograph from Vinnie Jones – the famous one in which the leader of Wimbledon’s Crazy Gang is grabbing Paul Gascoigne. “José, be good,” Jones has written. But Mourinho does not want that. He wants to have his rivals by the balls.Mourinho is shot on the training pitch with Davinson Sánchez. “You have balls?” he asks the central defender, who he faced in the 2017 Europa League final when he was in charge of Manchester United and Sánchez was at Ajax. United won 2-0 and Mourinho tells Sánchez that he and his Ajax teammates bottled it. Or words to that effect. “I won the game minute one,” he says with a smile.It has long been Mourinho’s trademark man-management trick – the insult packaged up in the jokey, blokey wrapper, designed to get a reaction. The best bits of the early episodes involve his relationship-building with Dele Alli.“Fucking lazy,” Mourinho tells the midfielder on his first day. “I am going to be a pain in the ass on you. And you are lucky because when I am a pain in the ass, it’s a good thing.”It was never going to be all or nothing with the documentary, rather how much? What would Spurs permit in the final cut? Would there be any controversy, any real juice? The short answer from the first three episodes is no, with the glaring omission being the lack of any Pochettino footage on the day he is dismissed. The rumours at the time that Amazon had it all or at least something are not borne out.We see Kane piping up in the postmortem after the December defeat at Manchester United to call out everybody for a repeated failure to stand up and be counted, which is good and, crucially, makes him look good like a true leader.We see Son Heung-min’s upset in the dressing room after his red card against Chelsea, indignation flaring before he sits down quietly, on the verge of tears. He later gives a nice-boy apology. We do not get any mention after the Everton game of Son’s involvement in André Gomes’s traumatic ankle break.Mourinho is allowed to dish it out, with one classic coming as the press officer, Simon Felstein, primes him to expect a question on betraying Chelsea at his media unveiling. “The betrayal is that I won three leagues for them and they sacked me,” Mourinho says.Christian Eriksen is expendable because of the nature of his January departure to Internazionale. “The problem we have with Christian is that none of us know what the real truth is,” Levy says to Mourinho. “His agent controls everything. And there is no dialogue between the club and his agent at all.”At one point, Mourinho says that he can try one more time to turn Eriksen. “At least then you know you’ve tried everything,” Levy adds. Memo to Spurs fans: we tried everything to keep him.It is all extremely polished but that is not to say it is not watchable and enjoyable. Where it scores points is in adding detail to established plotlines and characters. The depth of the respect that Mourinho has for Eric Dier is plain. Moussa Sissoko’s influence in the dressing room is talked up. Alli is good fun. Every Spurs supporter will tune in."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f713efaee6fc8295a9f75b9733b94ac2a2ef7354/43_188_1663_997/master/1663.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b9b93aa55170069d70ad975b268ba41","title":"harry maguire left to ponder a life turned upside down","story":"Maguire’s hard-earned status as a leader for club and country will be damaged by the guilty verdict delivered in GreeceNightmare. There is no other prescient characterisation of the past few days for Harry Maguire which culminated in Tuesday’s conviction of the Manchester United captain in a Greek court on the charges of aggravated assault, resisting arrest and attempted bribery following a night out in Mykonos on Thursday.Maguire, who pleaded not guilty to all counts, could surely not believe the judgment handed down by a three-member misdemeanours panel on the neighbouring island of Syros – or the punishment of a suspended prison sentence of 21 months and 10 days.The suspension is due to the charges being classed as “misdemeanours” and the acknowledgement of a previously clear criminal record. And, Maguire claims he is innocent and has launched an immediate appeal.Yet, for now, his world seems to be in freefall, the dreams made true through a combination of talent and relentless hard work soured. The long yet successful journey to become the leader of United and of England’s defence in danger of a reverse of who-knows-what proportions.Maguire is an intelligent man, his bland public pronouncements actually a shrewd move to ensure the wrong thing is not said. Yet he would not be human if in the coming days there are not fleeting moments of self‑recrimination in which he blames himself for a serious misjudgment that led to his current predicament: that following a few hours in which he was out enjoying drinks with family and friends in the Mediterranean sun his life has turned upside down.Squeaky-clean is one term for the persona Maguire previously presented. His glittering career began with a debut for his hometown team Sheffield United in the second half of a 3-0 defeat by Cardiff in April 2011. A £2.5m move to Hull followed in June 2014, after more than 130 league appearances for the Blades. Three years on Humberside included a three‑month loan spell at Wigan Athletic from February 2015 and the building of his reputation as an old-school, yeoman-type centre-back who could also play the nice stuff out from the back.His England debut came in October 2017, when he was selected by Gareth Southgate on the left of the three-man defence in England’s 1-0 victory away to Lithuania in a World Cup qualifier.The 6ft 4in Maguire had moved to Leicester City in a £17m transfer the previous summer and his performances attracted United’s attention. By the end of the season his club and international form – Maguire was the linchpin of an England defence that reached the 2018 World Cup semi-finals – had moved José Mourinho to identify him as a United target only for Ed Woodward and the executive vice‑chairman’s in-house football personnel to rebuff the idea because they felt the asking price of around £70m was too high.Throughout that period Maguire’s low-maintenance personality was evidenced by him refusing to agitate for the move or go public with any frustrations he might have felt. When it became obvious United had walked away he continued to keep his counsel and focused on the following season.That professionalism was rewarded: Ole Gunnar Solskjær replaced Mourinho in December 2018 and on becoming permanent manager the following spring told the club that Maguire was also his No 1 target to stiffen United’s defence.Woodward assented and Maguire was bought for £80m: a world record for a defender. By January his ascent was complete as he was made captain by Solskjær following Ashley Young’s departure. And when the pandemic-interrupted season ended last month Maguire had led United to third place and a Champions League spot for next season.The player must wonder now, though, if he will lose the United captaincy. He has been stood down by Southgate from next month’s England games and must endure a waiting game until his appeal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06169f656513deec50b616af6d08d06bbe30ca94/159_128_2841_1705/master/2841.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8277db23403f5df2c01810c37f33ab5","title":"wolfsburg v barcelona womens champions league semi final live","story":"Fridolino Rolfo scored the only goal of a game in which underdogs Barcelona dominated but missed a plethora of chances In other bad news for Barcelona ...

We were a little bit lucky but I’m still so proud we did it.” Caroline Graham Hansen speaks: “The goals were the difference today,” says the Barcelona midfielder, who played very well. “We played a good game and we had enough big goal chances to score at least three goals. But we scored zero and they had one goal out of nothing so, for me, it feels very hard .. this defeat. But we have to congratulate them and wish them all the best for the final.” On BT Sport: They’re’ve cobbled together a montage of Barcelona’s terrible misses. Oh my! How did they lose?!?!? Peep! Peep! Peeeeeep! It is all over and Wolfsburg are through to the final, where they will meet Lyon or Paris Saint-Germain. They were lucky - Fridolino Rolfo scored the only goal of the game for the German side in a match Barcelona should have won pulling a cart were it not for their astonishing profligacy in front of goal. The Spanish side had 16 attempts on goal, but only one on target. 90+4 min: Wolfsburg surge forward on the counter-attack and get the ball down toward the Barcelona goal-line. 90+2 min: Barcelona sub Aitana Bontami shoots wide of an empty goal but it wouldn’t have counted if she had hit the target. Woflsburg goalkeeper Frieerike Abt dashed off her line, ran into some traffic and won a free-kick in the build-up. 90+1 min: Four minutes. Barcelona really deserve an equaliser here. They came into this game as underdogs but have been the better team. 89 min: Wolfsburg win a throw-in deep in Barcelona territory, which they are in not a huge hurry to take. They play the ball down to the corner flag and try to keep it there. I’m not expecting much added time here - these ladies don’t really do time-wasting or injury-feigning. 86 min: Barcelona substituions: Vicky Tosada and Lieke Martens on for Ouahabi and Hamarout. Wolfsburg substitution: Lena Oberdorf on for skippper Alexandra Popp, who is injured. 84 min: Barcelona continue to pile on the pressure. Ouahabi finds herself in a shooting position on the edge of the box but elects to play the ball wide instead. Another chance goes etc, and so on. 80 min: Terrific defending from as Jenny Hermosa is unable to turn home an inch-perfect Hansen cross from the right from close range. Kathrin Hendrich was stuck to her like glue. Hermosa appeals for a corner but doesn’t get one. How on earth have Barcelona not scored? 79 min: Pernille Harder beats Jenny Hermosa for pace down the left flank, cuts inside Hamraoui and shoots feebly at Sandra Panos. A good chance for Wolfsburg goes to waste. 77 min: Barcelona substitution: Patricia Guijarro on for Alexia. Wolfsburg substitution: Pauline Bremer on for Ewa Pajor. 74 min: A neat passing move from Barca on the counter results in Jennifer Hermosa shooting wide from a great position in the penalty area. Brilliant work by Barca right-back Torrejon in the buildup. 72 min: Barcelona’s Marta Torrejon is booked for what looked like an excellent, perfectly timed tackle to me. Wolfsburg free-kick in the area between touchline and left side of the penalty area. The free-kick comes in and Barcelona’s Hamraoui heads a goal-bound header off the line. 70 min: With a goal in the bag, Wolfsburg have dropped a little deeper. Bonmati, the recently introduced substitute, shoots high over the bar after a decent gallop forward. Barcelona, the underdogs, have been the better team tonight but are losing. They’ve squandered so many chances ... 64 min: Barcelona’s Mariona Caldente gets on the end of a wonderful, inch-perfect Jennifer Hermoso pullback from the byline and somehow shoots over with the goal gaping. Another wonderful chance for Barca goes to waste. 63 min: Barcelona win a corner. The ball’s sent into the mixer and drops for a Hamraoui, who shoots on the turn. Her effort is put out for another corner. Nothing comes of it. Wolfsburg lead but are very much on the back foot. 60 min: Barcelona come close to restoring parity, with Asisat Oshoala meeting a cross from the left and heading just over the bar. In fact, replays show her header was tipped over the bar by Wolfsburg goalkeeper Abt, but neither the ref nor the lineswoman saw it. Oshoala protests, but to no avail. Wolfsburg lead! Fridolino Rolfo stabs home from point-blank range after Barcelona fail to clear an attempted Pernille Harder overhead kick. 55 min: The lord giveth and the lord taketh away - now Caldente wins a free-kick, drawing a foul from Sara Doorsoun. 53 min: Barcelona’s Mariona Caldente is booked for dragging Svenja Huth to the ground as the Wolfsburg right-winger galloped into the Barcelona half on the break. She’s taken one for the team, there, has Senorita Caldente. 52 min: Chance! Caroline Graham Hansen runs on to a through ball from Hansen and tries and fails to square the ball for Oshoala when she appeared to have the goal at her mercy. Wolfsburg clear and a wonderful chance for Barcelona goes begging. 50 min: Barca keeper Sandra Panos adjusts her feet and claws the ball wide after a cross from the right takes a deflection. From the corner, Wolfsburg skippper Alexandra Popp heads over. 49 min: After a poor enough first half, Wolfsburg are dominating the very early stages of this second period. Fridolina Rolfo is fouled and Wolfsburg have a free-kick just inside their own half. 47 min: Sandra Panos rushes to the edge of the box to clutch the ball to her chest, as Wolfsburg’s Polish striker Ewa Pajor stretches to get on the end of a through ball from Dominique Janssen. 46 min: Barcelona get the ball rolling for the second half in San Sebastian. There are no changes in personnel on either side. It’s all square at half-time: It’s been an absorbing encounter and the deadlock remains unbroken at the interval. Barcelona have been the better team but will be ruing their inability to trouble the scoreboard operator. Wolfsburg, the hot favourites, will be concerned. 45 min: Barcelona win a free-kick, in line with the right side of the Wolfsburg penalty area, about 30 yards from goal. Hansen whips the ball straight into the arms of Wolfsburg goalkeeper Friederike Abt. Barcelona are bossing this game at the moment.43 min: Barcelona’s Kheira Hamraoui hooks the ball over the bar from the edge of the Wolfsburg penalty area. 42 min: Quickfire chances at either end, as Huth heads feebly at Barcelona keeper Panos, moments after an unmarked Rolfo had fired narrowly wide for Wolfsburg from insdie the penalty area.

Britain has tighter laws than most countries on scooters, which it classes as motorised vehicles, and only those hired on a rental scheme can be used on roads in the trial zones.Coronavirus has accelerated demand for reform in the UK, but also deterred people from using shared schemes. In the early stages of lockdown, Lime and Bird closed down scooter operations in cities around Europe and North America.Lime, and the Swedish firm Voi, which will run the Northampton and Cambridge schemes starting in September, say every scooter will be disinfected on a daily basis, while Voi is covering its handlebars with antiviral copper tape.Firms vaunt the technology’s green credentials and appear to be going the extra mile to cut emissions, as well as addressing concerns over the life of scooters. The European startups Voi and Tier have pledged to use electric cargo bikes rather than vans in the daily servicing of the networks – redistributing scooters, charging batteries, doing repairs and disinfecting.This system is to be the first, and imminently launched in Tampere, Finland, but could it work here? In a London launch on Tuesday, Tier’s chief executive and co-founder, Lawrence Leuschner, unveiled a further pièce de résistance – a bespoke foldable helmet, stored in a box on the scooter frame, and surely destined for pillaging in the UK. Leuschner admits he is aware of the fate of Mobike, the Chinese bikeshare that retreated from Manchester after pulling battered bikes from canals.But, he says: “It’s important that we drive innovation and educate people – and if we do it in a sustainable and responsible way, rather than flooding the market with lots of different vehicles in lots of colours all over the pavements, I hope people will treat them responsibly.” He adds there is always an element of trouble, “not just in the UK”.Geofencing has improved to the point where firms say they can pinpoint the e-scooters’ location within a couple of metres, allowing them to know whether they are returned to specified bays where cities demand. Lime’s scheme will allow users to park at night almost anywhere within Milton Keynes, but they must take a picture to show it has been left appropriately, without blocking pavements.At £1 to unlock the scooter and 20p per minute, a prolonged ride quickly goes beyond bus fare territory, but Lime is hoping to entice riders with initial discounts and free rides for key workers. Clarke says the e-bike has already proved financially sustainable and scooters could be a bigger hit: “We believe there is going to be really high demand ... We’re in for the long haul.”Lime and others hope to have learned from teething problems abroad – as well as running potentially more highly regulated services in the UK. “How you engage with the city, police and community – disability organisations, residents and environmental groups – is really important.”London remains a prize target – although its authorities, scarred by the experience with Uber, are perhaps more reluctant to embrace firms promising technology solutions at the possible expense of existing systems. Transport for Londonsays it is open to “safe and sustainable” solutions but wants a coordinated trial across the capital, designed with all its communities and infrastructure in mind, adding its “viability and any geographical scope is yet to be determined”.Lime: A Silicon Valley startup that was notionally valued at $1bn within a year of launching in 2017, backed by Chinese capital.

Now a more positive story is emergingShortly before the infamous 1970 Isle of Wight festival, Stanley Dunmore, a local public health inspector, worried about “a possible breakdown of public order … if the festival is a failure, or falls short of expectations, or the weather is bad, or facilities which the fans expect to find in the town are not available”.His observations, made when music festivals were in their infancy, confirm some things that we know about them today – if only Billy McFarland and Ja Rule had read Dunmore’s report before the spectacular failure of Fyre festival. These events are complex and expensive to coordinate, especially in remote settings with inebriated and underprepared crowds cowed by the weather. If things go wrong, disaster can ensue.Isle of Wight 1970 became the British festival that we associate with disaster. The myth goes that a group of young men, out to make a few quid from youthful music fans, put on the largest-ever pop festival in Britain at the time. To protect their investment and rake in gate receipts, they erected fencing around the site to contain the crowd of 600,000 and exclude troublemakers. Building on a few references in the press, the popular image is of radicals and French anarchists flooding down from Desolation Hill, which overlooked the festival site, and ripping down the fencing. In a recent article on Joni Mitchell’s performance, the  reported that “fights broke out, objects were thrown, and a lot of bad acid was taken”.But it is easy to get the wrong impression about the 1970 festival. It has been mythologised and attacked for personal and political reasons, but against most criteria other than finances (a £40,000-£60,000 loss), the evidence that I unearthed for my first book reveals a beguiling and misunderstood story. It suggests the festival was not as bad as it seems – in fact, at the time some saw it as the British Woodstock.The first Isle of Wight festival, in 1968, attracted about 8,000 festivalgoers to Hell Field near Godshill. Three Labour-supporting brothers in their early 20s brought to the island from Derbyshire during childhood, Ray, Bill and Ronald Foulk, instigated the festival to raise funds to build a municipal indoor swimming pool.The 1969 festival exceeded their wildest expectations. Bob Dylan, who had hardly played live since his motorbike accident in 1966, attracted the world’s media and 80,000 to 100,000 festivalgoers. Ray Foulk says the 1969 festival was not without hiccups – he told me that “the catering was not adequate we were ripped off and the public were”, and a lack of toilets led to long queues. But the promoters learned on their feet and overcame these problems good weather did not test the amenities at the site, now in Wootton. There was a headline performance from the Who, and Dylan’s appearance was a culturally significant moment – a pilgrimage – for the postwar generation.It teed up the 1970 festival, one of the largest outdoor gatherings in Britain since the war, even if the figure of 600,000 is probably an overestimate. The event might not have taken place if local councillors, well-connected islanders and their Conservative MP, Mark Woodnutt, had had their way. In letters to the environment department, Woodnutt argued that the festival could cause a polio epidemic (the island had suffered one in 1949) and that the 1969 festival had “left a scene of indescribable filth”. However, he would need a high court injunction to stop the festival, and proof that the festival was a threat to public and environmental health rather than simply a nuisance.Mindful of a a possible injunction, the Foulks’ company Fiery Creations reminded the council of the lack of trouble during the 1969 festival and the good publicity the island received because of the event. Dunmore, the health inspector, and Douglas Quantrill, the island’s chief medical officer, alleviated sanitation and safety fears, and helped coordinate organisations from macrobiotic caterers to National Rail.Without legal recourse, local pressure groups and councillors disingenuously claimed the island lacked suitable sites for a large festival and pressured landowners into refusing to rent land. The East Afton site was only agreed in early August, weeks before the festival opened at the start of the bank holiday. The valley, flanked by a hill on National Trust property and near idyllic beaches below white cliffs, would soon host a stage, 20 turnstiles, 66 food and drink stalls, 500 toilets and 600 feet of urinals.Reports from the time, and footage, suggest that the crowd witnessed some stunning performances. The lineup included the Who, Miles Davis, Joan Baez, Joni Mitchell, the Moody Blues, Jethro Tull, Sly and the Family Stone and Gilberto Gil Jimi Hendrix played one of his last performances before his death. Recently rediscovered photographs taken by Peter Bull show calm and content festivalgoers, who resemble their contemporary counterparts aside from their attire, lack of mobile phones and the fact that they’re nearly all sitting down.There were disturbances, though. A group, no more than 200 of those camping on Desolation Hill, attempted to break down the perimeter wall the day before the festival began. Later, on Sunday morning, organisers and audience argued when security cleared the inner arena for Jethro Tull’s soundcheck and to check tickets. At 4pm on Sunday afternoon, MC Rikki Farr declared the festival free (to the horror of Ray Foulk who was standing in the crowd) and, after the announcement, the inner arena wall was dismantled from the inside by ticket holders, prompting a queue of concerned workers and creditors seeking immediate payment backstage. There were 117 arrests for possession of drugs.Conflicts do not feature prominently in the official record, however. Douglas Osmond, the chief constable of Hampshire police, dressed up like a hippy and went incognito on Desolation Hill for a day. He claimed to see less violence than at a typical football match and concluded that “people become unduly anxious about these gatherings”.Every national newspaper reported on the festival, with some of them, glad for news in August, printing extensive coverage. These generally positive reports were punctuated by scurrilous stories about sex and drugs, outraged locals and photographs of nude (mostly female) bodies. The Sunday Mirror’s account explained: “This isn’t quite paradise. But if you are young and can look after yourself and the sun stays out and the music stays loud, it doesn’t matter.”It is interesting, then, that a view of the festival as a disaster has come to dominate. Organisers blame the late documentary film-maker Murray Lerner. Fiery Creations and Lerner wanted to emulate the success of the 1970 Woodstock documentary, which took just under $50m at the US box office, but their Isle of Wight film did not find a distributor until 1997 and the delay caused acrimony. Ray Foulk, particularly in the second volume of his book When the World Came to the Isle of Wight, and Peter Harrigan, Fiery Creations’ publicist, allege that Lerner removed footage of isolated incidents of trouble from their context and spliced them between performances for drama. For instance, Lerner’s documentary edited the footage of arguments in the main arena on Sunday morning to include shots of some drunken jeering and stray beers thrown at a lighting tower. The film exaggerates the intensity, significance and extent of either disturbance. It was, Foulk said, “complete fakery” and “besmirched not just the festival but a whole generation of people”. Indeed, he argues that the festival was only declared free to benefit Lerner’s documentary in the first place.The organisers also made the mistake of inviting International Times (IT), a London-based countercultural paper, to view the site under construction. As head of the British White Panthers, its editor, Mick Farren, published communiques in pamphlets and IT that encouraged resistance. He saw the increased price (to £3, about the price of a double album) and security as an affront to his left-libertarian view that music festivals should be free, and claimed that the fences, security dogs and turnstiles evoked prison camps.After losing £6,000 on their own free festival a month before, Phun City near Worthing, the 1970 Isle of Wight festival provided Farren and his peers a chance for some agitprop myth-making to champion the radical underground. Take Jean-Jacques Lebel, the only one of the “French anarchists” that can be identified from the festival despite that phrase recurring in several accounts – thanks to his involvement in the counterculture, Lebel could amplify his role in the festival’s mythology and its political significance through the underground press.Farren’s fear about repression and exploitation were not misplaced, but misdirected. The idea that festivals had radical potential, alongside stigma concerning festivalgoers’ propriety, took hold, and exacerbated the anxieties and prejudices of conservative Isle of Wight residents. The county council had received calls to stop pop festivals since 1969 – one letter described festivalgoers as “social parasites” – and following the 1970 event Woodnutt introduced legislation to prevent another festival on the island. The council now had complete discretion over licenses for overnight events with a crowd over 5,000, and organisers would have to give four months’ notice. Subsequently, there were no further festivals there there until 2002.Other rural areas wanted similar control and Conservative MP Jerry Wiggin’s Night Assemblies Bill offered it. The bill proposed criminalising any outdoor gathering of 1,000 people or more between midnight and 6am unless the organisers applied to a local authority at least four months before and provided financial guarantees.The bill did not, however, define the “pop festival” clearly and therefore threatened the right to free assembly. The National Council for Civil Liberties argued it would “stifle political opinion and prevent activity at a time when too much emphasis is being put upon law and order at the expense of justice and liberty”, and the bill failed.It exposed, though, tension between young people, the counterculture and rural British conservatism. The vitriol aimed at pop festivals, and the types of social change that they were seen to represent, is startling. Great Western festivals ran into to trouble, for instance, in Tollesbury, Essex, in 1972 when trying to find a festival site (it ultimately settled on Bardney, Lincolnshire). The local villagers burned effigies of the organisers, Lord Harlech and the actor Stanley Baker – the type of hip capitalists that countercultural radicals also feared. A local explained that this was because the festival would cause the “sheer rape of our way of life”. The panic over festivals became a trope for bored reporters in the summertime and justification for heavy-handed policing, as those brutally attacked by Thames Valley police at the Windsor free festival in 1974 will attest.Quantrill, meanwhile, became a public health celebrity, if there is such a thing. Councils sought him out for advice on festivals and at the Royal Society of Health Symposium in 1971 he argued, in what became a widely circulated paper, that there was little risk in a reasonably well-planned festival such as the Isle of Wight 1970. The government select committee issued an official code of practice to guide local authorities and festival organisers, undermining “anarchic” or free festivals by giving local authorities clearer grounds for injunctions if a festival did not meet the code’s expensive recommendations. Without significant capital and a willing council, it made it harder for enthusiastic amateurs such as Fiery Creations to run a festival, leaving rural landowners and posh hipsters increasingly in charge.When you attend the modern-day music festival, however, you are, in a sense, stepping into a world made by three brothers, their friends and a handful of kindly civil servants.

The pandemic has simply accelerated that transformation, he said ahead of a British Retail Consortium webinar on the impact of Covid-19.Even an industry that has weathered its fair share of storms has never seen an event of this size and significance, and it’s becoming clear that the rules of engagement are changing. As retailers navigate uncharted waters, these are the rules that matter right now:Put safety firstAbove all, responsible businesses have to prioritise safety, both for staff and customers. According to Kyle Monk, head of retail insights and analytics at the British Retail Consortium, retailers are working hard on both implementing safety measures and communicating them clearly. Luckily, technology is on our side when it comes to designing systems that put safety first, but not at the expense of the customer experience. He cites a technology company that has shop assistants available by video screen in-store. The remote shop assistants can engage with you in a similar way in which they would normally.While it may seem at first that the new retail environment will not make the most fun of shopping experiences, with creativity, innovation and by utilising tech, companies can get the balance right.Be collaborative“The scale of the pandemic and the speed with which we’ve had to adopt a new way of living has left many of us feeling uncertain – especially retailers,” says Andrew Lawson, senior vice-president EMEA for Zendesk, a customer relationship management software company. The good news, however, is that a sense of optimism is emerging as businesses deal successfully with unstable operating conditions. “We’ve seen incredible stories of resilience coming out of the pandemic, as retailers and their suppliers band together to maintain the flow of goods,” says Lawson.This collaborative spirit will be important for the industry if it is to retain momentum, share best practice and agree about what support may be needed from the government. “It’s kind of unprecedented,” says Monk. “I don’t think, to be honest, any other industry is coordinating in the way that retail is at the moment.”PrioritiseWhile some retailers have launched e-commerce platforms in record time – one European chain that had around 1,000 stores but no e-commerce platform, managed to launch one in 13 weeks – Lawson suggests that incremental digital transformation might be the better way forward. Zendesk is finding that many of its customers are reluctant to invest time and money in total digital transformation when there is still so much uncertainty. “The priority is to identify solutions that can deliver returns on investment quickly,” he says. “For example, by looking at an omnichannel approach, you can bring all the information you have on a customer together in one place. This will provide your marketing and sales teams with invaluable insights.”Support your staffWe may never return to business as usual but, according to Lawson, companies can move forward by supporting and listening to feedback from staff. He also emphasises the connection between a happy and valued workforce, and the ability to be agile, scalable and resilient. “By helping employees adapt to new systems and processes through training and regular communication, and by really listening to feedback, the new styles and systems that we work under really can work for everyone,” he says.Appeal to your fansThere has never been a better time for companies to revisit their core purpose – building a trusted and valued brand. Research from Zendesk shows that customers have been more patient during the pandemic. While the volume of service requests and wait times have gone up, customer satisfaction remains fairly steady, indicating brand loyalty. Customers will support the brands that they want to succeed, says Monk.And Gibb believes successful retailers won’t have customers going forward, they’ll have loyal fans – people who care deeply about what that brand really stands for. For decision-makers in the retail business, who feel that the ground is constantly shifting beneath them, focusing on purpose could provide a much needed stable foundation.Things are changing fast.

Now everyone faces a new issue: how to return to some semblance of business normality.“The world of work – particularly how we think about work and how we think about where we work, has fundamentally shifted,” says coach and productivity expert Karen Eyre-White. “A lot of businesses have been in crisis mode. What we’re seeing now is them having to get back to a new normal with strategy, boundaries and structure in place.”Some things haven’t changed. As before, high productivity will be a priority – particularly given the gloomy economic predictions. Achieving it depends on motivation, training and technology, time management and support from others. But how can businesses make sure they have these essentials in place as we move out of lockdown and get back to work?Have clarity of purposeWith so much uncertainty around, business leaders need to reassure staff by projecting confidence and clarity wherever possible. “Try to be certain about as much as you can,” says Eyre-White, whether that involves scheduling regular catch-up meetings, or deciding the office won’t reopen until next year. Managers can boost their own productivity and that of their team by being clear about their priorities for any given day or week, and encouraging others to do the same.Aligning those priorities with the company’s objectives will keep even a remote team moving in the right direction, says Chris Bailey, author of Hyperfocus: How to Work Less to Achieve More. “The greatest challenge that businesses face in normal times is orienting what everybody’s working on toward what the purpose of the business is … and that’s still the case,” he says. “The more intentional we are about how we work and what we work on, the more productive we become.”Where priorities have changed, it’s important to communicate that effectively to staff, says Sarah Manning, senior HR director at Zendesk, a customer relationship management software company. “I can’t imagine many organisations didn’t have to pivot in some way in lockdown. Leaders need to be really clear now about what the expectation of their teams are going to be and put in measures to help people adapt.”Empower staff to find their way of workingProductivity can be difficult to measure, but focusing on the tasks achieved rather than the hours someone is at their desk can boost efficiency. Despite reports that lockdown led to an upsurge in demand for workforce surveillance tools, Eyre-White says that such an approach is unlikely to be effective. “Inidually, everyone needs to do different things in order to be productive,” she adds. “I just do not see how a surveillance system is compatible with that.”Instead, businesses should be encouraging staff to find what works for them – some people might be most productive if they go for a walk in the morning, others might take short breaks after 45 minutes of focused work, while some team members might need to work around a young family at home.Projecting empathy for the circumstances many of us find ourselves in is important, says Manning. Particularly at present. “Life is crazy right now. I think employers need to acknowledge that.”Promote good communicationWhen it comes to managing virtual teams, good communication is key to ensuring staff feel supported and informed. “Once a company has made a decision, communicate it clearly,” says Manning. “You need to be careful not to go out with half a message and cause a whole lot of anxiety for people.”Keeping communication channels open can promote a culture of collaboration.Apps such as Zoom, Slack, other digital tools and internal help desks can help ensure “people still feel engaged, connected and therefore invested”, says Manning. Zendesk, for example, has held remote quizzes, yoga classes and Friday night drinks during lockdown. There are other examples of companies holding digital book clubs, remote murder mystery games, and scavenger hunts.“Anything you can do as a manager to foster meaningful connections between employees will go a long way,” Bailey says.It’s OK to have down timeStaff may be working from home, but it’s important not to encourage an “always on” culture that blurs the boundaries between work life and home life, Eyre-White says. “There’s this idea of e-presenteeism and needing to be seen,” she adds. “Staff can’t be seen in the office so they may feel they need to be replying to their emails or messages instantly. And that’s not how you get productive work done. You need time away from those things. Businesses need to be clear that it’s OK.”One way to set the tone is to offer training to managers to help them adapt to working with, and supporting, remote teams. Simple measures can set an example, such as resisting the temptation to email outside work hours, and blocking out time for breaks on a calendar that the team has access to.No one should feel guilty about taking a break from work, says Bailey. “Focusing on things all day long is one of the worst things we can do because our mind just needs a chance to wander. Mind the guilt that you experience around relaxation and know that it’s a phenomenon most of us experience.”Embrace flexibilityAlongside the difficulties of the past few months, for many firms there have also been opportunities for lasting change.“If going remote didn’t kill a business, companies are going to have to decide their answer when employees ask: ‘Can I work from home?’” Manning says. “There are huge benefits from a cost perspective … and I do think companies can potentially attract more candidates and more ersity.”Staying flexible – and that might mean some staff work remotely in the long term – will help foster an inclusive, productive culture that has broader benefits.“This has definitely opened our eyes up to those different possibilities,” Manning adds. “We are going to have a much more flexible approach to where people can work and how they work.”Things are changing fast.

A huge drop in sales during March seemed to sound the death knell for at least some sectors of the industry. Online sales, on the other hand, have rocketed and new approaches are emerging among those retailers that are learning to be agile.“Covid-19 has really accelerated a bunch of inevitables. A lot of things are just happening a lot faster,” says Steve Hewett, global vice president for retail customer experience at the tech and consultancy firm Capgemini.For many companies, online is exploding. “This was already happening,” says Hewett. “But some companies are achieving the sort of online growth in weeks that they expected in three or four years.”This has implications for how companies do business, and it’s likely to be crucial to be able to deliver a hybrid onlineoffline experience to the post-Covid-19 customer. Here are five trends currently reshaping the retail sector:Brands are getting chattierIt seems that customers engaged with brands more during lockdown. “For years, buying something meant going to a physical place, seeing the branding in the store and understanding who that brand is,” says Adrian McDermott, president of products at Zendesk, a customer relationship management software company. “We need to establish the digital equivalents of finding, meeting and having those conversations.”Prices could remain “sticky”Rajesh Bhargave, a consumer behaviour expert, suggests that retailers need to be wary of changing their prices – whether up or down. “Consumers tend to remember what they paid previously and would view price increases as unjust in poor economic conditions.”Dropping prices is not always the answer either. Many consumers will have taken a financial hit and their wallets will be closed for concessionary spending. A knee-jerk reaction might be to cut prices to bring back that demand but, says Bhargave, associate professor of marketing at Imperial College Business School in London, this could have negative long-term effects and erode pricing power: “If you’ve been paying £10 for a meal and suddenly that’s £8 you start to wonder about the quality of the meal.”Brands have to add valueInstead of dropping prices, brands are likely to start looking at different ways to add value, says Bhargave. “If people want to dine at restaurants, they might want a more private and safe experience,” he says. “So how can you start offering a different service that charges a higher price and offers better value?”Video calling is another area that business is only starting to explore. “With so much taking place on Zoom, is there a higher-end service you can provide in this area?” Selfridges, for example, is offering online beauty and styling appointments, with products then delivered to customers at home.This is part of a move towards getting more revenue from fewer people, and appointments for in-store shopping also fall into this category. “It’s all part of offering a more customised, high-end experience,” says Bhargave.To bring the joy back into shopping, some stores are putting their energies into their window displays to encourage browsing and others are providing queue entertainment.The need for a new kind of agilityThings may never be the same. “We’ve almost got to hit the reset button,” says Hewett. “People are returning to school and the office and there’s no playbook on what the wants and needs are.” Moreover, whatever they are could change dramatically again. Hewett adds: “There’s an organisational need for agility that wasn’t there before, as brands aren’t able to be as tactical as they would like.”Things are changing fast. But you can be faster.

Despite government support, having to close their doors for months had a crippling effect on many and forced them to take action to keep afloat.For Steve Sanderson, founder of the independent menswear retailer Oi Polloi, lockdown pressed fast forward on an already tough situation for small businesses. The company’s store in Manchester has always been at its heart, but it also has a strong online and social presence. “Bricks and mortar operations are really difficult,” he says. “What’s going on at the moment is sort of a super fast wormhole journey into the future.”Sanderson says that things are going to be particularly tough for fashion stores, with an inevitable drop in footfall, plus the issues of being Covid-19-secure, such as being unable to let customers try on clothes unless the items are quarantined or cleaned afterwards. “If people can’t try things on, why would they come in to a clothes shop?” he asks.There are, though, some rays of hope. “We have a good connection with customers through our bricks and mortar business, and certain people will always like that. But we can’t afford to just be open – we have to find a way of making it work.“We’ll have to adapt and become something else, something people can’t get from anywhere else. I like the idea of click and collect because you can do something quite interesting with that. You could then also narrow down the time the store itself is open.”For Michelle Drew, co-founder of Established 25 Atelier, which sells fashion and home accessories, the coronavirus crisis forced her to reassess her ambitions. Before lockdown, Drew, who started in 2017 making scarves and bags for friends and family, was selling at a quarterly design market in Greenwich and had a monthly stall at Spitalfields market. When Covid-19 brought things grinding to a halt, her first thought was that she needed to get her website up and running, and really engage online. “I didn’t have a choice,” she says.Since then, Drew has joined online workshops and used the time to rethink her plans. “Previously, I thought I’d love to collaborate with other designers and have a premises. I’m now wondering if that’s the way forward, because so much has changed and I’m not sure things will ever be the same.”While Drew plans to return to physical selling at some point, she sees her business relying more on online trading. “It’s still a precarious situation. I definitely will return to the markets because I enjoy the contact, but I’m looking at other ways to move the business forward.”Bigger retailers, too, have faced challenges, for all their greater resources. Some have come through with flying colours, though, particularly if they had the right technology to hand.For Tesco, the coronavirus crisis brought an unprecedented surge in demand, but the company was well placed to react quickly. It already had emergency plans in place thanks to a “doomsday” management exercise four years ago. It had also embraced remote working, and had the technology to handle communication with 460,000 staff, suppliers, people services and security operations. These systems allowed the company to double its capacity for delivery and click and collect in just six weeks. Improvements to the computer algorithms used to drive picking technology – plus the army of pickers hired to cope with the increased demand – mean that whatever the future brings, the chain appears to have the flexibility to deal with it.Similarly, the online flower delivery company Bloom \u0026amp Wild proved its resilience. For its founder Aron Gelbard, protecting jobs by staying open was important, as was providing people with a way of showing they care for the loved ones they couldn’t see in lockdown.With its tailored CRM system, which manages queries from a range of channels, Bloom \u0026amp Wild now employs more than 25 customer service agents who manage between 3,000 and 3,500 inquiries every week – rising dramatically during peak times such as Valentine’s Day, Mother’s Day and, undoubtedly, lockdown.The company uses Zendesk to manage its customer relationships, allowing agents to deal with inquiries across Twitter, email, phone, online chat, Facebook Messenger and SMS. Alongside this, analytics help the company forecast customer demand and plan for peaks.As a business that exists purely in the virtual world, it’s an example to retailers everywhere of what can be achieved by clever use of technology.Things are changing fast.

The skies were grey, the pitch was brown and the ball, 61 overs old, had lost its shine and its hardness. Azhar Ali, suddenly the man in form, was on strike and seeing the ball well.There had not been much movement out there as Anderson delivered his 33,717th ball in Test cricket. To no one’s great surprise it landed on a length just outside off stump. But unlike so many of its predecessors in this game the ball seemed to gather speed and height off the blandest Test pitch of the summer. It took the edge of Azhar’s bat and flew quickly towards Joe Root at first slip. The England captain was not going to drop this one.He tossed the ball high in the air and then abandoned any social distancing – they have been in their bubble a long time – as he embraced his senior bowler, who, unlike two nights ago after a trio of catches had gone begging, was beaming broadly.The old union members, Stuart Broad and Chris Woakes, now surrounded him and the bashful smile was still there. He held up the ball to the empty stands and the photographers snapped away in the knowledge that their day’s work was nearly done. The great bowlers employed by Sky, Shane Warne (708 wickets) and Wasim Akram (414), came out on to their balcony to applaud.Before too long the next man in, Asad Shafiq, had taken guard. Anderson was soon at the end of his mark. He turned, cruised in to propel his 33,718th delivery it was on a length just outside off stump. Of course it was.Anderson’s delight was a mixture of elation and relief. He has never sought the limelight and it was probably a blessing to get this landmark out the way with the minimum of fuss. One wondered what delighted him the most, reaching 600 or demonstrating to one and all that he is not finished yet. Probably the latter.This has been the most testing surface for pacemen in the series, especially when the ball grows old, and Anderson, in his 39th year, has been the most effective of all of them. Hence the notion of saving him for home Tests only does not have that much cricketing logic.However, that is for another day. England do not know yet where they will be playing their next Test. Aside from Anderson’s landmark, this one petered out with the minimum of drama. Play could not start until 4.15pm, which gave England a potential 42 overs to find Anderson a wicket and win the game. The former was always going to be the easier task.Azhar was unfortunate to receive the only ball to misbehave on Tuesday. Without his efforts in the first innings Pakistan would have lost the match. Moreover, he has led a side who have battled in alien conditions both on and off the field throughout the entire series. It transpired that the outcome was decided by a dizzy partnership on Sunday in Manchester when Jos Buttler and Woakes turned the tables on the final afternoon of the first Test.Pakistan could easily have ended up winning this series 1-0 since they were favourites to prevail in that match on the Sunday morning, which serves to emphasise the talent in Azhar’s side and the scope for them to become a major force at Test level. Greater impetus can come from the increasing chance of more Test cricket being played in Pakistan, with England now one of the likelier sides to tour there soon.At the moment Pakistan’s bowling is more potent than their batting though there was time for Babar Azam to demonstrate his undoubted class with some wonderfully crisp strokeplay during his unbeaten 63. He should adorn world cricket for a decade.Shafiq fell to Root’s off-spin in the approved manner, caught off bat and pad at short leg by the substitute fieldsman, James Bracey. Anderson bowled a couple of overs with the second new ball but then the players decided to call it a day and there were warm fist pumps and also some end-of-bubble handshakes between the sides.Like West Indies before them, Pakistan’s cricketers have decorated an extraordinary summer in which we have been reminded, despite the pandemic and the downpours, that Test cricket can produce captivating drama that the other forms of the game struggle to match – as well as some memorable little moments. On Tuesday we had to be satisfied with one of those moments."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b72675795093d800ce69286c3f9425329f345137/2_0_3021_1814/master/3021.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c51f520395d294ffd0a84c0f347f53d8","title":"tour de france 2020 full team by team guide","story":"Our in-depth look at every team, the riders to watch and the cast of characters tearing through FranceCitroën arrive as co-sponsor next year and major changes loom with Romain Bardet leaving for Sunweb this will be their last Tour in the shape that has delivered six stage wins since 2013, three podiums plus climber’s and team prizes. A stage win is the minimum goal, but they can push for more if momentum builds.Main man Bardet has been the mainstay since 2014 he won the climber’s prize last year and will again target stage wins. Looked to be riding into form at the Dauphiné and French championship.Second ision squad with a strong multinational lineup led by climbers Nairo Quintana and Warren Barguil. “Wawa” has yet to truly kick on after a stellar 2017, when he won two stages and the mountains jersey, but France still hopes. Yorkshire’s Connor Swift, cousin of GB national champion Ben, makes his debut.Main man Quintana. Giro winner in 2014, the Colombian’s best days may be behind him but he is still a redoubtable presence and possible winner whenever the mountains loom.Team founded for the greater glory of Kazakhstan now largely reliant on Spaniards and Colombians. No room for Denmark’s Tour of Lombardy winner Jakob Fuglsang but they are a strong bunch of stage hunters such as lone Kazakh Alexey Lutsenko and Spanish champion Luis León Sánchez.Main man Miguel Ángel López. “Superman” was the coming man a few years back but has plateaued and isn’t really a candidate for overall victory. Worth watching in any mountain stage though.Their first Tour with the former GB academy head Rod Ellingworth in charge. There was no place for an unfortunately off-form Mark Cavendish, so it’s all in for Mikel Landa Sonny Colbrelli will show on the hillier sprint days and Matej Mohoric, Wout Poels and Damiano Caruso can step up in the mountains if Landa falters.Main man Landa. Enigmatic Spanish climber who has finished sixth, seventh and fourth in the past three Tours. An outside bet for victory given this year’s mountains but didn’t look at his best in the Dauphiné.Second ision French team who have pushed for a Tour spot for several years. They’ve finally made it but the squad looks underpowered so a stage win for Pierre Rolland or sprinter Bryan Coquard is the dream daily duties in doomed breakaways with Total Direct Energie and Israel Start Up Nation are a more likely reality.Main man Rolland. At the end of a 15-year career, so the days when he mopped up mountain stages are a distant memory. He has looked strong this August and hope springs eternal.GC contender Max Schachmann barely made the start after a crash, “Emu” Buchmann is getting over a broken collarbone, so it’s all about cycling’s biggest showman, Slovakia’s Peter Sagan, who is going for his eighth green points jersey. Lennard Kämna will target the mountain days but in this Tour it’s only really about one man.Main man Sagan is rarely fast enough to outpace pure sprinters, but can do far more than enough on the hilly days to win green. As he has every year bar one since 2012.The sponsoring shoe company leaves at the end of the season due to the Covid recession. Riders were jumping ship before August ended this doesn’t bode well as several of the Tour squad will be thinking about finding jobs for next year. They are a talented group of iniduals but may lack cohesion.Main man There isn’t one. Matteo Trentin, Greg Van Avermaet and Ilnur Zakarin are former stage winners who give the team potential on all terrains Jan Hirt is a strong climber.Longstanding also-rans who shockingly haven’t won a stage since 2008, but have added some serious oomph to this year’s squad with sprinter Elia Viviani and climber Guillaume Martin. A stage win for the Italian and a top 10 for the Frenchman would justify their promotion to WorldTour status.Main man Martin. Erudite Frenchman with a master’s in philosophy, author of “Socrates on a Bike” finished 12th overall last year and was a promising third at this year’s Critérium du Dauphiné.A two-pronged attack for cycling’s strongest all-round squad: Ireland’s Sam Bennett targets sprints and Julian Alaphilippe is after everything else. Bennett is on fire with two wins since the season restart and the aggressive Alaphilippe is clearly finding form, although he’s not quite at last year’s level just yet.Main man Alaphilippe. France’s 2019 darling thanks to a long spell in yellow mountains winner in 2018. The dapper musketeer swears he only wants a stage win. Believe that and you’ll swallow anything.American squad with a dilemma target the overall with Rigoberto Urán or stage wins with everyone else? Alberto Bettiol, Jens Keukeleire and Tejay van Garderen can target the hilly stages, Lancastrian Hugh Carthy – on his debut – Sergio Higuita and Daniel Martínez will fly in the high mountains. It’s a question that the road will decide.Main man Urán. Hugely experienced Colombian, now 33 who finished seventh last year without hitting his level of 2017 when he came second and won a stage. Anything near that would be welcome.This most traditional of French teams is built around one man, Thibaut Pinot new French champion Arnaud Démare stays at home although his form merited a call-up. Pinot will not lack in support if his No 2 David Gaudu hits form but all France will be wondering if he can deal with the pressure.Main man Pinot. Enigmatic but vulnerable Frenchman, who was heading for the podium last year until he succumbed to a leg injury. Form looks good but he was unable to keep his head on the final day in the Dauphiné.One simple goal: victory. Nothing else matters after seven wins in eight years, six as Team Sky. Stuttered badly at the recent Criterium du Dauphiné but should dominate the many mountain stages. A fine mix of all-rounders guided by road captain Luke Rowe with 2019 Giro winner Richard Carapaz as reserve leader.Main man Egan Bernal. The Colombian won convincingly last year and rode strongly to win the Occitanie Tour in early August. Pulled out of the Dauphiné to nurse his back but still starts favourite.Chris Froome’s 2021 team make their Tour debut, a curious mix with veterans in Dan Martin – assuming he has got over his Dauphiné crash – and André Greipel and a pure locomotive in Nils Politt fortunately sprinter Hugo Hofstetter is in form, but they will find it hard figuring out where they fit.Main man Martin. Likable Birmingham-born Irishman with a proven Tour record of two stages and three top 10s. He is struggling with injury but should make the start.Their “trident” of leaders became a pitchfork when Steven Kruijswijk injured his shoulder, and there are doubts about the fitness of co-leader Primoz Roglic. If Roglic starts and finds form, they will be by far the toughest opponents Dave Brailsford and company have faced in the last 10 years.Main man An inseparable duo: Tomoz Rogoulin or Primoz Duglic. The plethora of steep climbs favours Roglic but Dumoulin has enjoyed the perfect buildup.It’s all about winning stages for one of pro cycling’s oldest squads. Their main goal is to support Caleb Ewan in the sprints but they can also look to hard men Philippe Gilbert and Thomas De Gendt on the hilly days. In the high mountains, it’s mainly about survival.Main man Ewan. Australian sprinter who landed three Tour stages among his 10 wins last year. Unstoppable on his day but will need to be sharp this year with so few sprint stages.With the overall standings beyond their leaders, the cuddly Aussie team are now targeting stage wins. Esteban Chaves, Mikel Nieve and Daryl Impey have landed 10 between them across the three Grand Tours while Adam Yates’s class is undoubted. Will be quiet on the flat stages but will be key players when the road goes uphill.Main man Yates. Hasn’t kicked on since finishing fourth in 2016, but is adept in the mountains and with four Tours under his belt is now amply experienced.Since the 80s the team formerly known as Banesto have targeted the overall. This year, however, Alejandro Valverde looks well past it, while Enric Mas has yet to mature. A stage win or two in the many climbers’ days will do nicely, and almost every rider here is capable of landing one.Main man Valverde. Long past his doping ban, and long in the tooth at 40, but the former world champion is still hungry and as tactically smart as ever.Now rebuilding under the tutelage of Bjarne Riis, “Africa’s team” include just one African, Ryan Gibbons, and will be firmly targeting a stage win, although Domenico Pozzovivo will hope to cling on in the mountains for a top 15 overall. Should be prominent when it gets hilly but crossing the line first won’t come easy.Main man A trident! Michael Valgren hasn’t won big since the 2018 Het Nieuwsblad Classic Edvald Boasson Hagen has two stages in the Tour to his credit sprinter Giacomo Nizzolo has just won the Italian championship.A team in a leadership hiatus with Tom Dumoulin gone, Romain Bardet pending, and former points winner Michael Matthews heading for the Giro. They will target stage wins from Nicolas Roche, starting his 23rd Grand Tour, sprinter Cees Bol and climber Marc Hirschi. Best bet is lanky Belgian Tiesj Benoot.Main man Benoot. The 26-year-old isn’t a prolific winner, but came close three times last year on hilly stages. Not a pure mountain man but the lumpy days will suit him.Perennial triers who have flown the tricolour under various sponsors for 20 years notably with Thomas Voeckler. A stage win is the dream but far more likely is a daily presence in the break and a lot of television time for the sponsors. Popular and professional but lacking horsepower at this level.Main man Lilian Calmejane. Aggressive 27-year-old from Albi who won a stage in fine style in 2017 and flew the flag winning the King of the Mountains in the Route d’Occitanie this year.Trek will look for solid but probably unspectacular top-10 places overall from Richie Porte and Bauke Mollema – a 2017 stage winner – and fortunately have some interesting firepower in support. The youthful world champion Mads Pedersen, Toms Skujins or climber Kenny Elissonde are all capable of landing a stage win on their day.Main man Porte. Fragile 35-year-old Australian who has delivered only one top 10 at the Tour since leaving Team Sky in 2016. Still looks promising but stuff just tends to happen to him.A mishmash of nationalities containing some serious talent. Fabio Aru remains unpredictable but in recent weeks David de la Cruz, Davide Formolo and Tadej Pogacar have been flying, and the latter could be a top-six contender. If the overall is ruled out, they will be very active on the mountain days tilting for stage wins.Main man Aru. One of the handful of Tour starters to have won a Grand Tour, although his Vuelta was back in 2015 and he hasn’t looked at his best since 2017."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6df4a583331774d5bd6587d15364d62d0282799a/0_72_2700_1620/master/2700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d5754dcbad817063569d8d323bd7664","title":"wasps sale premiership match report","story":"Summer rugby is not adding up. Heavy rain and blustery conditions combined with a continued willingness to infringe at the breakdown and a reluctance of the referee to follow up spates of penalties with a yellow card or two made for a largely uninspiring encounter between two clubs who started in third and fourth and reversed positions after Sale made their power tell.A quirk of the fixture list meant that in this round of matches first faced second, third met fourth and fifth encountered sixth, but on this evidence Exeter have only Bristol to worry about as they take aim at a second Premiership title. Wasps were on a run of five bonus-point victories but, on the rare occasions they glimpsed the line here, Sale infringed.Wasps were equally cynical, giving away six penalties in the opening 12 minutes, twice when they were defending their line. They had less excuse than their hosts as the referee, Craig Maxwell‑Keys, was in control of their previous match and had he reached for a card it may have admitted some oxygen to proceedings.Instead, the sides looked to suffocate each other and Sale were the better equipped. Eddie Jones was among a clutch of England coaches in the ground, continuing his mission to find players capable of playing at a sustained pace. Only the wind showed any speed as AJ MacGinty kicked three penalties to Jimmy Gopperth’s two in the opening period in a trial of strength.There was a surfeit of kicking, as if the sides were trying to find out who had the initial wind advantage, and Sale had the edge up front where the prop Jake Cooper-Woolley left his mark on the ground he used to call home. The set piece was a source of penalties for the Sharks, along with the breakdown. There were 24 penalties in the opening 46 minutes but no yellow card and no warning for Wasps until they had infringed for the 19th time.Sale rested Manu Tuilagi but Rohan Janse van Rensburg offered the same brute force in midfield, targeting Jacob Umaga, whose evening started with a fumble and barely improved: he skewed two penalty kicks to touch and his high tackle on Van Rensburg allowed the Sharks to go into the break ahead. It was not a haven for playmakers and Wasps were unable to break free from the grip of opponents whose pursuit of their first post-lockdown victory was single-minded.Two more MacGinty penalties in the opening 15 minutes of the second half gave Sale a cushion before their pressure turned into a try, Luke James shrugging off the challenges of Dan Robson and Ryan Mills to score after landing over the line on his back and forcing the touchdown.Playing narrowly meant Sale negated the threat of the home side’s jackalling back row, but when Jono Ross was sent to the sin-bin four minutes from time Wasps had the chance to steal a bonus point but Gopperth failed to convert Jack Willis’s late try and Sale clambered above them to third.It was a signal success given the absence of Tuilagi and Tom Curry and the presence of the World Cup winners Faf de Klerk and Lood de Jager on the bench.The Sharks’ director of rugby, Steve Diamond, said: “Exeter and Bristol have sewn up the top two positions and it will be two from the next four – but with no crowds, home advantage is not the same this year.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e43ca392bc23e56df3b67ac26f6371332501717/1110_542_3236_1943/master/3236.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=396d39aaee03323b63cf70e363b15cf8","title":"samsung galaxy buds live review novel bean shaped airpod rivals sound battery","story":"Good sound and long battery life with a repairable and unusual open-fit design make great alternative earbudsSamsung’s latest Galaxy Buds Live true wireless earbuds are different from anything else on the market. They are shaped like kidney beans that you put in your ear – which is precisely why they are good.The Galaxy Buds Live cost £179, have active noise cancellation (ANC) and sit above the excellent £159 Galaxy Buds+ as Samsung’s top Bluetooth earbuds.What makes the Buds Live different is the way they fit. Shaped like a bean, they don’t have a traditional silicone ear tip, nor a stalk.Instead, the whole thing fits in the concha of your ear – the hollow between the ear canal and the cartilage at the back of your ear.They have an open-type fit that doesn’t block your ear canal with anything instead, they just line up the speaker grille so that sound is projected down your earhole.A small silicone wing, of which there are two sizes in the box, wedges up against the inside of your ear on the back side of the earbud to keep it in place.They look very strange but are quite comfortable once inserted and do not protrude far from your ear. Although how you get on with them will be dictated by your ear shape. For those that prefer the isolation of a silicone earbud tip, these are not for you.The earbuds are small – and so is the charging case. It is more of a square pillow shape than the one that comes with the Buds+, but is just as easily pocketable, fitting in the money pocket of a pair of jeans.The connectivity and controls are the same as the Buds+. They support Bluetooth 5 with both the universal SBC and AAC audio standards, and Samsung’s proprietary scalable audio codec, which only works with Samsung devices.The Buds Live are compatible with all standard Bluetooth devices, including Android, iPhones, iPads, Macs and Windows 10 devices. Connectivity to a Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, OnePlus 8 Pro, iPad Pro, iPhone 11 Pro and Surface Pro 7 was excellent.The Galaxy Wearable app on Android handles settings and updates on Android. The Galaxy Buds app on the iPhone does the same.Pairing is as simple as either opening the case for the first time or pressing and holding both earbuds for three seconds for each subsequent pairing. On Samsung and Windows you will see a quick-pairing popup that you only have to tap. On iOS you will have to do a manual pairing in settings.Samsung devices will sync the earbud’s pairing information between them, so they will be instantly available to other Samsung devices. They only connect to one device at a time but you can seamlessly switch between devices without having to manually disconnect each one.The Buds Live feature similar tap controls to Samsung’s other earbuds. Single tap for pauseplay, twice and thrice for skip track forwards or back. The tap and hold gesture can be changed but by default it turns ANC on or off – I preferred to have it as volume control.The Buds Live will outlast most competitors between charges, managing at least eight hours of playback between trips in the case without using noise cancelling. The case can charge the earbuds 2.5 times, adding up to 28 hours of total playback time.Turning on noise cancelling reduces the playback time by approximately two hours (up to 21 hours with the case). Talk time is up to 5.5 hours.A five-minute trip in the case gives the earbuds enough power to produce up to an hour of playback. Charging the case is done via the USB-C port or wireless charging.Samsung does not sell inidual replacement buds or cases. Unlike most true wireless earbuds, however, the batteries in the Galaxy Buds Live and case can be replaced by authorised service centres.Similar to Samsung’s other true wireless earbuds, the Galaxy Buds Live are some of the most repairable earbuds available, scoring an impressive eight out of 10 by repair specialists iFixit, which makes them far less disposable than competitors. In addition, the earbuds and case are made from post-consumer recycled plastic. The combination of those two things makes them some of the most environmentally friendly earbuds you can buy.The Buds Live sound really good for open-type earbuds better than Apple’s AirPods and Microsoft’s Surface Earbuds.They sound similar to Samsung’s excellent Buds+, with a surprising amount of bass and richness from an open-fit earbud. They handle detail well, with good separation of tones, crisp highs, warm mids and punchy bass.They lack a smidgen of really deep bass, sound a little muted in some more raw pieces, such as Nirvana’s Smells Like Teen Spirit, and struggled with super-detailed tracks such as Baba O’Riley by the Who. But feed them live guitars, pumping electronica or hip-hop and you will be richly rewarded. They sound particularly good with Britpop, too.The Buds Live are a great-sounding set of everyday listening earbuds, particularly for the open-fit design.But one thing they don’t do is block out any background noise, as there is no silicone tip to isolate your ear canal. The noise cancelling is also not very effective.The Samsung Galaxy Buds Live cost £179, are available in bronze, black or white and ship on 20 August.For comparison, the Galaxy Buds+ cost £159, Apple AirPods cost £159, the AirPods Pro cost £249, Google’s Pixel Buds cost £179, Microsoft’s Surface Earbuds cost £199.99, the Jabra Elite 75t cost £169.99, the Libratone Track Air+ cost £167, the Sony WF-1000XM3 cost £169, and the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless cost £280.The Samsung Galaxy Buds Live are a pair of attractive bean-shaped true wireless earbuds with good sound and a unique fit.If you don’t like silicone ear tips that block your ear canal, these earbuds are for you. They are light, secure and don’t protrude or have stalks.They sound better than open-fit rivals such as the AirPods but their active noise cancelling is only effective for deep rumbles.

Now he’s back in his most famous role in a comedy sequel It is hard to convey just how stratospherically famous Macchio, now 58, became when The Karate Kid – in which he played plucky lower middle-class teen Daniel LaRusso, crane-kicking the snotty rich kids – came out in 1984. Back in the 80s, a young person could become a huge star with just one movie and, to a large extent, those movies still define those actors: Tom Cruise had Risky Business, Matthew Broderick had Ferris Bueller’s Day Off, Michael J Fox had Back to the Future and Macchio had The Karate Kid.Nostalgia for those films and the deceptively basic (but actually tenaciously deep) joys they brought means 80s films are, once again, having a comeback, with the third Bill \u0026amp Ted film getting released next month in the UK, a fifth Indiana Jones apparently creaking out in 2022, and the official sequel to Dirty Dancing now in the works. But it’s The Karate Kid – seemingly the most simple of 80s blockbusters – that has unexpectedly had the most satisfying afterlife with Cobra Kai, the ludicrously enjoyable series that started on YouTube and has just been bought by Netflix.Cobra Kai is the ultimate fan fic, but in the best possible way. Created by Karate Kid superfans Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg, it imagines what happened to Daniel and his nemesis Johnny (William Zabka) 34 years on from the famous tournament, with Daniel now a successful car salesman and Johnny a barely functioning alcoholic, until he decides to reopen a certain karate school. But what could have been pure self-indulgence becomes surprisingly rich and textured, as Heald, Hurwitz and Schlossberg take seemingly minor elements from the original film (most notably the social class differences between Daniel and Johnny, but also the cars, the houses and the great fan debate about whether Daniel cheated in the tournament) and blow them up into whole episodes that go to far deeper places than the movies touched upon.“Jon, Josh and Hayden know way more about the films than I ever did,” marvels Macchio. “We’ll be shooting a scene and they’ll say: ‘Remember that time you lifted your left arm? The way you pointed that finger was definitive to my childhood!’ I’m like: ‘Dude, I was just saying a line!’ Oh, it’s really wonderful.”One of the many joys of Cobra Kai is how many of the original cast members appear in it. As well as Macchio and Zabka there’s Martin Kove, who played the bullying Cobra Kai teacher Kreese, and Randee Heller, AKA Mrs LaRusso, Daniel’s mother. There is even a hint at the end of the second series that Elisabeth Shue, who played Daniel’s girlfriend Ali, might make a comeback. But there is one gaping absence and that is Mr Miyagi, Daniel’s sensei, played by the wonderful Pat Morita, who died in 2005.“That’s been tough,” says Macchio, who spoke at Morita’s funeral. “There’s a montage scene in series two in which I’m teaching a younger kid, just as Miyagi taught LaRusso, and that brought a real rush of emotion for me. Every time we shoot I hearken back to those early days of rehearsal with Pat.” And yet, as beloved as Mr Miyagi was as a character, even getting an Oscar nomination for his performance, some Asian Americans have since said that they felt stereotyped by him, getting teased about his exaggerated accent (which Morita put on for the part) and constantly fending “wax on, wax off” references. Was Morita aware of the criticisms?Macchio made three Karate Kid films with Morita, with diminishing returns – the original, though, remains a stone-cold classic – and there was a fourth with Hilary Swank and Morita. Will Smith attempted to revive the franchise in 2010, now set in China, with his son Jaden and Jackie Chan as the mentor. It had, shall we say, a mixed reception. Macchio, famously one of the nicest people ever to appear on screen, is too kind to trash it, saying only “It enhanced the legacy of the original,” and he allows himself to point out: “Also, there’s no such thing as karate in China, so it should have been called The Kung Fu Kid.”While pretty much every other successful young actor in the 80s went through some kind of emotional off-screen ordeal, Macchio remained straight and stable, mainly living with his parents on Long Island and marrying his childhood sweetheart, Phyllis, when he was 26. They are still together and have two children. Macchio’s steadiness – which he puts down to his “upbringing and natural sensibilities” – is so renowned that Funny or Die made a very amusing film in which the actor tries to behave badly to beef up his career. It’s a good joke, but there is some truth to it, Macchio admits, because he always put personal stability before fame.Macchio has always been remarkably good-natured about being so associated with Karate Kid, even though he has had a perfectly healthy career as a jobbing actor beyond it. His first big break was in Francis Ford Coppola’s The Outsiders, alongside Tom Cruise, Rob Lowe, Matt Dillon and Emilio Estevez, and Lowe recounts in his memoir how Macchio was the on-set joker.“I always try to go for the joke, maybe because I’ve always been the smallest guy or the youngest-looking guy, so that was my defence,” he says. (Incredibly, despite looking about 13, Macchio was 22 in Karate Kid.) His other best-known role was in My Cousin Vinny, and Macchio compares the famous chemistry between Joe Pesci and Marisa Tomei with what he had with Morita. More recently, there have been steady TV roles in Ugly Betty and The Deuce.But Karate Kid retains a special place in his heart, so much so that he named his son, Daniel, after his character in the film. “There was a chunk of time when my son was like: ‘Did you have to?’ But now he’s proud of it. Unlike Ralph, Daniel is a classic, it never goes out of style, you know?”Cobra Kai seasons one and two are available on Netflix on Friday, with season three due later this year"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aed1fce03586129b495ce4ca41680cd1aa631981/105_0_2600_1560/master/2600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4047e8a1b90e16c3ac8031420588bce9","title":"the truth about cosmetic treatments review a format in need of a facelift","story":"From procedures gone wrong to the horrors of fat extraction, there’s little in this Michael Mosley doc we haven’t seen a thousand times beforeThis year, in many ways, has seemed the ideal time to get heavily, extravagantly into fillers. Human contact is still largely outlawed, so if it all blows up in your face (as it can do, quite literally), it is socially acceptable to hide behind a mask. Besides, some studies have drawn a correlation between the hours spent looking-but-not-actually-looking at yourself in Zoom’s tiny thumbnail (were my eyes always this far apart? Or this close together?) and the uptick in cosmetic procedures post-lockdown.But, if you do decide to get a little Botox – and perhaps some tear-trough fillers, too, while you’re at it – you may have to contend with Dr Michael Mosley’s not-angry-but-disappointed face, as he visits a tweakment clinic near you in two-parter The Truth About Cosmetic Treatments (BBC One). Mosley, who is on most other TV shows where a bit of judgment is de rigueur (see also: Channel 4’s Lose a Stone in 21 Days) is here to see whether the rise in nonsurgical treatments could be doing more harm than good. But first, time to ask some people on the street whose fault this all is. The Kardashians and Kylie Jenner? I for one am shocked that some of the most famous people on the planet could be influencing our behaviour.The rest of the programme isn’t so much The Truth About Cosmetic Treatments as A Largely Negative But Ultimately Commonsense Guide to Them. Do use Google. Don’t get Botox in the back of a car. Do not pass go, do not collect £200. Co-presenter Mehreen Baig, a blogger and journalist, is mostly good cop, telling us that people should get tweakments if they want them and if they will make them feel better about themselves. She visits a doctor offering nonsurgical rhinoplasty, increasing the volume of noses with fillers while making them appear smaller. She listens kindly while a group of middle-aged women undergo newfangled microneedling and drink some kind of collagen Capri Sun to see if they can roll back the years. She even watches as fat is extracted from the body of a heavily sedated woman called Kim, to be harvested for stem cells, which are then injected back into her face. Sure, Baig is visibly revolted as she watches, but it could be worse: remember that period in the early 00s when it seemed as if every celebrity was drinking their own wee?Meanwhile, Mosley is, if not bad cop, then largely disapproving cop. He considers the pitiful case of Emma, a woman whose bungled lip filler left a huge pouch of skin around her mouth, which she describes, unappetisingly, as “the sausage”. People can do tweakments anywhere, with no qualifications, he reminds us, so it’s important to check out peoples’ credentials. The issue here, though Mosley doesn’t get into it, isn’t so much that people don’t go running to the General Medical Council before booking lip fillers, it’s that they trust a friend or acquaintance, and are tempted by cheap deals.If Mosley is the not-angry-but-disappointed parent, the kind who said: “Now, why have you gone and done that?” when you got your earlobes pierced, he at least decides to make his own apathy towards tweakments clear, undergoing a heat gun treatment to stimulate his skin, and then complaining that it has merely left him looking like he has “bad sunburn”.The second episode focuses on bum lifts and steroid-taking lads, and is sure – yet again – to hammer home the already well-known risks of doing anything other than sitting in a darkened room until the end of time. More helpful, perhaps, would be a programme that descended, if only slightly, from the moral high ground and stopped wrinkling its nose – something that is sure to speed up the ageing process."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2de44f81e21f27115778b5abdb35d97633f1ea0/345_263_3378_2028/master/3378.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43cbd23220a476b0bc7f13bc76a1e4cf","title":"french minister defends precious right to sunbathe topless","story":"Gendarmes’ request for topless sunbathers to cover up on south coast prompts outcryFrance’s interior minister has defended the “precious” right to sunbathe topless on beaches, after police asked a group of women to cover up on the southern coast.French gendarmes patrolling a beach in Mediterranean seaside town Sainte-Marie-la-Mer last week asked a group of topless sunbathers to cover up in response to a complaint from a family, the local gendarmerie said in a statement on Facebook.It acknowledged their actions had been “clumsy” but said the officers only wanted to calm the situation, insisting there had been no official order to ban topless sunbathing in the town.But their actions prompted an avalanche of criticism on social media, where users wondered if the practice was now out of bounds.“Is Sainte-Marie-la-Mer now Saudi Arabia?” wondered one user, while others slammed a creeping “prudishness” in France.“It was wrong that the women were warned about their clothing,” interior minister Gerald Darmanin wrote on Twitter.“Freedom is something precious. And it is normal that officials can admit their mistakes.”“You will always see me in uniform,” the spokeswoman of the French gendarmerie Maddy Scheurer wrote on Twitter. “But topless sunbathing is allowed on the beach at Sainte-Marie-la-Mer. It was clumsiness by two gendarmes who had the best intentions.”Topless sunbathing in France is legally not considered to be sexual exhibitionism although it can be halted by local directives outlawing certain styles of dress.But far from everyone in France takes their tops off on the beach these days and topless sunbathing has become less popular in recent years.Surveys show that younger women are increasingly concerned about sexual harassment and body shaming on the beach."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ba722a537659abcc1d8c834f41638079fcb379a/33_0_1492_895/master/1492.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66d2421e5e6b423a055aa02affcedbf7","title":"how england follows scotlands lead over covid 19","story":"There have been a number of different occasions when England has taken heed of more stringent rules in ScotlandBoth Labour and the Lib Dems have accused the government of being slow to follow the science during the coronavirus pandemic. There have been a number of different occasions when England followed more stringent rules in Scotland, often after claiming there was little evidence to do so:Scotland banned mass gatherings of more than 500 people on 12 March but the UK government did not follow suit immediately. Johnson had even played down the importance of banning mass gatherings, suggesting Scotland’s decision reflected the lack of resilience of its emergency services.“The scientific advice, as we’ve said over the last couple of weeks, is that banning such events will have little effect on the spread,” he said. However, scores of events had already been cancelled unilaterally by most major sports, music promoters and even by Buckingham Palace.Schools in Scotland and Wales announced they were to close on 18 March, with Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, saying schools had lost too many staff to continue as normal. It was widely expected that England would follow immediately afterwards and school closures were announced by Gavin Williamson several hours later – though the move was already in train.Scotland made face coverings mandatory in shops from 10 July but UK government ministers set out several contradictory positions before announcing the measure in England, four days after Scotland’s new rule came into force.It was preceded by a weekend of indecision, with Michael Gove saying it should not be compulsory but people should be trusted to use their common sense, only then to be contradicted by Johnson who said people “should be wearing” face coverings inside shops to help prevent the spread of coronavirus. A day later, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, announced the change.The Scottish government backtracked on grades awarded by an algorithm which hit almost 76,000 pupils by downgrading one or more of their results, mostly those from poorer backgrounds. The Scottish government’s education secretary, John Swinney, apologised to the young people whose predicted grades were reduced and said the government “got this wrong”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/104fb54a4436a2440f862a117fcfe48604e39721/0_66_4814_2889/master/4814.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=e522fe37bad08e55f42e780a3a4ead4f","title":"tropical storm laura hurricane texas louisiana gulf coast","story":"Major storm heads to US after killing two dozen on the island of Hiiola, 20 in Haiti and three in the Dominican RepublicHundreds of thousands of people were ordered to evacuate the Gulf coast on Tuesday, as Laura strengthened into a hurricane that forecasters said could slam into Texas and Louisiana as a major storm with ferocious winds and deadly flooding.Laura passed Cuba after killing nearly two dozen on the island of Hiiola, 20 in Haiti and three in the Dominican Republic, where it knocked out power and caused intense flooding.More than 385,000 were told to flee the Texas cities of Beaumont, Galveston and Port Arthur, and still more were ordered to evacuate low-lying south-western Louisiana, where forecasters said as much as 13ft of storm surge topped by waves could submerge entire communities.The National Hurricane Center (NHC) projected that Laura would become a category 3 hurricane before making landfall late on Wednesday or early on Thursday, with winds of around 115mph capable of inflicting devastating damage.“The waters are warm enough everywhere there to support a major hurricane, category 3 or even higher. The waters are very warm where the storm is now and will be for the entire path up until the Gulf coast,” the NHC deputy director, Ed Rappaport, said.Ocean water was expected to push on to land along more than 450 miles of coast from Texas to Mississippi. Hurricane warnings were issued from San Luis Pass, Texas, to Intracoastal City, Louisiana, and storm surge warnings from the Port Arthur, Texas, flood protection system to the mouth of the Mississippi River.As of Tuesday morning, Laura was 585 miles south-east of Lake Charles, Louisiana, traveling north-west at 16mph. Its peak winds were 75mph. The NHC nudged its forecast track a bit farther west as computer simulations pushed the storm closer to Texas.There was little to keep Laura from turbocharging. Nearly all forecasts showed rapid strengthening at some point in the next couple of days.The deaths in Haiti and the Dominican Republic reportedly included a 10-year-old girl whose home was hit by a tree and a mother and young son crushed by a wall.On top of storm surge that could penetrate miles inland, as much as 15in of rain could fall in some parts of Louisiana, said Donald Jones, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Lake Charles, Louisiana, near the bullseye of Laura’s projected path.Marco, a system that approached land ahead of Laura, weakened into a remnant just off Louisiana’s shore. Satellite images showed a disorganized cluster of clouds, what meteorologists call “a naked swirl”, Jones said.But Laura powered up. The crew of a hurricane hunter plane confirmed that Laura became a hurricane with top winds of 75mph shortly after passing between the western tip of Cuba and Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula.The NHC warned people not to focus on the details of the official forecast since storm surge, wind and heavy rain will extend far from Laura’s center.In Galveston and Port Arthur, mandatory evacuation orders went into effect at 6am. People planning on entering official shelters were told to bring just one bag of personal belongings each, and a mask to reduce the spread of coronavirus.“If you decide to stay, you’re staying on your own,” Port Arthur’s mayor, Thurman Bartie, said.Officials in Houston asked residents to prepare supplies in case they lose power for a few days or need to evacuate homes along the coast. Some in the area are still recovering from the devastation of Hurricane Harvey three years ago.Emergencies were declared in Louisiana and Mississippi, and shelters opened with cots set farther apart, among other measures designed to curb coronavirus infections.Laura’s arrival comes just days before the 29 August anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, which breached the levees in New Orleans, flattened much of the Mississippi coast and killed as many as 1,800 in 2005. Hurricane Rita then struck south-west Louisiana that 24 September, as a category 3 storm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67df8e8f514f86f8b62987288afacf48fcd9f6d4/0_372_4486_2692/master/4486.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=fdb3db297b9f5d453c8ae773e42d3b13","title":"coronavirus live news gaza in lockdown following first local cases hong kong man re infected","story":"Turkey records highest number of new cases since mid-June India worse than US and Brazil in number of daily new cases European re-infections add to immunity concerns prompted by Hong Kong caseKate Green, Labour’s shadow education secretary, has called the Department of Education change on face coverings a “half baked U-turn”.Parents and schools needed clarity and leadership, but instead the government have just passed the buck back to them.Face coverings should be compulsory in communal areas in schools.Instead of this half baked U-turn the government should have given clear guidance and a plan to deliver it.Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, welcomed the “flexibility” of the change in advice on face coverings in secondary schools.It was inevitable that the policy on face coverings would change following guidance from the World Health Organization, and we recognise that the government in Westminster has responded to our call for a quick direction on this matter with the reopening of schools imminent.The new policy is discretionary, other than in places where coronavirus restrictions apply, and secondary school and college leaders will welcome the flexibility this affords them to decide what best suits their circumstances. We look forward to seeing the full guidance as early as possible.Former Males president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom said he has tested positive for coronavirus as the island nation battles an increase in new cases.Gayoom, who held power for three decades, was checked after he developed a fever, a former aide close to the family told AFP. No word was available on his condition.“I have tested positive for Covid-19,” the 82-year-old politician wrote on Twitter. “May Almighty Allah bless me and all other sick people with a speedy recovery and good health!”After leaving office in 2008 Gayoom has remained an active political figure. Opponents have accused him of being an autocratic leader during his three decades in power.However, he is also credited with being an early campaigner against global warming and sea level rise which he had warned could wipe the low-lying Males off the face of the earth.The Males, known for upmarket island tourism, reopened its international borders to visitors in mid-July after a three-month halt that crippled the hospitality industry.It has seen a steady increase in cases in recent weeks and has reported a total of 7,047 infections and 28 deaths.General Motors and Ford said they are close to completing production of ventilators ordered by the Trump administration this spring, and are ramping down or exiting the operations.Many of the ventilators assembled by the automakers and other manufacturers have gone into a US government stockpile as doctors have shifted away from using invasive ventilators with Covid-19 patients. The government currently has 108,000 ventilators in its medical equipment stockpile, and 12,000 deployed at US hospitals, the US Health and Human Services department said on Tuesday.GM and medical equipment maker Ventec Life Systems are on the “home stretch” towards completing a contract to deliver 30,000 critical care ventilators by the end of August under a $489m contract with the federal government, the automaker said.GM and Ventec have already delivered more than 20,000 machines, GM spokesman Jim Cain said.Ford has assembled about 47,000 of the 50,000 ventilators it agreed to supply to partner General Electric, Ford spokeswoman Rachel McCleery said. GE has a $336m contract with the government.Ford and GM earlier this year said they would employ as many as 1,500 people on ventilator assembly lines. Automakers likened the efforts to their switch from making cars to tanks and planes during the second world war.With North American car and truck factories back in operation, the Detroit automakers are winding down their forays into ventilator manufacturing, while continuing to make respiratory masks.The automakers’ efforts to build ventilators and other medical equipment were launched in a politically charged atmosphere as the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic swamped the US economy and healthcare system. The shortage of ventilators became a symbol of the nation’s struggle to respond. President Donald Trump put pressure on the automakers as part of a broader push to secure more than 130,000 ventilators by the end of 2020. The automakers used the medical equipment assembly operations set up in the spring to test safety protocols they later used to reopen their vehicle-making operations.Irish prime minister Micheál Martin and deputy prime minister Leo Varadkar have said there were clear breaches of public health guidelines during European trade commissioner Phil Hogan’s trip to Ireland.They said in a statement:Government guidelines clearly required him to restrict his movements for 14 days. He should also have limited his movements to and from Kildare for essential travel only, and he should not have attended the Oireachtas Golf Society dinner. Hogan attended a golf dinner during the trip that has outraged the Irish public and led an Irish minister to resign and several lawmakers to be disciplined. The number of Americans newly diagnosed with the coronavirus is falling, a development experts credit at least partly to increased wearing of masks, even as the outbreak continues to claim nearly 1,000 lives in the US each day.While the US, India and Brazil still have the highest numbers of new cases in the world, the downward trend is encouraging.“It’s profoundly hopeful news,” said Dr Monica Gandhi, an infectious diseases expert at the University of California who credits the American public’s growing understanding of how the virus spreads, more mask-wearing and, possibly, an increasing level of immunity.“Hopefully all those factors are coming into play to get this virus under control in this country that’s really been battered by the pandemic,” she said.The virus is blamed for more than 5.7 million confirmed infections and about 178,000 deaths in the US.The decline in newly reported cases in the US comes even as deaths from the virus remain alarmingly high. Over the past two weeks, officials have reported an average of 965 deaths a day from Covid-19, down from 1,051 a day in early August.The situation has improved dramatically in several states that struggled with high caseloads earlier this summer.In Arizona, for example, officials reported 859 new cases on Tuesday, down from a peak of 5,500 in late June. More than 2,000 people arrived at the state’s hospitals showing symptoms of the virus on a single day in early July. This week, that number has been less than 1,000.In Florida, where more than 10,000 people have died, the state reported 2,600 new cases on Tuesday. Earlier in the summer, it was regularly reporting more than 10,000.Nursing homes in the US will now be required to test staff for Covid-19 and offer testing to residents, the Centers for Medicare \u0026amp Medicaid Services (CMS) said.In July, the Trump administration released an additional $5bn from the Provider Relief Fund to help nursing homes address critical needs, including hiring additional staff and increasing testing. London mayor Sadiq Khan has welcomed the government’s U-turn on face masks in schools. Posting on Twitter, he said: Our children must be able to return to school in a safe environment and I welcome the latest u-turn by the Govt - a step in the right direction. However, it is of huge concern that yet again the PM has had to be forced into following the advice of public health officials. Turkey’s former economy czar and the leader of the opposition Deva (Remedy) Party, Ali Babacan, said he had tested positive for Covid-19 but was in good health, becoming the most high-profile Turkish politican to contract the virus.Babacan, 53, also a former deputy prime minister, resigned from president Tayyip Erdoğan’s AK Party last July over “deep differences” about the direction of the party he helped found. In March he formed his rival political party.Babacan said on Twitter:I just learned my Covid-19 test result is positive. Thank God, I am in good condition at the moment. My doctors said I needed to remain in quarantine with my family for some time. I will continue my work from home, God willing.Turkey’s daily number of new coronavirus cases has risen in recent weeks as the government has rolled back containment measures in the interest of shoring up the economy.On Tuesday, the number of new cases jumped the highest since mid-June with 1,502 recorded infections.More than 261,000 people have contracted the virus in Turkey according to official figures, while 6,193 people have died.The government has warned citizens about rising cases, and responded on Tuesday by banning some events in 14 provinces, including the capital Ankara.Pupils in England will no longer be advised against using face masks in schools after prime minister Boris Johnson made an 11th-hour U-turn days before students head back to the classroom.In lockdown areas such as Greater Manchester, which have greater restrictions to stop the spread of the virus, wearing face coverings will become mandatory in school corridors where social distancing is more difficult.In areas of England not subject to tighter restrictions, headteachers will have discretion over whether to require face masks, but the government will no longer advise against their use, a senior government source said.The prime minister bowed to pressure and changed the guidance late on Tuesday after scores of headteachers broke ranks to urge their use, backed by Labour and trade unions.Johnson told reporters earlier in the day he would “look at the changing medical evidence as we go on” but insisted schools would be safe regardless.The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the agency in charge of processing work permits, so-called green cards and other visas, said that it had avoided furloughs planned for 30 August. But aggressive spending cuts the agency planned to put in place would impact all operations, including naturalisations, it said in a statement.But immigration experts and former officials say even before the onset of the pandemic, the agency had seen revenues fall sharply as a result of slowdowns in processing and other limits placed on immigration applications.Republican president Donald Trump has made curbing immigration a priority during his years in office.The USCIS deputy director for policy, Joseph Edlow, warned in the statement there was no guarantee the agency can avoid future furloughs and called on the US Congress to ensure the agency had sufficient funding for fiscal year 2021, which starts in October.USCIS had asked for a $1.2bn bailout from Congress in May to avoid the projected furloughs, but lawmakers pushed back, arguing the agency had the funding it needed to continue operations through the fiscal year.Switzerland is set to be the next country on which to have quarantine measures imposed by the government in England, the  has reported, with the Czech Republic and Iceland moving into the “danger zone” due to high coronavirus infection rates.If confirmed, it will means travellers from Switzerland will have to self-isolate for two weeks on arrival in the country, along with travellers from Spain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands and a number of other countries the UK government deems to have worrying coronavirus infection levels. Ministers are due to meet within the next 48 hours to make a decision, the  reports, with an announcement expected on Thursday ahead of the usual 4am on Saturday deadline for the new rules to come into effect. Young people are driving the spread of Covid-19 in the Americas, the head of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has said, noting that both deaths and caseloads have doubled in the region over the past six weeks.Dr Carissa Etienne chastised governments that have rushed economic reopenings despite data that shows a worsening pandemic.“This is not a good sign. Wishing the virus away will not work,” she said, detailing what she described as a “real disconnect” between the relaxation of containment measures and the continuing spread of the virus.The PAHO is the Washington-based Americas arm of the UN World Health Organization.Since July, coronavirus cases in the Americas have more than doubled to about 12 million confirmed infections, while deaths have shot up by roughly the same rate to some 450,000, according to PAHO data.“This indicates that younger people are primarily driving the spread of the disease in our region,” she said.A recent uptick in cases in several Caribbean nations including the Bahamas is also a growing concern, said Etienne, with new infections not only driven by tourism but also returning residents.Overall, governments should base their reopening decisions on the best available data and expand testing and contract tracing programmes to better identify and control spikes in cases, she said.Six of the world’s 10 most affected countries are in the Americas, said Etienne, pointing to the US, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Peru and Argentina.More US colleges are grappling with high numbers of students testing positive for Covid-19 just days into the start of the new semester, after some universities rolled back their campus reopening plans in recent weeks.The University of Alabama on Monday reported more than 550 people across its campuses had tested positive for Covid-19 since it resumed in-person classes on 19 August. Most of those infected were students, faculty and staff at the university’s main campus in Tuscaloosa.Citing a “dramatic increase” in coronavirus cases on campus, the mayor of Tuscaloosa issued an executive order on Monday ordering bars to shut down for 14 days and placing restrictions on other establishments.“Many students who tested positive for Covid-19 have chosen to go home to isolate,” Kellee Reinhart, the university’s vice chancellor for communications, told Reuters.Reinhart said the school had an “ample amount” of space for Covid-19 positive students to isolate and that it was enhancing testing of various groups.The number of positive cases does not include the 400 students who tested positive upon returning to University of Alabama campuses before classes began last week.Alabama is not alone in scrambling to deal with Covid-19 college outbreaks.The University of Southern California (USC), which resumed education almost entirely online on 17 August, on Monday said that more than 100 students at the University Park Campus in Los Angeles were in a 14-day quarantine after exposure to the virus.Ohio State University, where classes resume on Tuesday, this week issued more than 200 interim suspensions for students following a string of large parties where health and safety rules were largely ignored, according to media reports.Last week, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill cancelled in-class instruction after positive cases of Covid-19 shot up dramatically.A representative of Lebanon’s hospitality sector said that service and tourism businesses would defy a newly reinstated coronavirus lockdown that has compounded the crisis-hit country’s economic woes.“From tomorrow, we will open our doors,” said Tony Ramy, head of the syndicate of owners of restaurants, cafes, nightclubs and pastry shops.“The arbitrary and demagogic decision to close down, whether partially or fully, does not concern us any more,” he said in a televised statement from a Beirut street heavily damaged by the huge 4 August explosion at the capital’s port.An AFP photographer said dozens of people gathered in support of the announcement, some holding signs that read “Tourism is the pulse of Lebanon” and “For us, the state vanished with the blast”.The declaration, made on behalf of a wider tourism body also representing hotels and seaside resorts, came four days after authorities imposed a two-week coronavirus lockdown to stem a string of record-hitting daily infection tolls.Under the latest rules, malls, nightclubs, gyms, swimming pools, restaurants and coffee shops have been ordered to close.Restaurants, coffee shops and pastry shops can deliver, but only between 6am and 6pm due to an overnight curfew.Ramy blamed the government for the devastating explosion at Beirut’s port and the huge losses it has caused the tourism industry, which he estimated at around $1bn – including $315m for restaurants alone.He called on the sector to engage in “civil disobedience” against the state by severing commercial ties with the government and depriving it of tax money.“We will not pay a single penny until we have a new state,” he said.The interior ministry responded that it would punish those who flouted the lockdown, and urged Lebanese to act in the public interest.“The interior ministry ... warns it will not be lenient in implementing what the laws stipulate for transgressors, from issuing fines to referral to the relevant judicial authority,” caretaker interior minister Mohammed Fahmi said, shortly before the country announced a record 24-hour coronavirus death toll of 12.The Beirut traders’ association this week also said businesses wanted to reopen from Wednesday.Authorities fear Lebanon’s fragile health sector would struggle to cope with a further spike in coronavirus cases, especially after some hospitals near the port were damaged or taken out of commission in the explosion.Translate Bio said that an experimental coronavirus vaccine it developed with French drugmaker Sanofi induced immune response in early-stage non-human primate studies.In a regulatory filing, the company cited Sanofi’s presentation slides showing that the vaccine candidate induced neutralising antibodies and T-cell responses in animal studies.Translate, which signed a potential $2bn vaccine development deal with Sanofi last month, said their vaccine candidate is set to be evaluated in an early- to mid-stage human trial.Other drugmakers racing to develop a safe and effective vaccine for Covid-19 are further ahead in their testing, with Moderna, Johnson and Johnson and Pfizer starting their late-stage studies.Translate’s vaccine, like Moderna’s, uses mRNA technology which delivers proteins that produce immune response against the disease directly to target cells.Sanofi is developing another Covid-19 vaccine candidate with British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline.In July, the US government said it is providing $2.1bn to Sanofi and GSK for Covid-19 vaccines to cover 50 million people and to underwrite the drugmakers’ testing and manufacturing.Hi everyone, this is Jessica Murray, I’ll be steering

The French health ministry said it had recorded 3,304 new coronavirus infections on Tuesday, well below daily highs seen last week and taking the cumulative total to 248,158.The number of new infections was above the 1,995 reported on Monday – which traditionally shows a dip – but remained well below Sunday’s new post-lockdown record of 4,897 and below the levels above 3,600 reported in the second half of last week.The ministry also said the death toll rose by 16 to 30,544, while the number of people in hospital with Covid-19 fell to a new post-lockdown low of 4,600. The number of people in intensive care rose by 11 to 410 and is now back up to levels last seen at the end of July."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Loss equivalent to an ice sheet over landmass of Ireland to a depth of 300 metresDiesel and petrol consumption fell as transport restrictions took hold, report shows\u0026lsquoStaggering\u0026rsquo study indicates sea level rises could reach a metre by the end of the century"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"The by-the-wind sailor\u0026rsquos sworn foe, the violet sea snail, floats upside-down alongside itMichael Viney: North Atlantic\u0026rsquos top predator now shares island with 13 other speciesMichael Viney: The wayside ashes of the west stand as defiantly healthy emblems of their kindInidual ants are certainly not smart, but their group wisdom may exceed our ownMichael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

The initial impact of Brexit was two price hikes of 10 per cent each, both caused by a fall in the sterling to euro exchange rate.But the impact on sales was virtually zero and a World Trade Organisation tariff of 7 per cent, which will apply to Silverhill goods entering the UK without a UKEU trade deal, doesn’t faze the company’s head of sales, Barry Cullen.“It’s not a major price difference,” he says. “We are a premium product. We are about twice as expensive as our competitors, so we’re not price sensitive.”Two years ago when the implications of Brexit were sinking in, the company leased temporary warehouse space near Manchester where 100 pallets, each holding 420 frozen ducks, could be stored, thus ensuring UK customers would continue to be supplied if ports became jammed. The warehouse option can be revived after January, if needs be.The Silverhill breed, which is half Aylesbury, half Peking, is popular in France, Germany, Scandinavia and the Far East so as regards exporting to the rest of the world, the company long ago abandoned the UK land bridge and exports now, via Dublin Port, to Cherbourg and Rotterdam.Silverhill duck has become a far-travelled delicacy. In Singapore, what is marketed as “London Fat Duck” began life as an egg in Aughnacloy, Co Tyrone. It was hatched in Slieve Bragan, Co Monaghan and reared for 42 days on farms in Monaghan and Tyrone before being processed in Emyvale – all by a workforce of about 250.Cullen believes their UK customers, who are overwhelmingly ethnic Chinese enterprises, are well used to importing from outside the EU and the prospect of WTO tariffs and regulations doesn’t worry them. “They’re all fine about it,” he says.Longer term, Cullen sees Irish-based businesses turning away from the UK.Then there’s the prospect of increasing Silverhill’s burgeoning trade with the Far East.“Indonesia,” he says excitedly, “the population’s 260 million and you think it’s a poor country but you take the top one per cent. . . you start thinking in terms of selling pallets of duck and end up thinking of container loads.”PortwestLike Silverhill, warehousing became a solution for another major exporter, Portwest, the €180 million turnover, outdoor leisure and work clothing company which is based in Westport, Co Mayo and employs 4,500 people worldwide.“Before Brexit we had one main distribution warehouse in the UK, with 250 staff, serving every country in the EU,” says Portwest managing director Harry Hughes. “After Theresa May announced that the UK were leaving the customs union, we decided to open a second distribution warehouse in Poland and were ready when the first deadline passed.”The Polish warehouse has 150 staff and serves all of Portwest’s EU customers. The UK warehouse, with 100 fewer staff, serves UK and Portwest’s non-EU customers – England’s loss was Poland’s gain.“We are now Brexit-proof from issues associated with customs and borders,” says Hughes. “No company will be exempt from the possible political or commercial fallout.”CombiLiftCombiLift is another Monaghan-based company with a global reach that has also had to react to the potential worst-case scenario in January.The company, a hugely successful maker of forklift trucks, has grown over 22 years into a €300 million turnover enterprise employing 650 people.Most of the staff work at an enormous assembly plant that is 11 acres under roof and sits on a 100 acre site at the edge of Monaghan town. Four production lines, now working two at a time in staggered shifts because of Covid-19 distancing restrictions, crank out customised forklifts trucks.Their multi-directional wheel and steering system gives them extra manoeuvrability, allowing them operate in very confined spaces. This allows CombiLift to market itself as a space saver, selling customers the notion that their existing warehouse has greater capacity, if storage aisles are reconfigured and made narrower, thereby allowing for more shelving.While the company’s two largest markets, accounting for half of output, are the UK and US, it also exports to more than 80 countries throughout Europe and the Americas, as well as to Asia, Africa and Australia.The company’s single most significant response to Brexit was to obtain from Revenue the status of Authorised Economic Operator (AEO), a process that took 10 months and culminated in the issuing of a prized AEO certificate in June 2019.What the status means in effect is that the CombiLift plant in Monaghan becomes a customs and excise frontline, rather than the frontline being at the port through which exports flow. On a day-to-day basis, this means the plant operates like a bonded warehouse so when finished products or spare parts reach a port, they pass through the green channel, without delay and unchecked.“You become a trusted partner with Revenue and as long as you do everything properly, there is no reason for them to check what you do.”That said, the plant can be subject to inspection at any time and the perimeter of the site is laser beam protected. CCTV is everywhere.CombiLift has an articulated truck or container leaving the Monaghan plant every hour of every day. The company also takes in 40 truck-loads of imported parts, the company’s manufacturing raw materials.Whatever way Brexit pans out in January, CombiLift will be able to deliver spare parts to UK customers overnight.So McVicar hasn’t given up on the UK.“Whatever happens in Brexit is not going to stop us investing there, for multiple reasons,” he says. “The UK clients are still going to need forklift trucks to move goods around. In fact, their demand for warehousing space is going to be at a higher premium because the minute a company comes out of that European block, they’ll want to want to make sure they’ve goods on their island.“UK companies are going to be stocking higher levels of components and food to deal with border scenarios and where our products come into value is, even though we make forklift trucks, we are actually in the business of selling warehouse space. We sell forklift trucks that save warehouse space and as the demand for warehousing increases, there’s more demand for our product.“So even post-Brexit, whether there’s no deal or there is a deal, we’re still going to invest in the UK.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Daragh Mc SweeneyProvisionAn elderly shop owner in Bandon, Co Cork, who has experienced his second major flooding incident at his premises in a matter of days, describes himself as a “broken man”.Con Linehan opened his menswear business on South Main Street in the town nearly 30 years ago having worked for many years in Saville’s Menswear in Cork city.He estimates that Storm Ellen and Storm Francis have cost him upwards of €20,000 in damage to his premises and stock in less than a week. Business owners in the town were stripped of flood insurance in 2009. A visibly upset Mr Linehan and his wife Ann find themselves in the position of paying for the damage out of their own pockets. “Today was also shocking. It got all the stock rooms. All the fitting rooms were destroyed. “We are trying very hard to keep this business going. I can’t change location because I own the building. Twice in the one week is unbelievable. We weren’t even able to get the shop right from the last flooding last week. The skirting boards are hanging off the walls. They will have to be replaced. “This worry is always hanging over you all the time and at this hour of my life. Every brown penny I have has gone in to this business.”Mr Linehan said that the flooding is yet another burden in a year which saw them closed for months arising out of the pandemic.Business is slow since they reopened as men are not going to weddings or functions in large numbers. Having been closed for months he still had to fork out for a €1,500 ESB bill and all other utility bills and accountancy fees still have to be paid even though more money is going out than comes in. He has called on the people of Bandon to show solidarity with affected businesses such as his, saying that he is at the end of his tether following years of flooding. Meanwhile, on North Main Street in the town Hungarian-born sisters Kathleen and Andrea Guth were mopping up the floor of their flood-damaged hair and beauty salon that they opened last year. The sisters reopened their salon just last week following the Covid-19 restrictions. Andrea Guth said the business is in a prime location in the town. However, they have had a year from hell, with one setback after another, in their business which they set up after years of grafting in salons. “We had roadworks, the virus and now this. What next? This is our first business. The location is supposed to be very good, but so much has happened. “Kathleen Guth lives over the salon. As the water levels on the street rose she made heroic efforts to bring hairdryers, scissors, and boxes of products to her flat.However, paint they had set aside to revamp the shop was ruined and the sisters fear customers will be turned off the salon because of the smell flooding causes. In Kevin Bowen’s clothing store in the town owner Aoife Bowen said her store incurred minor damage. “Luckily the manager and one of the girls got notification about it at 11.45pm. The drains are the problem back here. “On previous occasions water would have come in front and back but it didn’t come in the front. When it came in it was a case of all hands on deck. A little bit of stock was damaged but it wasn’t as bad as other years.”The store is an institution in the town with Aoife’s father opening the premises 57 years ago. “The worst flood was 2009,” she said. “Five years ago we were flooded twice in three weeks. In 2009 we were closed for five months. I am glad we hadn’t gone ahead with getting the place all painted because we thought flooding was gone with the works on the river. “You kind of think ‘where did all the money with the works go?’ How did they miss this?”Stephanie Butler, who has worked at the shop for 40 years said that the multimillion euro flood works in the town had spared them the worst of previous storms. However, she says that there is “huge disappointment” that there are still flaws in the defences to be sorted out.“It is heartbreaking. There are a couple of homes as well which have been destroyed. I know of a house where the kitchen was ruined overnight because of the flooding.”Cork County Council says the level of rainfall seemed to have overwhelmed the collection network. Fianna Fáil Councillor Gillian Coughlan says that a compensation package needs to be put in place for business and home owners.“There is no insurance. These buildings have been flooded time and time again. These repairs will have to come out of their own pockets. That is unsustainable. Year after year. I am calling on the Taoiseach to provide this emergency assistance package for families and businesses. Because these are family businesses,” he said.Meanwhile, in Bantry in west Cork up to 50 businesses incurred flood damage overnight. The local main drainage scheme was unable to cope with up to 25mm of rain falling in a two hour period.New Street, Main Street and Barrack Street were the worst affected in the flooding. The town’s streets were turned in to rivers. At the Drinagh Co Op hardware store staff worked at a fever pitch to save stock. Michael Coughlan, shop floor manager, says that it was “an unusual night.”“The last time I saw flooding like this in the town was in 1988. I think the main drain in the town got blocked and it wasn’t able to take the force of the water. It actually literally bellowed up the streets as it came down. “We had about four inches of water in the shop. It destroys your trade for the short term. Hopefully we will regain it again. We could do without this on top of Covid. But we have a good strong local community and people try to support each other at times like this.”Terence Gibbs, owner of the Cosy Cabin, in Barrack Street in Bantry said that he was holding his breath waiting to see if the insurance company would pay out after his premises was destroyed overnight.“It is not a cosy cabin now. It is a wet cabin. We had about 17 inches of water. I will be the first person to to welcome in 2021. I don’t want to remember this year. We are open six years and we ‘celebrated’ our anniversary with closed doors in July because of Covid. “I have had TDs in here this morning and I have said ‘where is my golf membership?’ All they are doing is going to golf dinners. Even the captain of the Titanic had the decency to go down with the ship. “There is tens of thousands in damage in this pub and I know the insurance company will do everything they can not to pay. Everything here is made of wood hence ‘Cosy Cabin’, so you can imagine the damage.“I am a father of three kids. I love Ireland but I know I could make a better life for us abroad. I am asking Taoiseach Micheál Martin to help us. Where is he today?”Flooding also occurred at Dunmanway, Rosscarbery, Connonagh, Clonakilty, Drimoleague, Leap, Ballydehob, Passage West and Youghal. Cork County Council Fire Service and Roads crews worked throughout Monday night to clear flood water and assist properties affected.The Council Management Team convened on Tuesday to review the situation and will continue to monitor it. Council response crews and contractors remain as a status yellow wind warning is in place for Cork until 7pm.Wet and winy conditions are expected today as Storm Francis crosses Ireland.Southwest winds veering westerly, reaching mean speeds of 55 to 65kmh, will bring widespread severe gusts of 90 to 110kmh (and possibly higher in exposed areas).Following recent weather events, trees have been weakened and remain susceptible to further damage.

Illustration: iStockMore than 80 guests attended an Oireachtas Golf Society dinner in the Station House Hotel, Clifden, Co Galway, last Wednesday at a time when Government regulations strictly limited indoor gatherings. Here is who was at it: Mr Calleary resigned as minister in the fallout from the event. Mr Hogan is now under intense pressure over his position. Former Fianna Fáil TD and senator Donie Cassidy had a table as president of the golf society. The Westmeath politician had eight guests at his table, according to the seating plan – understood to be mainly members of his family. Mr Cassidy resigned as vice-president of Fianna Fáil following the controversy. The society’s 50th anniversary event paid tribute to the late Mark Killilea, a founding member of the group and former Fianna Fáil MEP. Several members of the Killilea family attended the dinner, and his son, Fianna Fáil councillor Donagh Killilea, gave a speech. Former Fianna Fáil minister and property developer Frank Fahey was also at this table. The table included Senator Paddy Burke and councillor Enda McGloin, who both lost the Fine Gael whip as a result of their attendance. Dr Michael Harty, former TD and chair of the Oireachtas health committee, was also at the table. Others included former Fine Gael senator Paul Coghlan, and John Flaherty, captain of the guard at Leinster House, who is responsible for health and safety in the Houses of the Oireachtas. Supreme Court judge Séamus Woulfe and Fianna Fáil Senator Paul Daly have both apologised for their attendance at the event.Mr Justice Woulfe, who is a former attorney general, is now facing a Supreme Court-ordered review by former chief justice Susan Denham into whether he should have attended the event.Daly, who attended the event with his partner, Bernie, was stripped of the party whip last week by Taoiseach Micheál Martin.Galway businessman and owner of the Station House Hotel John Sweeney and his wife, Treena, were listed as guests at the table, as was the ambassador of Morocco.Chief executive of the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland Brian Hayes was seated here, alongside former Fine Gael senator Imelda Henry. Hayes, who is a former Fine Gael junior minister and MEP, apologised for attending the event, but said it did not affect his ability to fulfil his role as head of the BPFI. According to the seating plan, he also had three unnamed guests at the table.Henry, who is no longer in politics and owns a consulting firm, apologised “unreservedly” for attending the event, adding that she attended in a personal capacity.Two Fianna Fáil Senators, Aidan Davitt and Niall Blaney, were among those seated at this table. Both have apologised for attending.Taoiseach Micheál Martin has removed the party whip from both Senators. Mr Davitt has served as a Senator since 2016, while Mr Blaney was elected to the Seanad in 2020.Guests at this table included Fine Gael Senator Jerry Buttimer, who resigned as Leas Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, over the affair. His husband, Conchobar Ó Laoghaire, was also listed as a guest. Buttimer has said it was an “unintended but serious lapse of judgment in attending the event”.Other guests were Senator John Cummins, twice mayor of Waterford and one of three Fine Gael Senators who had the party whip removed from them over the scandal, and Pat McCartan, a former Workers Party TD and now retired Circuit Court judge. Mr McCartan serves as vice-captain of the Oireachtas Golf Society. Also at the table was former Independent TD Paudge Connolly, now a Monaghan County Councillor. The  revealed he was playing golf in Spain nine days previous to the dinner. Spain is not on the Government’s green list of countries, meaning people arriving back from there must quarantine for 14 days. Mr Connolly has yet to respond to a request for comment.Former Fianna Fáil minister of state with responsibility for older people Áine Brady and her husband, Gerry, also a former Fianna Fáil TD for Kildare and a local auctioneer, headed up this table. Neither have responded to phone calls.Kildare was under tightened lockdown restrictions at the time of the golf dinner, which meant residents were restricted to travel within the county, except for work, vital family or medical reasons. Brady is chief executive of Third Age, an organisation that supports older people in Ireland. In a statement reported by the Leinster Leader, she said she was “disappointed that my actions may have distracted from the tremendous work that the organisation does, and I will redouble my efforts to ensure that these programmes will continue to deliver positive outcomes for older people and communities in Ireland.” She added: “I unreservedly apologise and deeply regret my attendance at last week’s event.”There were eight other, as yet unidentified, guests at the Brady table, according to the table plans.Among the guests listed was Loman Dempsey, a property consultant and brother of former Fianna Fáil government minister Noel Dempsey.“I have no comment to make about that.

Photograph: Kenzo TribouillardAFP via GettyEU Commissioner Phil Hogan has sent a memorandum to President Ursula von der Leyen about his movements during a recent trip to Ireland following the controversy surrounding his attendance at a golf dinner of more than 80 people amid Covid-19 restrictions last week.Here is the timeline in full that Mr Hogan has given for his Irish trip:July 31st – Mr Hogan says he arrived in Ireland, completed the statutory Passenger Locator Form and travelled to his temporary residence in Co Kildare.August 5th – Mr Hogan says he was admitted to a Dublin hospital for a medical procedure. While in hospital, he tested negative for Covid-19 (he says www.citizensinformation.ie confirms that a negative test result ends the self-restriction period).August 6th – He says he was discharged from hospital and returned briefly to his temporary residence in County Kildare.August 7th – He says he travelled to Kilkenny before the local lockdown rules came into effect at midnight in Co Kildare (and neighbouring counties Laois and Offaly).August 12th – He says he travelled to Dublin from Kilkenny for essential work reasons, which required his attendance at the European Commission office. While in Dublin, he says also had separate meetings with the Tánaiste and with Minister Robert Troy, to brief them on events relating to ongoing negotiations with the US.August 13th – He says he played golf in Adare, Co Limerick and returned to Kilkenny.August 17th – He says he travelled from Co Kilkenny to Co Galway via Co Kildare. He says he stopped briefly in Co Kildare at the property in which he had been staying for the purpose of collecting some personal belongings and essential papers relating to the ongoing negotiations with the USTR, Robert Lighthizer, which continued while he was in Co Galway. This culminated in an agreement on a package of tariff reductions on August 21st.August 18th – He says he played golf in Co Galway, staying in Clifden. (no formal dinner or reception).August 19th – He played golf in Clifden, and subsequently attended a formal dinner for which he has since apologised.August 21st – He says he returned from Galway to his temporary residence in Co Kildare to collect his remaining personal belongings, including his passport, and stayed there overnight to catch an early morning flight to his primary residence in Brussels from the nearby airport.August 22nd – He returned to Brussels.In Hogan’s words: The full report“Set out below are the relevant requirements issued by the Irish Government in relation to Covid-19 and how I adhered to them at all times while in Ireland.“The Irish Government introduced a range of measures to give effect to public health guidance on Covid-19. Most of these measures have been introduced as Statutory Instruments under the Health Act 1947.“There are three key regulations that are relevant to the recent media coverage concerning my stay in Ireland between July 31st, 2020 and August 21st, 2020.”1. Restrictions on events “This is relevant to the event organised by the Oireachtas Golfing Society in Clifden, Co. Galway on August 19th, 2020.“At the outset I fully accept that it is abundantly clear that the event should not have been held and that I should not have attended this dinner. I accept this and have made a full apology to the Irish people for having done so.“From a regulatory perspective Statutory Instrument (SI) 234 of 2020 imposed a restriction on a person organising an event indoors to keep the numbers attending below 50 people. The legal obligations imposed by this Regulation rest with the organisers of the event rather than the attendees.“On August 18th, 2020 the Irish Government announced a tightening of this regulation to restrict events to no more than 15 people, although I understand that the Statutory Instrument giving effect to this change and the relevant official guidance to the hospitality sector were only made available subsequent to the event.“In reality this means that the dinner did not come within the remit of the new rules agreed on August 18th. The event is now the subject of a police inquiry to determine its compliance with Covid-19 rules.“I was an invited guest to the event on August 19th, 2020 and was assured by the organisers and the hotel that it was being held in full compliance with all relevant Covid-19 rules.“I had no reason to question or doubt that assurance, particularly in circumstances where an Irish Government Minister was attending and speaking at the event. Again I now recognise that the event should not have proceeded and I should not have attended.”2. Requirements to complete a locator form “SI 181 of 2020 imposes an obligation on international passengers arriving in Ireland to complete a Passenger Locator Form. The information provided on the form is used to contact arrivals over the next 14 days to determine their location and may be used for contact tracing for confirmed or suspected cases of Covid-19. The requirements to provide information apply to international passengers, with some exceptions including persons having diplomatic status.“I went to Dublin on essential official business on August 12th, 2020 to brief the Tánaiste, and the Minister for Trade on EU-US trade talks and to attend an event in the European Commission Office.“As I had submitted my contact details on the Passenger Locator Form I remained fully accessible to the authorities at all times as required by the Regulations, notwithstanding that my negative Covid-19 status had been determined since arrival to the State.”3. Restrictions on movement within specific lockdown areas “On August 7th, 2020, the Irish Government introduced a localised lockdown covering three counties, including Kildare, where I was initially staying before admittance to hospital. This lockdown was enforced by SI 295 of 2020 which specifies movement restrictions within the counties involved. People living within the county are not allowed to leave the county and those living outside the county are not permitted to enter the relevant counties.“There are some exceptions – firstly, a person can drive through the county to get to another county and secondly a person can enter the county if they have ‘a reasonable excuse’ to do so. Examples of a reasonable excuse include for reasons of work, moving residence, etc. The law clarifies that the examples listed are specified ‘without prejudice to what constitutes a reasonable excuse’ for the purposes of the restrictions.“In my case, I was in hospital in the run up to the lockdown being introduced and then travelled back to Kildare before going to recuperate in my home county (Kilkenny), which was not under lockdown. I had left Kildare before the lockdown was introduced at midnight on August 7th. My subsequent trips concerning Kildare were as follows“I subsequently passed through Kildare without stopping en route to Dublin on August 12th where I had separate meetings with An Tánaiste, Mr Varadkar and the Minister of State for Trade, Mr. Robert Troy about ongoing EU-US trade talks. I also had a short meeting at the offices of the European Commission. I returned to Kilkenny that evening, travelling through Kildare en route without stopping.“It was during this journey I was stopped by a member of the Irish police who had seen me holding a phone while I was driving. The policeman cautioned me against holding a phone and there were no charges or further actions under the road traffic legislation. I very much regret having answered the phone while driving.“Late on August 21st, I returned from Galway to my apartment in Kildare to collect my belongings including my passport for the purpose of travelling back to my primary residence in Brussels very early the next morning.“To my best understanding, my justification for entering County Kildare to obtain essential working documents or to get my belongings for the purpose of returning home to Brussels constitutes ‘a reasonable excuse’ under the regulations. At all times during my brief presence in Kildare over the period, I followed public health guidance.“To the best of my knowledge and ability I believe that I complied with public health regulations in Ireland during my visit.”"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Researchers say man had no Covid-19 symptoms the second time, suggesting immune system kept virus somewhat in checkLocals and police search the debris after five-storey structure crumbles in MahadLuon Sovath, who has spent decades fighting for human rights, was the victim of a vicious smear campaign this summerFears that country teetering on edge of major outbreak supported by data on rise in daily casesWhite supremacist killed 51 worshippers at two New Zealand mosques in March 2019Health condition \u0026lsquovery worrying\u0026rsquo after drinking tea that allies believe was laced with poisonDecision to transfer Kremlin critic ill with suspected poisoning after day of lobbyingProtests over last two months most serious threat yet to prime minister\u0026rsquos administrationLack of foreign visitors has facilitated increase in poaching and loss of revenueReport by US intelligence agencies sheds light on actions \u0026ndash and inactions \u0026ndash that created global crisisTens of thousands evacuated as record-breaking rains hit country\u0026rsquos southwestCountry entering dangerous new phase of rising infections in small towns and villagesUS president \u0026lsquopatently wrong\u0026rsquo when telling Minnesota crowd New Zealand situation \u0026lsquoterrible\u0026rsquoPolling put back by four weeks as 49 Covid-19 cases recorded in AucklandStudent-led demonstrations gain momentum testing laws protecting royal familyCovid-19 outbreak spreads to more than 30 people and extends beyond capitalJacinda Ardern sounds warning as number of cases in locked-down Auckland rises to 17Hundreds of police had raided Apple Daily in move decried as assault on press freedom\u0026lsquoGoing hard, going early with lockdown is still the best response,\u0026rsquo Jacinda Ardern saysReturn to nationwide restrictions announced by PM Jacinda Ardern in surprise press conferenceStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4335701.1598013937!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit uk time wasting makes deal unlikely says barnier","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBrexit negotiator Michel Barnier: “Frankly I am disappointed and I am worried.”  Photograph: Yves HermanPOOLAFP via Getty ImagesThe EU’s Brexit negotiator has warned that valuable time is being wasted in trade talks with the UK as he accused his British counterparts of failing to make progress on topics of key interest to Europe during the latest round of trade negotiations. Michel Barnier said he was disappointed, concerned and surprised by the lack of progress displayed in discussions that took place in Brussels this week, reiterating that at this stage an agreement between the two sides still looked unlikely and that there was a risk the two sides would fail to ratify a deal by the end of the year. “Too often this week it felt as if we were going backwards more than forwards,” Mr Barnier said at a press conference following the conclusion of the latest negotiations. “I simply do not understand why we are wasting valuable time.” The failure to advance the discussions that began on Tuesday evening leaves only a narrow window in which to agree the text of a trade agreement, translate it into multiple European languages and obtain ratification before the post-Brexit transition period ends on December 31st. While both the UK and EU insist they want a deal, EU officials decried a lack of momentum on the British side in the wake of Thursday’s session, with one describing it as “puzzling”. David Frost, the UK’s chief negotiator, acknowledged in a separate statement that there had been “little progress” during the week’s talks, but he also insisted that a deal remained possible even if it would not be easy to achieve.State aid and fisheriesThe EU wants the two sides to push towards a common understanding on the topics of state aid and fisheries, rather than leaving these highly sensitive topics until later in the talks, but British negotiators are seeking to advance to a legal text in other areas where the two sides are closer together.Lord Frost criticised the EU’s approach on Friday. “The EU is still insisting not only that we must accept continuity with EU state aid and fisheries policy, but also that this must be agreed before any further substantive work can be done in any other area of the negotiation, including on legal texts,” he said. “This makes it unnecessarily difficult to make progress.”Mr Barnier complained that he was not seeing any willingness on the UK side to take on board the EU’s priorities, adding that the need for a “level playing field” that ensures fair competition in areas including state aid would not go away and was a non-negotiable precondition to any trade deal.“No international agreement was ever reached without the parties agreeing to common rules,” he said. The notion of a zero-tariff, zero-quota agreement without level playing field provisions and a balanced deal on fisheries was a “non-starter” for the EU, and the absence of progress in these areas was blocking everything, he warned.British negotiating officials said the talks were stalling due to the problematic issues of fishing and state aid, over which they accused the EU of seeking to maintain the status quo.“What is frustrating is that Barnier wants to see us continuing arrangements very like those we had as members of the EU. The principle of ‘Brexit means Brexit’ is a good one and should be applied across the board,” the official said.“The process block now is that we must accept their position on state aid and fisheries before we can talk about anything else. We’re obviously not going to do that, so we’re frozen.”Key concernsMr Barnier confirmed that the UK had presented a draft legal text for the trade deal during the round of talks, but he added that this had not addressed the EU’s key concerns, serving instead as a reminder of the UK’s existing positions.Lord Frost added that the UK was seeking a relationship that ensures Britain regains “sovereign control of our own laws, borders, and waters” and is similar to other agreements struck by the EU elsewhere. “When the EU accepts this reality in all areas of the negotiation, it will be much easier to make progress.” A dinner between Mr Barnier and Lord Frost was held on Thursday evening after negotiations concluded, which officials suggested was tense following the lack of progress. “It was a very nice dinner, we had courteous and friendly discussions but we didn’t hide the difficulties between us,” one inidual said. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Ina FassbenderAFP via GettyThomas von Pluto is walking the empty corridors of his school in west Berlin, with blue tape lines on the grey linoleum floors.Another day of teaching over, the 34-year-old deputy director of Berlin’s Robert Jungk secondary school has no idea how many rolls of tape he’s gone through for 1.5m floor markings.His school, like all in the German capital, is in its third week back after the summer break and the only thing the same are the hives at the back of the yard, where bees produce school honey.With little fuss, and a remarkable air of calm, he explains how the school staff and 950 pupils aged 11-19 have been reinventing their education on the fly.“A big rethink is going on and we have to anticipate what will happen if things can’t continue this way. It hangs over everything,” says von Pluto.Germany’s federal structure means 16 states all operate their own education systems, from choice of lesson material to holiday dates.Mecklenburg-Vorpommern on the northeastern Baltic coast reopened schools on August 1st while Bavarian children don’t return until September 7st. Each has its own rules on distancing and face masks: some now require masks in classrooms, others just in corridors.All returned states have had infections of pupils and teachers, quarantines and, in some cases, school closures. State authorities all insist that – despite a reported 400 school infection cases nationwide, and rising – the situation is manageable, for now.The western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, home to 2½ million school-age children, says 97.8 per cent of its schools were open in their first week, August 12th-19th. Berlin’s school minister, Sandra Scheeres, insisted on Friday that 40 cases of the virus at city schools was not a cause for concern.Union pessimismThe GEW teachers’ union – with 280,000 members, one of the largest – is more pessimistic. It says Germany’s decentralised education structures have led to widespread confusion on responsibility and obligations.“We’ve teachers who are diabetic and over 60 being told they have to teach, and risk-group parents worried their children will bring something home,” says Dr Ilka Hoffmann, GEW’s federal spokeswoman on schools. “We see no coherent strategy, just politicians responding to a business lobby demand to open schools so their employees can return to work.”Berlin schools were given just three days to adapt a general hygiene plan to their buildings. The 1.5m distance rule no longer applies, allowing class sizes to return to normal, though most have abolished “streams” to minimise mixing of pupils.Where possible, schools should have dedicated stairwells for each year and capacity limits in smaller rooms. Another rule is to ventilate classrooms between lessons. That’s no problem in Robert Jungk – an airy complex opened in 2001 – but impossible in other schools built in the 1970s, or even the 1870s.Von Pluto says pupils have been generally good at wearing masks, though some need reminding. Extra school cleaning has been provided by the local authority, he adds, but the pandemic has highlighted long-existing weaknesses in digital learning.Another shutdownThat has created a huge, tiring learning curve for teachers: learning-by-doing digital education while co-ordinating timetables and teaching plans with colleagues in anticipation of another shutdown.Berlin’s city-state government offers a cloud hub, but each school has to organise its own digital offerings – and finance it out of its own budget. The pandemic has pushed many schools to take the digital plunge, finding non-commercial messaging apps and teaching platforms that conform with EU data protection rules.Many German teachers are still waiting for work computers and tablets, the GEW teaching union says, while some students without tablets are trying to do their homework on smartphones.Berlin’s Robert Jungk school has not had Covid-19 cases to date and its deputy principal says the last weeks have shown how much in education is possible digitally – but also how irreplaceable everyone finds the analogue experience.“Teachers and pupils were delighted to see each other back in school because teaching and learning simply don’t work without the social component,” he says. “This is a process of adjustment over a year, not just one week. That’s something we have to keep reminding ourselves.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Netanyahu says now is not the time to drag the country into an unwanted fourth electionSaudi minister says \u0026lsquopeace must be achieved\u0026rsquo on the basis of international agreementsOne found guilty, three acquitted in UN-backed tribunal into killing of former Lebanese PMCourt rules there is no proof Syria was involved in Hariri\u0026rsquos assassinationFour low-ranking members of the Shia Muslim Hezbollah political party are accused of killing the former prime minister and 21 others in a massive bombing in 2005Two countries taking steps towards normal relations with telephone links and flightsPutin suggestion came after Trump said he would trigger a \u0026lsquosnapback\u0026rsquo of sanctionsAs inquiry into Beirut blast gets under way, rescue of country not ruling class urgedThursday\u0026rsquos announcement underlines split in Arab world on Palestinian questionIsraeli right wing furious over decision to drop plans for annexation of parts of the occupied West BankDire condition of Libyan migrant detention centres condemned by human rights groupsCountries to open diplomatic relations for first time and Palestine accuses UAE of selling outAgreement between the two countries described as \u0026lsquoa complete sellout\u0026rsquo of PalestiniansMove seen as victory for Israeli PM Binyamin Netanyahu and will infuriate PalestiniansCountry needs administration that can fight graft, says German ministerWith 200 dead, 6,000 injured and 300,000 destitute, the mood in Beirut is unbendingNames of victims read aloud at demonstration near site of explosion that killed at least 171Prime minister Hassan Diab says blast that killed at least 163 was result of endemic corruptionResignation of government could enable international donors to sideline corrupt administrationPolice fire tear gas near parliament as donors pledge \u0026lsquomajor resources\u0026rsquo after explosionStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4332116.1597668041!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"inside joe biden s race of a lifetime to be us president","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDemocratic presidential candidate Joe Biden: Should he make it to the White House, Biden would have completed the longest marathon in US political history. Photograph: Olivier DoulieryAFP via Getty ImagesIt was late afternoon on February 2nd, the eve of the Iowa caucuses. We were jammed into a high-school gymnasium in Des Moines, the state capital, for Joe Biden’s closing rally.No one thought he would win the primary season’s talismanic opening contest the following day. Nor was he expected to come close to beating Bernie Sanders, the socialist Vermonter, in New Hampshire the next week. Though he was still ahead in the national polls, the 77-year-old former vice-president was treated as yesterday’s news.A crowd of several hundred was waiting unexpectantly. Biden entered roughly half an hour late, accompanied by a phalanx of retired politicians: John Kerry (76), the former secretary of state Chris Dodd (75), the retired senator from Connecticut Tom Vilsack (69), former governor of Iowa and Harold Schaitberger (73), president of the International Association of Firefighters.The oxygen seemed to drain from the room. As Biden’s surrogates spoke one after the other, the air got progressively thinner. By the time the candidate got up to speak, it was positively embalmed. “This is like a wake,” joked one veteran television anchor. Biden’s low-key soliloquy did little to lift the energy.Such are the limits of conventional wisdom. Twenty-seven days later, Biden grabbed the Democratic mantle after sweeping the South Carolina primary. With the notable exception of Sanders, who fought on for another five weeks, most of the rest of the field dropped out and endorsed him. It was a breathtaking twist.With hindsight, Biden officials say they always knew he would be the Democratic nominee. They were playing the long game. “We made a decision from the start not to listen to the loudest voices on Twitter,” says Stef Feldman, Biden’s policy director. That was not how many sounded at the time. When I asked a Biden staffer in Des Moines about the campaign’s mood, he used the TV anchor’s same funereal analogy.Who could blame them? Biden’s long history of running for the White House offered no cause for hope. Over a  of more than 32 years, he had not won a single primary. In 1987, he crashed out months before the voting began, having been accused of plagiarising a speech by Neil Kinnock, leader of the British Labour party.In 2008, he quit after having won just 0.9 per cent of the Iowa caucus vote. “At that point, most people thought his presidential career was over,” says Shailagh Murray, then a journalist with the Washington Post, who went on to become Biden’s deputy chief of staff. He had at least another 12 years to go. Nobody that night imagined that Barack Obama, winner of the Iowa caucus, would go on to pick Biden as his ­running mate.Ceremonial presidentThe vicissitudes of Biden’s 50 years in politics ought to make anyone sceptical of forecasts for this November. In the absence of time machines, we can only go by the numbers. Both the betting markets (about two to one in Biden’s favour) and the polls (an average eight-percentage-point lead over Donald Trump) suggest Biden will be America’s 46th president.What manner of president would he make? Half of Washington claims to know the man well. At a year above the median US male’s life expectancy, many expect him to be a ceremonial president. Even Biden’s close friends admit his energy and power of recall are not what they were.His would be a restorationist presidency – an erasure of what he is fond of describing as the Trumpian “aberration”. Others, notably Trump, depict him as a geriatric prisoner of the Democratic Party’s left. Most agree that whatever his agenda, and whatever the time of day, he would probably still talk too much.The word “logorrhea” (a tendency to extreme loquacity) has recently come into fashion. Biden’s campaign is keen to emphasise he would not, like Trump, be the “Twitterer-in-chief”.Those who know him the best – many of whom spoke to me for this profile – are in little doubt about the character he would bring to the presidency. Their Biden may stray too readily into schmaltz. But his empathy for people is real. In this pandemic-blighted election year, that quality could count for a lot.“Biden is the same guy I first met in 1969 – he was full of piss and vinegar,” says Louis Susman, a Chicago-based investor and former ambassador to the UK. “He doesn’t suffer from inner demons, he doesn’t bear grudges and he loves being around people.”Should he make it to the White House, Biden would have completed the longest marathon in US political history. No other serious figure has tried this long to make it over the finishing line in recent history.A majority of Americans were not born when Biden first entered national politics. At 30, he was the fifth youngest senator in the country’s history after he won office in 1972. Biden’s 48-year political career is older than John F Kennedy, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama when they were elected.Yet he sounds remarkably similar today to the ambitious, blue-collar Irish-American that he was then. Staffers tried and failed to get him to avoid using words such as “record player” during the 2020 primaries. Calling someone a “horse’s ass” is no longer thought to be cutting. In an interview with Kitty Kelley in 1974, Biden worried about being seen as a “gay young bachelor” around Washington – by which he meant “happy”, not “LGBTQ”.So popular are Biden’s anachronisms that there is even a “Biden insult bot” – a Twitter algorithm – to which fans can turn. “You got something stuck in your craw, you milk-swillin’ circus peanut,” reads one tweet. “Shut your piehole, you hood-winked britch soiler,” reads another.‘Amtrak Joe’Most American voters already know of the ­tragedy that struck Biden in his early career. A few weeks after he was elected to the Senate, he lost his wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter, Naomi, in a car crash while they were Christmas shopping in Delaware, his home state.His sons, Beau, aged three, and Hunter, aged two, survived but were hospitalised with severe injuries. Most people would have disintegrated. Biden considered not taking his Senate seat. In the end, he was persuaded to be sworn in at the hospital beside one of his sons. He said he could only continue in politics if he saw his kids every morning and night.Thus was born “Amtrak Joe” – the senator who took the 90-minute journey each evening from Washington to Wilmington to say goodnight to his sons. He commuted until 2008, long after the boys had grown up. Subtracting a tenth of nights for other travel, and nearly half the year for recess and weekends, I calculate that Biden spent at least 21,000 hours – or three years of his life – on that train.“He knew the names of every conductor and they all loved him,” says Paul Laudicina, Biden’s legislative director between 1977 and 1982. “Often, he would still be talking when he boarded, and I would go to Wilmington with him and then cross the platform and come straight back.”In the 1974 Kelley interview, the famously acerbic journalist said Biden “reeks of decency”. He nevertheless managed to sound almost Trumpian about his deceased wife. “Let me show you my favourite picture of her,” he says, holding up a snapshot of Neilia in a bikini. “She had the best body of any woman I ever saw. She looks better than a Playboy bunny, doesn’t she?” Kelley described his office as a shrine to Neilia.Biden recently conceded that he has been too invasive of women’s personal space – “handsiness” has also entered the DC lexicon. Unlike some of his contemporaries, however, he has not been dogged by rumours of infidelity. A former Senate staffer, Tara Reade, accused him earlier this year of sexually assaulting her in a corridor in 1993. Biden denies it and her story has been criticised as inconsistent.In 1977 Biden married Jill Tracy Jacobs, a teacher based in Wilmington. On their first date he dressed in a jacket. When he dropped her back home he shook her hand. According to What it Takes, the ­celebrated 1988 campaign book by the late ­Richard Ben Cramer, Jill said she could not believe such men still existed. “Jill is Biden’s least appreciated strength,” says Susman, who often hosted the Bidens for Thanksgiving in his Nantucket home.Much of Biden’s sense of gravity comes from her. Even when her husband was vice-president, Jill Biden continued to teach every day at a community college in Northern Virginia. When he left office in 2017, the Bidens’ net worth was less than $500,000. They still hadn’t paid off the mortgage on their Wilmington home.Irish-Catholic and handsomeUntil he was rescued from near-certain genteel decline by Obama, Biden was defined by his disastrous 1988 presidential bid. Most of the people who helped him on that jinxed quest, including Ted Kaufman, his long-running chief of staff, Michael Donilon, his chief strategist today, and Donilon’s brother Tom, Biden’s foreign-policy adviser, are still around him.They are mostly Irish-American and very tight-knit. Cathy Russell, Tom Donilon’s wife, was Jill Biden’s chief of staff when she was “second lady”. Her husband is tipped as a possible secretary of state. Kaufman is running Biden’s presidential transition – that long and rickety bridge between victory and inauguration.In the 1988 campaign, Biden tried to present himself as the new John F Kennedy – young, Irish-Catholic and handsome. It never quite took hold. Then he saw a video of Kinnock’s soaring oratory – “Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university?” That was the middle-class poetry Biden had been lacking – the story of how the sons and daughters of coal miners had been lifted up by the welfare state, Britain’s version of the New Deal.“He grabbed that tape and took it home he inhaled the thing,” wrote Cramer. “It was like when Barbra Streisand came on the radio – Kinnock was singing Joe’s song.” For the most part, Biden credited Kinnock’s words. But the rival Michael Dukakis campaign found one tape where Biden had not. They leaked it.Suddenly, Biden was inundated with calls asking whether his grandfather had been a coal miner (none of his forebears had been). “It looked like Joe didn’t just steal the words, it looked like he ripped off Kinnock’s life,” Cramer wrote. A few months after dropping out, Biden had a near-fatal ­aneurysm. Then another. He was given a 50-50 chance of ­surviving the first nine-hour operation.“Joe wouldn’t be alive today if he had still been running for president,” says Kaufman. “He wouldn’t have had the time to get his headaches checked out.” Or, as Biden said when he emerged from the anaesthetic: “Now I know why the campaign ended like it did.” For what it’s worth, Kinnock’s Labour Party lost the election too.Emotional antennaeBiden’s 2008 loss left less of a mark on him, partly because he became vice-president less than a year later. “How could you begrudge losing to Barack Obama?” says Murray. “Obama was like The Beatles.”The campaign Biden still regrets was the one that he didn’t fight in 2016. His reluctance stemmed from another tragedy, the death in 2015 of his son Beau from brain cancer. But he had little encouragement from Obama, who had already committed to backing Hillary Clinton. Biden’s internal polls show that he would have beaten Trump. But he had little chance of wresting the crown from Clinton, whose machine he could not hope to match.In his memoir Promise Me, Dad, named after Beau’s request that his father stay in politics, Biden recounts his anger following a Politico story that he was exploiting his son’s death for electoral purposes. “It exceeded even my worst expectations of what the opposition was going to be like,” he wrote. In truth, he could not discuss running without breaking down. “He would literally start to cry every time we raised the subject,” says a Biden ­confidante.In another cycle, Biden’s lachrymosity might have been an albatross. During coronavirus, his emotional antennae look like a virtue. More than 165,000 Americans have now died in the pandemic. That toll is likely to be approaching a quarter of a million by early November.Trump’s inability to express condolences for America’s grieving families could not be further apart from Biden’s. In 2016, anger was the dominant political emotion. In 2020, it feels more like sadness. “If Trump were matter, then Biden is anti-matter – their characters are opposites,” says Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor who has been advising Biden on constitutional matters since the mid-1980s.When Biden was vice-president, Norm Ornstein, a veteran Congressional watcher, lost his son in a tragic accident. “The moment he heard, Biden telephoned and spent an hour on the phone with me and my wife, talking us through it,” says ­Ornstein. “The next day I received a handwritten letter of condolence from him. There is nothing fake about his sympathy. He feels it deeply.”Andrew Yang, the maverick hit of the Democratic primaries, says: “When most people hadn’t figured out who I was, Joe took me aside and was very gracious and friendly. This was just as true when things were going badly for him – he’s always steady and good-natured, in public and in private.”‘Shoot. Me. Now’Some in Biden’s world admit they have one or two concerns about the election and beyond. Chief of these is his tendency to make gaffes. In that sense, the lockdown has a silver lining: there is no campaign trail to avoid. Zoom is easier to manage.When Obama was elected to the US Senate in 2004, Biden invited him to join the foreign relations committee, of which he was chairman. Having listened to a trademark Biden disquisition, Obama scribbled a note and handed it to a staffer. It read: “Shoot. Me. Now.”When the two men were discussing how they would handle their White House relationship, Obama said: “I want your advice Joe, I just want it in 10-minute, not 60-minute, increments.” For the most part, Biden complied.Sometimes, he could not help himself. The term “Bidenism” – self-inflicted public humiliation – has long been in currency. “Stand up Chuck, let ’em see ya,” Biden once said to a Missouri state senator in a wheelchair. “Folks, I can tell you, I’ve known eight presidents, three of them intimately,” he said in praise of Obama, adding: “I promise you, the president has a big stick, I promise you,” in a mangled rendition of Theodore Roosevelt’s dictum about speaking softly and carrying a big stick.Fear of such miscues saw the Obama camp “quarantine” Biden for most of the 2012 re-election campaign. This year’s actual quarantine could thus be helpful.Many in Biden world are betting that his choice of Kamala Harris as running mate will immunise him against a record of racial gaffes. Earlier this year, Biden apologised after saying that “you ain’t black” if you would consider voting against him. As a mixed-race American of Indian and Jamaican heritage, the Harris pick will buy Biden more protection.Given Biden’s age, she is far likelier than most running mates to become president. As Biden discovered in the primaries, she also knows how to throw a punch.It is hard to find anyone in Biden’s circle who is losing sleep over three debates with Trump later this year. As Biden showed in 2008 with Sarah Palin and in 2012 with Paul Ryan – the Republican running mates of John McCain and Mitt Romney – he is a surprisingly taut debater.Trump, meanwhile, seems to be afflicted with his own severe dose of logorrhea. His recent boast in a Fox News interview that he recalled five words in order in a cognitive test was greeted with mockery. “I have two words for you,” says a senior adviser, when I ask about Biden’s age and prolixity: “Donald Trump. ”Biden’s peopleNor is the campaign worried about Twitter. When I asked two Biden officials whether he composed his own tweets, or would know how to send one, I got an unexpectedly constipated response: “No one has ever asked us that.” It turns out that Biden does not physically send his own tweets but is involved with their substance.Their second concern is ageing. At 74, Trump is only a smidgen younger than Biden. The difference with Trump is the people with whom Biden would surround himself. Chief among these is Ron Klain, a long-standing Biden aide who is likely to be White House chief of staff. Tony Blinken would probably be his national security adviser.Other top-job contenders would include Tom Donilon and Susan Rice (successive national security advisers to Obama), Kurt Campbell (who ran Asia policy for Obama), Jake Sullivan (who leads Biden’s campaign policy), Nick Burns, a former under secretary of state, and Bill Burns (no relation), a former deputy secretary of state. Michèle Flournoy, a former under secretary of defence, is tipped as a likely Pentagon chief.One adviser predicted that Biden would choose Romney, the Republican senator from Utah, as his secretary of state. That would annoy Vladimir Putin’s Russia, whom Romney described as America’s “number one geopolitical foe”. It would also upset most Democrats for very different reasons.Either way, the contrast between Biden’s friends and the parade of often bizarre cameos that have staffed the Trump administration is glaring. The current president is now on his fourth chief of staff and sixth national security adviser. By contrast, most of Biden’s coterie have known him for decades.“What leaps out about Biden’s people is their competence,” says John Podesta, a senior official in both the Clinton and Obama White Houses. “Neither he nor his team need training wheels.”There are also lingering worries about Hunter Biden, who has long been a source of concern for his father. “Joe has a total blind spot about Hunter,” says a close family friend.Hunter was discharged from the US Navy because he tested positive for cocaine. He launched various business ventures while his father was vice-president. He was accused of monetising the Biden name and subsequently got a seat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.Trump’s attempts to extort Ukraine to supply Biden opposition research resulted in his impeachment last year (though he was acquitted by the Senate). “The campaign just has to keep Hunter out of the picture,” says the friend.Radical platformWhat would Biden actually do in office? Tackling the pandemic would be the first, second and third priority of any incoming president. Little can happen while the US economy is under semi-­permanent lockdown.Beyond that his economic platform is radical by the standards of any recent Democratic president, including Obama. “We would have the largest mobilisation of investments since world war two,” says Feldman. “We would start by putting pandemic logistics and supply on a war footing.”Some people compare the gargantuan challenges of today to 1932, when Franklin D Roosevelt won the election in the middle of the Great Depression. In spite of running a fairly bland campaign, FDR then embarked on a streak of “bold, persistent experimentation” that would remake America.But the differences are more interesting. For all its ravages, coronavirus is not as intractable as the Great Depression. By next January, the world should be closer to having a vaccine. Biden would also be fulfilling the first rule of any job – always follow an under-performer.He could achieve a lot in his first 100 days simply by covering the basics, such as launching a national coronavirus plan, shunning Twitter and not insulting foreign leaders. “If you have an American president at foreign summits eating with his mouth closed and not throwing cutlery around, the world will give him a standing ovation,” says one adviser and friend.Low-hanging foreign-policy fruit that Biden would pluck in his opening days include rejoining the World Health Organisation, the Paris agreement on climate change and the Iran nuclear deal, says Jake Sullivan. He would also convene a global summit to tackle Covid-19.Domestic steps would include stopping work on the US-Mexico border wall (such as it is), setting up a daily coronavirus briefing led by Dr Anthony Fauci or Ron Klain (who led Obama’s Ebola team) and picking an attorney general who would embrace planks of Black Lives Matter’s criminal-justice reform agenda.In his dealings both with Republicans and foreign leaders, Biden would place great stock in personal chemistry. Enjoying the company of people is one area where Biden is as different to Obama as he is to Trump. “The thing that Biden most likes is what Obama liked the least – the ­personal stuff,” says Podesta. Nick Burns says Biden revels in the “constant gardening” of diplomacy – talking frequently to his counterparts.Wishful thinkingSceptics point out that today’s Republican Party is unrecognisable to the one with which Biden grew up. Should he emerge intact from transition with a paranoid Trump, the chances of the defeated party working with him will be slim. Woke nativism will prove a more durable pathogen than Covid-19.Moreover, Biden’s global honeymoon would be unlikely to last long. Most people view his musings about restoring the status quo ante – going back to the world before Trump – as wishful thinking, not that geopolitical trends were particularly stable during the Obama years.China looms far larger today than it did in 2016. Biden’s favourite European, Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, is due to retire by next year. And Biden will neither be inclined – nor likely in a position – to offer Britain’s Boris Johnson the US-UK trade deal he craves.Tony Blinken, Biden’s senior foreign policy adviser, says Biden’s scepticism about Obama’s ineffectual Afghanistan surge looks better and better in hindsight. “I respect Gates tremendously but he just wanted approval for his Afghanistan plan and Biden disagreed,” he says. Biden was in favour of US intervention in Bosnia in 1995, he adds, to convey that Biden is not some ­inveterate peacenik.But Biden’s biggest migraine would probably be at home. In the coming weeks, Trump is likely to make a lot of Biden’s “socialist” agenda – the hundreds of billions he has pledged to spend on everything from college education to rural broadband.Should Biden follow Obama’s example and pick Wall Street-friendly economic advisers, the left’s distrust would soon resurface. Last week, Lawrence Summers, Obama’s chief economic adviser and Bill Clinton’s Treasury secretary, ruled out joining a Biden administration. “My time in government is behind me,” he told the Aspen Security Forum.Happy passengerTo many people’s surprise, the left has largely fallen into line. Bernie Sanders dropped nearly all his most-cherished demands to agree a joint platform with Biden. This is in stark contrast to Sanders’s stand-offish – and simmeringly uneasy – ceasefire with Hillary Clinton in 2016.An estimated one-fifth of Sanders’s supporters in 2016 either sat on their hands or voted for Trump. Biden has not adopted a universal basic income, Medicare for all or a wealth tax – Sanders’s top three priorities.Yet the Vermont senator seems to be a happy passenger on Amtrak Joe’s train. Their policies may differ but their values are not miles apart. “Biden believes that his ultimate calling is to make life better for the middle class,” says Jared Bernstein, an economic adviser. “His watchword is ‘dignity.’” Ted Kaufman adds: “Biden and Bernie may disagree ideologically but they respect each other’s integrity.”Might such charms work on Republicans? I spoke to many people in Biden’s world and none thought the Republican leopard was likely to change its spots. One said: “Joe is still a romantic about the Senate. He will have to learn the hard way.”The omens for old-fashioned Biden-style bipartisanship are not cheerful. Yet there is an improbability to Biden’s odyssey that should give anyone pause. The lyrics may be corny. The music is not. It is an odd mix of Shakespearean tragedy and Shakespearean comedy.I have heard people describe Biden as the embodiment of America’s can-do spirit. Shailagh Murray called him a “spiritual optimist”. A campaign official talked of his “strategic empathy”. I have also heard people call Biden a “clown”, including a former Obama official.Biden loves to talk of when “the man meets the moment”. The joke is that he has said this about himself every time he has run for office. There has never been a moment where Biden does not think he should be residing in the White House.But like a stopped clock, perhaps this time he is right. “Life is about choices, right?” says a former senior CIA official who has interacted with Biden over more than three decades. “Biden or Trump?” He admitted that he occasionally saw Biden as a “mediocre” politician. But he added that Biden always struck him as fundamentally decent, which sounds like a subversive quality in today’s Washington.“Even if you thought that Biden was mediocre,” he continued, “you would take mediocre over catastrophic every time.”– Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Full coverage of the US presidential election 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4338524.1598365249!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"teenagers unearth 1 100 year old gold coins in israel","story":"The Israel Antiquities Authority has announced a find of rare gold coins in Yavneh, south of Tel Aviv, during an archaeological excavation.

Photograph: Heidi LevineAFP via Getty ImagesThe treasure needed to be secured. So the hoard of 425 gold coins was stowed in a clay jar, its lid secured with a nail, and stashed in the sands of what is now central Israel. It then sat undisturbed for more than 1,100 years, until last week, when two 18-year-olds taking part in an archaeological excavation by a hillside in Yavneh noticed something unusual. “I dug in the ground and, when I excavated the soil, saw what looked like very thin leaves,” said Oz Cohen, one of the teenagers. “When I looked again, I saw these were gold coins. It was really exciting to find such a special and ancient treasure.”The teenagers were volunteers in a vast project linked to the construction of a community in Yavneh, south of Tel Aviv. The programme offers the promise of connecting young people with history, and, while it is meant to be culturally rewarding, it is not often that someone strikes gold – literally.In fact, Robert Kool, a coin expert at the Israel Antiquities Authority, said the find was a “rare treasure” that could help archaeologists gain a deeper understanding of what was happening in the region at the time. The coins, which weigh less than a kilo and are made of pure gold, date to the ninth century, when the Abbasid Caliphate ruled a vast empire stretching from Persia in the east to North Africa in the west. “The hoard consists of full gold dinars, but also – what is unusual – contains about 270 small gold cuttings, pieces of gold dinars cut to serve as small change,” Mr Kool said in a statement. The cutting of gold and silver coins was a regular feature of the monetary system in Islamic countries after the 850s with the sudden disappearance of bronze and copper coins, he said. One of the cuttings unearthed last week, which Mr Kool said had never before been found in excavations in Israel, included a fragment of a gold solidus coin of the Byzantine emperor Theophilos, who ruled from 829 to 842. Its appearance in an Islamic coin hoard offers proof of the continuous connections between the two rival empires during this period, scholars say. Whether it was through war or trade, money kept flowing. Mr Kool said the era was one of the least understood in Israel and that any clue was useful. But coins are especially telling. “You can read the name of the caliph in Baghdad, ” he said about coins from the time. “The name of the governor who rules in his name in Egypt is often included.” There may also be names of other sub-rulers, the mint where the coin was produced and, most important, the date of production. Liat Nadav-Ziv and Elie Haddad, archaeologists at the Israel Antiquities Authority, which is in charge of the sprawling excavation site, said in a statement that the finding might “indicate that international trade took place between the area’s residents and remote areas”.They also said it was clear that the money had been hidden on purpose. “The person who buried this treasure 1,100 years ago must have expected to retrieve it, and even secured the vessel with a nail so that it would not move,” the statement added. “We can only guess what prevented him from returning to collect this treasure.”It would have been worth a small fortune at the time, Mr Kool said. “For instance,” he said, “a person could buy a luxurious house in one of the best neighborhoods in Fustat, the enormous wealthy capital of Egypt in those days.” – New York TimesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph audio briefings sign new whatsapp group","story":"Keep up to speed with The Briefing, The \u0026#39s two-minute audio updatesNeed a better way to keep up-to-date?

The concert is taking place without a live audience and with fewer musicians because of coronavirus.The decision to buck tradition and reinvent the finale of the Proms season began when Finnish conductor Dalia Stasevska, who is conducting the Last Night, and David Pickard, the BBC Proms director, discussed changing the repertoire to reflect the international debates about racism. But the attempt to placate both camps by choosing arrangements that would not require a soloist prompted accusations that it had “scored an own goal.”Mr Fox called on his supporters to retaliate by buying Dame Vera Lynn’s version of Land of Hope and Glory in a bid to get it to the top of the UK charts.\u0027Would the BBC then have to play it? What a beautiful day that would be,” he wrote on Twitter.Within a few hours, the 1994 remastered track had reached No.1 in the UK iTunes chart.Meanwhile, a petition calling for traditional versions of Rule Britannia and Land of Hope and Glory to be included in the programme attracted more than 20,000 signatures.It accuses the BBC of the “worst kind of tokenism” and insists that the songs are a “vital element of our heritage” that “sustained us in moments of national peril.”  It describes the Last Night as a “much-cherished ritual,” arguing that the songs are sung with pride “but also with a degree of joshing humour and wry self-mockery that is characteristically British.”Mr Sharma said the BBC should ensure that viewers who do not find the words offensive are able to join in from their living rooms.“Personally I would like to see the lyrics sung and of course it is always possible to put lyrics up as subtitles on the screen so if people want to they can join in at home,” he told Times Radio.Trevor Phillips, the former chairman of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission, said the BBC always panicked about race as there was no ethnic ersity at the top.“What you have is rooms full of white men panicking that someone is going to think they are racist,” he added.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bbc made right artistic decision change rule britannia prom","story":"The BBC’s choice to play Rule, Britannia! without words at the Last Night of the Proms was the correct “artistic” decision, its director-general has insisted, as the corporation placed the blame squarely on Covid-19 after days of chaos.Lord Hall, who is to be replaced in the role by Tim Davie in one week\u0027s time, said it was the right decision for this year, as the corporation appeared to backtrack with a statement promising the song would be back in full for 2021. The BBC Proms has already come under pressure to ban songs appearing to glorify Britain\u0027s imperial past, with classical music industry sources suggesting the Covid-19 measures were a convenient reason to make changes.The very public fall-out lays bare the chaos at the centre of BBC decision-making, as it faced complaints from those who believe Rule Britannia should be banned outright for its reference to slavery, and those furious at it caving to what they see as “woke” culture wars.It is understood that the corporation has been considering how to deal with the song for some time, having faced petitions from musicians to remove it from the Last Night altogether.After “BBC sources” briefed a Sunday newspaper that this year’s conductor had her own concerns about the words, the corporation has this week confirmed it will be performed only as an instrumental version as part of a medley.It said the decision was made as a result of wider measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus, with no audience at the Royal Albert Hall to sing along, and no chorus.A spokesman refused to detail who was involved in discussions, saying only that it was a BBC decision in what music critic Norman Lebrecht described as a process of panic, a flurry of meetings and further illustration that no-one at the BBC takes personal responsibility.On Tuesday evening, the BBC issued a new statement insisting the decision was for one year only, with the full programme of songs to be reinstated for a live performance in 2021.“For the avoidance of any doubt, these songs will be sung next year,” said a spokesman.“We obviously share the disappointment of everyone that the Proms will have to be different but believe this is the best solution in the circumstances and look forward to their traditional return next year.”The BBC has faced questions over why only particular songs had been changed in the circumstances while others will be sung in line with recent tradition during the event on September 12.Lord Hall confirmed that the issue of dropping songs because of their association with Britain\u0027s imperial history had previously been discussed.In an interview with the BBC, he said it was a miracle that Proms director David Pickard had put together a fortnight of live performances amid the pandemic.Asked whether there had been a discussion about dropping songs specifically because of their history, he replied: The whole thing has been discussed by David and his colleagues, of course it has.The point is they\u0027ve come to the right conclusion, which is it\u0027s very, very hard in an Albert Hall that takes over 5,000 people to have the atmosphere of the Last Night of the Proms, where a whole audience normally sing along.It\u0027s quite hard creatively and artistically to make that work. I think they\u0027ve come to the right conclusion.Who knows what will happen next year. I suspect it will be back.The fact is we have come to the right conclusion, which is a creative and artistic conclusion, he said on BBC Radio 4\u0027s World At One programme.The BBC said there had been unjustified personal attacks on social media on Finnish conductor Dalia Stasevska, who will be at the helm of the Last Night this year.A “BBC source” had previously told the Sunday Times: Dalia is a big supporter of Black Lives Matter and thinks a ceremony without an audience is the perfect moment to bring change.Decisions about the Proms are made by the BBC, in consultation with all artists involved, the corporation said.Classical music insiders noted that the briefing appeared to have been used by the BBC to test public opinion before it announced an orchestral version of Rule, Britannia!, and later clarified it was for one year only.The corporation had previously been lobbied by those in the classical music world to change the Last Night line-up, regardless of coronavirus measures.Chi-chi Nwanoku, the founder of Chineke! orchestra, told the  she had recently emailed the Proms team urging them to drop Rule Britannia and lyrics that “are just so offensive”.Writing on the Slipped Disc classical music blog, one anonymous musician who played Rule Britannia last year said he and “most” of his orchestra colleagues now “feel uncomfortable” playing it, leaving the BBC with “little choice”.The BBC would not confirm whether incoming director-general Tim Davie was part of the decision-making process, or whether Director of Creative Diversity, June Sarpong, or her team had been consulted.The national anthem and Jerusalem will still be sung during the event, which will air on BBC Radio 3 and on BBC One and feature soprano Golda Schultz and the BBC Symphony Orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall in London.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"boston conference linked 20000 coronavirus cases","story":"A Boston hotel that was linked to a coronavirus outbreak after it hosted a local biotech company\u0027s conference earlier this year likely led to about 20,000 cases, according to the authors of a new study.The outbreak linked to the Marriott Long Wharf hotel was previously only thought to have caused 99 cases, but after studying nearly all the confirmed early cases of the illness in the area by looking at changes in the genetic makeup of coronaviruses, the researchers were able to assess the broader impact of the “super-spreading event”.Scientists in the aftermath of the outbreak conducted what is believed to be the largest genomic analysis of any US outbreak so far, to provide an exceptionally detailed look at how coronavirus cases exploded in the pandemic’s first wave.A team based in Boston analysed the February 27 conference, organised in a hotel in the city by drug company Biogen.They took the virus home with them to the Boston suburbs, Indiana and North Carolina, to Slovakia, Australia and Singapore.Over the following two weeks, the virus that circulated among conference attendees was implicated in at least 35 new cases.In April, the same distinctive viral sub-strain swirled through two Boston homeless shelters, where it infected 122 residents.An analysis of the genome was published on Tuesday on the website MedRxiv, and explained the work of 54 researchers in the field.The 20,000 figure was not included in the report, but the authors told The Boston Globe that their calculations were based on viruses isolated from 772 patients in Essex, Middlesex, Norfolk, and Suffolk counties.Their report will now be peer-reviewed for publication in a scientific journal.At the time of the conference, only 15 cases had been confirmed in the US, and the organisers of the event had no reason not to proceed, they felt.“We didn’t know better,” said Jacob Lemieux, a physician and infectious-disease expert at Massachusetts General Hospital and lead author of the study.“The difference now is there is increasing scientific evidence to show what can happen from a single event like that. We do know better. So we need to learn the lesson.”Scientists were able to precisely track the virus originating at the conference thanks to a mistake made during the coronavirus’ replication process — a simple switch of two letters in the virus’s 30,000-character genetic code.After the conference, each time the infection spread, the mutation spread with it.Every one of the 28 people linked to the conference whose genome was sequenced carried the conference’s characteristic mutation.The mutation was dubbed “C2416T” for its location at the 2,416th spot on the genome and the two nucleic acids, cytosine (C) and uracil (T), that got switched.Sequencing also revealed how the coronavirus evolved even as the Biogen conference was going on. About a quarter of attendees were sickened by a virus whose genome contained both the C2416T mutation and a second mutation, G26233T. In one case, the scientists found both versions of the virus replicating in a single set of lungs.This shows that the G26233T variant is a descendant of the germ that originally arrived at the meeting, said Dr Lemieux.As of mid-July, the variant had been found in about one-third of the cases sequenced in Massachusetts and three per cent of all genomes studied thus far in the United States.The variant has shown up as far afield as Alaska, Luxembourg and Senegal.Bronwyn MacInnis, associate director of viral genomics at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, and a co-author of the study, said the genome analysis was the crown jewel of understanding Covid-19\u0027s spread.She argued that every coronavirus sample collected in the United States should be sent to a genetics lab for sequencing, with the results then shared with health officials and contact tracers, deepening their understanding of their local outbreaks.Scientists and the National Academies say that the United States currently lacks the resources to carry out surveillance in a comprehensive way.Dr McInnis gave the example of a school, where students became infected.If genetic analysis showed they shared a common strain, the virus was most likely transmitted at school, suggesting the facility should close or at least conduct a thorough review of infection-control procedures.But if the infections were genetically unrelated, it’s likely the students contracted the illness elsewhere - in which case the students should stay home, but the school could remain open.“It’s not testing that can answer that question,” she said. “It’s having genomic data to tell you whether they appear to be connected.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"picture special farewell boeing 747","story":"The 747 was imagined in the 1960s to meet a growing demand for air travel, with Pan Am asking Boeing to design a plane twice the size of the 707, the first jetliner.It was the first twin aisle airliner and able to sit up to 10 across in economy class.

Though its appeal to carriers was a low operating cost per seat, many airlines, especially flag carriers, purchased the 747 due to its prestige. Through the 1980s, Boeing was taking scores of orders for the aircraft every year, and delivering as many as 70 to its customers.The 747 brought air travel to the masses but it also ushered in a new Golden Age of Flying, with additional space allowing for unprecedented comfort and luxury.Though more and more people were able to fly, it was still considered a special occasion, prompting travellers and families to dress up for flights. Aircraft serving the holiday markets of the Caribbean were said to have carnival atmospheres on board.As planned by Boeing, the 747 was long popular with cargo operators thanks to its unobstructed fuselage and vast capacity. It could take off with a payload of up to 970,000lbs.Boeing continued to update the aircraft, stretching and modernising it to make it more fuel efficient. There are five main variants, with different models within each category, including the latest, the 747-8. Nasa still has a 747 in service it used to transport spacecraft, while Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic does the same, launching its aircraft at altitude. The evolution of smaller, more fuel efficient aircraft that are easier to fill, such as Boeing’s own 787 Dreamliner, makes the 747 less attractive to airlines. Today, more cargo operators than passenger airlines fly the aircraft, while orders have all but dried up. "},{"url":null,"title":"putin has no good options belarus","story":"In the six years since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, commentators have speculated about what might lead the Kremlin into another military intervention in the eastern part of Europe. What is currently happening in Belarus – large-scale protests against Alexander Lukashenko following rigged presidential elections – has been the most popular bet.Yet, Vladimir Putin – in spite of his well-publicised dislike of public protests – has been hesitant to intervene militarily in the post-Soviet space in response to crises that result from rigged elections and result in large-scale protests. For every Ukraine in 2014, there is Georgia in 2003, Ukraine in 2004, Kyrgyzstan in 2005 and 2010, and Armenia in 2018.True, the international order – and Russia’s place (and, perhaps more importantly, its perceived place) within it – has changed significantly since the so-called colour revolutions of 2003-2005, but there are still lessons to be learnt from Russia’s behaviour over the past decade.The situation in Belarus currently resembles that in Kyrgyzstan and Armenia more than it does that in Ukraine. In Kyrgyzstan and Armenia, popular protests emerged in response to rigged parliamentary elections, with the countries’ kleptocractic leaders ousted by movements promising to crack down on corruption. In much the same way, the protests in Belarus appear to be motivated primarily by domestic issues – the rigged presidential election on August 9, as well as widespread discontent with authoritarian leadership.The protests in Ukraine were motivated by domestic issues, including widespread corruption, as well. But they were also motivated by international issues, most obviously former president Viktor Yanukovych’s last-minute decision to back away from signing an Associate Agreement with the European Union in favour of aligning his country more closely with Russia. As a result, the protests in Kyiv – unlike those in Bishkek or Yerevan – were marked by overt pro-Western, pro-European Union, and anti-Russian messages.Such messages are not visible in Minsk, but this has not stopped Lukashenko from playing on Putin’s fears of a colour revolution in Russia. “Defending Belarus today is nothing less than defending all of our space,” Lukashenko said to Putin, according to state news agency Belta. “If Belarusians don’t hold out, this wave will roll over there.” Lukashenko has also invented military threats facing Belarus from NATO, portraying himself as a last bastion for Russia against an increasingly hostile West.For all of this, however, the Kremlin values Belarus more than it does its leader. Russia tried to remove Lukashenko in 2010, and Lukashenko has rarely been a reliable partner for the Kremlin’s geopolitical games. He refused to recognise the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia in 2008, following Russia’s war with Georgia, and has flip-flopped on Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, maintaining strategic ambiguity ever since.On August 16, when Russia cited the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO), a military bloc of six former Soviet states who have pledged to defend each other in case of attack, it promised only a “readiness to render the necessary assistance to resolve the challenges facing Belarus” and did not mention Lukashenko by name.Does this mean that Russia will not intervene militarily in Belarus? No. But the Kremlin is unlikely to intervene militarily to keep Lukashenko in power, at least in the long term. Instead, Moscow – amid continuing large-scale protests and a steady trickle of defections from Lukashenko’s government – may be willing to contemplate other options, including a power transition. This would become more likely if the Kremlin sees a figure in the disparate Belarus opposition movement with whom it could work.In fact, it would be surprising if the Kremlin were not already testing the water. It did this in Kyrgyzstan in 2010, cultivating links between the governing United Russia party and the head of Kyrgyzstan’s interim government Roza Otunbayeva, and in Armenia in 2018, establishing contact with opposition figures and settling on Nikol Pashinyan while Serzh Sargsyan was still in office. In doing so, both Otunbayeva and Pashinyan made a point of committing to maintain the geopolitical status quo.In Belarus, this option would likely involve the Kremlin having to convince Lukashenko that retirement in exile is the least bad option for him. It would also likely involve having to share a mediation role with EU member states in any political transition process. But the Kremlin may ultimately deem it worthwhile in order to ensure that its core interests are protected.Dr Andrew Foxall is Director of the Russia and Eurasia Studies Centre at the Henry Jackson Society, the London-based international affairs think tankMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ring wild bells part national soundscape","story":"It can take an outsider to spot the obvious. When the composer George Frideric Handel arrived in Britain, he described it as “the ringing isle”, because he heard bells everywhere. And there is something undoubtedly English about the sound of church bells. Apart from a muffled toll for a funeral, it’s mostly a sound of joy and celebration. Think of chimes on a Sunday morning before a service, or a more complex peal for a wedding: it uplifts heart and soul, even for those not attending the service.If bells fall silent, then, as they did throughout the Second World War on Churchill’s express orders – it meant when they rang, people would know there was an invasion by enemy troops – or more recently, during the height of lockdown, we mourn their lack. In Faversham, Kent, though, the bells are about to be silenced for a good reason. A local benefactor has left a £200,000 legacy so that the bells of St Mary of Charity Church can be restored and two smaller new bells can be funded. The ringers are hoping that the smaller bells will encourage younger ringers.Enticing the next generation to train as bellringers is key to keeping this very English tradition going. In September the campanologists’ body, the Council for Bell Ringers, is holding its annual meeting. They’ve had a difficult year: a ban on ringing for several months, no teaching, ringers opting for other interests that require less dedication. But the real problem is finding new blood. As the Council’s strategic priorities paper points out: “We can no longer rely on the church to supply us with recruits, particularly youngsters”. For as church attendance declines, so does ringing apparently.Could there yet be an upsurge? I keep reading surveys telling me that millennials are far keener on religion than baby boomers and that they prayed a lot during lockdown. “God deliver me from Covid and being stuck at home with Mum and Dad” might be a start in terms of young people turning to God again, but the campanalogists can’t wait. They need to find other ways to recruit the next generation right now.Surely it can’t be hard. After all, what’s not to like about literally learning the ropes? We’re all being told that, post-Covid, we need to exercise more, to develop our mental agility, and improve our mental health through being sociable, rather than glued to our laptops. Bell-ringing has it all. I tried it once at a tower open day and pulling bellropes requires strength as well as skill.Then there’s the complex art of change-ringing, first developed in the seventeenth century, and continued since with ever more inventive sequences with similarly inventive names, like Grandsire Doubles and Stedman Cinques. On paper they look like mathematical formulae, for ringing requires the kinds of intellectual workout that’s good for us all.Finally there’s the social life. After all that tiring exercise and brain-work, bell-ringing practice usually ends with a trip to the pub. In the eighteenth century, ringers did not even need to walk to the bar for a drink: each tower would have a “gotch”, a 16-quart pitcher of beer to sustain the ringers.Its revival might be just what’s needed to draw in new enthusiasts. We certainly need something to help ensure that such a wondrous part of our national soundscape survives.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ronaldinho released spending five months detention forged passport","story":"Former Brazil football star Ronaldinho was released on Monday by a Paraguayan judge after spending five months in detention over a forged passport.Judge Gustavo Amarilla also released Ronaldinho\u0027s brother Roberto de Assis Moreira, who likewise had been held for a month in jail and another four months under house arrest in a hotel in Paraguay\u0027s capital, Asuncion, for the same charge.The 40-year-old former World Cup winner is free to travel to whatever country in the world he wants but he must inform us if he changes his permanent residence for a period of one year, the judge said.He has no restrictions except for the fulfilment of reparations for damage to society.Dressed in jeans, a black beret and black shirt, Ronaldinho accepted the terms of his release, which include payment of $90,000 in damages. His brother, who is also Ronaldinho\u0027s business manager, must pay $110,000.The judge stressed that he was not issuing a definitive dismissal of the case but rather that Ronaldinho was benefitting from a conditional suspension of the procedure.His brother, on the other hand, was given a two-year suspended sentence.Prosecutors said they did not believe Ronaldinho took part in the plan to manufacture the fake Paraguayan passports but believed de Assis Moreira was aware that the passports were false.They flagrantly used a public document containing false content, said Marcelo Pecci, one of the public prosecutors, who said it was a very serious offense.De Assis Moreira must appear before a judge in Brazil every four months for two years and will have a criminal record.Ronaldinho\u0027s situation is not the same as Roberto\u0027s. He has no obligation to appear before any Brazilian judicial authority. He must only report a change of address, said Amarilla, who accepted a recommendation by four prosecutors to avoid the need for an oral trial.Before Monday\u0027s trial the public prosecutor said that Ronaldinho displayed no personal characteristics or criminal behavior that ... would put society at risk.The brothers arrived in Paraguay on March 4 with Ronaldinho, the 2005 Ballon d\u0027Or winner, due to take part in an event in support of disadvantaged children.However, two days later, the pair were taken into police custody when investigators raided their hotel following the discovery they had fake documents.Before the judge announced his decision, the defense issued a statement insisting on the innocence of both brothers.They presented Paraguayan documents to migration authorities believing they were authentic, said the statement. The people they trusted deceived them vilely.After being held in a police station in Asuncion, where Ronaldinho celebrated his 40th birthday on March 21, the two men had been under house arrest for more than four months in a luxury hotel in the capital, on bail of $1.6 million.The investigation has since expanded into a case of possible money laundering and criminal association.Some 18 people have already been arrested in connection with the case, most of them immigration officials or police officers.The investigation found no indication that either participated in money laundering or criminal association, said the defense statement.Ronaldinho, considered one of the greatest footballers of all time, was crucial in Brazil\u0027s 2002 World Cup win.He played for European giants such as Barcelona, AC Milan and Paris Saint-Germain during a hugely successful 10-year stint in Europe.He won the Champions League and two La Liga titles with Barcelona and Serie A with Milan.After returning home to Brazil he won the Copa Libertadores - South America\u0027s equivalent of the Champions League - with Atletico Mineiro.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"would betrayal let fishing industry slip net","story":"It was a symbolic moment during the 2016 EU referendum campaign. The flotilla of fishing boats steaming past the Palace of Westminster represented an industry left behind by successive administrations. Yet it was met with obscene gestures and derisory scoffing by the multimillionaire musician Bob Geldof.For many, the image provided a moment of joyful farce in an otherwise embittered campaign. For others, whose livelihoods and lives have been systematically destroyed by the European Bloc’s stranglehold over what was once one of Britain’s most vibrant industries, was rubbing salt into the wounds of a chronically neglected sector.The West\u0027s turn towards Epicureanism in recent decades has brought with it a vogue for locally-sourced, sustainable produce. The sleepy fishing village of Padstow in Cornwall has become a trendy destination for metropolitan foodies embracing the romance of a fresh catch served in front of a vista of gently bobbing boats in picturesque marinas. Where once our mainstay was cod and chips, healthy living, exoticised palates and the Sushi phenomenon should surely see those employed in coastal industries struggling to meet demand.Yet the real story is one of poverty, desperation and betrayal. Those who wolf down imported Mahi-Mahi and dismiss our attachment to fishing - an industry long gone and only capable of generating 0.5 per cent of the country’s GDP - have clearly never travelled to decimated coastal communities, no doubt happier to brag of oversized barracuda held aloft from billionaire boats in the Bahamas.Industry experts believe rejuvenating the sector would lead to growth of between 0.5 to 3.5 per cent of UK GDP with five jobs created on land for every job created at sea. Yet in some harbours, not a single UK-registered vessel remains. The sector currently employs around 12,000 people in fishing and 20,000 in processing, with overall profits from our fleet generating around £1billion per annum.Compared with our continental neighbours, this is just shy of the French catch, yet dwarfed by the perennially piscary Spanish. In fact three quarters of what Brits consume is imported, while the vast majority of our own catch, particularly crab, pouting, octopus, squid, sardines, mackerel, turbot, brill and sole, ends up in foreign food markets. A great deal of this is ostensibly down to supermarket stocks and culinary trends as it is the industry itself, yet for the nation of fish and chips, it should alarm us all that 92 per cent of our cod quota does not go to British fishermen. It was during wartime Britain that our heritage as a seafaring nation saw a dramatic shift. Fishermen were drafted into the Navy with their vessels requisitioned to join the defensive fleet. The powerful images of a formation of humble fishing boats skirring valiantly onto the bomb-stricken beaches of Normandy serve as poignant reminders of the mettle of our maritime men and women.Post war Britain was catapulted into rationing, followed by a relative boom in fishing in the 60s. Yet this was to be short lived as the Cod Wars of the 1970s got underway. Symbolically, in land-locked Luxembourg, dominion over our waters and the myriad aquatic species that make our coastline so ecologically rich was handed to the European Union to be redistributed for political leverage. There was little will in Britain at the time to fight for fishing, considered less than diplomatically expedient.The same trade-offs are again present today. Recent rumours that Michel Barnier would barter EU oversight of level playing-field rules against access to UK waters should remind us just how critical fishing is in ongoing negotiations. With half the English quota now owned by Dutch, Icelandic or Spanish companies, the geographical fact of the sovereign United Kingdom being surrounded by some of Europe’s most fruitful waters should put fishing front and centre. Brexiteers should be concerned that for many UK mandarins, this ravaged sector may be happily exchanged for freedom from regulations that could adversely affect mega-industries such as finance.Yet to consider fishing through this prism misses the point. The symbolism of an island nation defending its territorial integrity is crucial to the ideal of sovereignty underpinning Brexit. The sheer lack of ambition and imagination our politicians have shown risks binding Britain to an unhelpful status quo, just as our waters were mortgaged off to Europe half a century ago.Then there is the human side of the story. The under-reported real-life toll of an industry where chafed hands and broken nets are minor grumbles compared to unpaid mortgages and destitution, as once-thriving coastal communities have become dilapidated shells. For those who tune into the Radio 4 shipping forecast in the wee small hours, the idea of losing the romantic litany of names and indecipherable denominators feels like a tragic loss to our heritage. We are sleep-walking into underselling our nation’s potential on an alarming scale. We cannot let our fishing industry slip through the net. To do so would miss the entire point of becoming a proud, self-determining nation once again.Alexandra Phillips is a political consultant and commentatorMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ammonite movie trailer kate winslet saoirse ronan watch release date","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Movie was directed by ‘God’s Own Country’ filmmaker Francis Lee\u0026nbspThe Independent employs reporters around the world to bring you truly independent journalism.

The report warned that “Starlink alone may roughly double the number of space-based moving objects detectable by the unaided eye around twilight.”Options to reduce the impact include “darken them”, “keep them low”, “orient them to reflect less sunlight”, but number one on the list was “don’t launch them”.SpaceX has been frequently blamed for disrupting views of the night’s sky with its growing network of Starlink satellites, which currently number around 500. Early launches in 2019 triggered hundreds of UFO reports due to their unusual formation, with some astronomers comparing them to a “string of bright pearls”.The private space firm was criticised last month for blocking the view of the Comet Neowise as it made its once-every-6800-year journey past Earth.SpaceX launches and lands Mars-bound Starship craftSome timelapse images of the comet and other celestial objects appeared with long streaks caused by the low-orbit strings of Starlink satellites.The Starlink project aims to provide high-speed internet to under-served parts of the world, starting with remote areas of Canada before spreading coverage down to the equator as more satellites launch.SpaceX has deployed a variety of tactics to reduce the visibility of its satellite network, including painting them black and twisting the position of their solar panels to make them less reflective.The American Astronomical Society (AAS), which hosted Tuesday’s Satcon 1 event, worked with SpaceX to test and develop different methods to address the issue. SpaceX told The Independent that it also worked with the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NROA) and the Green Bank Observatory (GBO) to minimise the impact of its satellites.Professor Tony Tyson from the University of California, Davis, said that one mitigation strategy discussed with SpaceX was making Starlink satellites 10-times darker to remove satellite trails.“However, even if that works, the satellite trails themselves will clearly be in the data – complicating data analysis and limiting discoveries,” he said.“With tens of thousands of low-Earth orbit satellites, we find that generally no combination of mitigations can completely avoid the impacts of satellite trails on the science programs of the coming generation of optical astronomy facilities.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.

This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them. Aren’t they beautiful?Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Liberal Democrat education spokesperson, Layla Moran, said Mr Williamson “is simply not the person to deliver a safe return to schools and must resign”.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSchool leaders’ union ASCL wrote to the education secretary calling on him to commission an immediate independent inquiry into what went wrong.The Ofqual chief regulator had been due to face a grilling from MPs on the House of Commons Education Committee next Wednesday over the chaos surrounding exam results, which initially saw an algorithm downgrade nearly 40 per cent of A-level pupils’ predicted grades. Amid fury among parents and pupils, Mr Williamson was forced into a U-turn which resulted in a massive increase in passes and inflated results compared to previous years.In a statement, Ofqual said that Ms Collier had decided that “the next stage of the awarding process would be better overseen by new leadership” and was stepping down after four years in post.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An assistant at the Wallace Monument cleans the case which houses the William Wallace sword in the Hall of Arms room at the monument near Stirling as they prepare to re-openRestored World War Two landing craft LCT 7074 is transported from from the Naval Base in Portsmouth to its final resting place at the D-Day Story at SouthseaJenny Nguyen and Tony Cao, from Vietnam, pose for wedding photos on Tower Bridge in London, as it remains closed to vehicles after it was stuck open on Saturday due to a mechanical fault.

The association handed a petition to Downing Street to ask Prime Minister Boris Johnson to allow circuses to reopenShe is replaced on a temporary acting basis by her predecessor Dame Glenys Stacey until the appointment of a permanent chief regulator in December. Dame Glenys will be supported by a new committee of the Ofqual board, chaired by Ofsted chief executive Amanda Spielman.A Downing Street spokesperson yesterday said that Mr Johnson was “sorry” for the distress felt by students who were initially given grades below the requirements for their chosen university courses, in many cases because Ofqual’s computers adjusted results in line with their schools’ performance in previous years in a way which favoured private schools.PM ‘sorry for distress’ caused by exam result fiascoOfqual threatened with legal action over exams contract I resigned as education secretary over marking it’s about credibilitySpeaking during a visit to Devon on Tuesday, the prime minister said: “I mean you think about the people that have done their A-levels, their GCSEs this year, they’ve been in many ways a remarkable generation.“They’ve had to stay at home, which has been difficult, it has posed risks, as I say, to their health, to their mental health, they’ve done a fantastic job, they’ve protected the NHS, they’ve helped to save lives, to get us through this pandemic and I’m just pleased that they now do have results that they can work with.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mr Williamson will also be held to account for his part in the affair when he gives evidence to the committee on 16 September.The education secretary was facing growing calls to step down. He has so far dodged questions over whether he offered Mr Johnson his resignation.Ms Moran said: “It is incredibly disappointing that Gavin Williamson has refused to take responsibility for the combination of initial school return failure and the more recent exam fiasco and has instead allowed to let someone else take the blame.“He has lost the trust of students, parents and teachers who he failed to consult, leaving universities and colleges in chaos.“Meanwhile the prime minister is still yet to apologise for the stress and harm his government caused to students, parents and teachers.“Gavin Williamson is simply not the person the deliver a safe return to schools and must resign.”Labour MP, Bill Esterson, said: “Sally Collier, head of Ofqual, has done the decent thing, accepted responsibility for the exam fiasco and resigned. How can it be right that Collier has resigned but education secretary, Gavin Williamson hasn’t?”Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “This move follows the failure of the statistical model that led to this year’s grading fiasco, but the fault is not hers alone.“Ministers have questions to answer over the extent to which they scrutinised and challenged the methodology and reliability of the statistical model, particularly given the enormity of the task and the importance of getting it right.“Schools and colleges put their trust in the government over this matter, dutifully followed the processes advised by Ofqual, and now feel badly let down by the ensuing debacle. They deserve some answers and so do their students.”Bill Watkin, the chief executive of the Sixth Form Colleges Association, said it was “not altogether surprising that Ms Collier had quit”, but said responsibility was shared with government.He told the BBC: “This was all about protecting the system against grade inflation – too many high grades, which would seem to devalue the achievements of young people. But I have to say young people have had such a hard time of it in the last few months, I don’t think grade inflation was something that we needed to worry about quite as much as we did.”Education committee chair, Robert Halfon, said he was surprised Ms Collier had quit just days after agreeing to appear before his cross-party inquiry, and said he hoped she would still attend to answer questions.“I’ve tried to stay away from finger-wagging, because my policy is to find out what’s gone wrong and who was responsible for it, and why this sort of mega-mess was allowed to happen in the first place,” Mr Halfon told Times Radio. ”I’m not going to comment on iniduals, but clearly she felt Ofqual had failed the parents, pupils and schools, and that’s why she went.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Labour is calling on the government to urgently scrap its cap on benefits in order to avoid a wave of evictions for rent arrears.In a letter to employment minister Mims Davies, Labour frontbencher Seema Malhotra warned that the month-long extension of the moratorium on evictions announced on Friday would only delay the inevitable for thousands of families unless the cap was also lifted.Official figures released earlier this month showed a “shocking” 93 per cent rise in the number of families hit by the cap during the coronavirus pandemic, with households losing an average £248 a month, she said.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe cap – which limits a household’s total annual benefits to £20,000 a year or £23,000 in London – meant that many of these families were missing out on the temporary uplift of universal credit and local housing allowance introduced by ministers to help disadvantaged households cope with the impact of Covid-19, said the shadow employment minister.Unless it is scrapped, she warned that tenants will receive only brief and temporary relief from last week’s announcement of an extension to 20 September of the ban on evictions and a new requirement for landlords to give tenants six months’ notice.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An assistant at the Wallace Monument cleans the case which houses the William Wallace sword in the Hall of Arms room at the monument near Stirling as they prepare to re-openRestored World War Two landing craft LCT 7074 is transported from from the Naval Base in Portsmouth to its final resting place at the D-Day Story at SouthseaJenny Nguyen and Tony Cao, from Vietnam, pose for wedding photos on Tower Bridge in London, as it remains closed to vehicles after it was stuck open on Saturday due to a mechanical fault.

Rent arrears will grow further unless the extension is used effectively to scrap the benefit cap.”Johnson needs to find a long-term solution to the evictions issueStarmer accuses PM of ignoring ‘looming crisis’ for rentersThe renters facing homelessness within days as evictions set to resumeShe cited a report last year by the cross-party House of Commons Work and Pensions Committee, which found that many of those affected by the cap faced an “intolerable” financial position, with evidence from one housing association that 55 per cent of those affected fell into rent arrears.And she said that the overwhelming majority – 86 per cent – of households subject to the cap include children, with two-thirds of them being single parent families. The shadow employment minister asked Ms Davies to provide an assessment of the numbers of households at risk of eviction and details of steps being taken by the Department for Work and Pensions to allow them to stay in their homes.“Labour has repeatedly called on the government to scrap the benefit cap and extend the ban on evictions to avoid a wave of homelessness,” said Ms Malhotra. “This policy pushes families and children into poverty.

Ever see 6 water spouts at once?” Mr Leday wrote on Facebook. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWater sprouts are tornadoes that form over water, or move from land to water,  according to the National Ocean Service.The watery vortexes have the same characteristics as a regular tornado, usually occur during storms and can be just as dangerous as regular tornadoes. Double hurricane threat as two tropical storms advance towards USMr Leday caught sight of the phenomenon as two tropical storms brewed off the coast of the US and hailstones in Louisiana.After a day as a hurricane, Storm Marco brought a surge of high water to the Louisiana coast on Monday, setting the stage for Tropical Storm Laura to enter the Gulf of Mexico and move towards the same stretch of US coast later in the week, most likely as a hurricane.People along the Gulf Coast braced for an onslaught from the twin storms, with many evacuees recalling the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when catastrophic flooding breached the levees in New Orleans and as many as 1,800 people died.“What we know is there’s going to be storm surge from Marco, we know that that water is not going to recede hardly at all before Laura hits, and so we’ve not seen this before and that’s why people need to be paying particular attention,” Governor John Bel Edwards warned at a Sunday briefing.Marco had grown into a hurricane early Sunday, and while its top winds dropped to 50 mph on Monday morning, the National Hurricane Center cautioned that Marco could still cause life-threatening storm surges and dangerous winds along the Gulf Coast. Marco was centred about 85 miles (135 kilometres) south-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River Monday morning, moving northwest at 10 mph (17 kph).

Haiti’s prime minister said at least eight other people died and two were missing. In the Dominican Republic, relatives told reporters a collapsed wall killed a mother and her young son.Hundreds of thousands were without power in the Dominican Republic amid heavy flooding in both countries.Despite Marco’s weakening, a storm surge warning remained in place from Morgan City, Louisiana, to Ocean Springs, Mississippi. A tropical storm warning included Lake Pontchartrain in Louisiana and metropolitan New Orleans.A storm surge of up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) was forecast for parts of coastal Louisiana and Mississippi.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

And lots of parents have been alarmed to see their children stuck at home, in-active and putting on weight.Mr Fry says: “Schools have to do something about this. We will have to measure pupils next month and again in spring to seewhat has been creeping up during this enforced period of inactivity has been countered by being back at school.”I could not agree more that schools need to do something about this issue. But bringing back weighing kids in schools is problematic.Plenty of people have spoken up about how traumatic they found it being weighed at school, and the humiliation of being told they were overweight.But much worse is how many people have said that was the trigger for a letime of disordered eating.Jameela Jamil, the star of Netflix sitcom The Good Place, says: “Being weighed at school was truly the minute my eating disorder started at . I can trace it back to that exact day.”Cycling champ Elinor Barker, who won gold at the  Rio Olympics, reckons her own experience as an elite athlete shows “lighter is not always better”.She says: “I was the heaviest I’ve ever been when I won the Olympics. At my lightest I could barely get through a training week.”I have not heard anyone credit school weigh-ins with keeping them fit and healthy, with a balanced and positive relationship to food.Weighing children is problematic for so many reasons. It sends the message that they alone are responsible for their weight, when in fact taking care of their bodies with the right food and exercise is as much down to their parents, their school and the adults around them.But also, it becomes a form of body-shaming, and encourages children to focus only on the digits on the scales rather than the much bigger picture.It can plant the seeds of a letime of dficulty around food and is very often counterproductive.There are so many other ways to help children take responsibility for their own health.Schools need to make sports fun, ied and accessible to all children.In particular, they need to find ways to encourage teenage girls to participate, as this is the age when they often drop out of sports.School meals need to be healthy and delicious.And schools need to take meal times seriously and encourage children to do the same.We also need to inspire children to want to be healthy and fit. What about more talks in schools from sportsmen and women on how to exercise and what to eat  They are such good role models.Parents also have a massive role. We lead by example andwe have an unhealthy relationship with food, it’s likely our children will too.If we teach children about what their body needs to work properly, and how to cook tasty, nutritious meals which deliver that, they will be engaged in a positive way that has nothing to do with shame or guilt.HAPPY nd birthday, Madonna.She and toyboy Ahlamalik Williams, celebrated with an extravagant bash at Jamaica’s GoldenEye resort.And anyone who saw photos and videos of her shenanigans could be forgiven for thinking she is half her age.As she left the island, she posted on Instagram: “Thank you Jamaica. We have picked your flowers, eaten your fruit, danced to your music, enjoyed every sunset.”Whatever you think of her, there is something enviable about her ability to make the most of le.I hope I look as good as she does at her age but, more importantly, I hope I am still having as much fun.Some say: “Grow old gracefully.”She proves it is much more fun to grow old disgracefully.Celebrities have the potential to really make an impact and change lives – but not all of them do.So I love the story this week that Taylor Swt has donated more than £, to Vitoria Mario, a Tottenham teenager who started a GoFundMe appeal to become a mathematician, describing herself as a “black -year-old with a dream”.Vitoria, had been offered a place at Warwick University to study maths but could not afford to take it because she did not qualy for a student loan.When Taylor saw Vitoria’s GoFundMe appeal, she gave her the entire amount she had left to raise, along with a message saying: “I am so inspired by your drive and dedication to turning your dreams into reality . . . Good luck with everything you do! Love, Taylor.”Imagine waking up to that message .Cynics might suggest that Taylor does things like this for the publicity.But eventhat is true, who cares Vitoria will never forget this and it will likely change her le for ever.Also, how impressive that she found a way to follow her dreams and get the money she needs to go to university.We could all take a leaf out of the book of Britain’s oldest coronavirus survivor.At the grand old age of , she has revealed her secrets to staying healthy are eating an orange a day and “counting your blessings”.Angela Hutor has lived through both World Wars, as well as the Spanish Flu pandemic of .She caught Covid- in April and was so close to death that her daughter was called to hospital to say her final goodbyes. But Angela bounced back.Her advice this week to family and friends is to keep calm and occupied.Angela, from North London, is adamant Britain “will get through this” – and given all that she has survived, she should know.So let’s all take that on board. This lady has a great attitude, something we should all adopt.Frankie Bridge is under fire for posting a photo of her children watching iPads at the dinner table – with some people up in arms about how unacceptable it is.But perhaps people in glass houses should not throw stones.By which I mean that anyone who has children and wants to have a nice time knows kids are not always great at sitting through long, fancy dinners out.Some people think going out to dinner is a treat and children should learn to behave properly.Butyou ask young kids to sit and wait for their food, they will get restless.And there is a definite argument that going out to dinner should be a treat for the adults too.If that means a bit of screen time for the kids while at the table, well, who am I to judge GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But this is in spit of the four nations chief medical officers - including Professor Chris Whitty - stressing that there is a very small risk to children in schools. Deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries said this morning the risk to childrens long term wellbeing is far greater than the risk of coronavirus.The PM has begged parents to save their kids le chances by sending them back to school.Online learning provider Oxford Home Schooling reported a massive  per cent rise in enrolments for  to  year olds and a  per cent increase in  to  year olds.London-based Minerva Tutors also said enquires in the last two months have rocketed by  per cent.Greg Smith, head of operations at Oxford Home Schooling, said: We have never had this many calls.What we are seeing is a rise in enquiries for GCSE courses and people will be applying in the next couple of weeks... We are anticipating a massive increase in applications.Mainly people are saying they dont want to send their children back to schools. Ive spoken to lot of parents who are shielding and they dont want to send their children back because it opens a whole set of risks.Many of the parents are living in multi-generational households and they are worried about the child bringing back the virus and potentially their grandparents contracting coronavirus.

She was crying.”There is no suggestion the Prince knew of Epstein’s demand or was involved in any non-consensual sex. And last night sources close to him branded the allegation “baseless”.Ex-pin up Lisa, who now runs an LA modelling firm, first met Epstein after a Caribbean photoshoot in . He invited her and another pal to his island, Little St James.She recalled: “I found Jeffrey very charming and he seemed really nice. I had mentioned I had lived in England and he said, ‘Oh, would you like to meet a prince ’.“This man walked up and I recognised him as Prince Andrew. He was very nice. It was very brief.”Lisa saw nothing untoward on the island and over the next few years met with Epstein at charity events, parties and Broadway shows.She added: “He always wanted to meet friends of mine. He loved young women but none of us suspected he liked underage girls.”Lisa said in  the friend confided about the alleged incident at Epstein’s New York townhouse.Lisa claimed: “She told me Jeffrey told her to go into a bedroom and have sex with Prince Andrew. She said Andrew had sex with her, and left the room. I think she was confused by Jeffrey — manipulated by him. She felt like she had to do it.“That’s why she was so angry, so upset. She thought they had a dferent relationship.”Lisa went on: “I had one last conversation with Jeffrey. I said, ‘My friend told me about you instructing her to have sex with Prince Andrew’.

Usually there is at least a soloist,not a full choir leading the audience, but of course this year the public seats in the hall will be empty because of the virus, and the voices on stage silenced.Now, the lyrics of both songs are pro-colonial. If you ban them from the Last Night of the Proms, ending a tradition going back decades, what consequences will that have Certainly, someone  years from now will say we shouldn’t have done that.It is the same argument for not taking down statues. If you remove statues because that person stands for something evil in their past, you are removing the deed too.Manipulating history only adds to mistrust among the black community.I would like to see the survey that says the public want these two songs taken out of the Proms programme, because it appears to me that the public hasn’t been consulted.Rule, Britannia! was written by Scottish poet James Thomson and he features on the famous Scott Monument in Edinburgh, near where I live.He is also commemorated in Westminster Abbey’s Poets’ Corner, next to William Shakespeare.If we say we must remove his words from the Proms, do we then remove the memorials too Rule, Britannia!, written and set to music in , was mentioned in James Joyce’s novel, Ulysses. It is part of my history and my culture. If we take it away, we take away part of my culture.It’s a song about the power structure at the time, and the arrogance and hypocrisy of Britain vowing to “never be slaves” while at the same time owning and benefiting from about , black chattel slaves in the West Indies who were called ‘property’.Of course, people are sensitive to its meaning, as well as Land Of Hope And Glory, the music of which was written by Edward Elgar.It doesn’t mean we should hide it.I personally don’t find the lyrics offensive because they are a true representation of the terrible truth at the time.If you take that away, then you are replacing history with a fairy story.There is also the possibility that it was written to show the evil of the time, rather than glorying it.The objection is that Rule, Britannia! is used by flag-waving “prommers” as a jubilant finale at the Proms.It is used in the wrong context, and that is part of the ignorance of our society of our history.It’s the same with Amazing Grace, which was written by a slaver of black people and is sung as a religious anthem.Recently, it was proposed that we should ban Swing Low, Sweet Chariot at rugby matches due to its link to slavery. That came to nothing.Instead of banning such songs or stripping away their lyrics, we need to educate people on the history of slavery, starting with putting it on the history curriculum.From speaking to people about slavery, the one constant reaction is always: “Why didn’t anyone tell us this before ”At the Proms, instead of taking the words away, we should put an explanation in the programme. We should tell people it’s about enslaving black people, making money from them, giving them a short le span and then compensating the slave owners when it was abolished because slaves were regarded as ‘property’.If they want to sing it after reading that, then fine, go ahead and sing it. But I bet they won’t sing it as joyfully as they might have done before.When I worked in research, I once had a lovely technician who worked for me. She looked after me so well, and she went to the Proms.If she knew the history of those two songs, being my friend, I doubt she would have sung along.It wasn’t her fault that she didn’t know the history.Those songs didn’t have a place in the Proms in the first place, they are there because of people’s ignorance. I would challenge anyone to know their meanings and still sing them in a frivolous capacity.But we shouldn’t be bothering ourselves about whether those songs should now be removed.What we should be bothering ourselves about is increasing the representation of black people who are the descendants of slaves. We should be concerning ourselves about making sure black people from the Windrush generation get compensation. And we should also be ensuring ourselves that every child is taught the history of slavery so that they can make their own minds up about whether to sing songs like these.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Is there no end to their wokeness  How about the enjoyment of the millions of Brits who pay the licence fee  You can’t choose history on your terms. It doesn’t belong to you.It came as a BBC source described the handling of the Proms line-up as “white guys in a panic,” trying to appease the Black Lives Matter movement.Meanwhile Boris Johnson slammed the “woke” plans to axe the patriotic sing-along climax from next month’s bash.Debating the issue on Good Morning Britain, freedom of speech campaigner Inaya Folarin Iman said criticism of the two songs was absurd, adding that they bring a lot of people joy and happiness.But Kehinde Andrews, a black studies professor at Birmingham City University, said the line Britons never, never, never shall be slaves from Rule Britannia is racist propaganda dating back to the British Empire.Organisers said they were concerned about the lyrics along with their links.TV choirmaster Gareth Malone, told The Times that he supported removing Rule Britannia lyrics in solidarity with black and Irish members of his choirs who had refused to sing it in previous years. He said: “If people want to sing about the subjugation and enslavement of other nations, I don’t think that should be given a  in .”His view was shared by Chi-Chi Nwanoku, founder of the Chineke! Foundation, which supports ethnic minority musicians. She told : “The lyrics are just so offensive.The annual Royal Albert Hall concert, beamed around the world, traditionally ends with the flag-waving anthems.At the weekend, it was reported that the conductor for this years Last Night, Dalia Stasevska of Finland, was keen to reduce the patriotic elements of the event.It led to a backlash yesterday, with the Prime Minister and Oliver Dowden, the Culture Secretary, getting involved.Mr Dowden told the BBC that “confident, forward-looking nations don’t erase their history”.And Boris Johnson said that while he understands the emotions involved, “we need to tackle the substance of problems, not the symbols”.Former Cabinet Minister Andrea Leadsom tweeted: “Seriously  Has the Beeb totally lost touch ”Tory MP David Morris said: “We cannot erase our history. We have got to be proud to be British. It does not matter what colour, creed or religion you are.”Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage told The Sun: “The BBC should stop apologising for our history and our heritage. People will be disgusted by this level of political correctness. The only thing that needs cancelling is the BBC itself.” And North West Durham MP Richard Holden wrote: “Another stupid move from the BBC. Just let the people sing! At every turn the BBC just dig the hole they’re in a bit deeper. They need to stop with this attempt to appease the woke morons.”In a bid to defuse the row, BBC bosses announced last night that the Last Night on September  would still feature familiar, patriotic elements.It said: With much reduced musical forces and no live audience, the Proms will curate a concert that includes familiar, patriotic elements such as Jerusalem and the National Anthem, and bring in new moments capturing the mood of this unique time [...].It added that the programme will include new orchestral versions of Pomp and Circumstance March No  Land of Hope and Gloryand Rule Britannia.There will be no audience at the Proms due to Covid restrictions. Mother of the FreeHow shall we extol theeWho are born of thee Wider still, and widerShall thy bounds be setGod, who made thee mightyMake thee mightier yet!Dear Land of Hope, thy hope is crownedGod make thee mightier yet!On Sovran brows, beloved, renownedOnce more thy crown is setThine equal laws, by Freedom gainedHave ruled thee well and longBy Freedom gained, by Truth maintainedThine Empire shall be strongThy fame is ancient as the daysAs Ocean large and wide: A pride that dares, and heeds not praiseA stern and silent prideNot that  joy that dreams contentWith what our sires have wonThe blood a hero sire hath spentStill nerves a hero sonBritons never, never, never shall be slaves.When Britain first, at heavens command,Arose from out the azure main,This was the charter of the land,AndAngels sang this strain:The nations not so blest as theeMust, in their turn, to tyrants fall,While thou shalt flourish great and free:The dread and envy of them all.Still more majestic shalt thou rise,More dreadful from each foreign stroke,As the loud blast that tears the skiesServes but to root thy native oak.Thee haughty tyrants neer shall tameAll their attempts to bend thee downWill but arouse thy generous flame,But work their woe and thy renown.To thee belongs the rural reignThy cities shall with commerce shineAll thine shall be the subject main,And every shore it circles, thine.The Muses, still with freedom found,Shall to thy happy coasts repair.Blest isle! with matchless beauty crowned,And manly hearts to guard the fair.Rule, Britannia!

But former Brexit Secretary David Davis has warned it is a critical endgame and the UK will soon have to be preparing for talks to collapse.He said Brussels will try to take things to the wire, adding: “The last three weeks will matter more than the first three years.” One Eurocrat admitted “outsiders don’t realise how pessimistic we’ve become” about getting a trade deal.The UK is holding firm on a refusal to accept EU red tape or cave in on fishing rights. Mr Barnier fears talks are headed for a bitter breakdown.He believes Downing Street is laying the ground for a vicious “blame game” over who is responsible for the stalemate.In a gloomy briefing to diplomats, the grumpy Frenchman claimed that last week’s tetchy round of talks have made things worse.The UK’s negotiator David Frost had put forward a draft text last week in the hope of speeding up the discussions. But Mr Barnier dismissed it as “unrealistic” and urged EU states to stay “cold blooded”.He insisted that the UK’s “clear strategy” will be to “trade off” fishing access for freedom from EU rules at the last minute.An EU source said: “We expect the mood to switch rapidly to contingency planning in expectation the UK will throw itself into the blame game rather than the endgame.”A British official hit back, saying: “The UK has consistently pushed for detailed textual discussions on the core elements of a trade agreement.“If the EU continues to stall progress because of its unrealistic asks on fish and subsidies, we will quickly run out of time.”Well now Ive seen everything. The gullible British Remainer Press report breathlessly that Michel Barnier is telling usthat the Brexit negotiations are “running out of time.” This of course is the man who squandered a year on the minutiae of the Withdrawal Agreement whilst refusing to discuss the hugely important future trade arrangement, all the while claiming that we were “running out of time.” Rather shamefully the British government put up with this nonsense, which led in turn to my resignation – but that is a story for another day.Now Barnier is desperate to resolve his so-called redline issues before we get to the critical endgame.I have always said that the last three weeks will matter more than the first three years. But there will come a time very shortly when we will have to sht the thrust of our preparations towards No Deal.The reason for this is that the European Union always runs out the clock. When it is bullying some smaller state this works to its advantage. In the Brexit negotiation what will happen in the last few weeks is that the nation states of Europe will have to come to terms with the size of the risks that Barnier is taking.If we end up with a no deal scenario – and it is possible – the Europeans stand to lose a large and very profitable marketplace, namely the United Kingdom. They stand to lose access to the most efficient financial market in the world, the City, which provides brilliantly low cost and low risk finance to all of their industries. They think that is punishing us, but they will really punish themselveswe are smart about it. They stand to lose any access to British fisheries, rather than the sensible and civilised arrangements that would apply once they accept agreed British control of our waters.They stand to lose the funding that was agreed under the Withdrawal Agreement, which was agreed on the presumption that we would get a trade deal, a political promise that the EU is failing to keep.Without a reasonable trade deal there is nothing to stop the United Kingdom repudiating the whole agreement, and simply maintaining the parts that we as a civilised nation would of course apply – including for example the protection of the rights of European Citizens.But pay money  Why  Recognise European product classications in the UK, the so-called Geographical Indications, that protect inidual European products like ham,or cheese, orbeer or wine  Why should we not allow cheaper and better products from the rest of the world to use the names in our Supermarkets This would not be the best outcome, but we would manage perfectly well.If the EU put tarfs on our goods, we willthe favour, and make money on it. Our currency would no doubt adjust to keep us competitive.And without the limitations of EU law, we could support the industries that the EU is trying to punish.Which of course is one of the reasons that the EU is trying to tie our hands on state subsidies to industry. Britain has always been much less likely to use these than European nations, but the Europeans know that they are a potential defensive weaponthey try to punish our industries.David Frost, our Brexit negotiator, is doing a good job. He has been clear on our “red lines”. Unlike the EU “red lines”, these are not just ideas made up by the Government, they are the direct outcome of the referendum. As such they represent the peoples decision, and are not subject to concession.We are not going to allow Brussels to decide our laws – which is what Barnier means by a level playing field. So it is time that the Europeans woke up to the realities.It is clear that there are only two options now for leaving at the end of the transition period, a no deal exit or a zero-tarf deal. All sensible business owners will be preparing for both. Deferral and delay is the only thing that affects certainty and the delay on March th last year was the only time when the economy was rattled – businesses will be ready for Brexit come what may when the transition period finishes at the end of the year.Certainty is what both business and the country as a whole require, not just to get Brexit done but also to help ensure that the economy bounces back from the negative economic effects of the lockdown.We already know that there has been no “Great British Exodus” nor immediate recession despite what certain pundits and commentators predicted.As long as we leave on time and do not drag this out any further, there is no reason why this should change. Indeed,we deliver the certainty of the end of the transition period, there is every reason that business and the economy will bounce back.It is incredible after all this time to see Brussels still bent on ensuring that Britain somehow loses out, so fixated are they on deterring others from ­abandoning their club.They are still making patently unreasonable power grabs even their europhile fans struggle to defend. They still want newly-independent Britain to surrender full control of our fishing waters. To agree economic restrictions to prevent us undercutting them and keep us under their thumb.They simply must change the recordthey’re genuinely worried about the potential hardship of us trading on WTO terms — and them copping the blame.

At last, after an unprecedented lockdown of six months, all schools are due to re-open, representing a giant leap back towards normality. But the damage caused by the Coronavirus disruption has been severe.Many parents have been prevented from ing to work. Young people’s education has been badly undermined, especially because the quality of online learning has been so uneven. One study found that a fth of pupils had less than an hour’s instruction a day. Moreover, social activities and friendships – which are a vital part of growing up – have been heavily restricted.The exam chaos over the last fortnight was a fitting symbol of the vacuum created by the absence of proper schooling. No advanced society canwhen a vital sector like education is temporarily paralysed. That is why it is so important that the Government succeeds in its goal of seeing a fullto the classroom. As Boris Johnson put it at the weekend, “it is vital for pupils’ education. It is vital for their welfare. It’s vital for their physical and, indeed, mental well-being.”Given the Government’s mixed record on its management of the Covid crisis, this will be a big test. From the inadequate supply of protective gear to the botched imposition of quarantine rules, Ministers have got it badly wrong at times. They cannot afford another fiasco next week.But to do that, they will have to curtail the influence of militant teaching unions, which thrive in a climate of scare-mongering and grievance. Full of negativity, these hardened left-wing operators turn every pebble of dficulty into a giant boulder of obstruction. They are the abominable no men and women, the ultimate “can’t do” brigade.To overcome the unions’ capacity for trouble-making, reassurances about safety will be absolutely crucial. Most teachers are keen to go back to work, but they want to know schools will not be dangerous environments. That is why the recent upbeat advice from medical experts has been so welcome. It is clear from the Covid experience around the world that not only are children less likely to transmit the disease than any other group, but also that schools are safer than most other workplaces. Yesterday, the Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jenny Harries pointed out that a child is more likely to be involved in a traffic accident or die from flu than to be harmed by Coronavirus.That message was also spelt out by her boss Chris Whitty, who said on Sunday that the damage to health caused by a continued schools lockdown is potentially greater than the impact of Covid. “The balance of risk is very strongly in favour of children going to school,” he declared, adding the chances of catching the disease “are incredibly small.” In fact, there is now hard evidence to prove this. Although the vast majority of schools were closed since March, over one million pupils – such as the children of essential workers – went back to the classroom in June. Yet a comprehensive study by Public Health England showed that in the subsequent weeks until the end of term, just  children and  staff tested positive for Covid- – and nearly all these infections occurred outside the school. There were hardly any cases of children passing on the disease to each other, or to their teachers. Other research from around the world has come to the same conclusion.But none of this seems to matter to the teaching unions, eager to exploit anxiety in pursuit of their anti-Tory agenda. These are the organisations which for decades have blocked every major reform of the education system and have defended every outdated working practice. With depressing inevitability, they have continually put their own narrow interests before the wider needs of pupils. They want the respect due to trained professionals but they frequently display the rebellious spirit of the permanent agitators. “Strike action is a very powerful tool,” said Amanda Martin, the President of the ,-strong National Education Unionin an interview with the Communist Morning Star newspaper in , adding, “I’ve run demos and rallies and worked with trade councils to bring everyone out and that’s brilliant.”Led by the NEU, the unions have brought the same attitude to the Coronavirus crisis. Instead of looking for solutions, they have endlessly exaggerated problems. One Whitehall insider says of Dr Mary Bousted, the £,-a-year joint general secretary of the NEU, “it’s all about the union, to hell with the teachers who want to get back into the classroom – let alone the children.” A left-wing radical, Bousted jokes that the word “strike” was one of the first she learnt as a child. Hers is not the voice of co-operation and enterprise, so it is hardly surprising that the Government has struggled to get schools reopened.In June, a planned majorwas thwarted by the unions, dealing a severe blow to Gavin Williamson’s credibility. One left-wing website gushed that the continued shutdown was due “to the hard work of NEU branch secretaries and rank and file militants galvanising the members.” In the months since, an alliance of unions – including Bousted’s NEU and Unite led by the notorious Merseyside militant Len McCluskey – have fought a y battle against a swt re-opening. Central to this effort at sabotage was a vast -point checklist of detailed questions which the Department for Education was told it had to answer. Dubbed by critics “a wreckers’ charter”, the list included queries such as “will lidded bins with double bagging be available in every classroom”, “will dedicated space be available for any breastfeeding women to express milk” and “has behaviour policy been reviewed to acknowledge the increased level of trauma and anxiety experienced by pupils ” Some Tories complained that the union was playing politics. Robert Halfon, the chairman of the Education Select Committee was amazed at the warped priorities: “It is incredible that not one of these nit-picking questions asks the most important thing of all – what’s best for the kids ”Even as September approaches, the whining and resistance has not ceased. “The unions need to stand firm and protect their members,” argues socialist teacher Martin Powell-Davies. In the latest ruse, the public sector outfit UNISON not only wants its members to wear masks in the classroom – something for which there is no scientic evidence of any need – but also to have extra funding for deep cleaning. “Schools need more money to pay for specially trained cleaners, rather than relying on other staff who are busy enough already,” says Jon Richards, UNISON’s head of education. The moan about over-stretched budgets is a favourite of the union movement but it is an empty accusation. The Government is pouring an extra £. billion into education, while this summer it was announced that teachers’ pay is to go up by an average of . per cent, a bigger increase than any other public sector workers received.But that did nothing to stop the combination of whingeing and shroud-waving. The mentality of the hardliners was embodied in a recent statement from the NEU’s far left “Education Solidarity Network” which set out a series of demands to “make sure safety comes first.” Among them were: “smaller class sizes to allow adequate physical distancing” arrangements “for rotas and home learning to be produced in consultation with parents” “local risk assessments to include staggered outdoor breaks, sanitising, provision of transparent coverings to enable access to lip reading and facial expression” and “weekly onsite testing of staff”. Above all, the Network called for extra funding “to implement these measures.” If there were any question of a risk to safety, the union should “prepare for a national strike ballot.”That was so typical. This lot seem to feel more comfortable on the picket line than in the classroom. The Solidary Network might be seen as extreme, but its carping outlook runs right through the unionYesterday, the NEU’s joint general secretary was bleating on the airwaves about the risks of new Covid spikes: “Staff, parents and pupils are being sorely let down by the government because of a lack of a Plan B and of ensuring robust track and trace is in place throughout the country. We believe the Government is negligent in the extreme.” The charge of negligence might be applied with more force to the NEU, whose hostile stance has made thesuch an exhausting obstacle course.

Organisers of the BBC Proms said the songs would be featured as orchestral versions instead, due to offensive lyrical connotations about the British Empire.The decision sparked backlash online, with Laurence Fox leading calls to defund the BBC as a result.Over , others signed a Change.org petition entitled Save Rule Britannia and Land of Hope and Glory from Last Night of the Proms exclusion.The petition reads: If the BBC excludes these songs from The Last Night of the Proms, the lives of patriotic Britons of all colours and creeds will be diminished by this insensitive act of cancellation. We believe that patriotic songs matter and we call upon the Director General of the BBC and the head of BBC Music TV Commissioning not to betray our patriotic heritage.One person commented: These two songs are probably the highlight of the proms season. The Proms will not be the same without them.Their view was echoed by the Prime Minister, who said today: I think its time we stopped our cringing embarrassment about our history, about our traditions, and about our culture, and we stopped this general fight of self-recrimination and wetness, I wanted to get that off my chest.It came as a BBC source described the handling of the Proms line-up as “white guys in a panic,” trying to appease the Black Lives Matter movement.Piers Morgan called the decision absolutely pathetic, writing on Twitter: The BBC needs to grow a pair  stop grovelling to such insane ‘woke’ cancel culture nonsense that most Britons find utterly absurd.Alok Sharma, the Business Secretary said the Last Night of the Proms brings “a huge amount of pleasure to millions of people” and thatsinging is not possible, the BBC should put up subtitles.Debating the issue on Good Morning Britain, freedom of speech campaigner Inaya Folarin Iman said criticism of the two songs was absurd, adding that they bring a lot of people joy and happiness.But Kehinde Andrews, a black studies professor at Birmingham City University, said the line Britons never, never, never shall be slaves from Rule Britannia is racist propaganda dating back to the British Empire.Organisers said they were concerned about the lyrics along with their links.TV choirmaster Gareth Malone, told The Times that he supported removing Rule Britannialyrics in solidarity with black and Irish members of his choirs who had refused to sing it in previous years.He said: “If people want to sing about the subjugation and enslavement of other nations, I don’t think that should be given a  in .”His view was shared by Chi-Chi Nwanoku, founder of the Chineke!

No, they said, you have to buy the item, take it home to try it on, then bring it backit doesn’t fit. Needless to say, I ed home empty-handed.So,our High Street clothes shops are to survive the pandemic, two things need to happen.Unless classed as vulnerable, those of us who actually enjoy clothes ­shopping need to get back out there as soon as possible and actively support them. And the Government needs to relax its strict rules and let retailers and shoppers take inidual responsibility for what happens in store.If I have to wear a mask and gloves to try on a pair of jeans in a cubicle, then I’m happy to do so.

They have risen to this unprecedented challenge and put their lives on the line to keep our country going. Now we need them to help lead the recovery from this crisis as we build back better. NHS and social workers, bus drivers, posties, delivery drivers, shop workers, and so many others have made sure we have all been cared for, fed and connected during this pandemic. They are ideally suited to rebuilding our communities and our country. They are ideally suited to rebuilding our communities and our country in the months and years ahead. The last few months have proven beyond all doubt that it is the unsung, underpaid and undervalued workers who are the backbones of our communities – the people that our economy and our country cannotwithout. They know what their communities need and truly know what it means to be a ‘public servant’. We want to ensure that our key workers are at the heart of decision-making across the country, which is why we are encouraging and supporting those who want to get involved in politics and stand for election in the years ahead. Politics is not arcane parliamentary language of Statutory Instruments or Select Committees. Politics is about what is happening on your high street, in your town, at your workplace. Politics is about making sure your children’s school has got the resources it needs or fighting back against dodgy landlords ripping off tenants. Real people and real lives. It is clear for all to see that our political institutions do not reflect the communities that they serve. I am proud that before I became a Member of Parliament I worked in our social care sector, going from house to house in my community supporting those who needed help. But when MPs talk in the House of Commons about the crisis facing our social care sector, how many of them have worked on the frontline and have first-hand experience of it  During debates on the Budget or the economy how many MPs have fed their families on a minimum wage pay packet  Not many, and certainly not nearly enough. This needs to change, and I am determined that the Labour Party, working with our trade unions and colleagues in local government, will lead that change.  I am proud that the Parliamentary Labour Party is the most erse it has ever been and is more than half of Labour MPs are women for the first time in our history. But we all know there is a huge amount of work to do, at all levels of government. We need to do more to ensure that our political institutions and elected representatives are rooted in our communities and better represent and reflect our communities, in all of their ersity. As deputy leader and party chair I am leading initiatives to encourage and support more female, black, Asian and minority ethnic, disabled and LGBTQ+ members to put themselves forward to stand as candidates and run for office.

The Mirror can today reveal the cost to the public for the first time, after the Government quietly published contracts on Sunday. Newly published details also confirm the deal was put in place without other firms being allowed to bid for the work. This latest revelation takes the total value of contracts handed to Public First this year over £ million.Public First is a small lobbying and research firm run by James Frayne, a Brexit ally of Mr Cummings, and Rachel Wolf, who co-wrote the  Tory manesto.The publication of the new contract was revealed by Tussell, a database of public contracts and spend.

The scaffolding supervisor has terminal cancer after a potentially le-saving operation was cancelled because of Covid. Our hearts go out to Adrian and his family. What makes this all the more unbearable is it will not be an isolated case. Cancer Research fears a third of cancer patients have missed vital treatment because of the pandemic. The number of urgent cancer referrals by GPs in England fell by a half in May and there are more than two million people waiting for breast, bowel and cervical cancer screenings. We cannot allow the legacy of lockdown to be thousands of lives lost to other diseases. The same spirit of endeavour which saw the building of the Nightingale hospitals should now be applied to clearing this backlog and restoring all NHS services. Lives depend on it. Your turn Gav OFQUAL chief Sally Collier today put Gavin Williamson to shame by resigning over the exams fiasco. In a more honourable world it would be the Education Secretary who handed in his notice. Yet can again we are seeing civil servants being made scapegoats for failings by arrogant and incompetent Conservative ministers. Mr Williamson has been promoted way beyond his ability. Not only has he presided over the exam grading fiasco he has failed to set out a clear plan for schools to reopen. The confusion over whether pupils should wear face coverings has added to the chaos. At the same time figures show the gap between the richest and poorest pupils is rising. If Boris Johnson really cared about children’s schooling he would install a new Education Secretary capable of sorting out this mess. It’s Santatiser!

She told the Aldi Mumaposs Facebook page how she realised you can ask them to slow down, I do, she said. They don’t mind. And never had a rude checkout operator either. But not all the responses were positive, as people disputed whether it was a good thing to ask a checkout worker to slow their pace, the M.E.N reports.Andrew Martin wrote: If people actually did what they’re suppose to do and put their shopping directly in their trolley then packed on the shelf provided you wouldn’t have an issue. Allan Milnes wrote: You are not supposed to pack your shopping at the tills in Aldi. Stick it back in your trolley and pack it at the tables at your own pace. Itaposs not a new concept I remember doing this in the aposs. Ive never packed a bag at the till unless its a few items. So many people have said it already, but you shouldnapost be asking them to slow down - just put it back in the trolley basket and pack it at the shelves opposite. Aldi and Lidl are cheap for a reason -you donapost like it donapost shop there, wrote Eden Cady-Mckellar. Brenda Newall said: People should either pack it at the shelf after paying or do what I do sling it in the trolley and pack it at the car, thataposs the whole idea of aldi and lidl get through the checkout quicker I prefer it this way no dawdling about like other supermarkets. Aldi customers have said that keeping up with the lightning-fast supermarket checkout staff should be an aposOlympic sportapos.  Paying up a the end off your weekly shop becomes a personal challenge to try and bag the items as quickly as the cashier is scanning them. With a queue of keen spectators looking on, many shoppers crack under the pressure. Aldi customers have previously shared hilarious hacks to slow down the checkout staff, including one who advised scrunching up the packaging around the barcode so it wouldnapost scan first time. Others said they preferred to work in teams, with one slowly handing the items over one at a time at the till while the other packs. Not everyone was so outrage by the mumaposs Aldi tip. One said: I always ask the checkout workers at my local Aldi to slow down a bit, so I don’t get overwhelmed. They always say yes and it’s always very pleasant, never had a problem. But for others the sheer panic of racing to pack was all part of the Aldi experience. One argued: Keeping up with the ALDI checkout workers is a game for me. It should be an Olympic sport. A second added: Sometimes they go slow for me then other times it’s like a tornado and I can’t get the shopping fast enough into the trolley. When Aldi was asked why their cashiers scan items so quickly,were told staff members are encouraged to be as efficient as possible, which helps to keep the prices low. Bosses also claimed their checkouts are  per cent speedier than rivals - but said their checkout assistants were also trained to alter the rate they scan to match the pace of the shopper.

The proposal would free up millions of pounds to boost cyber warfare capability amid threats from Russia, China and Iran. One option being considered by the Ministry of Defence is to scrap plans to upgrade much of the fleet of Challenger  tanks and Warrior armoured fighting vehicles. A defence source told the Mirror “pressures on budgets across the department” led bosses to come up with the potential changes. The insider added: “But it would be a very big and bold decision, especially as the Warrior fighting vehicles have proved useful in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. No decision has been made as yet on the future of the Challenger and it is extremely unlikely it would be mothballed entirely. There is a chance some may be mothballed.” The MoD is under pressure to invest in cyber defence even though overall budgets are set to be slashed due to the economic downturn. Despite cuts, Britain is also committed to making a signicant contribution to NATO and helping defend Europe against the threat from Russia. The source added: “Having Challenger has been a huge plus in ensuring our partners know the UK is making a sizeable contribution to NATO.” The insider said the Army is “already very stretched”. If the Challenger tanks were mothballed they would be kept in storage and made available in an emergency.

Sharon Coupe, , from Edwinstowe near Sherwood Forest has always been house proud but felt like she stopped caring about her home after her diagnosis in May . The mother-of-two’s best friend was determined to help her with a DIY makeover and the two of them have spent lockdown making her home beautul again. Sharon, who has stage four bowel cancer and five tumours, said she believes there is no need to let things go just because of having cancer. She said: My house has always been beautul, but when I got diagnosed I just felt like I didn’t care what the house looked like anymore. If I was to die, nobody would say aposoh she had a lovely houseapos. But Cathie has dragged me out of my rut. We are now steadily going through the house and making it beautul again. In May , Sharon was rushed to Kings Mill Hospital in Nottinghamshire the same day as having her eyes tested after the optician saw something behind her eye that was illuminating. She was referred as an ‘urgent casualty’ before being told she would need to go to Hallamshire hospital in Sheffield. Two weeks later, the support worker was told she had a tumour behind her eye and needed to undergo a ciliary flap biopsy - she had the procedure on th August . One week later, doctors confirmed the cancerous tumour behind her right eye as secondary. Sharon, who is mother to Connor, , and Aaron, , then underwent a series of tests to find the primary cancer. Sharon said:I asked the doctors not to sugar coat anything for me. But my heart sank - I had silent tears rolling down my face and all I could think of was my boys Connor and Aaron. I bought them up alone as when Connor was five, his dad and I separated but I found out I was nine weeks pregnant with Aaron. My boys are my absolute rocks.  I provided a -hour urine sample, had numerous head, shoulder and full body scans before being sent to the Western Park hospital. I also had two liver biopsies and had to stay in hospital for five nights. The results delivered the devastating news that the primary cancer was in Sharon’s bowel - but it had also spread to her liver, lungs, right eye and bones - finding five tumours in total. She was told it is an extremely rare cancer which is inoperable and incurable but hopefully treatable. Her best friend Cathie and her mother were both by Sharon’s side as the results were given to her. Sharon added: Once the professor said the primary was in my lower bowel, I askedit could be removed but he said “that’s not all” as he explained the five tumours.  The professor said in his  years of experience - he had only seen three patients with this rare cancer - Sharon being his third. Sharon hasn’t been given a timeline but says she is now stage four. In July, she underwent an MRI scan and more PET scans. The last ones had shown treatment had been successful as  of the  tumours are stable. However the tumour behind her eye is not stable - and it has grown, with a cataract over it. She recently found out that the characteristics of the tumour had changed indicating it could have spread to her brain.  She said: As for the eye - I have now been told regardlessit’s gone into my brain I have to have the eye removed as the tumour is pushing on the retina. The cancer has also spread to my skull, collar bones, manubrium, my hips, my pelvis, my spine and three disks. The results of these new scans can show even more but we have to wait and see. The-mother-of-two felt like she stopped caring about her home after she was diagnosed - despite previously being described as ‘house proud’. But the best friends have now been completing a DIY home makeover. Sharon believes there is no need to let things go just because of cancer but said she has noticed DIY work taking a lot longer due to the fatigue that comes with the disease.  She said: There’s no need at all to let things go just because you have cancer… Yes it’s taking a lot longer to do as the fatigue that comes with this disease is something you cannot describe. But we are doing this and we are getting there! We are doing one room at a time but it takes a while as I do all the wallpaper, I am up and down the ladders, Cathie has been painting and I’ve glossed all the doors.Sharon experiences horrendous fatigue and extreme side effects from treatments including hot flushes, temperature, sweating, aching and headaches.She has also had pain in her hips and lower back throughout the DIY work.  Sharon has morphine inside her   and believes she wouldnapost be able to she didn’t have the constant pain relief. Sharon is on sandostatin LAR which is injected into her buttocks muscle every three weeks. She also has an injection in her stomach every eight weeks for her bone cancer but now suffers from extremely sensitive teeth. She added: I have Calci D mg a day, docusate and senna to help with the bowel, Creon  to help with my stomach and oxy norm every  hours for pain. I am on antidepressants too as the professor said as strong as I am and as much as I am smiling whenever they see me, he thinks this will take its toll.  He said it is a lot for any one person to put up with and I now have counselling too. However the pains and medication hasn’t stopped Sharon. The best friends have been working through the house transforming one room at a time. Sharon’s bedroom cost £ and is now complete with flamingo wallpaper and pink bedding and curtains. Her bedroom took three months to complete as Sharon struggled to do the wallpapering and go up and down ladders.  The friends then moved onto another bedroom which Sharon wanted to make grey, black and silver. This was done during lockdown and took five weeks. Sharon and Cathie worked on the bedroom with the help of her two sons and a family friend Les - the transformation cost £. She said: I think the room looks so classy now. All of these rooms have been done during lockdown. I can honestly say I am loving doing all of this. It may take its toll by the end of the day and it may take longer but when it’s done the feeling I get is of great joy knowing I’ve made an effort and not just stayed in bed feeling sorry for myself all day.  Sharon has also been keeping her friends and family updated via social media and said she has been overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people. She has had ’s of cards, flowers, gts and hampers and feels there are so many people that have gone out of their way and above and beyond to support her.The mother said she gets kind messages everyday from people asking hershe needs help and said she had no idea people on Facebook were so kind and caring.However Sharon recently experienced a breakdown and her two sons surprised her by taking her to the garden. Connor and Aaron surprised their mum by pulling all the weeds up, turfing the lawn and creating a decking area with a patio for her. Her friend Cathie also planted lots of flowers and even got Sharon a sunlounger to cheer her up. She said: Connor and Aaron came to my room after three weeks of breaking down and said aposright come on mum - let’s get you up.apos They took me to my dump of a back garden and when they said open your eyes - I was amazed! My garden was beautul and it really did help and prompted me to get up and sort myself out. Sadly money hasn’t been easy for Sharon as she only qualied for statutory sick pay - having not been in her job long enough.

It was said that the Wiltshire Police officer even told her what to doanyone saw them together - such as pretending she had lost her dog. The inquiry heard that PC Ross contacted the woman - known as Ms X - last year after noticing her profile online, where she said she liked unorms. He sent a picture of himself in unorm to prove he was a police officer before using his personal mobile to arrange to meet her. PC Ross, , and Ms X then met at around pm on June  after he drove to her house in a marked car - at her request.

He dropped her off at home at around .pm. Again, they talked about what she would sayanyone asked. PC Ross suggested she say she had gone to the police station to make a witness statement and even fetched a witness information notice from the boot of his car to aid the lie. Barrister Alice Meredith, for Wiltshire Police, said the constable’s actions had brought discredit on the police service and would have undermined people’s confidence in the force. He was accused of neglecting his responsibilities as a police officer and breached a specic point in the force’s code of conduct stopping officers from engaging in sexual conduct or inappropriate behaviour while on duty. She said: The officer wished to meet with Ms X having been interacting with her on a dating website. Having expressed an interest in unorms and, prior to the second meeting, discussed engaging in sexual activity involving the use of a police car, Ms X and the officer made arrangements to meet whilst the officer was on unormed duty and using a marked police vehicle.

A further  per cent don’t check because they assume their employer won’t make a mistake, while one in  don’t even know how to access or get hold of their payslip in the first place.  And a tenth get disheartened by the amount of tax deducted from their gross salary. It also emerged more than one in  rarely check their account balance before making a purchase, but  per cent have had their card declined for not having enough left in their bank or building society. As many as  per cent have even been caught so off guard with their spending habits that they’ve been unable to afford an unexpected bill. However,  per cent wouldn’t dream of making a purchase without first checking how much they have squirreled away. The research, conducted via OnePoll, also found three-fths won’t bother to log their personal day-to-day spending. But of the  per cent who do watch their pounds and pennies, three in  use a banking app to keep track, while  per cent jot it down with a good, old fashioned pen and paper.  It also emerged nearly half of those polled hate talking about money and their finances, while  per cent don’t even like to think about it. And more than a quarter admitted to having a ‘bury their head in the sand’ attitude towards their cash situation. As a result,  per cent are worried about the current state of their finances, and three in  are even concerned for their financial future because they don’t feel they have everything in order.

They only told their closest family and friends and ordered takeaways from their favourite restaurants rather than going out as they got to know each other. But on October , , they couldnapost hide it any more when news of their relationship was leaked. According to a new book about the couple, Finding Freedom, the leak came someone who works for Harryaposs cousin Princess Eugenie and her dad Prince Andrew. Authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand write: The Sunday Express was going to run with the story of their relationship - and the tabloid was rumoured to have been tipped off by an employee of none other than Eugenie and her father, Prince Andrew. Eugenie is extremely close to her cousin Harry, so itaposs likely that she was upset when she found out what happened - even though it wasnapost her fault. The two royals have been very close their whole lives, with their mums Princess Diana and Sarah Ferguson taking them on holiday together when they were kids. As they grew up, they took on the London clubbing scene together, sneaking into bars and doing shots together. Eugenie also played matchmaker to Harry before he met Meghan, setting him up with her actress friend Cressida Bonas. Scobie and Durand write: Eugenie has always been more than just a cousin to Harry. They were also the closest of friends. Out of all the Queenaposs grandchildren, Harry and Eugenie have one of the most natural connections. Like Harry, Eugenie is loyal, honest, and great fun. Like Harry, Eugenie also struggled to carve out her own identity growing up. Harry had always confided in his cousin when it came to the women in his le. Not only did he trust her implicitly, but friends say that she gives great advice and has always been beyond wise for her years.

According to a royal source the -year-old monarch will not reside at Buckingham Palace but would like to commute to the capitalit is safe to do so.It is believed that this will be the longest absence the Queen has had from Buckingham Palace during her -year reign, the Sunday Times reports.The Queen usually s to London in October after enjoying her annual summer break in Balmoral, but instead, she will reportedlyto Windsor Castle. Both the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have been self-isolating at Windsor since March  - four days before the UK went into lockdown. She has reportedly been told that the close-knit bubble of household staff who have been working with her in Windsor is the safest way to reduce the risk of her contracting coronavirus. A royal source said: There is a desire to get Buckingham Palace up and running again as a working palace, but onlyall the relevant advice suggests that it is appropriate to do so. It is believed that plans are being drawn up so the Queen can safely attend commemorations at the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday in November.But until the threat of coronavirus is eliminated the Queen will not apparentlyto Buckingham Palace. However, it is thought that she will spend her Christmas break at Sandringham in Norfolk as usual. The news comes after reports that the coronavirus risk means the Queen may not be allowed toto her public duties for years to come.Royal biographer Andrew Morton, , told The Sun in May that he feared the Queen may only be seen on TV or video links rather than in public due to the risk to herself and Prince Philip.The writer, who penned Diana: Her True Story in , told the paper: Itaposs terribly sad but I canapost see how the Queen can resume her usual job. The Covid- virus isnapost going away soon and will be with us for months,not years.  It would be far too risky for the Queen to start meeting people on a regular basis. The stringent measures are expected to upset The Queen as she has said in the past that she has to be seen to be believed. Buckingham Palace is usually open to the public for  weeks each summer and selected dates during winter and spring. But due to the coronavirus pandemic it has remained closed to visitors after a decision made by the Royal Collection Trust last month because of the operational challenges of social distancing in their palaces and properties.

Glaciologist Konrad Steffen, , was working near the Swiss Camp research station he set up  years ago when the accident happened in poor visibility. He drowned in deep meltwater at the foot of the crevasse. Ryan Neely, a University of Leeds climate scientist who studied under Dr Steffen, said crevasses in the area “were unheard-of” until recently. He said: “It looks like climate change actually claimed him as a victim.”  When Steffen, from Switzerland, first arrived in Greenland in  to set up a weather station, rising sea levels were not a huge concern, although the scientic community had agreed climate change was under way.But this changed after Steffen proved that not only were the ice sheets melting, but they were also moving and breaking up into the sea. He has yet to be proved wrong. Known as “Koni”, he set up Swiss Camp on the western edge of the ice sheet and with a growing number of colleagues and students, would set out for weather stations every morning on a snowmobile, equipped with a satellite phone, an emergency sleeping bag, and a packet of Marlboros. He only slept four hours a night, and kept going by drinking espresso after espresso. Colleague Jason Box, a climate scientist, once said: “There has been speculation among us that he isn’t actually human. Some of his students believe he has espresso running through his veins.” Dr Neely remembered once waking up in his bunk, only to hear Dr Steffen ask: “How long do you think it would take for the entire Greenland ice sheet to melt ” He had been up for hours, making back-of-the envelope calculations.  He realised the melting ice was becoming a threat which world leaders should wake up to, and former US Vice President Al Gore and Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the House of Representatives, were among the politicians who visited the camp in Greenland. In , Steffen flew over the Jakobshavn Glacier and saw that its tongue had collapsed, as though “somebody had hit it with a massive hammer”. Seismographs began to pick up an increasing number of ice quakes, suggesting the ice sheet was juddering towards the sea. The temperature was rising so steeply that at first Steffen did not believe his own monitors. After  years, they indicated a rise of C. Zurich-born Steffen believed the scientic community’s predictions of sea level rise were too optimistic. In , after the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicted sea levels would rise by cm to cm by , Steffen said: “Unfortunately, I think we are looking more like a metre.” He told a journalist: “There will be a change coming, and obviously a change that we have not seen in thousands of years.” Because of the decline of sun-reflecting sea ice, the Arctic is thought to be warming twice as fast as the rest of the world.

The History of Dundee FC’ and ‘They Wore The Dark Blue’ books, told Tele Sport: “The season before they went to Dens Park,  , the club had gone for more high-profile players and had spent a lot of money on wages.“There were some controversial things happening, some disciplinary issues with players and then some directors not backing up other directors when it came to dealing with it.“To save money, they went with largely local lads the next season. I think the only top player they had was Sandy Keillor who was an outstanding player for a decade.“Dundee couldn’t pay off the debt, though, and were wound up. But the Scottish League stepped in, they wanted to keep a presence north of the Tay, and asked them not to pack in but to wait a while.“Essentially Dundee Football and Athletic Club liquidated and they played the last two games of the season with the new set-up under the name Dundee Football Club.“The club were fortunate that the lease for Carolina Port was changed for commercial use and the new like-minded committee moved to Dens Park.“There were now a group of like-minded people with the same drive and determination to grow the club. And the supporters responded.”Indeed, a packed Gilfillan Hall saw a new committee formed with the influential Bailie John Robertson appointed president.Soon, though, the club were without a home as their Carolina Port ground was being taken over by dock work.Gussie Park was considered before the committee settled on leasing some agricultural land alongside Provost Road and Dens Road.It was a steeply sloping bit of land but Robertson remarked the creation of the ground had been by “putting stout hearts to a stf brae” while the stand at Carolina Port was dismantled and rebuilt on the south side of the new pitch.The new era for Dundee Football Club started on August , , with , spectators and £-s-d – around £, today # taken at the gate.President Robertson kicked off for the visiting Edinburgh side St Bernard’s ahead of a - draw.Dundonian Fred McDiarmid made history by scoring Dundee’s first goal at Dens Park.Dens Park has been the scene of many happy memories for a great many people in its  year history.The ground has hosted a European Cup semi-final between the Dark Blues and AC Milan, a Fairs Cup semi-final with Leeds the visitors, three internationals between Scotland and Wales in ,  and  as well as two League Cup Finals in  and .Those were some of the great occasions but what does it mean to fans who have been heading through the turnstiles week after week, year after year Tele reader Malcolm Stewart has fond memories of watching Dave Curlett, Shug Reid, Jimmy Gabriel, Alan Cousin, Doug Cowie and many more in his early days at Dens.He said: “My first memory of going to Dens Park was when I was eight-years-old, so that would be . I went with my grandfather who had been supporting Dundee way before then.“My grandfather would take me to the Provie Road end but I was in the Main Stand for the big European games and that’s where I go now, too.  That stand has barely changed since!“I have a lot of memories about the  team, I was at Muirton for the league win. I think about half a million people say they were but I certainly was!“That team was outstanding and there was hardly ever any space anywhere in the stands in those days.“The TC Keay and Provie Road ends were open then of course, not the stands like they are now and there was an incredible atmosphere at Dens.“My favourite player was Charlie Cooke, he was something . He was later on after the European games and was only around for a couple of years but he was my favourite.“There have been plenty of good memories for me at Dens Park. Goodness knows what it will be like next season but I hope there are more to come.”The Main Stand at Dens, unique in its angled shape, will next year look back over a century of Dundee goals, moans and celebrations.Built in  by Archibald Leitch, whose other works include Old Trafford, Anfield, Goodison, Highbury, Hampden, Ibrox and Tynecastle among many more, the ‘bend’ in the middle was designed to ensure a great viewing angle whether watching from the middle or the ends of the stands.Just  years after almost being wound up, Dundee were making their presence in Scottish football felt.Price added: “The building of the stand in  was such an ambitious move. That showed from being almost liquidated  years previously and given a reprieve from the league to building one of the best stands in the country.”Thirty-two years later and the Main Stand, along with the other three sides were filled to the brim.A record , fans piled into the stadium to see a Scottish Cup second-round tie between the Dark Blues and Rangers.The Glasgow side would win - that day and go on to lt the cup as well as the ‘A’ Division title, as it was known then.The massive crowds wouldagain in the early s as the greatest Dundee team of all time celebrated their league success in  with a European adventure.Twenty-five thousand saw a Gilzean hat-trick as Bob Shankly’s Dark Blues thumped FC Cologne -, , saw another treble from Gilzean in a - victory over Sporting Lisbon and then just under , were there to see Alan Cousin and Gordon Smith see off Belgians Anderlecht in the quarter-final.Among those , was a young Norrie Price. He recalls: “I was there for what would be one of the top half-dozen attendances in what was only my second time at Dens at the age of .“Anderlecht with just short of , people at Dens Park was one of the greatest experiences of my le.“Anderlecht were a fabulous team as well, had just beaten Real Madrid. For the first  minutes it was just non-stop Anderlecht passing. Under the floodlights they had this white and mauve strip and played fabulous football. I was thinking ‘gosh, Dundee can’t get a hold of the ball!’“The experienced players helped and in the second half turned the game.“It was a fantastic atmosphere, electric. You could see puffs of smoke coming from supporters all over the ground whether the breath in the night air or cigarettes. There were lights all around the ground.“Big crowds have a le of their own and it absolutely hooked me forever.“First of all, just going to the game. It had been talked about for weeks. The newspapers were fantastic, had been talking about the game for ages and there were real souvenirs made.“Even now I have fabulous memories of all the build-up.”Gilzean would net nine times in that European run to the last four, stopped only by AC Milan, and scored a record  goals for Dundee.“Gilzean was my favourite,” added Price.“We used to pretend to be all the dferent players, Andy Penman, Alan Cousin, Alan Gilzean. Everyone wanted to be Gilzean because he scored the goals.“He had a tremendous burst of pace and would often be on the halfway line with teams trying to play offside.“It was a great team and the interchanging of passing was great to behold. You look at that era and there were so many heroes. Today the best teams have maybe three or four the kids like to pick out but it doesn’t happen so much now.“That night against Anderlecht it was Smith that made the dference, he transferred the ball from one foot to the other and wandered past the full-back and put it across for Penman. It was a goal out of nothing.”The Ibrox disaster of  saw regulations brought in and the days of huge crowds were over. Bench seats were installed which brought the capacity down from more than , to ,.Further improvements in fan safety saw that reduced even further during the s.Then , packed out the new-look Dens Park in December  as the eyes of the entire country were focused on the home of Dundee Football Club.For the second time in two years, the Scottish League Cup would be decided at Dens. This time the Dark Blues would be playing after rivals Dundee United had defeated Aberdeen in a replay of the - final the year before.The Tangerines were back to defend their trophy in what would be an all-Dundee affair, even referee Bob Valentine was local.Former Dark Blues inside forward Jim McLean, who turned out  times for the club, was in charge of United and leading them to their own glory days.Dundee were very much the underdogs, battling for promotion to the Premier Division, with United enjoying European football for the fourth-straight season.A first-half goal from Davie Dodds was added to by Paul Sturrock’s second-half brace as the Tangerines ran out - winners and lted the cup at the home of their rivals.Come the end of the campaign, it would be more cheerful for home fans at Dens Park with promotion secured at East Stirling thanks to an Eric Sinclair goal.Dundee historian Kenny Ross remembers that time as he began his love affair with the club.He said: “One of my early memories was in the run up to promotion in  .“I didn’t get to go to the League Cup Final in  at Dens, we couldn’t get tickets. My dad queued up but the shutters went up and we ended up watching it from the top of the Law with hundreds of others, from both sides, with the car radios on. It was packed up there. It was amazing.“Later that season, I remember going to a game against Berwick Rangers in March and being in the Stand Enclosure swinging my legs on the barriers! I think it finished - which tells you why I was doing that.“Myself and my dad then moved to the Provost Road end and watched games from the Bobby Cox until I started doing some of the media stuff for the club where I’m now at the back of the Main Stand.”He added: “There were , at that cup final. The last time the gates were shut were for a Skol Cup quarter-final, again against United, in  where , watched. The queues were horrendous that night before the gates closed.“The day Hearts lost the league at Dens in  was just under , and there were , in the ground when United won the league three years earlier.“The last time it was sold out was for the Championship win in  – that was a total sell-out against Dumbarton.”The next major changes came at the tail end of the th century with promotion to the top flight in  dependant on the redevelopment of Dens Park.Up came two near-identical stands at either end of the ground in record time, just  days, to meet the SPL’s required seating capacity.The Bob Shankly and Bobby Cox stands popped up and Dens Park as we recognise it today emerged into the new century.Along with the new millennium came glitz and glamour with the Bonetti revolution.Club stalwarts like Barry Smith and Gavin Rae were joined by Argentine great Caniggia and the likes of Georgi Nemsadze, Fabian Caballero and Juan Sara to boost the average home gate to ,.Fans would also see a Champions League winner in Fabrizio Ravanelli and English Premier League star Temuri Ketsbaia turn out in dark blue at Dens Park before administration hit.Supporters once more stepped in to help save the club in  through another administration, just like they did  years before.Fast forward seven years and owners Tim Keyes and John Nelms revealed plans for a new stadium to take Dundee from Dens Park to a new home at Camperdown Park.Initial hopes were that would be ready for the start of the   campaign but funding issues and a global pandemic have delayed the first spade in the ground at ‘New Campy’, the fans’ name for the potential new ground.Whenever that might arrive to replace Dens, fans will continue to flock to their club’s home of  years.However, the next home match, a League Cup clash with Forfar on October , will be a competitive match like no other at the old ground.Depending on government guidelines at the time when the new season starts, there could be no fans there for a competitive fixture. At the very least there will be social distancing measures in place to combat spread of coronavirus.The days of , at Dens Park may be gone but that won’t stop thousands still wanting to get their fix of football from the Main Stand, South Enclosure, Bobby Cox or Bob Shankly.“It’s almost a marker for your year, when the first game at Dens is,” Price added.“We were looking forward to the better weather and the play-offs earlier this year but they didn’t happen. Reality kicked in and everyone was aware how dangerous a situation it is for everyone now.“When you see football where kicking off, you do feel left out. This situation shows just how much we take for granted.”Andrew Nelson’s departure from Dundee this summer heralds the end of a chapter in the Dens Park club#s history\" title\"#Andrew Nelson’s departure from Dundee this summer heralds the end of a chapter in the Dens Park club#s history# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-fc-andrew-nelson-jim-mcintyre-james-mcpake embed # secretONRAQjKlL\" data-secret\"ONRAQjKlL\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

I like what Olly Crankshaw brought to the Dee last term and a similar sort should be sought.At the back, a left-sider to push Jordan Marshall and a goalkeeper should be on the shopping list, while a No  to bang in the goals is needed.The clock has started ticking, let’s see what the next month and a half brings. . .Enjoying the privileged position of being able to attend games in person this season has been fantastic but minus fans it’s lacked something.Whether it’s passionate Dees banging on the Tannadice press box window celebrating a derby equaliser or hordes of Arabs heading for away days in the sun, they’ve been missed.It’s certainly earlier than expected but the September  date is promising. Fingers crossed it happens!There’s just no seeing past Bayern Munich for the Champions League is there  The Germans are an absolute powerhouse and, as good as PSG are, I don’t think they stand a chance in the Lisbon finale tomorrow.Arsenal ace Kieran Tierney lts lid on ex-Dundee United No Gordon Young#s attempts to sign him, working with Stevie Frail and his debut against Dundee\" title\"#Arsenal ace Kieran Tierney lts lid on ex-Dundee United No Gordon Young#s attempts to sign him, working with Stevie Frail and his debut against Dundee# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp arsenal-celtic-kieran-tierney-dundee-united-gordon-young-stevie-frail embed # secretWyaDSfYoJ\" data-secret\"WyaDSfYoJ\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

That#s what the owner said # they believe in my potential, I just need some games now. I#ve got two years and an option of a third year, so I#ve got heaps of time to get fit and hopefully score some goals.#It#s very technical and there#s a lot of passing. Defensively they#re very organised. It#s like the polar opposite of Scottish football it#s not very direct at all, whereas in Scotland it#s all about getting the ball forward.#Hopefully it#ll suit my style of play. I feel like I#ve learned a lot already. I#m off the wing and into the middle now.#This is Ross# first time living outside Scotland, with the Ellon-born schemer having two loan spells away from the Dons with Ayr United and Morton.Learning the language and living by himself will be two new challenges for the -year-old.He added: #It#s a big challenge. Apart from my loan moves I#ve basically lived at home. Even with the loans it#s been Glasgow, so you can go home whenever you want.#It#s something I#m looking forward to. Holland is quite a nice place and I#m looking forward to living by myself, doing the cooking and cleaning.#There#s a few foreign lads here but I think once a week they go for Dutch classes in the city, so I#ll have to get on that.#Ross admitted the response to his move has been overwhelmingly positive, with his family keen to see him embrace the chance of a fresh start.He said: #My dad is big into his football and has watched a lot of Dutch football over the years.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet.

I share many of his concerns, and commend the series of articles.It would be good to hear from a range of Argyll and Bute residents with their ideas for how we get from #here# towards a better #there#. My personal pet project would be an Argyll and Bute Citizens’ Assembly, that would bring people together to generate real strategies to bring about just and #green# change for our area.A good start would be better transport links, via enhanced road and ferry services.A permanent solution to the Rest and be Thankful would be welcome, of course, but it was really heartening to see how Western Ferries rose to the challenge on Friday Auust .  They magicked away that endless queue at Gourock with great patience and goodwill and double service, showing what can be done.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,Following the latest landslide and road closure at the Rest and be Thankful, once again the road closure signs were placed at the wrong place on the Arrochar side.Having spoken to several of the local businesses owners, the main issue around the signs are they are too far away from the incident. There are information signs from Balloch to Tarbet advising of the closure at the Rest.Surely moving the signs to Ardgartan would make more sense. Should anyone have to turn then there is ample space to do this. We cannot continue to render two villages effectively closed in case someone has failed to read the signs or cannot turn.Transport Scotland and BEAR Scotland must guarantee that the signs will not be put back in the same place when further disruption occurs, and it will.Jane Ireland, Slanj restaurant, Tarbet"},{"url":null,"title":"news from the districts august 21 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMull of Kintyre music festivalhas taken its virtual  event to new heights by beaming a unique Scottish rendition of David Bowie’s #Space Oddity# to the International Space Station.The annual music festival teamed up with the Machrihanish Airbase Community Company , in the running to become the UK’s first spaceport, to record the unique set, featuring local band Slainte Davaar Allstar’s cover of Bowie’s iconic track.With the festival moved online this year the organisers came up with the idea of partnering with the local base and its unconventional location for the exclusive gig.The set was performed on the former top-secret RAF base runway # nearly two miles long and one of the longest in Europe – for current Commander of the ISS Chris Cassidy and Cosmonauts Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner, as they orbit the earth at ,mph.Event manager Iain Johnston of JIG Events said: #The Mull of Kintyre Music Festival has encouraged people to visit Kintyre from all parts of the globe since its inception  years ago and we were naturally disappointed, like every other event organiser up and down the country, to have to cancel this year.

Control system builders ITI will undertake the design, installation and commissioning of the upgrade across the station’s four units.The power station, constructed in a cavern within Ben Cruachan on the shores of Loch Awe, plays a critical role in stabilising the country’s electricity system throughout the Covid- pandemic due to its flexibility. The plant can generate power in less than a minute when needed and can also store excess electricity from the grid like a giant battery, a service which was called upon when the low electricity demand during the lockdown coincided with periods of high wind power in Scotland.The plant’s reversible turbines pump water from Loch Awe to an upper reservoir on the mountainside to store excess power from the grid. The stored water is then released back through the turbines to generate power quickly and reliably when demand increases."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures august 21 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGordon Stewart from Ardfern sent us thisatmospheric photograph, taken from Corranmor Farm on Monday August .A stunning full rainbow appeared that day over Loch Craignish lagoon, captured by Gordon on camera.PIC:no_aYourPictures_Rainbow"},{"url":null,"title":"enjoy cowal highland gathering in the comfort of your own home","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWith just days to go until one of Scotland’s favourite events takes the virtual stage for the first time, Cowal Highland Gathering’s organisers are preparing to unveil a packed programme to a worldwide audience.Cowal’s Virtual Highland Gathering is an ambitious three-day event which mirrors as closely as possible the programme of the gathering itself.Kicking off on Thursday August , Cowal’s Virtual Gathering features a host of exclusive interviews and performances, together with a look back at some of the highlights of the -year-old event.The Gathering’s Friday night gig is back too, with the Gig at the Gathering Unplugged going live from pm.

Itrsquos not so easy to access, but the fact the trees are now under threat made me want to discover the place before it might be too late. As I write, the decision has yet to be made on the fate of the trees.Irsquom a lover of history and totally understand the need to create a safe, weather-proof home for these historic planes, and to keep the museum as much an authentic visiting experience as possible. But there is a huge amount of space in the existing museum area, so the destruction of woodland seems unnecessary.The museum argues that any additional modern structures near the runway will undermine the historic look of the airfield. The proposed new visitor centre will, they say, create much-needed new jobs. So cutting down the trees to move the planes and create a new home for them is, the museum authorities argue, the only realistic option for them. They say that refusal of their plans will put the new jobs at risk.I totally understand the need for jobs at this time in particular, but the trouble is the approach taken by the museum is part of the reason the world is facing an ecological crisis with deforestation, the destruction of habitats and the extinction of wildle. It is part of the mindset that sees nature as ldquoin the way of development.Donrsquot be ridiculously dramatic, I hear some folks say this is not the Amazon or a rainforest in Indonesia, itrsquos a small wood in East Lothian.And that is precisely the point. It is a small but very rare example of a wood with mature trees in our county. It is a special place, with a ersity of trees and buzzing with wildle. Walk under its canopy and you will discover that. I know itrsquos proposed to plant new trees in a dferent area as compensation, but this wonrsquot connect to the wood and will take generations to grow. It will never replace what will be lost.If we seriously want to do something about the ecological disaster we are making on our planet then we need to start in our own backyard. We canrsquot campaign against deforestation, habitat destruction and declare a climate emergency, and then say: ldquoWell, the rules donrsquot apply to us when we want to destroy woodland to move some planes.Deforestation has a multitude of justications all over the world: dam building, road construction, cattle ranching, extreme poverty of subsistence farmers, profit from timber, oil exploration and pipelines, mining: the list is long. The point is there will always be someone with an economic justication for environmental destruction.While it may be on a much smaller scale, the proposal to destroy irreplaceable woodland in order to move some planes is a product of the same mindset that has brought us to a point of environmental and climate crisis.This mindset is revealed in the Historic Environment Scotland response to the proposal. This is the public body charged with protecting Scotlandrsquos built heritage. It has said: ldquoWe would not consider the trees of Sunnyside Strip to be directly related to the cultural signicance of the scheduled monument ndash they are visible but do not relate to our understanding of the monument as a wartime airfield.In other words, woodland isnrsquot part of our heritage mature trees, many of which were around before the war, arenrsquot historic or worthy of value in themselves. Really The wood is far more a historic part of the wartime airfield site than the massive car park. It seems to be a very selective viewpoint.The truth is that the UK is one of the most nature-depleted countries on the planet. A quarter of our already-decimated wild mammals are in danger of extinction. Our woodlands are small and dispersed, but all the more vital for the habitat they provide. East Lothian has huge developmental pressure, and this wood is a rare and vital part of naturersquos increasingly precarious foothold in our county.A changed mindset would be one which makes the protection of nature and the environment the initial default position. Developers should then take this priority as the starting point for proposals.That hasnrsquot happened with this plan, and credit to the council for rejecting it.There has been so much publicity and justied outrage recently over the destruction and littering of our land by people lsquowildrsquo camping and disrespecting nature. So many people, it seems, just donrsquot care, or seem unable to appreciate the gt of our natural environment and its importance.There is a disconnect from nature at the heart of this. We will never solve the environmental and climate crisis we are in until we can foster love and appreciation of nature, of which we are a part. Our childrenrsquos future literally depends on this.And institutions such as National Museums Scotland should be part of the solution, not the problem. Instead of viewing the woodland as irrelevant to the visitor experience, it could be used to enhance it. The wood is a magic place, with younger trees growing amidst towering old mature ones.My kids were in wonder as they explored the wood, peering up at the tops of the trees, and an old oak caught their attention as its boughs seemed to dip asto say hello. We spent a wonderful hour being immersed in nature.Many of our children, in fact many adults, have limited opportunities to explore and enjoy such places. Imagine the extra possibility of a nature walk in the tall wood, where wildle thrives and trees older than the airfield can tell their story. This wood is not an intrusion for the visitor but a potential wonderful addition. Get the ranger service to do talks and tours about this amazing place, a treasure hunt use it to enhance peoplersquos connection to nature ndash an extra experience.Woodland is not just a habitat for wildle, itrsquos a habitat for us humans too. Enjoying nature and learning about its importance should not be seen as a contradiction to enjoying historic planes.While Irsquom aware that itrsquos only part of the wood under threat, the proposal to destroy a large section of it will result in a tragic loss of trees and the habitat they provide. But itrsquos not just the destruction in itself, itrsquos also the precedent and example it sets for future developments.I really hope the Reporter will uphold the councilrsquos decision, and the museum, which is a fantastic and well-loved historic place to visit, will consider a new location for the visitor centre. Then we will all be winners."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-peeps-past-august-18-20-1995-1970-1920","story":"lsquoENOUGH is enoughrsquo was the message from traders in North Berwick, reported the East Lothian Courier on August , .The opening of North Berwickrsquos sixth charity shop this week has sparked controversy ndash and fears have been raised that a seventh could be on the cards.Traders claimed the resort had now reached ldquosaturation point with fundraising outlets, which are now selling new goods in addition to second-hand items.They said the charities were setting up shop on prime sites, and argued that they were ldquosubsidising them through having to pay higher rates.Fears that the trend could ultimately lead to a downturn in the local economy and the death of the High Street as a shopping centre were also expressed.The row follows the opening of the Chest, Heart  Stroke Associationrsquos outlet at a former delicatessen shop in the High Street on Monday.A RE-ENACTMENT of the Battle of Dunbar was postponed as it clashed with a model power boat demonstration, reported The Haddingtonshire Courier of August , .The re-enactment of the Battle of Dunbar, which is to be staged by the Royal Scots as part of their recruiting drive in East Lothian, has been postponed for a week because it would have clashed with the running of a model power boat demonstration to be held on Sunday, September .

This is how I heard about an otter at the Esk for the first time three years ago.A few people mentioned they had seen this elusive creature a few years ago, but never since.The otter became my new photography challenge. I tried visiting the river at dferent times of the day, especially at dawn and dusk, when otters are more active, always trying to keep the noise down to a minimum.After two years of searching, my hope was gone and I almost gave up. Until one sunny day in April during lockdownhellipThe weather that day was enjoyable, so Chris and I decided to go on a walk. The local path was very busy the dog walkers, cyclists, families with children and joggers were enjoying the sun whilst social distancing.As always, I kept my eyes low on the water hoping to see the kingfisher.As we followed the river upstream to the area at The Grove, I spotted something moving in the water.I grabbed Chrisrsquo hand and I pulled him down on the ground right behind a bush.It was not a kingfisher but something I did not expect to see in the middle of the day... an otter fishing!We managed to crawl down the slope and lie down so we would not disturbit.Whilst I was photographing the otter, I also heard a cheery pee-pee-pee and saw the kingfisher flying past the otter. What a day!Since then I have seen the otter a couple more times.The Eurasian otter is a secretive, semi-aquatic species with chocolate brown fur, webbed feet, and a powerful tail. Their thick coats are built of two layers of fur: an inner layer that works as insulation, and the outer, waterproof layer. The two-layered system prevents their skin from direct contact with water and subsequent temperature loss.Their nostrils and ears stay closed as otters swim underwater.Despite being excellent swimmers, they cannot hold their breath underwater for long periods the average time underwater is about  seconds as they e.Otters are solitary, territorial animals, that live in underground holes called lsquoholtsrsquo. The size of their territory ies and depends on the quality of the habitat, amount of food and number of possible holts.It is also known that a male otter has a larger territory that can even overlap several female ottersrsquo territories. Otters usually have a well-defined area within their grounds in which they feed, rest and breed.Seeing signs of otters is generally easier than seeing the animals themselves.

Signicant proposed changes include enabling the children involved to express their views and changing the way these views are obtained.But unless an amendment from Liberal Democrat MSP Liam McArthur is agreed in tomorrows debate, a key opportunity will be missed to improve the chances that children will remain equally involved with both of their parents. The vast majority of research around the world concludes that equal time or close to it has enduring benefits for the children in separated families.Mr McArthurrsquos amendment introduces a factor into court hearings that has already been successful in other progressive countries. On the request of one of the parents, the sherf hearing a court case will have to consider whether children should spend approximately equal time with each of their parents.The amendment doesnrsquot force the court to order shared care. It doesnrsquot bind the hands of a sherf or undermine the overweening principle that the sherf will put the interests of the children first. It does mean thatthere are two safe, competent, loving parents both will have the opportunity to make their case for sharing the parenting responsibilities. It creates a dferent starting point for the decision from the winner-takes-all competition we currently have in Scotland.A similar law has been in force in Belgium since . It has reduced the number of such disputes that have to be brought to court. According to Belgian family judge Marie-France Carlier, ldquothere has been a huge reduction of parental conflict in the courts as parents now know what the law says. After separation, lots of them immediately decide to set up joint physical custody before having any court decision. A change in culture has gone hand in hand with a change in the law.Only about  per cent of Belgian decisions are for a : split with around % of remaining decisions for semi-equal care, with the children spending at least five days per fortnight with one parent.Usually it is the father who ends up with less time, but this still means he can be fully involved in weekday care ndash not relegated to the visiting role of a ldquoweekend dad. If the court considers that children will not benefit from full involvement of both parents it can order whatever contact pattern is best for them.Underpinning Mr McArthurrsquos amendment is an acceptance that the current system is expensive, unpredictable and inconsistent between courts and between sherfs. It has too many disincentives to cooperation between parents at a time when they need help to make things as easy as possible for their children, not a system that encourages them to criticise each other to win time with their kids.We have heard sherfs say from the bench ndash even before hearing arguments ndash that shared parenting never works. Of course sherfs also know they never see the successes. Only the failures come back before them.Politicians in countries such as Portugal, Greece and Brazil are currently considering whether to make similar changes in their family law. Holyrood could strike a blow for parental equality this week and bring the law into line with the reality of family le in modern Scotland.Ian Maxwell is the national manager of the Shared Parenting Scotland charity"},{"url":null,"title":"president-turns-producer-in-chief-big-show","story":"The New York Times reported yesterday that the US President has hired two producers from The Apprentice to run the bash. The television show that propelled Mr Trump from minor New York celebrity to coast to coast recognition famously ends with losing candidates being told ldquoyoursquore fired, and the winner ldquoyoursquore hired. Given the President is running for a second time, some iation on a theme would be permissible.The Republican convention, like the Democratsrsquo gathering, will be like nothing seen before. Such are the Covid- times. Stripped back to basics, the Democratsrsquo virtual event took some getting used to. Gone was the sales conference meets Christmas party atmosphere of old, complete with pop music and balloons. Even the firework display looked asit was trying hard to be modest.A stellar line up of speakers, led by Michelle Obama, and slick production , still made it a television event that more than  million Americans watched each night. Joe Bidenrsquos speech was well received, evenhe did not receive a big bump in the polls, and another  million was added to the partyrsquos coffers. Job done, everyone happy.Will the Republicans be saying the same come Thursday night  Whatever happens, the event is not the one the party wanted. Organisers tried to get as close to the convention norm as possible, but that plan was scrapped as the death toll from Covid- continued to soar.Instead, there will be a mix of in-person events, with an audience in Washington of no more than  people, and speeches from the key players at ious locations.On Thursday the President will accept the nomination at the White House, defying critics who say the residence should not be used for party political purposes. The First Lady, Melania Trump, will take to the podium in the White House rose garden tomorrow, hoping to follow the success of Jill Biden, who filmed a video in the school in which she once taught.Kellyanne Conway, senior adviser to Mr Trump, has promised a move away from what she called the ldquodour and sour mood of the Democratic National Convention. There has already been controversy over the guest spot given to lawyers Mark and Patricia McCloskey, the couple from St Louis who were pictured outside their mansion pointing guns at Black Lives Matters protesters in June.Mr Trump is expected to speak every night, andhis recent White House press conferences are any guide, viewers should expect the unexpected. Not given to delivering tightly scripted addresses, the President could find himself wandering far off topic. Any over-running will not go down well with television networks and viewers waiting for their shows to start.What a change it will be for a candidate who is at his happiest when he is speaking to his base in some vast auditorium. Gone will be the glory days of  when packed rallies cheered his every word and a penned press could be held up for the crowdrsquos ridicule. How much atmosphere can even he generate before an audience of  people  His team need to avoid at all costs repeating the flop that was the Tulsa rally, when a paltry , people turned up and the atmosphere fell flat.Come the fireworks display over the White House lawn on Thursday certain things should be clearer. As with the Democrats, the partyrsquos general direction of travel will be apparent. The Democrats went for the centre ground, going heavy on the personal ndash Mr Bidenrsquos steadiness, decency, inclusiveness ndash and light on policy. It was the most positive campaign launch since Barack Obamarsquos  run.It would be the mother and father of all convention surprisesthe Republicans followed suit. Mr Trump has been trying out ious lines for size, accusing Mr Biden and his Veep nominee Kamala Harris of being prisoners of the left. A heavy emphasis on law and order and protecting the suburbs is expected. But how personal can he be in attacking his opponents  This is not  when he questioned the integrity of Hillary Clinton, and encouraged his supporters to do the same. Voters may accept that from a candidate, but not a President.Perhaps the best the Republicans can expect from their unconventional convention is to get through it without any major gaffes. They can then start campaigning proper where it matters, on the ground. With most voters not turning their attention to the election until a couple of weeks before polling day, the conventions had already lost much of their impact.

The polls in  showing Yes at over  per cent. The ldquosurge in SNP membership. The marches. All of them have been declared as signs that the momentum is with Yes and the same inevitably happened this week with the polls showing Yes on % and %. Forgive meI donrsquot get overly excited.But we shouldnrsquot be unduly cynical either. In private, senior figures in the SNP say the tipping point they really need is % and one of the first steps towards achieving % is saying you have momentum, whether itrsquos true or not. Itrsquos the faith factor that can attract believers which is why Nicola Sturgeon keeps doing it and was doing it again this week. The new polls, she said, showed that ldquothe momentum is very clearly with us.:Veteran SNP MSP calls for complete re-write of independence caseThe second step in the process, the other factor you need to reach %, is capitalising on the momentum you actually have, but thatrsquos a tricky one for the SNP because itrsquos not clear whatrsquos causing the recent rise in support. It could be Brexit, but then again the SNPrsquos big hope in  was that the result of the EU referendum would lead to a surge for them but it pretty much failed to materialise. Indeed, the First Ministerrsquos attempts to link Brexit with a second independence referendum led to the SNP suffering big losses at the General Election in .Alternatively, the latest encouraging polls for the SNP could be down to coronavirus and the fact that people seem pleased with the SNPrsquos handling of it. Ms Sturgeon says herself she believes this to be a factor ndash ldquoshow not tell she calls it ndash but itrsquos a hard trend to capitalise on isnrsquot it  If it was Brexit fuelling support for Yes, the SNP could keep on capitalising on itthe economy suffers. Butitrsquos coronavirus thatrsquos boosting support, the crisis will eventually fade and it may take some of the new support with it.Stage three on the road to % ndash building momentum beyond your core groups ndash is also quite hard to work out. Itrsquos clear that most of the sht from No to Yes has happened among Labour voters the firmest support for Yes is also still clustered around cities and the more deprived parts of those cities. But to get independence to the -plus zone that devolution reached  years ago, you need the momentum to get beyond those hard cores.Ms Sturgeon acknowledged this herself in  when she said that what really built the momentum for devolution in the s was the involvement of people beyond party politics. ldquoThe churches, trade unions, writers, artists, business people, she said, ldquothey all had their say and they were driving forces in building the momentum that led Labour to promise a referendum and the people of Scotland to vote for a Parliament with tax ying powers. If the SNP is to get % for independence, it needs the same kind of trend.But itrsquos stage four that could really take the Yes side over the line because itrsquos often the point where the process is almost impossible to reverse. Behaviourists call it ldquosocial herding and what it means is that when a politician or cause appears to be popular, people will gravitate towards it because itrsquos popular therersquos also a certain part of the electorate that will want to be on the winning side. Again, you saw some of that in the s with devolution it got to the point whereyou didnrsquot support a Scottish Parliament, you were a bit of a freak and itrsquos not always easy to stick to a beliefyou think everyone  thinks dferently. Itrsquos social herding that will take us over the line to  plus.Which leaves the question of where Scotland actually is in the four-stage process and I think the answer to that is not as far as some in the SNP think. Therersquos no denying the upward trend for Yes, and therersquos probably been a sht because of coronavirus, but we will have to wait to seethe SNP really is in stage two and can capitalise on whatrsquos happening.As for stage three ndash reaching out beyond the hard core ndash again therersquos not much evidence yet of support changing except in the soft middle which wersquove known for a while now is prone to shting back and forth. Itrsquos also worth remembering political scientist John Curticersquos point that support for Yes may come down again under the sustained attack there will be on independence in the event of a second referendum. In other words, momentum can go down as well as up.:SNP call for Russia to respect Ukraines independenceAnd therersquos another factor which may be more important than momentum anyway. As Irsquove already pointed out, who you are and where you live was a massive factor in how you voted on independence: well-off areas voted No, poorer areas voted Yes. But demographics change and, in the end, this could be whatrsquos really critical for the independence case.First, coronavirus and Brexit will make a lot of us poorer and nationalism does well in economies that are struggling ndash so the harder le gets for people, the more likely they are to be tempted by Yes. But secondly, support for independence is higher among under-s than it is among older people and the laws of demographics are clear on that one: the second group is going to get smaller. Political views can change as you age of course, but the demographic destiny looks undeniable.The question of momentum is much less certain. I know Nicola Sturgeon says she has it, but she said the same thing in  and  and look what happened then.

A comprehensive revaluation should be set in hand which would give the basis both for a fairer property tax and for a land value tax, both to be introduced within five years. Local authorities should also be permitted a wider range of local taxes, which could include a tourist tax and workplace parking levies. Community councils should be enabled as of right to levy a small precept on the council tax instead of being dependent on local authority handouts. The balance of council income would come from the Scottish Government, which controls income tax levels, and would be at a iable level so that richer areas would receive less per head of population than poorer areas.This approach, primarily taxing land, property and income, would mean that Scotland could have a fairer and more progressive taxation system even within the constraints laid down by Westminster.David Mumford, Dunbar.NOT SO GREENYOU report on SSE Renewable`s new Viking wind farm near Shetland.

Gerrymandering is an attempt to establish a political advantage for a particular party or group by adjusting district boundaries. Mr Russell alleges, but technically in error, what could be considered a iant of gerrymandering by expanding, or restricting, the voter pool for political advantage. The Scottish Government has engaged in iant gerrymandering by conferring voting rights upon those aged  years or older.

Mr McKay can be further assured that should such a referendum take place, he will have a second opportunity to muster further support to vote against Scotland being a sovereign country.

This is now brought into line with the public transport guidance.What about primary school children With the exception of school buses as outlined above, the new guidance in schools only applies to secondary school pupils.Do they need to be worn in class While staff and students can continue to wear face coveringsthey wish to, they will not generally be necessary in the classroom.This is because there is greater scope for physical distancing and face coverings can have an impact on teaching.However it remains the case that where adults cannot keep m distance and are interacting face-to-face for a sustained period , face coverings should be wornCan a child be excluded for not wearing one It is expected that the guidance will state that pupils should not be excluded from schoolthey do not wish to wear a face covering.Can someone help my child with their covering Education Secretary John Swinney said:ldquoSchools will be asked to ensure children and young people have clear instructions on how to put on, remove, and store face coverings.\"Any staff member or pupil will still be able to wear a face covering when they wish to do so.\"John Swinney confirmed the new guidanceWhy is this being done Mr Swinney added:ldquoThere is increasing evidence that face coverings can provide some protection for the wearer as well as those around them.\"We also know that some pupils have found it very dficult to physically distance when moving around school, which could increase the risk of transmission of the virus.\"And on school transport, as on public transport, there can be mixing between dferent age groups.\"What  was said Mr Swinney said:ldquoWe want to continue to protect what we have achieved in suppressing the virus and re-opening schools, and to do the best for children in schools.\"Alongside this change to the wearing of face coverings, we need to reinforce the importance of maintaining high standards of cleaning, personal hand and respiratory hygiene and physical distancing, where possible.\"In situations where there is a local cluster, use of face coverings throughout the day may be required.ldquoThe position will be kept under review to ensure that our approach remains commensurate with the evidence and the levels of transmission in Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-causing-confusion-face-coverings-used-high-schools-buses","story":"Nicola Sturgeon confirmed that those aged five and older on dedicated school transport will be subject to the public health measure, which will be introduced from Monday - as well as high school pupils in crowded and communal areas, but not in classrooms.The NASUWT teaching union has warned that ministers should focus on the root cause of outbreaks of Covid- in schools, while the EIS union has stressed that improved distancing between people in schools would be a more effective strategy.Meanwhile a parent campaign group has labelled the move \"a slippery slope\".The First Minister said the changes to the official guidance for schools has been formed by ldquothe latest scientic evidence as well as the real-le experience of schools as they re-opened\".:Face coverings to be brought in for secondary schools on limited basisShe added: ldquoThe current guidance advises that face coverings in the classrooms are not necessary, however, it says that staff should wear themthey canrsquot physically distance and are having face-to-face interaction with pupils for more than around  minutes.\"The guidance also current emphasises that staff and pupils should be supported to wear face coveringsthey wish to do so ndash that advice remains unchanged. However, the new guidance will now include two additional situations where face coverings should be worn.ldquoFirstly, adults and pupils in secondary schools should wear face coverings when they are moving around school in areas where distancing is challenging ndash for example, through corridors or communal spaces. Secondly, adults and children aged five and over should wear face coverings on dedicated school transport and that, of course, simply mirrors the situation on public transport more generally.Ms Sturgeon stressed that dedicated school transport and crowded parts of schools have a ldquogreater potential for dferent groups to mix, there is ldquoles scope for distancing and effective ventilation and ldquotherersquos more chance of voices being raised resulting in the creation of aerosols.She added: ldquoWe believe that face coverings could provide an additional layer of protection in mitigating these factors.ldquoWe expect that most children and young people will have access to face coverings already, as part of their daily lives. However, we will work with local authorities to ensure that schools also have supplies so that no child is disadvantaged.:Face coverings in Scotlands schools explained: What does the guidance say ldquoWe hope that these changes provide some additional assurance to pupils, staff and parents.Patrick Roach, the general secretary of the NASUWT union, has pointed to the dficulties raised in schools since re-opening earlier this month as guiding the sht in approach by ministers.He said: ldquoThe NASUWT has always been clear that the government must follow the scientic evidence and advice to mitigate the risks of Covid- within schools and it is right that guidance is kept under review to in light of changing trends and evidence.ldquoThere is little doubt this revised guidance is in response to the practical dficulties schools are experiencing in maintaining effective social distancing practices, together with a number of reported incidences of coronavirus transmission following the full re-opening of schools in Scotland.He added: ldquoHowever, this announcement runs the risk of causing uncertainty and confusion.ldquoWhere schools are unable to ensure effective social distancing, other measures will need to be introduced to protect health and safety. However,wearing face masks or face coverings in schools is now deemed appropriate in order to safeguard health and safety, then it is dficult to understand why this practice has not been made compulsory.:EIS union in plea for Nicola Sturgeon to cut school class sizes to halt Covid spreadEIS general secretary, Larry Flanagan, said: ldquoThe EIS welcomes this decision by the Scottish Government today, which reflects the updated advice from the World Health Organization recommending face coverings for those aged  and over, where one-metre distancing cannot be maintained.ldquoSchools are busy places with a large number of adults and young adults moving around. The use of face coverings in these circumstances is a sensible and appropriate step to reduce the risk of Covid- spreading through school communities.He added: ldquoWhile we welcome todayrsquos announcement, the EIS believes that effective physical distancing between pupils is the best means of reducing the risk of Covid- spread in schools.ldquoThis is an area where the guidance from the Scottish Government currently lacks specicity ndash there needs to be a much sharper focus on ensuring social distancing in schools to protect pupils, staff and the wider community. Smaller class sizes to ensure appropriate physical distancing of pupils are essential.:Union seeks regular Covid testing for staff in schoolsBut parent campaign group, Us For Them Scotland, has warned that ldquoparents across Scotland will be angry at the changes.Jo Bisset, the grouprsquos organiser, said: ldquoIt will impact vulnerable pupils the most and creates another unnecessary challenge for children whorsquove already endured months of misery.ldquoThis is also a slippery slope.

Reasons for objection included:After a y discussion, councillors chose to reject the application. This decision was led by Kirkwall East councillor, David Dawson, who was seconded by West Mainland councillor, Owen Tierney. The reasoning given for this was that the application proposed an extension which extended beyond the quarry#s defined mineral safeguard area, which Councillor Dawson and his colleagues felt was not justied. It was also felt that this extension would result in cumulative adverse impacts to residents living in nearby properties.Though this rejection was unanimously agreed by the planning committee, Kirkwall East councillor, John Ross Scott, formally lodged his objection to the decision taken by members after it had been made.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I believe that OLA representing the cattle industry in Orkney can have a strong association with Moredun in the future.#Beth Wells, from Moredun, said “Through meetings we have been fortunate to meet many of Orkney’s livestock farmers, who are well known for their high quality beef production and we are delighted to be developing a closer working collaboration with OLA, which will be of huge benefit to both of our organisations.”OLA is a sub-group of HiHealth Herdcare which is a national cattle health scheme.

Unlike student nurses and midwives, however, those training to be a paramedic are not eligible for a bursary, despite being unable to take up part time work.  To add insult to injury, their counterparts in England do receive bursaries.“This lack of a level playing field risks putting off those we need to see coming into our health service.  The current arrangements do little to encourage young people to pursue a career as a paramedic and store up problems for the future.“When I wrote to the Health Secretary recently on behalf of a constituent, I was told the government has no plans to review the funding options for trainee paramedics. Today, Nicola Sturgeon said she would look into the matter, having also been approached by a young constituent, angry at the unequal treatment.“The First Minister needs to recognise that introducing a bursary scheme would make a real dference, not least in widening access to the profession.  It’s time the Scottish Government properly recognised the dedication of our trainee paramedics by putting them on the same footing as trainee nurses and midwives.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

On the Pentland Firth, people are still being forced to pay over the odds.“COVID has inevitably created challenges, but even prior to the pandemic there seemed to be little urgency from the Scottish Government to deliver on its promise. Assurances that Ministers will now ‘pick up the ball again’ are likely to ring hollow with islanders who just want a date for cheaper fares to be introduced.“Meantime, Ministers could help soften the blow from the delayed introduction of RET by using the underspend to cut fares on Orkney’s internal ferry services.

Covid- test shortens the  day restricted movement requirement\" data-source\"Health Department\"It said: ldquoHealth Service Executiveguidance states that when someone is restricting their movements because they are a close contact of a confirmed case or because they have travelled into Ireland from a non-green list country, they must do so for  days.ldquoThe HSE guidance does not state that a negativeCovid- test shortens the  day restricted movement requirement.Following a request from Ms von der Leyen, Mr Hogan published a timeline of his movements in Ireland in which he revealed he played golf in Adare, Co Limerick, before ing to Kilkenny on August .Another  cases of Covid- have been confirmed in Ireland, the Health Department said.Police are investigating whether coronavirus regulations were broken in holding the Irish Parliamentrsquos golf society event two days after the Government announced it intended to curb the numbers permitted to gather together.The trade and former agriculture commissioner has also been urged to consider his position by the leaders of the Republicrsquos coalition Government, Mr Martin and Mr Varadkar, after attending the dinner at a hotel in Clden along with a number of other senior politicians and public figures.The row has prompted more resignations in a new Government which has struggled to find its feet amid the pandemic.Large social gatherings are discouraged in the country to hamper spread of the virus.Pressure has been building on Mr Hogan to step down from his EU role.In his latest statement, he said: ldquoAt the outset I fully accept that it is abundantly clear that the event should not have been held and that I should not have attended this dinner.ldquoI accept this and have made a full apology to the Irish people for having done so.ldquoI was an invited guest to the event on August   and was assured by the organisers and the hotel that it was being held in full compliance with all relevant Covid- rules.ldquoI had no reason to question or doubt that assurance, particularly in circumstances where an Irish Government Minister was attending and speaking at the event.ldquoAgain I now recognise that the event should not have proceeded and I should not have attended.Mr Martin, Mr Varadkar and the leader of minority coalition partner the Greens said concerns remained and breaches of public health guidelines were made by Mr Hogan since he travelled to Ireland.They said: ldquoHe should also have limited his movements to and from Kildare for essential travel only and he should not have attended the Oireachtas Golf Society dinner.The leaders said people were correctly angered, given the sacrices so many have made to adhere to public health guidance.ldquoIn addition, his delayed and hesitant release of information has undermined public confidence.They said they awaited the outcome of the President of the Commissionrsquos review.ldquoUltimately the commissioner is accountable to the EU Commission, not to the Irish government or to the Oireachtas.copy -.

But what of other aspects What of community resilience, something I suspect will barely register as a priority for most us when deciding on our weekly shop It may be the case that more people will try and grow more of their own food and local produce will, hopefully, be in greater demand.All very welcome. But what’s really needed is a completely fresh approach to our behaviour as consumers.As the pound in our pocket becomes ever more stretched we need to value it in terms of what benefit it can bring to the wider collective # who can it support, what should it support and how can that can bring about greater resilience within our own communities.It’s not radical or revolutionary. It’s just about taking a bit more time and effort to think about where best to spend our cash, especially when it comes to our most basic of needs.It can’t possibly make sense to get your Sunday roast from the supermarketthe same cut of meat is available at your local butcher at a comparable price . And especiallythat butcher has sourced his meat from the crofter down the road.It takes a bit of extra effort to call in at the butcher, for sure, but add in important elements like food miles and provenance and there really is no excuse, except for our own inherent laziness.It has always amazed me how there is any fish at all on the shelves of supermarkets in this part of the world when the local fishmongers offer far higher quality at a lower price.And, in any case, it’s now perfectly possible to buy direct from the fisherman, with many of them now offering sales to the public.That may have come about through the closure of their overseas markets during lockdown, but what better example of necessity being the mother of invention.If west-coast prawns were coveted by sophisticated palates on the Mediterranean, then they should be more than adequate for consumption a bit closer to home.It’s not that long ago that our communities were completely self-reliant in food.We do demand a more discerning choice these days # no-one would want toto a diet made up entirely of fish, mutton and potatoes.But, with an abundance of quality produce on our own doorstep, surely it makes sense to take more advantage of that and in the process create greater community resilience through sourcing from independent, local retailers.If there’s a downside to that approach, I fail to see it.ONE aspect that looks certain to change, certainly for the foreseeable, is that there will be less air travel.Through the lockdown it is estimated that carbon emissions have been reduced by over  per cent by planes being grounded alone.That’s not even taking account of reductions in car journeys and it is a staggering figure from just one simple change.There are certain elements in the environmental lobby who would have you believe that methane emissions from cattle make a signicant contribution to climate change.Never mind that bovineshave roamed the land for thousands of years without causing much harm.Never mind that it’s only the last  or  years, as our economy became ever reliant on fossil fuels, that the damage to our planet has been made.The reduction in air travel will be for economic, more than environmental, reasons.But the staggering statistics of these last few months should at least mean that when it comes to a real determination in tackling environmental damage the finger of blame will be pointed in the right direction.Then again, maybe cows are a much easier target."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image.jpg","title":"royal celtic societys unique music","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineWork has begun on processing the twenty entries received for a unique competition which set the country’s musicians the challenge of creating a new shinty composition.

Kerry McWilliams, the founder of Lightwork NI, a charity that has provided more than  sessions of direct support to families over the past two months, said the crossover between school and family le was a major issue for many of the people she has worked with throughout the pandemic. Kerry said they have found that while children were largely able to keep in touch with the outside world and their peers through the likes of social media, many were uncomfortable being taught by their parents. And she said the stresses experienced by some groups of parents, such as key workers or those who had lost their income, made it more dficult for adults to support their children effectively. Home schooling was a cause of signicant conflict and distress, she said. Parents told us they found it very dficult to get children to do the work children told us they were afraid of being found out.One nine-year-old boy told me, #I don#t want to do school work with my parents because they think I#m really smart and they#re going to find out I#m not - I get good marks because I cheat and copy and when they see I can#t do the work they#re going to know#. This was a common fear for children - a sense of discomfort as school invaded their homes and family relationships. Most children like to keep school and home separate. Parents felt exposed and vulnerable as they were unable to understand or support their children#s learning.Many couldn#t access ICT equipment or provide internet access for multiple children and this led to frustration. She continued: We have lived through a global pandemic, a moment in history unprecedented in modern society. Families I have worked with have all moved through paralysing fear, powerlessness and panic. They have taken a fresh look at what makes them happy, what is worth fighting for - we all realised it#s not toilet roll - and how far they have sleepwalked into a le they wouldn#t have consciously chosen, and don#t really want to go back to. I believe the legacy and consequences of lockdown will be signicant for everyone both in the immediate future and for many years to come.She said there are a number of steps parents can take in the coming weeks and months to ensure their children cope with theto school, including drawing upon the relationships that were built during lockdown and ensuring children#s voices are heard. She also recommended putting in place routines and precautions to ensure everyone feels safe: Then you can stop worrying. Our worries communicate to children - when you feel confident and optimistic, they will too.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappPupils from Bloomfield Collegiate in Belfast wearing face coverings. Gareth Cross and Catherine DevineAugust   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailEducation Minister Peter Weir has announced that face coverings should be worn in the corridors and communal areas of post-primary schools in Northern Ireland. Mr Weir said the guidance to schools would be updated and the change would come into effect from August  when all pupilsto school on a full-time basis.The DUP MLA said he had taken the decision after advice from Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride and the Chief Scientic Adviser Professor Ian Young. I am recommending that pupils and teachers wear a face covering in corridors and other communal areas of post-primary schools from next week when schoolsfull-time. This updates the existing guidance on the use of face coverings in educational settings, Mr Weir said. The Education Minister said the current public health advice is that the use of face coverings provides some benefits.He said he would continue to recommend that all pupils wear a face covering on all dedicated school transport including buses and taxis where it is appropriate for them to do so.“In relation to communal areas in schools, the guidance already strongly encourages face coverings for activities that entail large numbers of staff or pupils within an enclosed space where social distancing is not possible, Mr Weir said.“Given the risk mitigations in place in schools to limit and contain the spread of Covid-, face coverings are not recommended as being compulsory for routine use in education settings. However, staff and pupils may wish to use them during the routine school day and this is acceptable. Schools should also be aware that some personsare exempt from wearing face coverings.“I will continue to keep all guidance in respect of education settings under review in light of the latest medical and scientic advice. el.async  trueel.src  https:belfasttelegraph.bbvms p twocol_article c .js dart_art_IDdart_articleIddart_kw%B%Coronavirus%%C%Northern%%C%Ireland%%C%Education%%C%Minister%%C%announces%%C%secondary%%C%school%%C%pupils%%C%should%%C%wear%%C%face%%C%coverings%%C%in%%C%corridors%%Ddart_gs_channelsgv_safe_adult%Cgv_safe_arms%Cgv_safe_crime%Cgv_safe_download%Cgv_safe_drugs%Cgv_safe_hatespeech%Cgv_safe_military%Cgv_safe_obscenity%Cgv_safe_terrorism%Cgv_safe_tobacco%Cgs_health%Cgs_health_misc%Cgs_education%Cgs_education_misc%Cgs_politics%Cgv_death_injury%Cgv_processeddart_sectionnews_health_coronavirusdfp_adunit_lbelfasttelegraphdfp_adunit_lNewsdfp_adunit_lHealthdfp_adunit_lCoronavirusdocument.getElementByIdChildIt comes after Health Minister Robin Swann said Northern Ireland is still walking a tightrope in dealing with Covid- after two clusters were confirmed in Craigavon Area Hospital.

Guidelines were very clear. It goes against public health advice.” He called for further resignations from all political representatives who attended the event.Read MoreEilis O’Hanlon:Opinion Sinn Fein shows no shame in demanding resignations after Irish government golf row His comments come less than two months after Sinn Fein vice-president Michelle O’Neill and Finance Minister Conor Murphy were criticised over claims they breached coronavirus guidelines at the funeral of veteran IRA man Bobby Storey.Speaking to RTE, Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald said the Irish government “has descended into new levels of chaos”. But when asked about party members who came under criticism for attending Mr Storey’s funeral in June, Ms McDonald said she does not think there is an equivalence between a funeral and a “golfing shindig”.Earlier, DUP MP Carla Lockhart said Mr Cullinane’s comments show that Sinn Fein is “certainly a partitionist party when it comes to irony”.“Sinn Fein’s demands on Irish government ministers to resign for breach of Covid- guidelines begs the question why two dferent standards by the same party in two dferent countries  If ministers who breach the rules must resign there why not here ” she added. “True to form, Sinn Fein brazenly ignored the public outcry at the double standards and demands for resignations.”TUV leader Jim Allister said: “Northern Ireland has been reminded by Mr Cullinane that when it comes to his party it is a case of do as we say not as we do.”Former Fine Gael MEP and Alliance leader John Cushnahan said Sinn Fein has “no right whatsoever” to condemn those politicians who attended the golf dinner.SDLP MLA Colin McGrath questioned whether David Cullinane’s comments represent a Sinn Fein policy that “doesn’t apply across the border”.Dara Calleary’s resignation comes just  days into his role as Agriculture Minister, a position to which he was appointed to after Taoiseach Micheal Martin sacked his predecessor Barry Cowen amid controversy over a drink-driving offence.Last night Ireland’s acting chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn said it is “very clear” that the event held in Galway was not in line with public health guidance.Current guidelines state that no more than  people should gather indoors in the Republic.Dr Glynn said: “There’s a very justiable and understandable anger in Ireland today. It’s not misplaced.”Speaking to RTE, Taoiseach Micheal Martin denied his leadership had been damaged.He said the Mr Calleary had paid a “terrible price” but had done the right thing in resigning.Ireland’s Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said what happened was “wrong an inexcusable”.He added: “There are people all over this country who have made huge sacrices and who continue to make huge sacrices and at a minimum, the Irish people need to see those rules followed by members of the Oireachtas.”Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland c .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fee-fbf-aa--dbbd_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland c .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fee-fbf-aa--dbbd_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland c .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fee-fbf-aa--dbbd_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland c .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fee-fbf-aa--dbbd_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland c .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fee-fbf-aa--dbbd_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Republic of IrelandIrish agriculture minister resigns after attending golf eventIrish Agriculture Minister Dara Calleary has resigned after attending an indoor golf society event with  other people.News PremiumBobby Storey funeral: Unionists aim to keep pressure on Sinn Fein#s Michelle O#NeillUnionists are aiming to keep pressure on Sinn Fein over the funeral of Bobby Storey more than a month after the row began.GalleryCoronavirusConfusion over Executive rules on foreign trips as MLA cancels holiday to Italy after backlashStormont has been thrown into confusion over its Covid- holiday rules after an MLA sparked controversy by saying she#d be taking a family break to Italy - only to cancel it after she came in for criticism.Northern IrelandSinn Fein abused society with funeral attendance – BeattieSinn Fein leaders abused wider society in Northern Ireland by flouting coronavirus rules at Bobby Storey’s funeral, the Assembly has been told.Most ReadIncident in which NI restaurant turned away ambulance worker because of Covid risk #regrettable#, says hospitality chiefSix remanded in custody as lawyers claim involvement of #agent provocateur# in New IRA probe Ciaran BarnesOpinionBig mouths brought New IRA to its kneesSupplier to Wrightbus goes bust with loss of  jobsSea crash tragedy siblings found clinging to each other, mourners told,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

At the moment people cannot even apply for a test, she said. I understand some of those young people have been told it could be next year before they will be able to take a driving test.It has also revealed that learner drivers who were due to sit a driving test in Craigavon are being sent to Armagh and Lisburn instead.This situation is untenable and places local motorists at a distinct disadvantage, said Upper Bann MP Carla Lockhart.A Department for Infrastructure spokesperson said: The DVA has worked hard to restore services and communicate the facts to all customers. It is vitally important that health and safety is put first while working to minimise disruption.On July  the minister announced that the DVA is planning to resume some practical car and lorry driving tests from September . The DVA holds the contact details of around , driving test candidates who are either key workers, or who had a test booked and cancelled in late March to the end of June. When driver testing resumes around  key workers will be tested first.The DVA estimates it will take six to eight weeks to clear the backlog. A further update will be provided to advise when it is opening its booking system for all new customers.

Search and rescue were there, we all came and went freely, we were comforted in there, all the ladies from the community - food and water in abundance. That was quite special, she said.

Sinn Feacutein’s Karen Mullan has voiced her ‘disappointment and concern’ at the ‘unwillingness’ of Robin Swann to provide essential funding to keep Derry’s Community Crisis Intervention Servicerunning. While the SDLP’s Mark H Durkan said like everything asked for in the North West it has become a ‘whole battle’. He described the service as a ‘huge success’ which has been a literal ‘leline’ to many. Bereaved local families, activists and organisations campaigned for a service of this kind for years. googletag.cmd.push CCIS provides a ‘safe space’ for those in crisis from pm on Thursdays until am on Sundays when many other services are not operational. It is run by Extern NI from the Holywell Building on Bishop Street. People experiencing a mental health crisis are referred to the service by the PSNI and Foyle Search  Rescue or attend of their own volition. Iniduals receive immediate support forgoing the need to attend a busy hospital Emergency Department. They are also directed to additional support servicesnecessary. An independent Ulster University report found the service to be cost-effective. Figures released by the Western Trust demonstrate the need for enhanced mental health provision in the city. googletag.cmd.push At the end of June  people were waiting more than nine weeks to access adult mental health services. There were  young people waiting more than nine weeks to access child and adolescent mental health services , as of June . Foyle Search  Rescue has also responded to many emergency incidents in recent months despite a period of lockdown. ‘UNTHINKABLE’ Karen Mullan said the minister has declined requests from her and party colleagues to meet to discuss the need to fund the CCIS and mental health services in the city. She added: “Derry City and the North West area a is being neglected by the Minister and his unwillingness to invest in mental health support services. “The Community Crisis Intervention Service is a service dealing with iniduals who are facing a crisis and need de-escalation. “This crisis can be due to a mental health episode or as a result of substance misuse. “All these issues fall firmly under the remit of the Department for Health and as such the minister. “Icallon Minister Swann to provide the funding for the Intervention service and investment in mental health provision in the City.” In June the health minister visited Derry where he announced pound, of additional funding to keep the service running for three months. Mark H Durkan said it is impossible to measure the positive impact it has had and he ‘shuddered’ to think about what could have happened without it. He continued: “We were able to convince the Minister to extend funding on an interim basis. “We have to remember that tackling the mental health crisis is an Executive priority so it’s not just one for the Department of Health. “They’ve made positive noises but that has to be backed by action and for me it is unthinkable that this service wouldn’t be funded moving forward.” The Foyle MLA said it is unacceptable for service users and hard-working staff to keep getting word of short extensions and that a permanent commitment must be made. A spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council acknowledged that the funding provided would allow for the temporary continuation of the service. However, councillors are of the view that the Department of Health and other government departments should consider a ‘long-term funding arrangement’. In response, a DoH spokesperson said: “The additional funding provided by the Department of Health enabled Derry Crisis Intervention Service to continue until the end of September . “Correspondence from Extern has been received today requesting additional funding to support the service until the end of March . This is currently being considered. If you feel in crisis and need support oryou have observed someone who is in distress and may come to signicant harm through self-harm and suicidal behaviour please call CCIS on:    If you need to speak to someone urgently, please call Leline on   , the Samaritans or attend your local Emergency Department.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The collapse of Stormont coupled with the Department of Health’s view that the school did not demonstrate ‘need and value for money’ led to delays. Finally, in May of this year Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill announced that it had been approved and would open in September . In an in-depth interview with Derry News reporter, Garrett Hargan, Professor Dubras speaks of her elation after discovering the long wait was over, about the hundreds of people who have expressed an interest to date and the wide-ranging benefits that training doctors locally will bring. googletag.cmd.push She also refutes any suggestion that the school will ever be relocated, talks about the prospect of health science courses moving to Magee to complement the medical school and new build projects in the pipeline which will enhance the learning experience for medical students in the city.  For readers who may not know, can you provide a brief background of your career path before taking on the role as Foundation Dean at the Magee Medical School  I’ve been a GP for a long time. My clinical background is that I worked in Southampton looking after homeless people for a long, long time. I was lead GP for a homeless service. googletag.cmd.push From a university perspective, I worked at the University of Southampton for quite a long time and had increasing roles in leadership and ended up running the medical degree programme. I went from there to King’s College in London where I was the Deputy Dean of Medical Education. We were doing a huge curriculum change in this very big medical school, one of the biggest schools in the country with about  students each year. So it was very sizeable and quite a challenge. Then I became the Interim Dean of Medical Education for nine months and then was ready for a new challenge and that’s when this job came up. I arrived in Derry in June . I was really excited about coming here because it was an opportunity to establish something new, obviously with a focus on General Practice. An opportunity to bring my own values to the school and my personal values which have kind of always been about social justice, access and community-based healthcare. It really aligned with the university’s plans. And that’s me in a nutshell. What are your thoughts on the city having lived here for two years now  It’s wonderful, I have felt so welcomed here. I was born and grew up in the Channel Islands, Jersey, and it’s a small community, coastal and I’m kind of used to being in a place where people know other people and I’m used to being somewhere that I can get to the sea. From that perspective I’ve loved it. But I’ve done things like joining Altnagelvin Hospital’s choir, I’m probably the worst member of the choir, but it’s just been lovely and a brilliant way to get to know people. I’ve started running, I joined Star Running Club. Everywhere I’ve gone I’ve been impressed by just how much of a welcoming place the city is. Why did approval for the medical school take so long  It took a little bit longer than I was expecting. But although the journey was a little bit longer and a bit lumpier than I had anticipated, it’s worth it. I think the outcome is a really great one. At this months Western Trust meeting a member of the board said the Department of Health put obstacles in the way. Is that true  No, I don’t think so. It’s been a very thorough process of working with the university to develop our outline business case. And I think the civil service have a responsibility to make sure that these things are robust. At the point where we submitted our final business case to them in October of last year I was confident it was well put together and robust. There was time required for them to consider that. And the Assembly was not in place which was an added dimension to the decision-making process because the civil service aren’t in a position to make that level of decision. So it took longer than any of us expected but with the benefit of hindsight, that was not wasted time. And the GMC process was ongoing in parallel anyway. They visited us in July last year and we did have to pause the process until such time as we had confirmation of student places. But once we resumed the process we were able to pick that up fairly quickly. A little bit longer but I wouldn’t say there was deliberate obstruction at all. How did you feel when it finally got over the line  Oh goodness, delighted. The announcement by the Deputy First Minister in May of our places was just so welcome and then the confirmation that we had by the end of June was equally, each step has been fantastic. But the one that made me feel most excited was the point where the GMC gave agreement that we could recruit staff and students. That was the most signicant for me when our external regulator said it was happy for us to progress. There is some fear in the city, which has been highlighted by local councillors, that the school could be moved given the history of courses being transferred to other campuses. Are there any guarantees that the medical school will not be moved to another campus  I don’t think there’s any question about that, Garrett. How many applications have you received so far for the course  They all go through UCAS and we don’t know how that is going until ious UCAS deadlines are passed. This morning we had the first of a series of webinars with people who are interested in studying with us. We had  people on this morning wanting to know about the programme. We’re running a test centre for The Graduate Medical School Admissions Testand we filled up our places within a week. There is a real interest in coming to study with us. Has a date been set for the GAMSAT  There are two opportunities, one is usually September and the other March. We became registered as a GAMSAT centre as soon as we got the go-ahead to recruit students. Because it’s an Australian company that runs GAMSAT, it’s the kind of gold standard for anyone going in to graduate entry medical school courses. Our September October sittings are full and they will release the dates for March and as soon as those are released people will be able to register. But in order to apply, people don’t have to have taken GAMSAT in those dates. There’s a two-year grace sosomeone did it in  they would still be eligible for our first round of applications. You’ve pointed out that it is not a post-graduate course or limited to people with medical qualications, but open to anyone with a : degree. What fields have applicants come from so far  The beauty of our programme is that we don’t limit it to people with bioscience backgrounds. My experience working with students on other GEMS courses and also the experience of our partner medical school, St George’s in London, is that there’s a real mix of prior backgrounds. You might have people coming in who’ve got Masters of even PhDs in biomedical related subjects but equally I’ve worked with people who’ve come in with degrees in music, who’ve been geography teachers, lawyers, and the interesting thing about graduate entry medicine is that we teach it students work in mixed groups so you’ll find you might have somebody with an English degree working with someone who has a Masters in mechanical engineering or a BSc in biomedical sciences and actually they all learn from each other and are all engaged in that journey. And the people who are non-bioscience in background learn fast and by the end of the first year they are all at the same level and all really benefited from that ersity in backgrounds. At this stage would you know anything about the geographical spread of applicants  We have a database of about  people who have been interested in following the programme and have probably been in contact with us for about three years. They’re fairly widely dispersed, quite a lot of them are from NI and spread out here. Some expressing interest from GB and other international students but there’s a limit to the number of international students any medical school can take. That’s set by the UK government because of the way clinical placements are funded and also going into the foundation programme to become fully registered with the GMC. There’s a cap on medical courses partly because of what it costs to train doctors but in addition to that it’s about the capacity of hospitals and general practices to take those students. We’ve got lots of interest but limited to what we can do internationally. What specic facilities do you need in order to provide the type of first-class course you envisage  We have a building identied for refurbishment. We will have students on campus for their first year and part of their second year. After that they’re largely out on clinical placements and coming back to campus for certain weeks, tutorials and so on. The estate plan is comprehensive to accommodate those students and we’ll be providing them with a range of resources rooms for learning anatomy, for learning clinical skills, communication skills as well as standard tutorial rooms. Do you have those in the current buildings at Magee  Absolutely. Is the aim to still have a new building along the riverfront   Absolutely yeah, we still intend to have our new building but we have the wherewithal and are ready for first intake on the campus.  Would the theory element of the course be taught there once it’s ready  That would be the expectation, yes. Is there any timeline that you’re aware of for that  As you know, the funding for that is within the City Deal process so there will be the standard contractual stuff that will go on. But we have space on the campus to not be pressured for time and ultimately our new build has to be right. It’s not like we’re going to have to move out within a particular timescale. Seventy students have been agreed to begin with a view to increasing that to . Are you confident it will be increased to  and in what timescale are you looking for that to happen  There are ongoing discussions with the Department for the Economy. In our business case we had a sense of how we want to grow year on year but we’re certainly happy to be delivering  doctors a year because that is a substantial addition to the Northern Ireland medical workforce. Does Ulster University have enough experience and expertise to supervise the medical school at council level  One hundred per cent, absolutely. You’ve heard us talk about the rigorous GMC quality assurance process and a lot of that process is about testing out with us, in a very robust way, a whole range of things that include senior level governance, support, commitment, resources so the GMC wouldn’t be permitting us to progressthey weren’t confident in the university’s ability to deliver this. Can you say anything about the plans for on-site teaching facilities at Altnagelvin that were mentioned at the recent Western Trust board meeting  We’re at an early stage of those conversations and obviously we’re working in a partnership with the Trust and we’ll be having conversations with them and with our colleagues at Queens University Belfast. So it’s early days yet with that. Were these plans included in a business case that has already been submitted  Oh yes, it’s costed. Absolutely. Was it with the department of health because a number of departments have said they have no knowledge of it  I can’t remember the details about which department, it was included in the capital requirements within the City Deal. Should health science coursesmove to Magee to complement the medical school and build upon that positive progress, and would you like to see them come  As you know there’s been a consultation on the future location of those courses which has been paused because we’re running a full equality impact assessment. So we’re aiming to resume that shortly. I think from an educational perspective, the more health professionals you are able to educate in the same place the better. Do you think the medical school approval will aid that case  I think it’s a signicant element. Are you confident it will happen and are you personally pushing for that move  It’s subject to consultation, Garrett, so I can’t pre-judge the outcome of a consultation. But you’ve read the consultation document so you know that that’s the university’s preferred outcome . What do you think about a cross-border university named in honour of John Hume that would link UU Magee, the Institute of Technology in Letterkenny  Sligo and North West Regional College   It has been proposed by the Irish government’s Higher Education minister, is that something you’d be supportive of  I think we have to recognise the impact of John Hume as a politician, peace maker and honorary graduate of the university. So John Hume had immense impact and I think we are very keen to work with the Hume Foundation to recognise his contribution in whatever way is most appropriate. And of course, as you know, his daughter is a GP locally so I think commitment to health and social justice are all things which align very much with my own personal values. We have a very strong working relationship with our colleagues at the Letterkenny Institute of Technology, with North West Regional College, so I think from my perspective, the university is going to continue to deepen those working relationships. Student numbers have dropped at Magee every year since. Does the university have to show that it is committed to the campus by delivering on long-promised expansion to , students  I think the mere fact that the university is committed to the school of medicine and training of doctors in the city is evidence of its commitment. Are you aware of a wider strategy to deliver on that promise  I don’t think there’s any doubt about the university’s commitment to the city, as I said, certainly in terms of training doctors, we’ve already talked about the university’s preferred outcome for the health sciences consultation so I think there’s absolutely no doubt about the university’s commitment. Id imagine you have a busy year ahead, what has to be done to ready the school for students in the coming months  As you can see from the university’s marketing material and my tweets and so on you’ll see that we’re actively marketing to recruit students. And we’ll continue that with webinars, we’ll be running the GAMSAT test in October, we aim to run our interviews in JanuaryFebruary of next year whether they are in person or virtual because of COVID. That will be us progressing student recruitment. Then there is staff recruitment which is due to go out in the next week or so. We have a recruitment strategy to get all of those people in post in time for the first students. There’s the building refurbishment, there’s procurement of our virtual learning environment and ious other bits and pieces. So, you’re right, there is plenty to keep us out of mischief. Looking to the future, what will the course bring to the city, and ultimately when these students are able to graduate, how much will that mean to local health care  My goodness, there are so many benefits. One is that we know from really good research over time thatyou train doctors locally they stay local. And will often choose general practice as a career. What it can do for the city first and foremost is, it will grow our health profession workforce. Second is, there is also a huge opportunity to improve morale amongst the workforce who are currently here because they can see real benefit in brining on the future. There’s nothing more exciting than actually working with medical students because they’re amazing people and you know that they’re going to make brilliant doctors. The third thing is that there’s a real opportunity to improve recruitment anyway, because people like to come to places that are involved in medical education. And another benefit is the fact that medical students don’t just stay in their university, they like to get involved with the local community through classes and societies, so they will often run resuscitation training courses for kids in schools, they might work with a range of community groups doing volunteering. So I think everywhere you turn you would see real benefits to the school the medicine and these students in the city.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The collapse of Stormont coupled with the Department of Health’s view that the school did not demonstrate ‘need and value for money’ led to delays. Finally, in May of this year Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill announced that it had been approved and would open in September . In an in-depth interview with Derry News reporter, Garrett Hargan, Professor Dubras speaks of her elation after discovering the long wait was over, about the hundreds of people who have expressed an interest to date and the wide-ranging benefits that training doctors locally will bring. googletag.cmd.push She also refutes any suggestion that the school will ever be relocated, talks about the prospect of health science courses moving to Magee to complement the medical school and new build projects in the pipeline which will enhance the learning experience for medical students in the city.  For readers who may not know, can you provide a brief background of your career path before taking on the role as Foundation Dean at the Magee Medical School  I’ve been a GP for a long time. My clinical background is that I worked in Southampton looking after homeless people for a long, long time. I was lead GP for a homeless service. googletag.cmd.push From a university perspective, I worked at the University of Southampton for quite a long time and had increasing roles in leadership and ended up running the medical degree programme. I went from there to King’s College in London where I was the Deputy Dean of Medical Education. We were doing a huge curriculum change in this very big medical school, one of the biggest schools in the country with about  students each year. So it was very sizeable and quite a challenge. Then I became the Interim Dean of Medical Education for nine months and then was ready for a new challenge and that’s when this job came up. I arrived in Derry in June . I was really excited about coming here because it was an opportunity to establish something new, obviously with a focus on General Practice. An opportunity to bring my own values to the school and my personal values which have kind of always been about social justice, access and community-based healthcare. It really aligned with the university’s plans. And that’s me in a nutshell. What are your thoughts on the city having lived here for two years now  It’s wonderful, I have felt so welcomed here. I was born and grew up in the Channel Islands, Jersey, and it’s a small community, coastal and I’m kind of used to being in a place where people know other people and I’m used to being somewhere that I can get to the sea. From that perspective I’ve loved it. But I’ve done things like joining Altnagelvin Hospital’s choir, I’m probably the worst member of the choir, but it’s just been lovely and a brilliant way to get to know people. I’ve started running, I joined Star Running Club. Everywhere I’ve gone I’ve been impressed by just how much of a welcoming place the city is. Why did approval for the medical school take so long  It took a little bit longer than I was expecting. But although the journey was a little bit longer and a bit lumpier than I had anticipated, it’s worth it. I think the outcome is a really great one. At this months Western Trust meeting a member of the board said the Department of Health put obstacles in the way. Is that true  No, I don’t think so. It’s been a very thorough process of working with the university to develop our outline business case. And I think the civil service have a responsibility to make sure that these things are robust. At the point where we submitted our final business case to them in October of last year I was confident it was well put together and robust. There was time required for them to consider that. And the Assembly was not in place which was an added dimension to the decision-making process because the civil service aren’t in a position to make that level of decision. So it took longer than any of us expected but with the benefit of hindsight, that was not wasted time. And the GMC process was ongoing in parallel anyway. They visited us in July last year and we did have to pause the process until such time as we had confirmation of student places. But once we resumed the process we were able to pick that up fairly quickly. A little bit longer but I wouldn’t say there was deliberate obstruction at all. How did you feel when it finally got over the line  Oh goodness, delighted. The announcement by the Deputy First Minister in May of our places was just so welcome and then the confirmation that we had by the end of June was equally, each step has been fantastic. But the one that made me feel most excited was the point where the GMC gave agreement that we could recruit staff and students. That was the most signicant for me when our external regulator said it was happy for us to progress. There is some fear in the city, which has been highlighted by local councillors, that the school could be moved given the history of courses being transferred to other campuses. Are there any guarantees that the medical school will not be moved to another campus  I don’t think there’s any question about that, Garrett. How many applications have you received so far for the course  They all go through UCAS and we don’t know how that is going until ious UCAS deadlines are passed. This morning we had the first of a series of webinars with people who are interested in studying with us. We had  people on this morning wanting to know about the programme. We’re running a test centre for The Graduate Medical School Admissions Testand we filled up our places within a week. There is a real interest in coming to study with us. Has a date been set for the GAMSAT  There are two opportunities, one is usually September and the other March. We became registered as a GAMSAT centre as soon as we got the go-ahead to recruit students. Because it’s an Australian company that runs GAMSAT, it’s the kind of gold standard for anyone going in to graduate entry medical school courses. Our September October sittings are full and they will release the dates for March and as soon as those are released people will be able to register. But in order to apply, people don’t have to have taken GAMSAT in those dates. There’s a two-year grace sosomeone did it in  they would still be eligible for our first round of applications. You’ve pointed out that it is not a post-graduate course or limited to people with medical qualications, but open to anyone with a : degree. What fields have applicants come from so far  The beauty of our programme is that we don’t limit it to people with bioscience backgrounds. My experience working with students on other GEMS courses and also the experience of our partner medical school, St George’s in London, is that there’s a real mix of prior backgrounds. You might have people coming in who’ve got Masters of even PhDs in biomedical related subjects but equally I’ve worked with people who’ve come in with degrees in music, who’ve been geography teachers, lawyers, and the interesting thing about graduate entry medicine is that we teach it students work in mixed groups so you’ll find you might have somebody with an English degree working with someone who has a Masters in mechanical engineering or a BSc in biomedical sciences and actually they all learn from each other and are all engaged in that journey. And the people who are non-bioscience in background learn fast and by the end of the first year they are all at the same level and all really benefited from that ersity in backgrounds. At this stage would you know anything about the geographical spread of applicants  We have a database of about  people who have been interested in following the programme and have probably been in contact with us for about three years. They’re fairly widely dispersed, quite a lot of them are from NI and spread out here. Some expressing interest from GB and other international students but there’s a limit to the number of international students any medical school can take. That’s set by the UK government because of the way clinical placements are funded and also going into the foundation programme to become fully registered with the GMC. There’s a cap on medical courses partly because of what it costs to train doctors but in addition to that it’s about the capacity of hospitals and general practices to take those students. We’ve got lots of interest but limited to what we can do internationally. What specic facilities do you need in order to provide the type of first-class course you envisage  We have a building identied for refurbishment. We will have students on campus for their first year and part of their second year. After that they’re largely out on clinical placements and coming back to campus for certain weeks, tutorials and so on. The estate plan is comprehensive to accommodate those students and we’ll be providing them with a range of resources rooms for learning anatomy, for learning clinical skills, communication skills as well as standard tutorial rooms. Do you have those in the current buildings at Magee  Absolutely. Is the aim to still have a new building along the riverfront   Absolutely yeah, we still intend to have our new building but we have the wherewithal and are ready for first intake on the campus.  Would the theory element of the course be taught there once it’s ready  That would be the expectation, yes. Is there any timeline that you’re aware of for that  As you know, the funding for that is within the City Deal process so there will be the standard contractual stuff that will go on. But we have space on the campus to not be pressured for time and ultimately our new build has to be right. It’s not like we’re going to have to move out within a particular timescale. Seventy students have been agreed to begin with a view to increasing that to . Are you confident it will be increased to  and in what timescale are you looking for that to happen  There are ongoing discussions with the Department for the Economy. In our business case we had a sense of how we want to grow year on year but we’re certainly happy to be delivering  doctors a year because that is a substantial addition to the Northern Ireland medical workforce. Does Ulster University have enough experience and expertise to supervise the medical school at council level  One hundred per cent, absolutely. You’ve heard us talk about the rigorous GMC quality assurance process and a lot of that process is about testing out with us, in a very robust way, a whole range of things that include senior level governance, support, commitment, resources so the GMC wouldn’t be permitting us to progressthey weren’t confident in the university’s ability to deliver this. Can you say anything about the plans for on-site teaching facilities at Altnagelvin that were mentioned at the recent Western Trust board meeting  We’re at an early stage of those conversations and obviously we’re working in a partnership with the Trust and we’ll be having conversations with them and with our colleagues at Queens University Belfast. So it’s early days yet with that. Were these plans included in a business case that has already been submitted  Oh yes, it’s costed. Absolutely. Was it with the department of health because a number of departments have said they have no knowledge of it  I can’t remember the details about which department, it was included in the capital requirements within the City Deal. Should health science coursesmove to Magee to complement the medical school and build upon that positive progress, and would you like to see them come  As you know there’s been a consultation on the future location of those courses which has been paused because we’re running a full equality impact assessment. So we’re aiming to resume that shortly. I think from an educational perspective, the more health professionals you are able to educate in the same place the better. Do you think the medical school approval will aid that case  I think it’s a signicant element. Are you confident it will happen and are you personally pushing for that move  It’s subject to consultation, Garrett, so I can’t pre-judge the outcome of a consultation. But you’ve read the consultation document so you know that that’s the university’s preferred outcome . What do you think about a cross-border university named in honour of John Hume that would link UU Magee, the Institute of Technology in Letterkenny  Sligo and North West Regional College   It has been proposed by the Irish government’s Higher Education minister, is that something you’d be supportive of  I think we have to recognise the impact of John Hume as a politician, peace maker and honorary graduate of the university. So John Hume had immense impact and I think we are very keen to work with the Hume Foundation to recognise his contribution in whatever way is most appropriate. And of course, as you know, his daughter is a GP locally so I think commitment to health and social justice are all things which align very much with my own personal values. We have a very strong working relationship with our colleagues at the Letterkenny Institute of Technology, with North West Regional College, so I think from my perspective, the university is going to continue to deepen those working relationships. Student numbers have dropped at Magee every year since. Does the university have to show that it is committed to the campus by delivering on long-promised expansion to , students  I think the mere fact that the university is committed to the school of medicine and training of doctors in the city is evidence of its commitment. Are you aware of a wider strategy to deliver on that promise  I don’t think there’s any doubt about the university’s commitment to the city, as I said, certainly in terms of training doctors, we’ve already talked about the university’s preferred outcome for the health sciences consultation so I think there’s absolutely no doubt about the university’s commitment. Id imagine you have a busy year ahead, what has to be done to ready the school for students in the coming months  As you can see from the university’s marketing material and my tweets and so on you’ll see that we’re actively marketing to recruit students. And we’ll continue that with webinars, we’ll be running the GAMSAT test in October, we aim to run our interviews in JanuaryFebruary of next year whether they are in person or virtual because of COVID. That will be us progressing student recruitment. Then there is staff recruitment which is due to go out in the next week or so. We have a recruitment strategy to get all of those people in post in time for the first students. There’s the building refurbishment, there’s procurement of our virtual learning environment and ious other bits and pieces. So, you’re right, there is plenty to keep us out of mischief. Looking to the future, what will the course bring to the city, and ultimately when these students are able to graduate, how much will that mean to local health care  My goodness, there are so many benefits. One is that we know from really good research over time thatyou train doctors locally they stay local. And will often choose general practice as a career. What it can do for the city first and foremost is, it will grow our health profession workforce. Second is, there is also a huge opportunity to improve morale amongst the workforce who are currently here because they can see real benefit in brining on the future. There’s nothing more exciting than actually working with medical students because they’re amazing people and you know that they’re going to make brilliant doctors. The third thing is that there’s a real opportunity to improve recruitment anyway, because people like to come to places that are involved in medical education. And another benefit is the fact that medical students don’t just stay in their university, they like to get involved with the local community through classes and societies, so they will often run resuscitation training courses for kids in schools, they might work with a range of community groups doing volunteering. So I think everywhere you turn you would see real benefits to the school the medicine and these students in the city.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Jeananne Craig worked in the English capital and Dublin for more than a decade, reporting on breaking news and showbiz red carpets.  But after the birth of her second child in , the Rosemount woman decided to relocate to the city where she grew up. “I had a great time in London and some amazing experiences there, but like many Derry people living away from home, I always missed it,” Jeananne said. “We moved to Derry a year and a half ago and are so happy to be here, particularly in the last six months, when having a bit more space and being close to family and nature has been so important.” googletag.cmd.push With a growing trend for people looking to leave built-up cities for quieter, more affordable locations post-lockdown, Jeananne decided to share her experience and that of other ‘city quitters’ in a podcast. All Change Please is co-hosted by Jeananne, who now works as a freelance journalist and copywriter, and her friend and fellow journalist, Jayne Cherrington-Cook, who left London for Kent. They release new episodes fortnightly and interviewees in series one include s music royalty-turned-designer Pearl Lowe, who moved from London to Somerset, Irish presenter and illustrator Maggie Molloy, and original Big Brother winner Craig Phillips, who reveals he once rented a room from the shows notorious Nasty Nick. googletag.cmd.push We cover all sorts of topics, from the practicalities of moving, to working from home and making friends somewhere new - and whether people have any regrets about leaving a big city, said Jeananne. Its all done remotely with Jayne in Kent, me in Derry and our guest joining from wherever theyre based. I actually have to record in my parents house, my own is too noisy with two young children running around and wanting to join in, said Jeananne who, plans to include some well-known local names soon.The logo for All Change Please was designed by local artist Bronach Crabtee, aka The Crafty Crab. The plan is to attract listeners considering a move, but I think our interviewees have such interesting stories to tell, it will make a good listen for anyone looking for a new podcast to enjoy, Jeananne added. The first two episodes of All Change Please are online now, with new episodes released fortnightly on a Thursday. The podcast is available on iTunes, Spoty and Acast, and is on Twitter @allchangepod https:podcasts.apple gb podcast all-change-please id  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Micky Doherty was presented with the Foyle Pride Mark Ashton Award for Outstanding Contribution to the LGBTQ+ community by the citys real Mayor, SDLP Councillor Brian Tierney, at a ceremony at the Holywell Trusts Garden of Remembrance on Saturday night. A spokesperson for Foyle Pride said Mr Doherty, who fronts the citys Pride parade each year, was a truly deserving winner who does so much, for not only the LGBTQ+ community, but also the wider city and district community. Mr Doherty is a tireless charity fundraiser and helped set up a special fund to help local people in need during the oronavirus crisis. googletag.cmd.push Im known in the local area as being a charity fundraiser-theres a charity fundraiser Ill host it, said Mr Doherty. Its just part of me that I like helping people. During lockdown I knew people had started to struggle and they were coming to me and I started to think about how I could help. Because I have been working with charities for a long time people put their trust in me. Mr Doherty was hosting a drive through bingo event last week when he got a phone call to say he had won the Foyle Pride award. I just burst out crying, he admitted. I really didnt expect it so I was just overwhelmed. googletag.cmd.push I just have so much gratitude for the award and for everyone who nominated me and I want to thank them all. Mr Doherty said he wished his late mum, Cathy, could have been there on Saturday to see him receive his award. Its hard to accept that my mammy couldnt be there, he said. Its just not the same without her but I am still filled with so much gratitude for it, he said. Derry LGBT+ campaigner, Suzanna Toland, who passed away earlier this year, was remembered at Saturdays ceremony. It was really nice to see Suzanna recognised for everything that she did, said Micky. She was a very special person.Before she passed away she had set up an LGBT+ disco at Rosie Joes so that people would have a safe place to socialise.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In family, business and community. Devastation and disbelief reached into every corner of County Derry last Friday afternoon, as the news of his sudden death filtered through. Everyone I spoke with over the weekend was just in shock. My thoughts are with his we Anne and the entire family, as they unite in grief. Rarely would you see Hugh without Anne. They went everywhere together. His family were never far behind. My sympathy also goes out to his daughter Maureen, son Carlus, son-in-law Benny, daughter-in-law Maria, his grandchildren Ollie, Leo, Fiadh and Lily Anna. Its not often you go to Owenbeg that you dont see them all there to take in a game, no matter who is playing. googletag.cmd.push Hugh Peter was well-known far from his own townland of Cloane. He was Managing Director of HA Mechanical Services, a company he started in  with his we Anne. Together, they grew the firm from six employees to over . When you think of a local community, the provision of local jobs is unquantiable. The parish of Ballinascreen and the surrounding areas have benefited greatly. In terms of an amateur sport, like GAA, one of the factors rarely mentioned is the importance of clubs not losing players forced to emigrate in search of work. This cant be done without stable employers, without people like Hugh McWilliams. googletag.cmd.push Then there is the sponsorship element. Hugh and Anne have been the Derry GAAs main sponsor since taking over at the end of the  season. They also sponsor the camogie and ladies football teams, while also backing the senior football and hurling leagues. Derrys statement last week was very apt, labelling Hugh as a giant of generosity and all at a time when the HA logo wasnt splashed across the national media like the big hitters of Dublin, Kerry and Kilkenny. Closer to home, HA are also in their fth year as Ballinascreens main sponsor, also across all four codes. Other examples of Hughs generosity went unnoticed, away from having a company brand associated with it. All the local schools benefited from his support, local mental health charity STEPS and St Vincent de Paul. The list could go on. Two years ago, to celebrate  years of HA, he held a family fun day at the local An Raacuteth Dubh Community Centre. From the moment you walked through the gate, everything was on Hughs tab...from the bouncy castles to the refreshments. They also organised a charity golf day and coffee morning, with all three events raising pound,. He bumped the total up himself, so both charities – Cancer Fund for Children and South Derry Downs Syndrome - were presented with cheques for poundk. For such a successful business man, he never forgot where he came from. He wasnt shy about putting something back. And all with modesty, far from any fanfare. One of the most enjoyable years of my le was the summer of , training the Derry minor team. A swing of Damien Reddingtons left boot may have snatched the All-Ireland minor title from our grasp, but I feel much richer for being involved with that group. We had some craic along the way - sailing up and down the M in the big yellow bus, with the tunes belting and the summer opening up in front of us. There was also a special bond with the supporters and parents. It was the first time I met Hugh Peter. He left Carlus to the bus one Saturday morning when we were Ballyshannon bound to play Roscommon in a challenge game. The Rossies had won the All-Ireland the previous year and Hugh was asking how long I thought the Derry minors summer would last. We hadnt a clue. It was one eventful step at a time. Fast forward to September and as I got off the bus and trudged through the lobby of Dublins Crown Plaza after the All-Ireland final heartbreak, Hugh came forward to shake my hand. Defeat was gurgling in the pit of both our stomachs. I cant remember exactly what he said, but, he was thanking us, while relaying how much his son had enjoyed the journey. Years later when John Francis Bradley, who also played on the same minor team, was seriously injured in a car crash and fighting for his le. Ballinascreen club, with Hugh McWilliams at the forefront, arranged a Night for JF. Screen club was packed. You couldnt have turned a sweet in your mouth. In hospital that night, John Francis spoke for the first time since his accident. The next morning Hugh delivered the many items from the auction to the Bradley family and gave him a pathway back into work. The club later handed over the money donated on the night. Another example of giving. You could write a book. A few months after that All-Ireland minor final, Hugh arranged for a gathering of the squad at the Hogan Stand Bar in Moneyneena. There was music, a buffet, craic and Hugh was in his element. It was like closure on the season. I always enjoy calling into the Hogan Stand and the owner, Tempo man Charlie McNally, claims his porter is the best around. If Hugh was there, he would always send a pint down my direction, like he did for many others. He would never accept one back, but would merely invite you into a football debate with him and Pele, his close friend John Scullion. Hugh would love it. The topic was usually - Screen, Slaughtneil, the Derry championship, the county scene and back to Screen again. Often there would be agreement, sometimes there wasnt and the slagging would begin before theydto chatting with their wives Anne and Mary G. The four of them were so close. Tuesday was no doubt tough day for everyone in the McWilliams family circle, in Ballinascreen and beyond as they said their final goodbye. Hugh often coined the phrase its not about being here for a long time, its about being here for a good time. He always had time for a smile, time for a chat and enjoyed le to the full. He will be sadly missed by his family and friends. I count myself lucky to have known him.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Declan Devine has insisted that his players are ready as the clock ticks down towards this evenings Europa League tie with FK Riteriai in Vilnius. The Candystripes boss and his squad left Derry yesterday and flew directly to Lithuania where they have put in place their final preparations for this evening’s game against the Knights, with victory meaning over pound, to the club. City got back to winning ways at the weekend with a deserved - win over Cork City at the Brandywell, a victory which came at the exact right time for Devine and his team who have struggled since football resumed last month. googletag.cmd.push Devine was part of the City management team which flourished on the continent in  against IFK Gothenburg, Gretna and Paris St. Germain and knows full well the joy of winning at the highest level. “Its one of the highlights of your season and something that you reflect back on,” he said. “Some of the European ties Ive been involved in, both with this club and other clubs, have been highlights and memories that live with you for a long time. When you reflect back you want to remember winning thats the ultimate one because you want to progress through a round. googletag.cmd.push “Our recent history, barring Aberystwyth, hasnt been great. Weve qualied which is a sense of achievement, but we have to try and strive to be better we have to get through a round or two and try and make sure its a regular occurrence that we are playing in these types of games.” Devine has dismissed any notion that FK Riteriai are there to be beaten on Tuesday, with the Lithuanians struggling badly in their domestic league. Riteriai have played  league games in A Lyga this season, and won just one game, losing  in the process. Yet Devine believes that their league performance is not a fair reflection of the quality within the team. “This is a tough game,” he said. “Ive watched a lot of them, they are technically very good footballers, but we are going out to try and win a game. We have to be at our very, very best, as everyone has to be in Europe. We cant afford an off night because the stakes are so high. We want to be in this competition for more than  minutes so its all about the performance on the night. “This season has been absolutely nuts. I’ve never seen anything like in in  years in football. Its not something that we really enjoy playing in front of empty stadiums, but its a game of football, its a -minute game that could potentially could go to  minutes and penalties. There are no excuses, we have got to perform on the night and Ive every confidence the boys can do that.”                                                                                    --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Benfica substitute Vata got down the wing and crossed and although Vaudequin headed clear, the ball came to Swedish international Jonas Thern, who took a touch before driving the ball across the face of goal and past Tim Dalton into the corner from  yards. googletag.cmd.push Just five minutes later Benfica doubled their lead. Paniera’s corner caused pandemonium in the City penalty area and although Aldair’s shot was blocked, the loose ball came to Ricardo, whose shot beat Dalton, only to be headed off the line by Kevin Brady. The referee’s assistant raised his flag and signalled that the ball had crossed the line and referee Guy Goethals awarded the goal. Derry City were now up against it but on  minutes the Brandywell was brought back to le. Liam Coyle’s through ball sent Felix Healy in behind the Benfica defence and his left-footed shot across goal beat Silvinho, only to bounce back off the base of the post. googletag.cmd.push Fortunately for Derry, the loose ball ran into the path of Paul Carlyle, who kept his composure to drill the ball into the vacant goal from  yards. The fans exploded into le. Derry City were back in the tie. For all their efforts though, McLaughlin’s team could not get the equaliser in the closing stages, but their showing against one of the strongest teams in Europe was not lost on their supporters, who gave them a standing ovation after the game.  August ,  Derry City , Lokomotiv Sofia  Felix Healy’s Derry City side were expected to be second best in their Cup Winners’ Cup tie against Lokomotiv Sofia, the full-timers from Bulgaria. Those fortunate to bag a ticket for the game were to witness a truly historic day at the Brandywell as Derry finally got their first European win as a League of Ireland team. . The only goal of the game came just before half time when Sofia goalkeeper Ruman Apostolev misjudged a cross from Harry McCourt and the ball flicked off the underside of the crossbar before being cleared. However, the linesman signalled that the ball had crossed the line, and much to the dismay of the visitors, the goal was awarded. McCourt’s goal proved to be enough and the final whistle brought memorable scenes at the Brandywell, with a whole generation of City fans seeing their team victorious in European competition for the first time.  August ,  Apoel Nicosia , Derry City  Just two days after facing Barcelona at the Brandywell, the Candy Stripes were in Cyprus for their UEFA Cup tie against Apoel Nicosia and it proved to be a signicant occasion as Derry City finally hit an away goal in a European tie. It had taken almost  years for the Brandywell club to achieve such a feat, with games against Cardf City, Benfica, Vitesse Arnhem, Lokomotiv Sofia and Maribor all drawing a blank. The right man in the right place proved to be none other than Gary Beckett, who scored on the stroke of half time to cancel out Wojciech Kowlczyk’s earlier effort. Nicosia went on to win the game - thanks to Stelios Okkarides’ second half strike, but the crucial away goal meant that Dermot Keely’s side were still in with a chance of progression ahead of the home tie at the Brandywell.  July ,  IFK Gothenburg , Derry City  The great result in the club’s history  Every Derry City fan will be able to say where they were and what they doing when news filtered through from Sweden that the Candy Stripes had beaten IFK Gothenburg on their own patch. For those lucky enough to be in attendance at the Ullevi Stadium, it was scarcely believable and tales of the celebrations which followed the final whistle became as legendary as Sean Hargan’s winning goal. The game was still in the balance until the th minute when Derry ventured forward and won a corner. In a moment never to be forgotten by the small number of Derry City fans in attendance, Kevin Deery floated a corner into the penalty area where Sean Hargan jumped highest to send the ball back across goal and into the net. It was an unstoppable header. With time running out, goalkeeper David Forde produced arguably his two best saves in a Derry City shirt, two world class saves in the space of a minute to keep Gothenburg at bay.  August ,  Gretna , Derry City  Another amazing result, another amazing night for Derry City as  Candystripes packed into Motherwell’s Fir Park to watch a demolition. It all went to plan for Gretna in the opening stages of the game and a nervy start from the Candy Stripes was punished when they fell behind as Ryan McGuffie scored after just eight minutes. Midway through the first half, things started to go wrong for the hosts as Derry City equalised, Darren Kelly meeting the ball with a firm header, sending it into the net to level the tie with a vital away goal. The teams remained level at half time, but Derry City were out again quickly, and in one of the most stunning halves in the club’s history, they blew Gretna away with an incredible display of attacking football. Two brilliant goals from Kevin Deery, including a blistering -yard free kick, put City in control but there was still ore to come. Derry took advantage of a stunned Gretna, Ciaran Martyn scoring two brilliant inidual goals, right in front of the City fans, who were in dreamland.  September ,  Derry City , Paris St. Germain  September  was a huge date in the history of Derry City Football Club as the mighty Paris St. Germain arrived at the Brandywell to great fanfare. The game itself produced another valiant performance from the Candy Stripes, as they showed respect, but no fear, to their glamourous opponents. Twice in the opening stages Killian Brennan came close, shooting just wide before sending a magnicent shot from  yards onto the crossbar. But as the game went on, the French side began to settle and Brennan had to be a hero at the other end as he cleared the ball off the line after Fabrice Pancrate’s header had beaten David Forde. Darren Kelly then cleared the ball off the line a second time as PSG took control and Derry were glad to survive until half time. Perhaps the game’s defining moment came just after the break when Kevin McHugh broke into the PSG penalty area and was brought down. Everyone in red and white screamed for a penalty but Slovakian referee Richard Havrilla said no. It wasn’t to be, but a - draw kept Derry in with a fighting chance ahead of the second leg in Paris.  July ,  Aberystwyth , Derry City  Derry City produced arguably their best performance of the  season, as they hit five in a Europeaan away game for the second time in  years. Leading - from the first leg, City showed no mercy. They cruised into a - lead within  minutes. Headed goals from Michael Duffy and Barry McNamee ended the tie as a contest but City were far from finished. A second half hat trick from Rory Patterson, the third of which was a cheeky penalty dinked down the middle, secured an outstanding - win on the night, and a - victory on aggregate. The score line was also the highest ever recorded for an Irish side in European football history.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Candystripes crashed out of the Europa League following a - loss after extra time in Vilnius, despite leading - through Joe Thomson’s goal early on. Devine believes that a poor defence and not going for the jugular when ahead so early on were the key factors in the defeat. “It was a real wasted opportunity tonight to progress from the qualying round,” he said. “The manner in which we conceded the goals was very disappointing but we were very wasteful also in front of goal. You can’t afford to give any team the goals we gave them tonight. It’s been something that’s happened in a few game already this season and something we have to address. googletag.cmd.push “Our management of the game wasn’t what it should have been, we should have been really going for the jugular and killing the game of in the early stages of the first half. We started the game really well but finished the first half really disappointed.” Devine believes the loss of both Walter Figueira and Jack Malone before the game had a signicant impact on the performance and result. “We were missing both Jack Malone and Walter Figueira who both picked up injuries in the last two days and they were huge losses to us, so we were down to the bare bones on terms of our squad,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “We’re absolutely gutted and disappointed for the effort that we put into the game but you can’t expect to concede the goals we conceded tonight and expect to qualy through a round of Europe. At the minute it’s very disappointing for everybody”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I am very proud that our incoming head boy, Cormac Savage, was at the forefront of this campaign and believe his contribution was pivotal in ensuring that the sense of injustice and unfairness felt by his peers was articulated in a forceful and timely manner.Mr McCann also welcomed confirmation that GCSE grades will be awarded as calculated by schools.ldquoTeachers were asked to exercise professional judgment and engaged in a robust process to ensure that pupil effort and attainment in the period from September  to the unexpected and unprecedented closing of schools in March was rewarded, he said. ldquoA great deal of time and energy was devoted to this task by the staff of St. Patrickrsquos Grammar to ensure that grades were awarded fairly and consistently.Down High principal Maud Perry, said after the initial publication of results last Thursday the school was celebrating its best ever A-Level achievements.ldquoThis was unsurprising, as this particular year group achieved the schoolrsquos best ever AS results last year, she said.ldquoThis was a very dferent year in so many ways, but Down High pupils continue to be among the best qualied of their generation and, beyond the curriculum, our pupils are enriched, socially confident and ready to take their place as leaders of the future in whatever fields they choose. Congratulations to all of the pupils on these fully deserved grades.Shimna Integrated College principal Kevin Lambe congratulated the schoolrsquos ldquowonderful A level students who weathered the storm of this unprecedented year.He said he was delighted that the vast majority of students had already been placed at their first choice of university before the restoration of the teacher assessed grades on Monday afternoon.Mr Lambe said that while there had been considerable controversy about the process of awarding grades this year, he paid tribute to the excellent guidance document CCEA provided and to the commitment and energy his staff brought to the grading process.ldquoI am quite sure that the moderation process was undertaken in good faith, but it caused dreadful damage and heartache across the country, he said. ldquoThe CCEA guidance was sound, the work of teachers was thoroughgoing, the teacher awarded grades were the right ones and I am absolutely delighted that they have been restored.Ballynahinchrsquos Assumption Grammar School said it was delighted with the government U-turn in awarding grades as the original process ldquocaused signicant emotional upheaval which affected students, parents and our staff.ldquoWe are fortunate in that over % of our A students had already accessed their chosen university or workplace and hope that now almost every girl has achieved their true potential and will be able to access a iety of career pathways. Assumption Girls set the highest of standards year on year and we are proud of our Year  Girls who excelled in every subject at every level, said a school statement.ldquoOur AS students now have a solid foundation of grades which will give them the confidence to believe in their own potential to achieve at the highest of levels as they enter A level. We wish our GCSE girls the best of luck for tomorrowrsquos results.Castlewellanrsquos St Malachyrsquos High School said it was pleased with Education Minister Peter Weirrsquos announcement that AS and A level students will receive their centre assessment grades or the grade awarded by the examining body, whichever is higher.ldquoWe continue to work hard in St Malachyrsquos in the best interests of all our young people, said a statement issued on Monday evening. We are all here in St Malachyrsquos to help and support our students in the best way we can. Congratulations on their wonderful achievements we wish them all the very best in the future.De La Salle High School principal Ciaran Maguire described the past academic year for students as ldquochallenging.He said students adhered to social distancing guidelines collecting their results last Thursday, with the school delighted with their overall grades.ldquoA-Level results across the province has been one of confusion and uncertainty, said Mr Maguire.ldquoWe as a school were relieved that the majority of the teacher assessment grades were secured for our pupils and will continue to appeal and challenge those that need to be addressed to ensure that all pupils get the right outcome, allowing them to progress in an ever changing world.Before Mondayrsquos announcement, Mr Mark Morgan, principal at St Colmanrsquos High and Sixth Form College in Ballynahinch, said the continued year on year improvement in grades from the students appeared to have been curtailed by the examination bodies.He said teacher predicted grades, which were in line with all the tracking data, appeared to have been totally ignored and grades were given that bore no reflection to the historic and contemporaneous standard attained by students at the school.St Maryrsquos High School in Downpatrick congratulated its A-Level and AS-Level students who received their results.The school said the studentsrsquo success was a ldquoreflection of their hard work, determination to succeed and dedicated teaching staff who always go the extra mile.ldquoOur steady, upward trend in examination results has continued this year and we wish our students all the very best as they begin their studies at university, the statement added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th August 2020 53.jpg","title":"53 dogs put down in past year – one third of all in NI  ","story":"A LOCAL politician says she is ldquoheartbroken that more dogs being put to sleep in Newry, Mourne and Down than any other council area in Northern Ireland.Fty-three dogs were destroyed in Newry, Mourne and Down in - out of a total of  for the whole province.Thatrsquos almost twice as many as the next highest area, which is Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon with .By contrast six councils reported single figure death rates, while not a single dog was put to sleep in Ards and North Down.Rowallane area councillor Kathryn Owen says the figure for Newry, Mourne and Down makes for ldquogrim reading.Cllr Owen, who has four dogs, says the council should look to the successful measures being implemented in other council areas.ldquoTo say Irsquom heartbroken about the immense number of dogs destroyed in Newry, Mourne and Down District would be an understatement, she said.ldquoThis is not a statistic that we should be proud of.

The Minister cannot allow all this to simply be thrown away.Ms Armstrong said the local community previously stood together to save Exploris and would do so again.She added: ldquoI would urge anyone with concerns to make their voice heard and lodge their concerns and together we can save our local economy.It is believed that the poundm aquarium proposal for Belfast could create more than  full-time jobs and would be the biggest attraction of its kind on the island of Ireland, with city planners recommending that the new development should be given the green light.The firm behind it, reefLIVE, says around  to  jobs could be created during its construction, with  full-time posts created when it opens its doors, subject to securing planning approval.The aquarium would be a two-storey building, based across more than , sq ft and include a cafe, coral reef ocean tank, with the main exhibition space across five zones on the first floor ndash themed as Ireland, Deep Ocean, Azores, Pacic and Arctic.Around  representations were received in relation to the planning application, including  letters of objection.Concerns included the impact to traffic and travel, the impact on heritage for both listed buildings and monuments, flooding and the potential negative impact on the Exploris aquarium in Portaferry.Those behind the planned tourist attraction say it is anticipated the reefLIVE Aquarium will be the largest marine-le visitor attraction on the island of Ireland and in bringing another international-standard attraction to the Titanic Quarter, would help to boost theof tourist visits to the city.In recommending the scheme for approval, Belfast City Council planners said that ldquohaving regard to the development plan and other material considerations, including the issues raised by the representation, the proposal is considered and approval of planning permission is recommended with delegated authority given to the director of planning and building control to finalise the wording of conditions subject to no new substantive planning issues being raised by third parties..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th August 2020 Celebrations.jpg","title":"Celebrations to mark the end of WW2  ","story":"CHURCH bells rang out across Killyleagh on Saturday morning to mark the th anniversary of VJ Day.The bells of St Johnrsquos Church of Ireland were tolled as part of the UK-wide commemorations of the anniversary.The day when the Second World War finally ended was celebrated with a short interdenominational act of remembrance at the War Memorial.At am former Army chaplain Hector Wanliss gave a ure reading and led prayers of thanksgiving for the men of Killyleagh, Shrigley and district who went to war, and for peace.Then Last Post and Reveille were sounded by Ronnie Cromie and Wilmer Cromie before two minutesrsquo silence was observed and Binyonrsquos Lines were recited by Billy Croskery, the chairman of Killyleagh and Killinchy Royal British Legion.A wreath was then laid by Mr Croskery, who was escorted by Kevin Kelly.Sadly Killyleaghrsquos last remaining Second World War veteran, Martin `Tinarsquo Charters, who is aged , was not able to take part on this occasion.Social distancing measures were in place and the organisers are grateful for those who attended adhering to these.It was a timely reminder that the main highlight of the year, the Killyleagh VE  celebrations, had to be cancelled in May by the Killyleagh Remembers the War group in the wake of the Coronavirus alert and the danger of public gatherings.The Killyleagh group has now cancelled its next proposed event, a lecture on the Second World War in the library due to be given by author George Busby on September .ldquoWe will be keeping under review the remaining schedule of the programme, in conjunction with the Heritage Lottery Fund.

Not only does dance allow kids to get their energy out, itrsquos also a great way for children to express themselves. Itrsquos never too early to encourage a love of physical activity in children.Briacuted is passionate about the benefits of dance for young children. ldquoDance is wonderful for coordination. It develops strength and endurance. Through dancing, a toddler will learn from the early age about what their bodies are capable of, she says.ldquo At the same time, it will build their curiosity as naturally they will experiment with certain movements. If toddlers have been introduced to dancing since early age, the chance of them developing good kinesthetic memory is increased.ldquoDuring class we work on key skills such as counting and sequencing thus subtlety engaging with numeracy and literacy. We incorporate sensory props such as ribbons, scarfs, feathers, bubbles and each dancer brings their own favourite toy to dance with. We introduce the foundations of Irish dance and enjoy watching a potential le long journey of dance begin.Following the Tapping Tots class, some  dancers attended the studio for an Irish dance camp with a dference.

This time Ardal McMahon provided the finish as they reached the water break.The RGU management team were left with plenty to ponder. Downpatrick continued to battle after the resumption, determined not to be hit by the threat of an avalanche of Rostrevor scores.At this stage there looked to be a real danger that Rostrevor would cut loose. To their credit, Downpatrick did not throw in the towel.Caolan Mooney burst through on the Downpatrick goal not long before half-time and a penalty was awardedwhen he was up-ended by goalkeeper Deeny. Shaun Parr stepped up and netted Rostrevorrsquos third goal.Downpatrick were given a glimmer of hope just before the interval when Parr and then Sean Cooper were black-carded.However at half-time, and the score at - to -, Downpatrickrsquos task looked onerous.The RGU came out with the right attitude to mount a revival in the second half and Doylersquos early minor reduced the gap.Chris Magee helped lead the Downpatrick forward linersquos continuing assaults on the Rostrevor goal with a couple of scores. And there emerged a real feeling of optimism amongst the massed Downpatrick ranks when Conor McGradyrsquos point left just two in it.However Rostrevor refused to hit the panic button. Guided by the experience of Mooney, they stretched their lead before the next water break.Downpatrick were awarded a penalty with the scoreboard reading - to -. However when Rostrevor needed a big moment at just the right time, goalkeeper Gareth Clarke provided it, plunging to push Tim Prenterrsquos effort to safety.That was the moment which really deflated Downpatrickrsquos resolve. You sensed that Rostrevor knew they had weathered the best that Downpatrick could summon in response to their deficit.Jordan Fegan then broke away in the closing minutes, before splitting the posts and taking Rostrevorrsquos score to -.Kane applied a classy coup de grace with the final score of the evening for the victors when he spun the Downpatrick defence and, bearing down on goal, took the safe option of landing the point.In the end it looked plain sailing on paper for Rostrevor. Certainly in terms of the opening they made to the match, catching the RGU cold, they laid the foundations early that kept many of the worries away that Downpatrick could spring a result on them.To Downpatrickrsquos credit, after that disappointing early start, there were more than enough signs there that the spirit within the camp to dig in and get themselves out of trouble in games is there.Downpatrick: James Deeny, Paddy Smith, Ronan Murphy, Eoin Rooney, Nathan McShane, Gerdie Collins, Conor Doherty, Damian Turley, Jonny Bell, Tim Prenter , Conor McGrady , Conor McCarron , Ruairi Quinn , Peter Turley , Chris Magee .Subs: Jarlath Brannigan , Morgan Fitzpatrick, Caolan Boyd, Damian Branf, Daniel McCarron, Garrett Trainor, Ruairi Og Quinn, Frank Starkey, Tom Savage, Tim Collins, Aidan McNeill, Con Farrell, Aidan Og Robinson.Rostrevor: Gareth Clarke, Jarlath Farrell, Tomas Gordon, Eoin Murdock, Nicky Murray, Colm Murney, James Donaghy, Sean Cooper, Caolan Mooney , Ardghal McMahon , Jordan Fegan , Patrick Magee, Conor Doyle , Shaun Parr, Piaras Kane .Subs: Paul McGrath, Richie Reynolds, Darren McElhinney, Conall Gordon, Eamon McConville.

I am so interested in how the legal world is changing and in particular looking at which laws we maintain and which we change coming out of the EU.ldquoCoupling law with French means that I can look at the international side of law and I am very much looking forward to learning more about both the British and French legal systems.ldquoIt is also very attractive to me to think about what the law should be from a moral perspective rather than just its application.Enyala by contrast was less sure of the direction she was going to take until she attended an Oxbridge conference in Swansea.ldquoThis was the first time I was introduced to material science she said. ldquoI really liked the structure of Oxfordrsquos course and the mixture of physics, chemistry and maths in the subject ndash it is very broad and follows on well from my EQP in nuclear energy.Both girls joined top school Cardf Sixth Form College on a  per cent scholarship from their local state school where they achieved  A*s each at GCSE.ldquoChanging schools has been a really good preparation for university le, Enyala said.ldquoIt has certainly made me more independent and aware of the world. When I joined Cardf Sixth Form I signed up for everything and particularly enjoyed playing music with some exceptionally talented musicians, taking part in badminton tournaments and performing in the drama productions.ldquoFor the first time Arianne and I have made separate friends, perhaps because we chose such dferent subjects.ldquoAs twins this is quite unusual as we are very alike in many ways but also have very dferent sides to our personalities.Arianne added: ldquoThe people were the best part of my school experience and everyone was really willing to learn and it was very easy to make friends.

a cheatit had been suitable.ldquoBack in  there were a few areas in Barry which were beginning to look a little tired, but it also came with a timeless charm that provided us with the perfect texture and feel that Dave and I had discussed.ldquoAdded to this was the welcome we were given by residents and, in particular, the support of the local council.ldquoPorthcawl was also a serious candidate for the backdrop to this show, but having scouted tirelessly the whole of Barry and Barry Island, I knew that this ticked every box.Mr Evans said Trinity Street was an instant favourite.ldquoI knew Gwenrsquos house was here, he said. ldquoThe terraced houses on a steep hill and its far-reaching views over to Barry Island and docks meant that no matter which direction the camera was pointing, there would be interesting textures and views.ldquoThe next objective was to get inside as many houses as possible to seeany worked for us as Gwenrsquos house.ldquoI letter dropped about  houses to gauge the interest.ldquoIrsquod heard that Matt Lucas was going to be involved so I used his name get to my foot in the door.ldquoThis usually helps.ldquoIn those days very few had heard of James Corden.ldquoI viewed and took pictures of about five houses on that street and Glendarsquos who was one of the first to contact me.ldquoThe decor and character of Glendarsquos house fitted my brief perfectly, but my first thought was that house was a little on the small side.ldquoTo get a film crew and the actors to work in such a tight space would be quite a challenge, butI could convince our director and designer that it could be achieved Gwenrsquos house was found.ldquoI took Dave and Christine along to Trinity Street and both fell in love with the location within minutes.Mr Evans continued: ldquoGlenda was so accommodating.ldquoI remember very well discussing with her the details of how filming on location works, how disruptive the whole process can be and also the location fee.ldquoWhat I do remember was her reaction when I mentioned the amount.ldquoGlendarsquos reply was: ldquoIrsquom so sorry Clive, but I donrsquot think I can cover that.ldquoGlenda thought that she needed to pay for the privilege of having us there and not the other way round.ldquoShe is a lovely lady and still loves being a part of the Gavin  Stacey world.During the locationsrsquo breakdown meeting, we discussed how Pam and Mickrsquos house might look in Billericay so homes were viewed in and around Llandaff and Sully until Dinas Powys was selected thanks to the welcome that was received.ldquoSt Cattwgrsquos Church at Llanmaes was not the first-choice wedding venue for Gavin and Stacey, Mr Evans said. ldquoThey were due to be married at St Nicholas Church at the village of St Nicholas, but a last-minute change of heart by the Church in Wales meant that we needed to find an alternative at the th hour.ldquoA friend and another locations manager called Chris Hill pulled in a favour and we were able to use St Cattwgrsquos.ldquoI dont recall any candidates other than Island Leisure .ldquoWhile filming on the front, Marco opening up early for the crew to be able to get a nice coffee as the weather was pretty unkind.ldquoWe didnt use the interior of the coffee shop as a location in series one, but as it was so cold when we filmed on the seafront the coffees were very welcome.ldquoWe also filmed at the Vale of Glamorgan Resort for the exterior of the wedding fair.ldquoThe interior was shot at the Copthorne Hotel at Culverhouse Cross.ldquoWhile at the Vale resort, the Wales rugby team came into the reception of the hotel.ldquoRuth Jones askedIrsquod be able to set up a photograph of the cast with the Welsh team.ldquoWe got them to agree so out there somewhere are pictures of the Gavin  Stacey cast with the Wales rugby team.ldquoUncle Brynrsquos house was only an exterior in series one so very little was involved in its search.ldquoQuiz night at the Colcot Arms was interesting.ldquoWe were close to completing our filming when the pub opened to the public - so the last few shots took a little while longer than wersquod planned.Mr Evans lives with his we Rhiannon and daughter Cerys Mim and runs his own Film and TV Facilities company.He added: ldquoThe actors usually donrsquot get to see the locations beforehand.ldquoThey are brought to set, run through a quick rehearsal then go for the real thing.ldquoThey then have to go through the whole thing over and over with the camera shooting from dferent angles.ldquoIt is a slow process and  hours on camera gives us around three minutes of footage.ldquoI get a real buzz from seeing locations that I have found on TV, but when it comes to Gavin  Stacey the story I always bring up is that while scouting in the very early days with the series producer in the car he askedI would consider reading for Dave.ldquoMy le could have been so dferent, but I have no regrets as no-one could have played it better than Steffan Rhodri.ldquoMy daughter Cerys Mim was born during filming and James Corden was the first to congratulate me when I ed to work on the show after her birth.ldquoHe joked about us naming her Nessa or Stacey.ldquoBarry and the Vale have always provided me with a fantastic hunting ground for film and TV locations.ldquoIts a huge contributor to South Wales becoming a hotspot for filming in the last decade or so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That is unfair. “I have raised this with the Minister and asked her to urgently review this decision and to quickly reinstate these test.I have requested a meeting with her so that the instructors can highlight their concerns.”Sinn Féin MLA John O’Dowd called for the opening of temporary driving test facility in Craigavon while the normal center is used for Covid  testing.Mr O’Dowd said: “While I welcome the commencement of Driving Tests across the North I have to express my disappoint they will not be recommencing in Craigavon. I understand the use of the current center for Covid  testing rules out this facility however other facilities could be used to keep tests in the Craigavon area.“I have written to Minister Mallon and asked for other options to be explored and another venue identied to allow learner drivers to complete their tests.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
