How has health been sold as a lifestyle choice?In 2017 I received an Arts Council England grant to complete research for my book Sanatorium. Writing a book was the only way I could think of funding a much-needed\u0026nbspvisit to a water-based physiotherapy rehabilitation programme, which was necessary to help symptoms caused by psoriatic arthritis and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. So I found myself in the sanatorium of my dreams: a thermal hydrotherapy centre on an island in the middle of the River Danube.\u0026nbspIt was a cold October when I made it to the island. There were bridges to the mainland, but I am not able to walk reliably for more than a few metres, and if I use my mobility scooter in the cold, my legs seize up quickly and become incredibly painful. As a result, I was almost completely isolated at the sanatorium. I only left the strange, insulated building when my mental health was suffering so much that the risk to my body began to feel worth it.Inside, the space was all about luxury. Every day I ate at a buffet piled high with what they called “wellness foods”. I became seduced by the colour and opulence of such lush, fresh fruits, until my collagen-deficient bowels reminded me why I am not a regular consumer of “healthy” fibres. (Wellness is a relative concept.)On my first day bathing in the eggy, sulphurous water – the sanatorium’s main healing attraction – I noticed the old-world glamour exuded by many of the elderly women around me. They wore full faces of waterproof makeup, diamond earrings and elegantly twisted turbans. Being young and broke, with my self-trimmed fringe and hormonal acne, it took me a while to work out the function of their performative leisure aesthetic. But after a few days of bathing, and a draining physio regime, I began to feel like I was dissolving putting on makeup became an important practice in reminding myself that I existed.As many of us remain indoors, I’d love to sell you this as the key to staying well in isolation. Make it fun! Do things to remind yourself that you exist and that you matter. Inject glamour and vivacity into your days, play chamber music during mealtimes. In other words, make prioritising your health and wellbeing a well-curated lifestyle choice!\u0026nbspThis isn’t too far away from what the multibillion-dollar wellness industry would like us to believe. Whether we are being told by Gwyneth Paltrow or Instagram influencers, the message is: you are the master of your own health! Choose wellness, not because you need to, but because it’ll make you feel great and look better. Wellness is an aesthetic shaped by primarily young, slender, white women in stylish leggings, usually standing in front of clifftops or inside gyms. It is an unnerving abundance of recipes for pancakes that are secretly made with bananas (#NomNom #CheatDay). It is a petite woman performing a handstand above the caption “Committed to nothing but love!”, in a photo tagging a sportswear brand and the yoga-cardio class available on her new app (link in bio, #namaste).It is a seductive illusion. Unlike the grandeur of the sanatorium, wellness is supposed to look effortless: anyone can have it if they are willing to make the right choices and dream big. Wellness appears so easily attainable that actual illness doesn’t always compute for those who encourage the idea that health, joy and spiritual gain are things you can buy.And while wellness booms, vital complementary health services are becoming less and less attainable. Where many European countries use inpatient hydrotherapy to treat rheumatic patients, almost all of the NHS hydrotherapy pools in London have closed. A pool at Guy’s Hospital remains open by renting its services to private patients at £70 a pop. The Budapest facility I attended, part of a group of health hotels, has survived by straddling this complex ide – simultaneously marketing itself as a health necessity and a lifestyle choice. Its vital and more intrusive medical services, such as underwater massage baths, painful muscle treatments, ice-cold cream packs for swollen joints, are screened off in cold, utilitarian back rooms, behind the layers of opulence.\u0026nbspThe sanatorium’s wealthier guests had the means to lean into the sense of luxury, transforming medical intervention into something akin to a cruise. They travelled across the world, meeting up with friends to “take the waters” in a host of healing locations. They didn’t have to juggle working or childcare. Although their conditions were – like mine – all forms of inflammatory arthritis, through retiring early and attending regular private treatment, they had managed to completely avoid use of the immunosuppressants, opiates and mobility equipment that I require to function. As we floated on our backs in the mineral-rich water, I noticed that many of the spa’s most glamorous inhabitants were fond of repeating a particular phrase: “I deserve this.”\u0026nbspI’m lucky enough, once, to have made it to the UK’s equivalent to the sanatorium, a rare inpatient physical rehabilitation programme provided by the NHS. Very few hospitals are able to offer such a service, and the waiting list is often years-long. (Right now, of course, they are all halted.) But unlike the sanatorium, NHS rehab is not glamorous. I shared a ward with 16 women. At night, people would wake each other up with cries of pain. Where the affluent women in the sanatorium talked about deserving their health, many people in the NHS system talked about deserving the more punishing aspects of their long-term conditions. They worried about the ways that they might have contributed to their illnesses: by not asking the doctor enough questions, working in physically demanding jobs, even, in more than one case, for having become pregnant before discovering that pregnancy could make their symptoms worse.During this pandemic, I’ve been thinking a lot about wellness and the nature of deserving. As NHS hospitals struggled to find enough beds and ventilation equipment, priorities were initially made using a frailty index: a numbered scorecard that determines your ability to function based partly on how far you can walk. The people who are less physically or mentally independent were more likely to be denied a bed. People like myself were valued less, in large part because we came loaded with fewer resources to begin with.\u0026nbspYou can see this even more starkly as the pandemic has progressed. In England and Wales, ethnicity is one of the strongest risk factors for coronavirus-related deaths, with black people four times more likely to die from Covid-19 than white people, and members of Indian, Bangladeshi and Pakistani communities dying at double the rate of their white neighbours. Presenting wellness as a “lifestyle choice”, in the face of so much structural inequality, perpetuates the dehumanisation of our most marginalised communities. And this is all the more insulting when you consider how often wellness culture’s hottest commodities – yoga, fasting, acupuncture, CBD treatments – have been appropriated, whitewashed and repackaged for profit.Medical professionals can be quick to dismiss the value of lives they do not understand. In appointments, I have learned to throw down my accomplishments quickly, before the doctor can send me out of the room with no treatment. Where I am successful, it is underscored by privilege: my cisgender whiteness, my class, my weight. Many of the chronically ill don’t come with this hand. Even before the pandemic, they had been used to the medical system giving up on them before they were given a chance.The difference between those of us who are able to treat feeling well as a lifestyle, and those for whom it feels unattainable, has never felt so marked. I spend a lot of time with chronically ill friends, brainstorming ideas to enable us to reach the healing spaces in which our bodies thrive: books, creative workshops, movies, academic projects. Sometimes this makes me laugh – the hustles we have to work in order to manage our needs. But it’s frustrating to know that my health can be so directly impacted by the amount of funding I am able to access in a given year, and the lack of sustainability in this practice (there are only so many books about a sanatorium you can write).Ideally, I’d attend something like the sanatorium once a year, to check in on how my body is moving, revisit and build on my daily physiotherapy routine, and tackle the ongoing spectre of chronic pain. My body doesn’t need organic juice deliveries or raw diets, just regular maintenance: a moment’s reprieve in the battle waged against itself.\u0026nbspBut for now I am here, in my London flat, in an inflatable bathtub. I straddle the line between brief spells of pretend sanatorium glamour (a washed face, a secondhand kaftan), and days and days of the same pyjamas, battling through an unsustainable freelance workload with chronic hand pain.Wellness is a seductive idea, because it suggests that we, personally, might be able to use our positivity and focus to chase away the spectre of death. It is scary and overwhelming to remember that our fate and health outcomes could be preordained by circumstances beyond our control. But the biggest lesson I’ve taken from my time researching and writing Sanatorium is that how your body responds to a crisis can depend on any number of external variables. And, to some degree, wellness is something you can buy. You may not be able to pay your way out of an incurable ailment, but staying healthy still comes with a price tag."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14d22b25519526c56a7abd37bc453552bc7fbb6a/0_350_5175_3105/master/5175.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6155a8722dbdbf5bd82ed926912be6d7","title":"shopper numbers surged 45 in week english shops reopened","story":"Shoppers flocked back to the high streets in England over the past week as non-essential stores reopened but numbers remained well down on a year earlier, according to the latest survey of retail footfall.Diane Wehrle, the insights director at Springboard, said: “The overall result for the UK was subdued by Scotland and Wales where retail reopening is yet to happen.“We anticipate an additional uplift to come when retail in these areas of the UK also reopens and the hospitality and entertainment industry is given the green light to resume trading in the coming weeks.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4bce472cf7134158b3ba2ee165fd122a0017f9f/0_93_3959_2377/master/3959.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0492c3e766473eef580772ae7a2e6c04","title":"pandemic zero coronavirus britain","story":"The summer gives us a chance to eliminate the virus and reopen the economy without pointless debates about 1 or 2 metre distancing measuresAs we see the return of the sunshine this week, and as the number of confirmed cases and deaths in the UK continues to fall, it can feel as if the worst of the pandemic is over.Far from relaxing, the government should be using this respite to make long-term plans on how to coexist with the virus until a vaccine can be found. Time is running out – when the cold and damp weather sets in, the virus will thrive. Test, trace and isolate schemes will be stretched as soon as flu symptoms rise and overlap with Covid-19 symptoms. Avoiding a second lockdown must be the imperative to ensure that the sacrifices made by the British public over the past 13 weeks do not go to waste.Currently the government’s drive to open up as quickly as possible bears a risk of another increase in infections, similar to what is being experienced in several US states such as Florida, Arizona and Texas, and in Iran. Ian Diamond, the UK’s national statistician, warned that the UK currently faces 3,000-4,000 new infections per day and only a fraction of those are being picked up through the test and protect scheme. By allowing the virus to spread during the summer months the government is creating a ticking time bomb that will go off as autumn arrives.Covid-19 is too dangerous to let spread through a population unchecked. Not only because of the difficulty of staying within health service capacity and overall mortality, but also because of the morbidity it entails. The FT has estimated that 65,000 excess deaths have occurred so far during the Covid-19 pandemic in the UK. In addition, an increasing number of long-term health complications are being seen in those who have recovered from the virus, and often in those who were healthy previously. Covid-19 is not the flu, but a multi-system disease that has surprised doctors in how it presents and how it develops within the human body. Important questions about immunity remain about whether re-infection is possible, or even immune enhancement where iniduals get a more severe version of the same virus upon repeated exposure, such as with dengue fever.That is not to say countries should remain in lockdown until a vaccine is discovered, given the economic and social costs. Instead, each country will need to find the “least worst” path out of this situation based on their populations, public health system and capacity. An increasing number of countries are trying to suppress the virus to a low level and, where possible, eliminate it before reopening their schools, shops and restaurants. Not only New Zealand, but also Australia, Thailand, Vietnam, the Faroe Islands, Iceland and countries in east Asia. Once the virus has all but disappeared, governments in these nations are able to identity imported cases – such as the two British travellers who reintroduced Covid-19 to New Zealand – and limit their spread. It is possible to both eliminate the virus and reopen economies – but it has to be done cautiously and with close monitoring.As an island, Great Britain is in a strong position to eliminate the virus and fully reopen schools, bars and theatres as well as bringing back sports matches and weddings, without pointless debates about 1 or 2 metre distancing measures. This would require mass testing – to catch all symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers – tracing of contacts and isolation for those iniduals. The public needs to be convinced that the short-term pain is worth it, including continued physical distancing from others, use of face masks when distancing is not possible, and putting aside short-term self-interest for a few more months. Local dashboards should be created using the first part of postcodes, so iniduals can understand transmission within their communities and ensure their behaviour contributes to a downwards push. Covid-19 will burn itself out if it has no other hosts to transmit it.A clear push towards a “zero coronavirus” Britain should have been the priority when the country went into late lockdown on 23 March. And while other countries raced ahead with testing and tracing, and border control, and face masks, the UK government seemed to think that locking down alone was the solution, instead of a window of extremely costly time to aggressively go after the virus and drive it out. As a Chinese colleague told me in early March, implement key public health measures now and you’ll be out of the woods by mid-June.The UK government has missed chance after chance to suppress this virus and reopen the economy as quickly as possible. The summer months offer it a narrow timeframe to reassess its overall strategy in managing this outbreak. It feels like decisions are being made based on polling to see how this affects government approval ratings, rather than based on what is needed to get through this crisis. Planning and leadership are required to look at where the country needs to be, then work back from that to implement the key measures to get there.

Each deals with kings in crisis, soul-searching in their own way, in highly charged but often ecstatically beautiful music.In the radio broadcast of Royal Opera House’s 2014 production, Polish baritone Mariusz Kwiecień was a fine King Roger in a signature role for him. This king is tipped into crisis by his encounter with a crazed Dionysian figure who arrives in the guise of a shepherd and to whose seductive, hedonistic sway Roger loses his queen, Roxana. As Roger, in isolation, is gradually able to see the light and discover the potency of self-determination, the listener is drawn deeper and deeper into Szymanowski’s radiantly luxuriant score. I hadn’t even planned to listen, but found I couldn’t turn it off.Giving Schoenberg’s massive cantata the operatic treatment was a daring first for Dutch National Opera, the inspired idea of conductor Marc Albrecht, strikingly realised by director Pierre Audi. The medieval legend of King Waldemar, his love for mistress Tove and the cruelty of his murderous queen is told in a sequence of poems by Jens Peter Jacobsen: the setting of Gurre castle is atmospheric, some of the characterisation challenging, yet far from illogical. Jacobsen was a botanist who translated Darwin’s On the Origin of Species into Danish, so nature’s redemptive power is implicit in the words, as is the passion. If the mere mention of Schoenberg is a frightener, think again. This is luscious late romanticism, albeit with glimpses of the composer’s future path.Embedded in the words of Mahler’s Das Lied von der Erde – translated from ancient Chinese poems – is the consoling certainty that, while man is mortal, the Earth and its song live on for ever. Today as man and climate change undermine that certainty, the music’s expressive power carries a further poignant force. In the ROH’s second livestreamed concert on 20 June (£4.99 to watch on demand), conducted by Antonio Pappano, the song-symphony was performed in the arrangement for chamber orchestra conceived in detail by Schoenberg and later completed by Rainer Riehn. The obvious version to use in the context of distancing, it highlighted the intimate relationship of the solo voices – tenor David Butt Philip and mezzo Sarah Connolly – with the instrumental soloists, all emerging with clarity and eloquently communicated. Connolly in particular sang from the heart.Compare and contrast this with Mahler’s original mega-score in Simon Rattle’s performance with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra from Aldeburgh in 2011, which can be heard on Radio 3 on Tuesday evening (and then on BBC Sounds for 30 days). For those wistful about the absence of this year’s Aldeburgh festival, these repeats are timely, with Britten’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream and an excellent cast marking the summer solstice. But his Peter Grimes staged out in the open on the North Sea shoreline will surely go down as one of the festival’s all-time memorable events. Seeing again the televised recording, with Alan Oke as Grimes, one could smell the salt tang, feel the rising wind and shiver.Under huge pressure to adapt to the present norm, podcasts are one way for organisations to sustain a profile. Welsh National Opera has launched a series – in English and in Welsh – and Longborough festival opera likewise. Theirs opens with Paul Carey Jones who would have been the much-anticipated Wotan in Die Walküre talking with conductor Anthony Negus in another, LFO artistic director Polly Graham and David Pountney discuss comedy in Wagner. “What larks, Poll, what larks!”But it’s the Guildhall School of Music and Drama who hold all the aces in creating digital performances of their end-of-year opera double-bill.

It’s the virtual thing in both senses and promises to be both inventive and evocative.My pick for the week aheadFrom Thursday 25 June, the Penarth Chamber Music festival weekend is being livestreamed, with repertoire gems by prime exponents of the genre, including David Adams, Alice Neary, Lesley Hatfield and Robert Plane."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/820b48532cfd4d2b39fac81c595ab7688beae402/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a759f8d2eeeda4c772f791dc8239f87","title":"next years gcse and a level exams in england may be delayed","story":"Government considering moving summer exams to give pupils more time to catch up on studies The government is considering delaying the 2021 summer exams in England in order to allow for additional teaching time to make up for lessons lost to school closures during the pandemic.The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, told MPs that the government would be consulting with the exams regulator, Ofqual, about moving exams back to give pupils more time to study for their GCSEs and A-levels.Teachers’ leaders have said pupils preparing for exams next summer have not had sufficient time to cover the syllabus, after schools closed to all but key worker and vulnerable children on 20 March and lessons went online.This year’s summer exams had to be cancelled as a result of the lockdown. Instead of sitting their papers, pupils will have their grades awarded by a combination of teacher assessment, class ranking and the past performance of their schools.Previously, Williamson has insisted that next year’s exams will go ahead, but when asked during education questions in the Commons on Monday, he said the government was considering how to give pupils extra time.The Tory MP Alec Shelbrooke has previously suggested moving the 2021 exam season from May to the end of June or July to give students and teachers more time in the classroom to complete the curriculum.Addressing Williamson in the Commons, he said: “I wonder if my right honourable friend will be giving consideration to that or other matters to get extra teaching time in ready for the exam season.”Williamson responded that the government’s £1bn catch-up package announced last week would help ensure that children from the most disadvantaged backgrounds would benefit from extra support through one-to-one or small group tutoring.He added: “My honourable friend raises an important point about how do we add more teaching time in, and that’s why we will be consulting with Ofqual about how we can move those exams back, giving children extra time in order to be able to learn and really flourish and do incredibly well.” An Ofqual spokesperson said later: “We recognise students expecting to take exams next year, and their parents and teachers, are concerned about the disruption to teaching and learning caused by the coronavirus pandemic.“We are working closely with the Department for Education, exam boards and groups representing teachers, schools, colleges and students, to carefully consider a range of possible measures. We are planning to publish for consultation, before the end of term, our proposals for 2021.”Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, warned of potential complications. “If the intention is to move the full six-week exam season to a later date, this would have significant ramifications.“It would mean either exam boards having a much narrower window in which to mark millions of scripts, or results being published later, which would potentially run into the autumn term. This would affect progression to further and higher education.“It’s important that the approach to next year’s exams supports pupils without creating more problems than it solves, and that it is agreed as soon as possible so that schools and colleges are able to prepare accordingly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fab635011ab88fafd1081391adfbb92c6a940fdf/0_56_4871_2922/master/4871.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c706fc60e5a866a90b7c70e78c1583e","title":"campaigners welcome historic eu inquiry into live animal transport","story":"Report will look at suspected lack of welfare regulation enforcement, as growth in exports sees livestock journeys increaseThe European Parliament has voted to establish an inquiry committee to investigate the transport of live animals across and out of the European Union.The committee will address whether the European Commission has failed to act upon evidence of “serious and systematic” infringements of EU regulations for the protection of exported live animals.Dutch MEP Anja Hazekamp described the vote, which took place on Friday, as a “historical breakthrough” for animal welfare: “A huge majority of parliament have said that animal transports should be investigated really firmly because they can all see there is so much going wrong.”Animal welfare organisation Four Paws welcomed it as a “milestone decision”. Approximately 200 reports detailing breaches in regulations have been filed to the commission since 2007.Hazekamp said these cases are not incidental as those in the industry often claim: “It is on a structural basis that we see really cruel things done to animals – severe abuse and mistreatment.”For a long time, she said, neither the commission nor member states were willing to take the lead in responsibility “and in the meantime, for decades, nothing changed”. Fear of commercial competition has also been an obstacle, she adds. reported earlier this year that the global live animal export business has more than quadrupled in size over the past 50 years, with rising meat demand setting nearly 2 billion animals on the move in 2017.The trade is also booming in Europe with an estimated value of $3.3bn (£2.7bn). Animals are undertaking increasingly long journeys – sometimes lasting weeks – to places as remote as Russia, Uganda and Thailand.The committee’s report, to be submitted in a year, will look at suspected lack of enforcement for regulations on space, watering, feeding, bedding, temperature and ventilation for transported animals.The EU decision follows growing action from member states. Last month the Netherlands, one of the world’s biggest exporters of live animals, became the first to announce a suspension on transports to non-EU countries as long as there were doubts on meeting EU regulations.“It’s a very important decision because so far what we have heard member states saying is that they cannot oblige a non-European country to comply with an EU law,” said Francesca Porta from Eurogroup for Animals. “But it’s not about obliging. It’s about member states taking responsibility.”Last week Austria followed suit and a number of German federal states have also introduced similar measures.The Netherlands’ decision was prompted by investigations from German vets and campaigners into transport routes into Russia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.In August last year four German vets visited a number of “resting spots” regularly supplied by German transport companies on their journey plans. EU regulations stipulate that until they reach their final destination, after every 29 hours of travel cattle must be unloaded, fed and watered in a designated resting place for 24 hours.The vets reported that some spots did not uphold regulations and that some places listed as resting spots did not exist at all.Their report concludes that animals on the route likely suffered “long-lasting and significant suffering and harm”. It states some transported animals had died painfully due to swallowing “foreign objects” at non-registered resting spots.Earlier last year German welfare organisation Animals’ Angels followed cattle on the same 6,000km route.“We had the proof that the animals were not unloaded for five days,” said Helena Bauer, from the group. “They suffer because they cannot move or properly drink, eat and rest.” Their video footage shows cattle covered in frost on the truck.A number of these resting spots were also regularly named on journey plans by Dutch exporters transporting breeding cattle, according to the Dutch agricultural minister Carola Schouten.Ina Müller-Arnke from German animal welfare organisation Four Paws said there was no real control system enforcing EU legislation: “So if you don’t have a control system or sanctions legislation doesn’t work.”The Netherlands have stated that a new process will be developed to ensure full compliance with EU legislation. The European Commission’s recent Farm to Fork sustainable food strategy also announced plans to revise legislation on animal transport and slaughter.Campaigners have also highlighted inhumane slaughter methods as a ground for tightening regulation and called for a shift towards the export of meat and carcasses.While Hazekamp doesn’t believe the parliament wants to ban live exports entirely, the new inquiry and member-state action highlights growing political momentum.“There is more and more pressure,” she said. “It’s a big problem that is really in the hearts of the citizens of Europe.”Meanwhile the Irish live export trade is facing a new challenge. The country has exported more than 120,000 calves this year, down about 47,000 on 2019, due to disruption caused by Covid-19. But a letter last week from the European Commission to welfare organisation, Eyes on Animals (EoA), appears to cast doubt on Ireland’s compliance with feeding requirements for unweaned animals on long sea journeys.In a 15 June letter the commission said it understands that unweaned calves must be fed after a maximum of 18 hours, according to EU Regulation 12005. The problem for Irish and Northern Irish calves, exported to mainland Europe in trucks driven on to car ferries, is that the door-to-door journey can take 25 to 30 hours and they are not fed milk or milk replacer during that time.To date, the long journeys without food, mostly from Rosslare or Dublin to the French port of Cherbourg, have not been an issue thanks to legal exemptions for longer sea journeys. The commission’s letter found, however, that the sea journey exemption is made “without altering” the rules “regarding watering and feeding intervals”.EoA founder Lesley Moffat said that means “regardless of the exception for longer sea journeys, there is no exception to the feeding rules”. For older animals, said Moffat, “you can comply by putting hay inside the truck or through the bars. You can’t do that with liquid milk replacer and unweaned calves can’t eat anything else.” That means their feed requirements are not met. Animal welfare lawyer Peter Stevenson said he believes the commission’s letter means Irish and Northern Irish officials must no longer approve the journey logs normally required for exported animals.In an emailed response to questions about the commission’s letter, Ireland’s Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, said it “ensures the transport and movement of animals operate in compliance with the legislative requirements”. The email did not answer queries about feeding unweaned calves after 18 hours, but it noted that animal “movements are governed by the provisions which allow for transport by sea on regular and direct links by vehicles loaded on to vessels without unloading of the animals”. Northern Ireland’s agricultural department did not reply to emails or calls.Green party senator and farmer Pippa Hackett, who is currently in coalition talks that could see the Greens join Ireland’s next government, was outspoken about the commission’s letter. “If calves are travelling for more than 18 hours without food, then this is surely a breach in EU regulation, and someone should be prosecuted.” Clarification, she said, would be required as to whether the onus is on the shipping company, the exporter, or the lorry driver."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/103c096a573ebd3df71bef82a342cb0e87c09358/0_165_4928_2958/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=422a1e8a3b4930db34f63f3373c74156","title":"fashion houses major shows behind closed doors dior burberry","story":"Dior cruise collection to be shown without an audience, while Burberry announces outdoor eventFashion is following the example of football by restarting its season behind closed doors.Christian Dior announced on Monday that a major show that had been scheduled to take place in May will go ahead on 22 July.Models, makeup artists and musicians will be flown to Puglia in southern Italy for a blockbuster cruise show, for which a catwalk will be erected in Lecce’s Piazza del Duomo, with the city’s baroque cathedral as a backdrop.Last year’s cruise show in Marrakech was staged in front of an audience of thousands and included the singer Diana Ross and the actors Shailene Woodley and Lupita Nyong’o, but this event will be played largely to camera – “like a beautiful movie”, according to Pietro Beccari, Dior’s chief executive.The live audience will be limited to close friends and family of Dior’s creative director, Maria Grazia Chiuri, and her team. “I can’t say no to my mother,” said the designer.Burberry announced this weekend that a show would take place outdoors in an as yet undisclosed location, which the designer Riccardo Tisci described only as “within the beautiful natural landscape of Britain”.Scheduled for 17 September, on the eve of London fashion week, the show will be “a physical presentation that is open for all to experience digitally,” said Tisci. “Other than the models and our team, there will not be anybody physically at the location.”Chiuri pointed instead to her wish to support the carpenters, electricians, ceramicists and embroiderers who had been commissioned to work on the show. Chiuri, who has ancestors in Puglia and a holiday home there, said she wanted “to send a message of hope and of optimism and to help those people as they try to restart”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0188aaa7c3e08e8cf083e9763d6170eba386850d/0_501_2967_1781/master/2967.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a3450a158a670321d22b44ed02aab2a","title":"how we made chicken run nick park jane horrocks","story":"‘Steven Spielberg flew us out to LA in a private jet and met us in a famous chicken restaurant’My sister kept pet chickens when we were kids and we’d make up these skits and cartoons where they’d always be the heroes of the story. Aged 17, on a foundation art course, I did a couple of stints at a chicken-packing factory. One day they sent me to the slaughterhouse and I saw all the live chickens hanging on a conveyor belt, held upside down by their legs – it was horrifying. In a way, chickens have always been in the back of my mind.Sometimes our American colleagues would be confused by British slang. Because the film is set in Yorkshire we used some very specific phrases. We’d then get notes asking: “What is a wassock?” Sometimes we got away with saying things because they simply didn’t know what we meant.The animators generally got through around two or three seconds a day. We’d crack open the champagne if we managed to get a minute in a week. The pie machine sequence, my favourite scene, took around three months.There was an atmosphere of excitement on set as it was our first proper foray into feature films. There was a nervousness, too – we were determined to prove that we hadn’t sold out, despite signing with a Hollywood studio. When the film came out, the reviews were mostly good – certainly good enough to feel like we’d hit the mark, although some accused Aardman of getting in bed with Hollywood and losing its national-treasure status. It’s incredible to me that 20 years have passed since we made that film and it’s still thought of as a classic.I can’t actually remember whether I was simply offered the role of Babs or if I auditioned for it. But what I do remember is the whole cast getting together for a read-through, which was unusual for an animation. I’d worked with Julia Sawalha on Ab Fab and knew Timothy Spall really well. It felt like being with old friends. Benjamin Whitrow, who played the RAF rooster Fowler, had a really loud voice and nearly blasted our ears off. He was absolutely perfect for the role! You could sense when we were all together that the film was going to be something special.Nick as a director was specific about what he wanted and I really enjoyed working with him. Both he and Pete Lord had a strong overall vision, not only for the animation but for what the characters sounded like. I’d received drawings of Babs and knew she was a larger lady – or should I say larger chicken? We had one recording with the whole cast together, then I had about four or five sessions on my own.It’s such a beautifully written and clever film without being overly sentimental and cheesy. You’re really rooting for the characters: you want them to win. My agent and I used to laugh about it marking the start of my “fowl period” as I went on to play a number of chickens in other animations.I wasn’t able to go to the premiere but I was in New York when it came out, so I went to see it in the cinema. The audience didn’t seem to get the irony and there wasn’t much laughter. Back in the UK, I went to see it in the cinema again. Of course, that was a different cup of tea altogether. The audience responded exactly as I hoped they would and roared with laughter.Babs is very similar to Bubble in Ab Fab. I think I do the dumb blonde role quite well – it comes naturally! It’s only been after years of people quoting Babs’s lines back at me that I’ve realised how good they are. I think my favourite is: “I don’t want to be a pie, I don’t like gravy!” When people hear my voice they “recognise” me. Some time ago, I went into my local dry cleaner’s and the woman working there said: “Can I ask you whether you happen to be the voice of a plasticine chicken?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f8f147f5d7391f0deb6be16340f49f6714f35d5/0_2786_5792_3475/master/5792.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=7f3078c8f3acca4b9551f1df2fb22911","title":"manchester city v burnley premier league live","story":"Manchester City are almost completely changed from the XI named for the 3-0 win over Arsenal. Only Ederson and Riyad Mahrez keep their places. Phil Foden starts, while Kevin De Bruyne, Raheem Sterling, Gabriel Jesus, Kyle Walker and Aymeric Laporte sit on the bench.At least City can name a full complement of nine subs just the seven on Burnley’s bench. The Clarets are without Aaron Lennon, Joe Hart, Phil Bardsley and Jeff Hendrick, as they’re all out of contract in a few days and nothing’s been agreed by way of extension. Strikers Chris Wood and Ashley Barnes are injured, too, so Matej Vydra and Jay Rodriguez start up front. Josh Brownhill, the £9m January signing from Bristol City, makes his first start for the club.This is a fixture that’s decided the title before. On a tense Monday night back in 1960, Burnley visited Maine Road to face Manchester City in the final game of the First Division season. Harry Potts’ team needed a victory to pip reigning champions Wolverhampton Wanderers to the prize, and deny Stan Cullis’s famous side a title hat-trick. Here’s how it panned out.Brian Pilkington put Burnley in the lead after four minutes. Joe Hayes equalised for City in short order, but 20-year-old reserve winger Trevor Meredith restored Burnley’s advantage on the half hour, polishing off a ball that had pinged loose of some penalty-box nonsense. City pushed for a second equaliser, but Denis Law missed a second-half sitter and Alan Oakes shot straight at Clarets keeper Adam Blacklaw when one on one in the last minute. Burnley became champions of England for the second time! City finished 16th.Thanks to Liverpool’s failure to win at Everton last night, there’s now no chance of this fixture deciding the title once again. But to all intents and purposes it will, should Pep Guardiola’s side fail to dispatch Sean Dyche’s team this evening. If Burnley get anything out of this, Liverpool will be nudged ever closer to the finishing line and will be able to seal the deal on Wednesday night against Crystal Palace. Everyone in red is claret now.It’s one heck of an “if”, though. A draw tonight is best priced at 8-1, while you can get 24s on a Burnley victory. That should come as no great surprise when you consider that Burnley were dismissed 4-1 by City on their own patch back in December that they’ve lost both of their last two visits to the Etihad 5-0 that they’ve lost eight of their last nine games against City and that they’ve only won once in their last 23 meetings with the Citizens.Even worse, they’ll be without first-choice strikers Ashley Barnes and Chris Wood. It’s most likely, then, that City will be closing the gap on Liverpool at the top to 20 points tonight, in which case Liverpool will have to wait at least another week for a chance to secure the title ... when they visit the Etihad themselves on Thursday week. But Burnley go into this match comfortable in mid-table, fresh from their break, and on the back of a five-game unbeaten run before lockdown. So you never know. It’s second versus 11th. It’s yet another night of potentially decisive Premier League action. It’s on!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a2e0faf67f20dba3949fc27387106fb3199cf02/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32efafbf2a14be03fcc80cca205e71ce","title":"share your reviews of the last of us part ii","story":"The sequel to Naughty Dog’s hit video game is finally here, but what did you make of it?

During the first weeks, it was difficult to gain access to hospitals to see how they were coping – until photojournalist Jonny Weeks was invited on to the Covid-19 wards at University hospital in Coventry. We made a full risk assessment, considering his safety and the risk to those around him, and with the guidance of the staff there he produced a brilliant photo essay. He was one of the very first photojournalists to have this kind of access in the UK and it was a key story for the .Photographing people through windows, in outside\u0026nbspspaces or from the end of their front path has become an accepted feature of this time, like physically distanced queuing\u0026nbspat the supermarket.\u0026nbspIt’s remarkable how inappropriate photo-stories made before the pandemic\u0026nbspnow feel. Seeing people in crowded places such as music festivals, or people going to work – a time before face masks – has quickly become dated.\u0026nbspLike our vocabulary, our visual language and practice has changed, for now.\u0026nbspWe’d all seen images of lockdowns in Italy and Spain and so had a good sense of what was to come. It was clear that the streets of London would fall empty and silent that first morning of lockdown on 24 March. In normal times I would have tried to find high positions to shoot down from but I knew that would be impossible. So I bought a giant monopod online, which thankfully arrived on the 23rd. The thing goes as high as a house with the camera popped on top, which I control using a smartphone down below. So I spent the first few days of lockdown wandering around with it flung over my shoulder, able to shoot desolate London scenes from above within moments from any position. The light was incredible during those first days and weeks, which only increased the sense of urgency to be out there shooting as much as possible. It felt like we were witnessing something unique in our history, which demanded thorough documentation. The days were long and I found it impossible to relax. Even when I got home I felt like I should be back out there photographing. I’d watch the skies from my garden and felt pangs of regret if I saw dramatic clouds developing, sure in the knowledge that I was missing some momentous, empty London streetscape.I went into an early lockdown because my partner is shielding. But you can’t “work from home” as a photographer, so I started taking long walks around my home district, Camden. I’ve lived in this part of London for over 15 years, but having all this sudden time to walk and think and really look in a way I’ve never done before gave me a new perspective. I noticed light, details, and stark beauty in places I’d never seen carefully before. It was strange to do this work and to feel people were only distant, fleeting presences on the periphery of my attention. But that’s how the early weeks of lockdown felt.I’ve worked for the  and Observer for 20 years now, but I also do commercial work – one of my last big jobs before locking down was a Transport for London campaign that is currently decorating a transport network I can’t use – and personal work. I’m the sort of photographer who always carried my Leica with me and usually I don’t see the distinction between paid commissions and my own work. Photography feels like a vocation as well as a career.Fears about the virus meant that for those first two months I didn’t take my camera with me when I went on my rather limited walks. It felt like a possible mode of infection an object I constantly touch and then bring to my face. It’s the longest I’ve gone in my adult life without my camera and without photography. It’s been very painful and difficult.Also I desperately missed, and continue to miss, the human side of my job. I enjoy the huge privilege of meeting so many disparate people and having the unique, brief insights into their worlds that being a photographer usually brings on a daily basis. I realise now more than I ever have before how these daily encounters give meaning to my life and also provide all the sparks that fire both my creative energy and my personal energy. Without that, life is flatter.I did quite quickly realise that I had to continue taking photographs even if I wasn’t working and wasn’t able to use my “proper” camera. I did a series taken on my long walks round Camden.As the rules have loosened a little and I’ve grown braver on my bike, I’ve visited friends outside their homes or in their gardens, and for the past few weeks I’ve returned to my proper Leica. My work is always about intimacy and connection, and as I’ve gradually started to take photos with people in them again, I’m glad to see that side of my creative personality coming back.Going forward, though, I am extremely apprehensive. Photography is a competitive, anxious profession to be in at the best of times. But at the moment I feel I’m trapped inside an airless glass box, where on the outside there are signs of the world coming back to life tentatively and old connections being renewed. I worry I’ll have my nose pressed to the glass till we are safe with a vaccine.My biggest challenge, apart from keeping my four-year-old entertained, was getting my parents repatriated from India, which we eventually managed to do. Both are thankfully safe and well.After a couple of weeks of lockdown work was very quiet, I was getting itchy feet and was desperate to take pictures. We were encouraged to think of stories to photograph safely that we could contribute to the paper. I decided to go to Slough, where I grew up, and photograph the local Asian volunteers who were helping the wider community. I would follow the volunteers in my own car and take pictures of the vulnerable people receiving the donations – all photographed at a safe distance. The volunteers felt very valued when they appeared in the national newspaper and even more so online, viewed by an international audience.Before the lockdown I would mostly shoot in studios with lights and a crew of assistants – makeup artists, PRs and so on. Since lockdown, I have been working solo and most of the portraits have been shot outside. I have sometimes set up a mini-studio with a background in people’s gardens: luckily we had pretty good weather. I must say I have actually enjoyed working this way, keeping things as simple as possible, just me and the subject.In the early days of lockdown, I was frustrated by the lack of coverage from within UK hospitals. Compared with what we were seeing and reading from Italy and the US, we knew very little of our own NHS. For me at least, this meant I had very little concept of the everyday acts of heroism being performed by NHS staff and I really didn’t have much of a clue what I was clapping for during “clap for carers” on Thursday evenings. I felt detached. I approached University hospital in Coventry, where I was born, and was lucky to be granted exclusive access to cover every\u0026nbspaspect of their amazing work.In doing so I was able to document many members of staff and their personal contributions – nurses and doctors in ITU, cleaners and charity workers on the wards. It was a huge undertaking and, given the number\u0026nbspof deaths and the lack of access for family members, a story that had to be handled very sensitively. It was also a challenging assignment because I felt a weight of responsibility to my subjects and I was shooting in conditions that were frankly alien to me (trying to take documentary photographs while wearing PPE is not easy). Fortunately, the feedback was overwhelmingly positive: people valued the unique insight the story provided, they were comforted by the many positive stories that emerged from the tragedy of the pandemic, and they recognised that we had fulfilled our duty to our readers as a newspaper. It showed me that honest, respectful journalism can be immensely powerful. And I was quite chuffed at getting five pages of my work in the paper, too!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05f43382eddfb2c070687c82ae8855ee26a60f34/0_169_3304_1983/master/3304.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=757d1807781873f83431a340d37815f1","title":"paul mccartney calls for meat to no longer be mandatory in englands school meals","story":"Former Beatle and his daughters Stella and Mary sign letter to education secretarySir Paul McCartney and his daughters Stella and Mary have joined a call to change guidance which makes it mandatory to serve fish, meat and dairy in England’s school meals.The McCartneys, founders of Meat Free Monday, want to see school children given more opportunities to choose climate-friendly vegan meals.They have signed a letter to the education secretary Gavin Williamson which has been written as part of the consultation process for the National Food Strategy, a landmark review of Britain’s food system.That strategy is an opportunity to revise School Food Standards which make it mandatory to serve fish, meat and dairy and replace them with nutritional guidelines “that allow schools to be more flexible.”In a statement the McCartneys said: “No one needs to eat meat, so it shouldn’t be mandatory to serve it in schools. It’s time to revise the School Food Standards to help the planet, spare animals, and promote healthy eating.”The letter, also backed by Greenpeace and the Royal Society for Public Health, argues the standards are unnecessarily restrictive.“So long as nutritional needs are met, inidual school caterers should have the freedom to decide whether they wish to include meat and dairy in their menus.”The current school food plan states that dairy should be served each day, that meat and poultry should be served three or more times a week, non-dairy protein for vegetarians at least three times per week and that oily fish should be served at least once every three weeks.Bridget Benelam, a spokesperson for the British Nutrition Foundation, said it was vital that schools provided nutritious meals.“It’s possible, although challenging, to put together menus for children without animal products that provide all the essential nutrients they need to grow and be healthy, and there are many positive aspects of having a more plant-based diet. However, it is important to consider that dairy, meat and fish are bioavailable sources of some key vitamins and minerals including vitamin B12, calcium, iron and zinc and so guidance would be needed on suitable plant-based alternatives that could provide these in adequate amounts.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d4ab823e88f7bbea570ad95d93880494c48fe0a/0_132_3015_1808/master/3015.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c13e67dbeb5a8829c56775bcab0f1b65","title":"rock against racism metals varied response to black lives matter","story":"Black Sabbath and Axl Rose are among those in the metal world supporting protests, but there’s no denying the opinions of others in the genreThere’s no point denying metal has a more complicated relationship with race than many of its adherents would like to admit, or confront. At its most stark, this is evident in the overt racism that has insinuated itself into black metal over the past 30 years, following the example of the openly racist Varg Vikernes of Mayhem and Burzum. There’s now even a genre identified as “national socialist black metal”.And there’s the fact of how metal came to be. The founding fathers of metal in the late 60s and early 70s were still playing music derived from the blues (even Black Sabbath began as a blues rock band, and their drummer, Bill Ward, filled their records with jazz-inspired flourishes).While researching a book about vintage metal, sociologist Keith Kahn-Harris and I discussed how the codification of metal a decade or so after Sabbath’s first record was in part a process of removing the blues, and thus the black musical origins of the genre, from its sound. That’s not a malign thing – as he pointed out, punk did much the same in its evolution out of the R\u0026ampB-based pub rock – but it happened.So it has been heartening to see so much of the metal world react to the Black Lives Matter protests not with a shrug, but with a recognition that sometimes the right thing to do is to speak. Kudos to Black Sabbath for printing T-shirts altering the logo from their Master of Reality album to read Black Lives Matter. Respect to Serj Tankian of System of a Down for taking a very clear stand: “Coordinate online and block every street everywhere and force the regime to resign. The time has come. Your time has come @realdonaldtrump.” Credit to all the metal bands coming together on Bandcamp to raise money for BLM with a benefit compilation.Astonished appreciation, as well, to Axl Rose – whose lyrics for One in a Million are nakedly racist and offensive – for both the fact of Guns N’ Roses giving support to BLM on Instagram and for Rose’s unequivocal taking of sides against Donald Trump: “Lamestream media ISN’T doing everything within their power 2 foment hatred n’ anarchy, that’s U!” he tweeted. “As long as we get what Ur doing, that Ur FAKE NEWS n’ a truly bad, repulsive excuse 4 a person wa sick agenda, we can work past U wwhatever it takes 2 a better, stronger future!!”While it would be nice to report these responses were universal, they’re not – even within the same band. John Dolmayan, System of a Down’s drummer, used Instagram to offer his support for Trump’s claim to be the greatest friend to minorities America has ever had, and has continued to continue on that tack, suggesting Democrats are “the true fascist, the true bigots hidden in plain sight from the same party who fought to maintain slavery, Jim Crow, non voting rights for women, and who are directly responsible for 70-plus million abortions, a large majority of whom were black. You don’t want free speech, you can’t handle free speech because you are cowards and need to be herded along with the rest of the sheep.” Sandra Araya, the wife of Slayer’s Tom Araya, has been posting racist memes to Instagram, and while the views of one person in a marriage should not be ascribed to another, Slayer’s own record on racial politics isn’t watertight given the controversy surrounding Angel of Death, their song about Josef Mengele.Are the metal bands speaking out against racism risking alienating their fans? No, not really. Any artist has racist fans, sadly. It is true that if you look on social media, those posts will have some fans disagreeing with them, angrily. It’s true, too, that some people are just stupid, whether or not they’re racist – like the fan who tweeted to Tom Morello that he was a fan of Rage Against the Machine “until your political opinions come out. Music is my sanctuary and the last thing I want to hear is political bs when I’m listening to music. As far as I’m concerned you and Pink are completely done. Keep running your mouth and ruining your fan base.” That fan was roundly mocked, by Morello, and more or less everyone else who had ever actually listened to Rage.It’s possible assumptions get made about metal because in the west its fanbase is – and let’s not deny it – overwhelmingly white and male, and history tells us no one looks out for the interests of white men quite as thoroughly as white men. But metal is behind only hip-hop as a truly global music, with no colour bars in the rest of the world. I’ve been to Nepal and to India to talk to metal bands and fans, talking about what the music means, and to those people it means liberation, and justice (metal musicians in Nepal are currently raising money for those starving to death in the country, because Covid-19 has deprived them of their subsistence livelihoods).Sabbath, Axl Rose and Serj Tankian are fulfilling the promise that those fans I met in Asia thought metal had made. They are supporting liberation. Any fan who has a problem with that has misunderstood metal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/619c64cd2342677e33921e9f62a2e9d56745d530/0_105_3210_1926/master/3210.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e41760355740241b7e9fbee45251289","title":"glastonbury tell us how you feel about the festivals cancellation","story":"Share your reaction to the announcement that there won’t be a Glastonbury this year, thanks to Covid-19 • Coronavirus and culture – a list of major cancellations• Coronavirus – latest updates• See all our coronavirus coverageNews that the Glastonbury festival 2020 has been cancelled to prevent the spread of coronavirus will have come as a shock to many.The festival’s 50th anniversary was set to take place this June, but organisers have decided to implement a fallow year and postpone until 2021.The festival organisers Michael and Emily Eavis wrote on social media that a cancellation was the “only viable option” in light of the pandemic.We’d like to hear from readers who are affected by the cancellation.Were you planning to attend, perhaps for the first time, or the last time?

While most cruise ship passengers have now made it back to land, many crew workers are trapped, quarantined in tiny cabins, some without pay. Crew members have said the experience has taken its toll on their mental health. Cruise companies have blamed strict rules from health authorities for not letting crew disembark.  Rachel hears from Will Lees, a Canadian who last October took a job as an art director on board the Norwegian Star cruise ship. When coronavirus hit in March, he found himself unable to get off. Shuffled between ships to await repatriation, he was eventually taken to Italy, where he was finally able to fly home. Perry*, a Mauritian crew member, is still stuck on his boat. With two cases of coronavirus onboard, Perry and fellow crew have been confined to their cabins for months. He does not know when he will be allowed home and is worried about how his family, who depend on his salary to support themselves, are managing. He has not been paid a wage since March.  *Perry’s name has been changed.

The structure appears to have been a boundary guiding people to a sacred area because Durrington Walls, one of Britain’s largest henge monuments, is located precisely at its centre. The site is 1.9 miles north-east of Stonehenge on Salisbury Plain, near Amesbury, Wiltshire.Prof Vincent Gaffney, a leading archaeologist on the project, said: “This is an unprecedented find of major significance within the UK. Key researchers on Stonehenge and its landscape have been taken aback by the scale of the structure and the fact that it hadn’t been discovered until now so close to Stonehenge.”The Durrington Shafts discovery, announced on Monday, is all the more extraordinary because it offers the first evidence that the early inhabitants of Britain, mainly farming communities, had developed a way to count. Constructing something of this size with such careful positioning of its features could only have been done by tracking hundreds of paces.Gaffney said: “The size of the shafts and circuit surrounding Durrington Walls is currently unique. It demonstrates the significance of Durrington Walls Henge, the complexity of the monumental structures within the Stonehenge landscape, and the capacity and desire of Neolithic communities to record their cosmological belief systems in ways, and at a scale, that we had never previously anticipated.”He added: “I can’t emphasise enough the effort that would have gone in to digging such large shafts with tools of stone, wood and bone.”But then these are the same people who also built Stonehenge, dragging bluestones to the site from south-west Wales about 150 miles away.While Stonehenge was positioned in relation to the solstices, or the extreme limits of the sun’s movement, Gaffney said the newly discovered circular shape suggests a “huge cosmological statement and the need to inscribe it into the earth itself”.He added: “Stonehenge has a clear link to the seasons and the passage of time, through the summer solstice. But with the Durrington Shafts, it’s not the passing of time, but the bounding by a circle of shafts which has cosmological significance.”The boundary may have guided people towards a sacred site within its centre or warned against entering it.As the area around Stonehenge is among the world’s most-studied archaeological landscapes, the discovery is all the more unexpected. Having filled naturally over millennia, the shafts – although enormous – had been dismissed as natural sinkholes and dew ponds. The latest technology – including geophysical prospection, ground-penetrating radar and magnetometry – showed them as geophysical anomalies and revealed their true significance.Gaffney said: “We are starting to see things we could never see through standard archaeology, things we could not imagine.”Based at the University of Bradford, he is the co-principal investigator of the Stonehenge Hidden Landscape project, which has been surveying tens of kilometres of landscape across Salisbury Plain. Archaeologists are now joining the dots and seeing this massive pattern, he said.Coring of the shafts has provided crucial radiocarbon dates to more than 4,500 years ago, making the boundary contemporary with both Stonehenge and Durrington Walls. The boundary also appears to have been laid out to include an earlier prehistoric monument, the Larkhill causewayed enclosure, built more than 1,500 years before the henge at Durrington.Struck flint and unidentified bone fragments were recovered from the shafts, but archaeologists can only speculate how those features were once used.Gaffney said: “What we’re seeing is two massive monuments with their territories. Other archaeologists, including Michael Parker Pearson at University College London, have suggested that, while Stonehenge, with its standing stones, was an area for the dead, Durrington, with its wooden structures, was for the living.”He added that, while numerous ancient civilisations had counting systems, the evidence lies primarily in texts in various forms that they left behind. The planning involved in contracting a prehistoric structure of this size must have involved a tally or counting system, he believes. Positioning each shaft would have involved pacing more than 800 metres from the henge outwards.The research has involved a consortium of archaeologists, led by the University of Bradford and including the universities of Birmingham and St Andrews, in an international collaboration with the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Archaeological Prospection and Virtual Archaeology at the University of Vienna.Henry Chapman, professor of archaeology at Birmingham University, described it as “an incredible new monument”, and Richard Bates, a geoscientist at St Andrews University, said it offered “an insight to the past that shows an even more complex society than we could ever imagine”.The consortium is publishing a scientific open-access paper in Internet Archaeology.The discovery makes up for the cancellation of this year’s summer solstice celebrations at Stonehenge – on 20 June – due to the ban on mass gatherings prompted by Covid-19. Archaeologists have another reason to rejoice after the discovery nearby of a giant Neolithic structure."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2908be29f02f8bd5e839bbf6ecea690c41e66aa4/2_0_2595_1558/master/2595.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3df43c3196a94b903fe78d8b6a21ff73","title":"from bricks to clicks how local high street shops have turned digital during coronavirus","story":"Across the country, many independent retailers have had to switch to digital almost overnight in order to continue trading through the coronavirus lockdown. But as stores begin to reopen, will consumers now be as likely to shop online as in person?The coronavirus lockdown turned the lives of many high street merchants upside down overnight. For those who had little experience of online trading, or had business models that relied entirely on face-to-face sales, the challenge was sudden and daunting. But it was a challenge they knew they had to face.Before the pandemic, Georgina Black, who runs Pretty Shiny Shop, a small independent gift store in Finsbury Park, north London, did very little trade online. “I got maybe three sales a month through my website,” she says. “I didn’t regularly update it and I didn’t even list all my products. I can tell you that had to change fast when the lockdown started.”Since March, she has been painstakingly adding all her products, taking images of them, writing descriptions and listing measurements. “It’s time-consuming because I have no team, but I am starting to see the results. From an average of three sales per month I am now getting on average four or five a day.”After problems with couriers – one package she sent took 10 days to arrive – Black has experimented with different delivery options. She even bought an electric scooter so she could deliver local orders herself. “I’ve enjoyed zipping around the streets,” she says.While it is not clear exactly when trading will go back to normal, Black says that she will continue to push the online side of her business alongside reopening her doors. “It was never a priority before but now I need it to survive because, realistically, footfall is going to drop – people just aren’t going to be as comfortable going into shops. So shop owners need to adapt.”Once lockdown hit, owners of small businesses had to become digitally savvy – and fast. With high street stores having to turn bricks into clicks, Visa has teamed up with industry partners to offer support to them. It hopes to help small businesses across the UK find new and different ways to serve the local people and communities that rely on them.One of Visa’s partners is Shopify, a leading e-commerce platform that powers more than 1m businesses worldwide. With the backing of Visa, Shopify has offered a 14-day free trial for all new small businesses and provided support from experts who can guide, advise, and get small businesses online.Black, who built her website using Shopify, is very much a fan of the platform. “I love Shopify,” she says. “I find it incredibly easy to deal with at the back end. I’m not a very technical person but making changes and adding products really is a breeze.”Visa has also joined forces with Deliveroo. The delivery service has waived the £50 sign-up fee for up to 1,000 small and medium-sized restaurants until 30 June – or on whichever date before then all 1,000 waivers have been taken up – it has also provided a cash payment of £500 to 200 existing small and medium-sized restaurant partners so they could continue operating during coronavirus.More than ever, the platform is helping businesses continue to reconnect with their local communities. The social psychologist and founder of ShopAppy, Jackie Mulligan, says the “resilience and determination” of local businesses during the crisis has been “inspiring”.Independent businesses are the heartbeat of our high streets and local communities, and the backbone of the UK economy. “We keep the local high street looking good and lively,” says Black. “I’ve been so impressed by how the local community has supported local shops. It’s so heartening.”When small, local businesses succeed, everyone in the community reaps the rewards. Recent months have been enormously challenging for them, but with the right support from local customers, online platforms and Visa alike, they can survive and thrive.Shop local.

Many have opted to support local retailers, but can that trend last?Like other shops throughout the UK, the Edward Street Bakery in the West Yorkshire village of Saltaire has been closed throughout lockdown. But as it told its followers on social media “bakers gotta bake (and cook)”, so it has been running bake-a-longs via its Instagram account. From brownies to a peanut butter cornflake tart, fans have been able to join bakery staff in creating their own goodies at home. And as well as keeping customers happy it’s also inadvertently supporting other local businesses as the ingredients for the bake-a-longs can be bought from Mr Whetstone – a local refill shop.Although this might stand out for sounding particularly delicious, it’s far from an isolated instance of an independent retailer finding innovative ways to connect with customers while its doors are closed. Across the country, store owners have shown ingenuity – and the public has been falling back in love with their local high streets as a result.For many years, the fate of the British high street has been a staple of magazine features and newspaper business page reports alike. Yet, in what is perhaps one of the biggest surprises of 2020 – and there have been many – rather than being the death knell for the local shopping scene, coronavirus appears to have sparked a renaissance. Although some stores will not be lifting their shutters when regular trading resumes, others have seen a spike in business.A witness to this shift in shopping habits is Jackie Mulligan, founder of the digital platform ShopAppy, which allows consumers to connect with their local high street online. She says this shift towards shopping locally was initially driven by practicalities.“The sea change that we saw at the beginning of lockdown was a result of the big superstores being unable to give people delivery slots and people didn’t feel safe going into those stores,” says Mulligan. As a result, there was a sudden discovery of local shops, she says.ShopAppy itself experienced a huge growth in customer registrations as people looked for new ways to shop for groceries and essential goods. Over time, these same customers have begun to look for other products too, with gifts and even art becoming more popular. Mulligan says that two-thirds of artists who participated in this year’s online version of a local Makers’ Fair made sales.Furthermore, these new customers are discovering that the local stores have a lot to offer. “They’re reporting that they couldn’t believe how good the fruit and veg was,” says Mulligan, adding that customers have also been wowed by the prices and lack of packaging.Ensuring new habits stickThe challenge for local shop owners is to ensure that this shift in consumer spending habits continues longer term. How can they capitalise on this current upsurge?Retailers need to act now, says Mulligan. “You can close your shop but still trade. You can close your cafe but still offer something. The key is to make it easy for customers to support local.”The Edward Street Bakery offers one example of how to do this other examples include allowing customers to ring up with orders or book appointments to visit the store.Another option is to take advantage of the special offer to join ShopAppy for free until the end of July and connect with local consumers through that platform. “However ambitious you are, it’s difficult to save the high street on your own,” says Mulligan.“People have turned to corner shops and local shops and we don’t want them to go back to old habits. We want them to have a bit more of a local choice when doing their shopping – supporting local is for life, not just for lockdown.”Shop local.

Lockdown, followed by an economic crash, has propelled more than 3 million new claimants on to universal credit, in three months, exposing the system’s strengths – and its limitations – on a scale that has not been seen before.Whether the system is comprehensive enough, and sufficiently flexible and generous enough to cope with that scrutiny and responsibility, is the subject of the first report of the new parliament published this week by the Commons work and pensions’ select committee under its new chair, the Labour MP Stephen Timms.The cross-party MPs’ report is unanimous: for all the sterling efforts of the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) staff to keep universal credit up and running, millions of people have still struggled to get the support they needed to pay for essential living costs during the pandemic. “It’s done a decent job,” Timms says, “but universal credit is a very basic safety net.”Timms, the MP for East Ham, and a former social security minister in the Blair years, is no fan of either universal credit or the government’s welfare policies, but he praises the DWP for its handling of the crisis so far, not least its “fleetness of foot” in rapidly reorganising itself to ensure money got to a large number of people in such a short period of time.He salutes the government for uprating the value of universal credit by £20 a week and notes that the much-maligned computer system did not collapse. There was much that was impressive, he says. “It may well begin to rebuild public confidence in social security and a better understanding of why we need a social security system.”But not everyone has been able to get support during the crisis, notably migrant workers with leave to remain who are ineligible to claim benefits because they have no recourse to public funds (NRPF). Timms asked Boris Johnson about this in a memorable recent exchange at the commons liaison committee, when the PM appeared not to understand his own government’s policy, blithely wondering why they could not apply for universal credit.“I rather agree with the prime minister when he said hardworking families with no income should be entitled to support of one kind or another,” says Timms. “What I want to see is the government following through on that view and delivering support by suspending NRPF at least to families with children for the duration of this crisis.”The report calls for immediate suspension of the NRPF rules for the duration of the pandemic. How can it be in the public interest for people – some of them health workers and retail staff – to be expected to comply with physical distancing and quarantine rules while denying them access to benefits, it asks.Timms notes that other groups can feel ignored: people who have been refused universal credit on the basis that they had more than £16,000 of financial savings, for example. Some people on tax credits were wrongly advised to claim universal credit, were refused it because they had too much in savings, and then found they had been automatically – and irreversibly – cut off from tax credits, leaving them hundreds of pounds a month worse off.Universal credit, he says, is plagued by “very, very serious flaws”. Foremost among these is the “indefensible” five-week wait for payment. New claimants do not have the savings to wait that long without income, often running up rent arrears, debt, and becoming reliant on food banks.The irony, says Timms, is that despite hundreds of millions of pounds of investment in digital technology, an initial benefit payment is now slower than at any point in the history of the welfare state. “Ever since the 1940s we have had a social security system that has been capable of delivering the first regular benefit payment to people within a few days … It seems to me this is not a system that is fit for purpose if it cannot do what the system has done ever since the 1940s.”The government’s favoured solution to this has been to offer new claimants advance loans to tide them over the five weeks, repayable over 12 months. Timms says this simply stretches the financial shock of universal credit over a longer period. The committee has launched an inquiry looking at “technically feasible and financially affordable” alternatives to the five-week wait, including the idea that new claimants are given a non-repayable grant to smooth the transition.No change is not an option, believes Timms. “When I was standing for chair of the select committee I made a lot of this problem with the five-week delay in universal credit and it was very striking how widely this was agreed on the Conservative benches as well on the Labour benches that this was a serious problems that need to be fixed.”One of the lessons DWP ministers might learn from the pandemic is how much of the architecture of the benefits system temporarily suspended during the pandemic might be permanently jettisoned, he says. He would not scrap conditionality, but the “needlessly punitive” sanctions regime – which penalises claimants for failing to carry out agreed tasks, such as job searches, by witholding their benefits for between four weeks and six months – should be looked at. One of the problems is that claimants feel the system is there to catch them out, rather than support them.“That’s a very poisonous relationship that people have sometimes got into with jobcentres. That not how it ought to be. The system should treat people a lot better than that. Sanctions are a reason why too many people have found it such an unpleasant experience.”Pre-pandemic concerns will not be forgotten by the committee as it starts its programme of inquiries. It will examine disability benefits, and the future of work. And while it is not a full inquiry – at least not yet – Timms says the committee will hold the DWP to account over the tragic death of Errol Graham, a mentally ill man who starved to death after his benefits were cut off.Timms was shocked that the DWP has seemingly done so little to learn and change its policies despite the avoidable deaths by suicide of a number of vulnerable claimants like Graham over the years. “The committee will certainly not let this go,” says Timms. “Everybody can see that the system failed terribly in this instance and other cases, and it needs to be put right.”Cases such as Graham’s, and other well-publicised failures, have led some critics to attack the DWP as unfit for purpose. Timms is an optimist. The DWP may not be the “listening and learning” organisation of ministerial imagination (“I applaud the aspiration,” he notes drily) but it has a vital role to play nonetheless. “I think social security is a very good thing and I am a firm believer in the potential of the department to change people’s lives for the better. I want to see more of that potential realised.”Career: 1994-present: Labour MP for East Ham (previously Newham north-east) January 2020-present, chair, work and pensions select committee 2012–present: chair, all party parliamentary group on faith and society 2010-15: shadow employment minister 2008–10: financial secretary, HM Treasury 2007–08: competitiveness minister 2005–06: pensions minister 2006–07: chief secretary to HM Treasury 2004–05: financial secretary, HM Treasury 2002–04: minister for e-commerce and competitiveness, then for energy, e-commerce and postal services 2001–02: school standards minister 1999–2000: financial secretary, HM Treasury 1999: pensions minister 1990–94: leader, Newham borough council 1984–94: Labour councillor, Newham borough council 1994: manager, telecommunications reports, Ovum 1986–94: principal consultant, Ovum 1981–84: secretary, Newham NE Labour party 1978–86: consultant, Logica."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1ae1995bbe3ab7aec20bb5788c53986ef4150e5/0_37_4332_2599/master/4332.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=abe2e7b161331482e8aeac8026211720","title":"apple expected to reveal new macs iphone updates and more live","story":"Follow the launch of Apple’s latest hardware and software updates as they are announcedAnd finally, we get Tim Cook back again, declaring today a “historic day”. “It’s time for a huge leap forward for the Mac: today is the day the Mac is transitioning to our own Apple Silicon.“Having a world class silicon design team is a game changer,” Cook says, before introducing a very silly video transfer to an “undisclosed location” where Apple’s SVP of Hardware Technologies, Johny Srugi, explains the company’s history of building its own chips: firstly the A-line chips from the iPhone, then the AX chips for the iPads.“The first thing this will do is give the Mac a whole new level of performance,” Sruji says. “You want to deliver the highest performance at the lowest power consumption.

Breathtakingly bleak (“All that I ever ’ad, I lost,” she says at one point), it’s a tour de force for the then-80-year-old June Brown, who on the strength of this episode, earned herself a best actress nod at the 2009 Baftas.When Tony Hancock told his writers Ray Galton and Alan Simpson he wanted to go it alone sans long-time co-star Sid James, they gave him absolutely what he wanted – a full 25 minutes of unsullied solo Hancock. Now living in a shabby bedsit in Earl’s Court, this opening episode of the comedian’s final BBC series is Hancock at his pretentious, deluded best, wrestling with an impenetrable Bertrand Russell doorstopper while readying himself for a date that never happens. Paul Merton’s ill-considered 1996 remake should be avoided at all costs.Cheap-as-chips video-diary shows were all over TV in the late 90s, so when Marion and Geoff appeared on BBC Two in 2000 it was riding quite the cultural wave. Written by Rob Brydon and Hugo Blick, it starred the then little-known Brydon as Keith Barret, a sweet-natured but fatally naive taxi driver going through a messy orce from his wife, Marion (Geoff is “the other man”). Despite its visual simplicity, the series managed over three season to paint a heartbreakingly detailed picture of an unsalvageable marriage.Blick followed Marion and Geoff with this scandalously overlooked series of 10-minute monologues for BBC Two in which Joanna Lumley headlined as ageing orcee Madison Blakelock. Living in genteel poverty in a one-room flat, each episode has the 18-years-single Blakelock wistfully recalling her jet-setting, high-living past. Gradually, through the six episodes, her carefully cultivated veneer of happiness begins to crumble, exposing the desperate bleakness at the heart of the series.Screened in 2017 to mark 50 years since the Sexual Offences Act of 1967, these eight 20-minute pieces told a variety of stories based around the gay experience, from Mark Gatiss’s impossibly touching first-world-war-set The Man on the Platform – with Ben Whishaw as a returning soldier who had a brief and unconsummated dalliance with his superior – to Brian Fillis’s More Anger starring Russell Tovey as an 80s thesp railing against the media’s stereotyping of gay men.Mickey Rooney was once the go-to guy for breezy, sunshine-hearted goofballs, which is why it’s such a shock to see him as a splenetic, embittered ex-jockey in this typically twisty Twilight Zone from 1963. Furious not just at losing his job, but at his 5ft frame (“a short man with a short memory who’s forgotten that he’s worked for the sport of kings,” the narrator, Rod Serling, tells us), he’s visited in his drunken stupor by his more sober alter ego (also played by Rooney), who soon grants him his greatest wish ...There are few TV characters more prone to grandstanding as the Doctor, but never before in Doctor Who’s (then) 52 years had the show given its topline actor such a daunting, impossible-to-resist challenge, to carry an entire 55-minute episode by himself. Imprisoned in a gigantic, shifting clockwork castle, Heaven Sent finds Peter Capaldi’s Doctor trapped in his own personal hell, pursued by a terrifying and silent veiled figure. Loved and loathed in equal measure for its tricksy, bordering on avant-garde storytelling, it’s a virtual showreel for one of Doctor Who’s most underappreciated Doctors.A critically adored, but chronically underwatched slavery drama that ran from 2016 to 2017, Underground hit its creative peak with the season two episode Minty. The real-life American abolitionist hero Harriet Tubman (played here by the mesmerising Aisha Hinds) delivers a titanic speech to a group of white activists. “Ain’t nobody gets to sit this one out, you hear me?” she tells them. Sadly, as sky-scrapingly brilliant as that episode was, it wasn’t enough to save the series, and Underground was canned shortly after."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97c2c2dc2d0641c5d520efd0e78139d70b47361b/990_196_1347_809/master/1347.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66ca3307b7d29b8fd172d63ce6123be3","title":"monsters are heinous but they need collaborators to do their dirty work","story":"Mouths to feed, rent to pay: there’s always an excuse if you’re tempted to do the wrong thing Anyway Ghislaine, accused of procuring underage girls for Epstein, is said to be a free woman in Paris, living in the swanky 8th arrondisement.

Most of them would do it not because they were “bad” people but because they had mouths to feed and rents to pay. In the end, it’s all just paperwork and nothing ever really happens, they would say.

It would have been very serious.”“I think we would have a situation where, in the worst element, the government would have struggled to fund itself in the short run.”Amid widespread investor panic as the virus spread, the Bank of England stepped in by pumping £200bn into the market for UK government bonds under a policy known as quantitative easing (QE). Under QE, the central bank electronically creates money in order to buy bonds from financial institutions with the aim of lowering borrowing costs for the government, businesses and households.By providing an influx of new money into the bond market, the policy can also soothe investor fears over a potential lack of buyers of government bonds, encouraging them to stay in the market. This in turn can help the government to sell new bonds to investors when it needs to borrow money.Although the governor said the country would still have had options available to avoid effective insolvency, he cautioned that it was facing “serious disorder” in financial markets and that the intervention from the central bank was vital.The government’s debt management office, which sells bonds to international investors, said in April it planned to raise £225bn from bond market investors in just four months to fund the huge increase in public spending during the pandemic.However, Britain’s borrowing prospects have improved markedly since the Bank of England intervention. In a sign of the government’s ability to continue attracting investment to fund its response to the Covid-19 pandemic, Britain sold a bond with a negative yield for the first time in May. Negative yields effectively mean investors pay to lend money to the government, and are sought during times of stress as safe-haven investments.During the 2008 financial crisis, the government failed to find enough buyers for some of its debt. However, Bailey said the scale of the shock in government bond markets in March and the risk of effective insolvency were unprecedented.“We basically had a pretty near meltdown of some of the core financial markets,” he said.The rapid spread of Covid-19 and the prospect of the worst global recession since the 1930s Great Depression plunged financial markets into meltdown in March, making it harder for governments and businesses to raise money.Conditions in the market for UK government bonds deteriorated substantially as investors sold sovereign debt, particularly the long-term debt favoured by the UK government, in order to raise cash.Bailey had previously warned of “pretty big dislocations” in financial markets during his first days as the Bank’s governor after replacing Mark Carney on 16 March.The Bank used two emergency interest rate cuts at the onset of the pandemic in Britain to sink borrowing costs to the lowest level in its 326-year history, while also ramping up its quantitative easing programme.Threadneedle Street announced a further £100bn injection into the British economy last week to take the overall size of the bond-buying stimulus package to £745bn.Launched during the 2008 financial crisis, the policy of quantitative easing was maintained over the past decade as the country only gradually recovered from the last recession, with the central bank preferring instead to slowly raise interest rates.Bailey used an article for Bloomberg on Monday to announce a switch in the Bank’s policy, saying that in future it would wind down QE first before raising interest rates."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20f274ecb4eb82167084fa1f8b291059d91b9dd2/0_215_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71bac05d1d98a1f59aadfe1d9b27ae9d","title":"coronavirus global report new covid 19 cases surge south korea israel","story":"New infections in and around Seoul Spain reports 36 new outbreaks New Zealand strengthens bordersAuthorities in South Korea have said the country is experiencing a second wave of the coronavirus in and around Seoul, and warned that stronger physical-distancing measures will be reimposed if the daily increase in infections does not come down.Confirmation of the new wave came as the Israeli government said a lockdown could be reintroduced amid a sharp rise in cases, and a team of contact tracing experts prepared to deploy to the Australian state of Victoria to tackle a new outbreak in Melbourne.The new outbreaks once again highlight the difficulties of fully eradicating the virus, even in countries considered role models in their initial response to the pandemic.They came as the pandemic continued its spread worldwide. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of the World Health Organization, on Monday warned it was still accelerating and while it had taken three months to reach the first one million cases, the last one million had come in just eight days. Known infections are now at more than 8.9m.The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) on Monday said it had become clear that a holiday weekend in early May marked the beginning of a new wave of infections focused in the densely populated Seoul area.“In the metropolitan area, we believe that the first wave was from March to April as well as February to March,” the KCDC director, Jeong Eun-kyeong, told reporters.“Then we see that the second wave, which was triggered by the May holiday, has been going on.”As of midnight on Sunday, South Korea had reported 17 new coronavirus cases – the first time in nearly a month that daily new cases had dropped below 20.It was a drop from the 48 and 67 cases reported in the previous two days. South Korea has reported a total of 12,438 cases, with 280 deaths.At the end of February, South Korea reported a peak of more than 900 cases in a day, in the first large outbreak of the coronavirus outside of China.An intensive tracking and testing campaign reduced the numbers to single digits by late April.But just as the country announced it would be easing physical-distancing guidelines in early May, new cases spiked, driven in part by infections among young people who visited nightclubs and bars in Seoul over the holiday weekend.“We originally predicted that the second wave would emerge in fall or winter,” Jeong said. “Our forecast turned out to be wrong. As long as people have close contact with others, we believe that infections will continue.”The mayor of Seoul, Park Won-soon, said stronger physical-distancing measures would be reintroduced if the daily jump in infections did not dip below an average of 30 over the next three days.Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said his government was weighing up its options amid a significant rise in Covid-19 cases.The country has more than 20,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, with new infections jumping by more than 300 in recent days. At least 305 people have died with the virus since the country’s outbreak began in March.“If we don’t immediately change our behaviour regarding wearing masks and keeping distance, we will bring upon ourselves, against our will, a return to lockdowns,” Netanyahu said on Sunday, adding: “None of us wants this.”The government of South Australia said three contact-tracing experts were being dispatched to Melbourne in neighbouring Victoria, and would spend three weeks helping local health workers there following a new outbreak.Portugal reimposed restrictions in Lisbon on gatherings of more than 10 people and in Spain, three areas in the north-eastern region of Aragón were ordered back into the penultimate phase of the lockdown de-escalation process on Monday after 33 new coronavirus cases were reported on Sunday.“We tackled the outbreak very early and managed to identify cases because we were looking for them,” said the region’s director general of public health, Francisco Javier Falo.Spain’s health minister, Salvador Illa, said the outbreak – concentrated in the Aragonese areas of La Litera, Cinca Medio and Bajo Cinca – was “being brought under control” on Monday morning.Illa said that 36 Covid-19 outbreaks had been detected in Spain in recent days, adding that all were under control.Spain emerged from its three-month state of emergency on Sunday, meaning that people can once again travel between different regions. The country also opened its borders to visitors from the EU and the Schengen area on Sunday.On Monday, New Zealand announced stricter measures to strengthen its border as an increase in flight numbers begins to bring more people home.“While the world enters this dangerous new phase, we remain in a phase of border containment,” said the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern.The government renewed its health order, mandating 14 days of quarantine, including a new measure to ensure that people arriving in New Zealand must have a negative Covid-19 test before leaving quarantine, and may be required to take multiple tests.France, which fully reopened its schools for children under 15 on Monday, on Sunday saw clashes between police and people attending music festivals in Paris and the western city of Nantes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49d3cb279ddd15a2bad807866ff413ea939ec093/0_367_5958_3576/master/5958.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=236ec066e211a022da160de12bf2cf63","title":"coronavirus shielding scheme eased england from 6 july","story":"Government support for most vulnerable will continue until end of July, says Matt HancockPeople with underlying health issues who are most at risk from Covid-19 will no longer have to shut themselves away in their home and can shop and mix with other people from 6 July in England, the health secretary has said.Support for people who are undergoing chemotherapy for cancer, have a damaged immune system or have had an organ transplant will continue to the end of July, said Matt Hancock.But from 1 August, the 2.2 million “clinically extremely vulnerable” who have been shielding from the virus in England will receive only local authority and voluntary help and can return to their jobs if their workplace is “Covid-secure”.The Royal College of Physicians (RCP) warned that patients would be anxious and unsure of what lay ahead.The government has said the levels of infection in the community have dropped far enough to make it safe for the most vulnerable to go out and meet up to six people who are not part of their household outdoors, while keeping their distance. Any who live alone or with a single child will be able to form a “support bubble” with one other household.Ministers say they are committed to maintaining “the unprecedented package of support” until the end of July, to give those shielding time to adjust to the changes. From 1 August, “support will remain available from NHS volunteers and local councils. People will retain their priority for supermarket delivery slots, and still be able to access help with shopping, medication, phone calls and transport to medical appointments,” said a statement from the Department of Health and Social Care.In April the UK government set out these five tests it said had to be met before they would consider easing coronavirus lockdown restrictions:Hancock thanked those who have been shielding since the lockdown began. “I know this has been incredibly tough. Shielding has involved not leaving your house for months, not seeing people you care about, not being able to wander to the park for some fresh air, or even pop to the shops for something you need. This sacrifice has been for a purpose, and I want to thank every single one of you,” he said. The government’s deputy chief medical officer, Dr Jenny Harries, said it knew how difficult the past months had been for the most vulnerable and the impact it had had on their mental health. “The prevalence of the virus in the community is now lower and the chances of getting infected are reduced, so we believe it is the right time to relax some of the advice so people can start to regain a degree of normality once more in their daily lives,” she said.“People should continue to follow social distancing guidance when outside their homes, as well as frequently washing their hands, to minimise the risk of becoming infected. We will continue to monitor the evidence closely and adjust the advice accordingly if there are any changes in the rates of infection that could impact on this group.”The RCP, which represents many of the consultants who look after the most vulnerable, said the announcement would be met with mixed emotions.“The past few weeks and months have been challenging and we know that many patients will be unsure about what lies ahead,” said Prof Donal O’Donoghue, the RCP registrar.“It is crucial that the government builds trust by regularly communicating and engaging with those who have been shielding up to now. Patients are likely to have many questions, and we need to ensure that frontline NHS staff are equipped with the detailed scientific evidence base to be able to support patients to make their shared decisions based on inidual assessments of risk and their personal priorities.” Sue Farrington, chair of the Rare Autoimmune Rheumatic Disease Alliance, said: “Many people who’ve been shielding told us they have felt abandoned, and while an end to shielding is welcome, people are understandably wary and need to know that their concerns aren’t being brushed aside.“We’re particularly concerned about people needing to return to work if their workplace is deemed ‘Covid-safe’. Over the last few months people have told us how the guidance for employers is already too open to interpretation. We really need to see specific guidance on how this will be enforced, how people will be protected, and how any issues will be addressed.”The government says the rates of the virus are now low enough to allow the advice to be “carefully and safely eased”. On average, less than one in 1,700 people are estimated to have the virus, down from one in 500 four weeks ago, said the DHSC.Each extremely vulnerable inidual will receive a letter with advice, telling them of the support available.“I also want to reassure everyone that we will continue to deliver the unprecedented package of support including food and medicine deliveries until the end of July,” said the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick. “You will be sent information that will explain what support is available after that you will not be on your own. Chris Askew, chief executive officer at Diabetes UK, said: “The government has again given little to no acknowledgement of the impact that these changes will have on thousands of people living with conditions such as diabetes, or detailed the support and protections they can expect. By allowing lockdown to continue to ease without specific and enforceable safeguards in place, they are allowing people with diabetes to fall through the cracks.“Thousands of people with diabetes are telling us that social distancing at work is not being made possible, and that employers’ risk assessments are failing to protect them. Without more robust guidance, employers will continue to decide their own ‘acceptable risk’, with no safeguards for inidual staff, or consequences for non-compliance.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf085546083dd1cacabca2dd182d398cbe839415/0_15_5970_3581/master/5970.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe2486b49cf615007fcddb05f4a75c56","title":"us coronavirus spikes first wave not over","story":"29 states reported a jump in cases, while Trump says increased testing is a problem: ‘It makes us look like we have more cases’More than half of all US states have reported a rise in new coronavirus cases, with some breaking daily records. Amid fears of a second wave of Covid-19 infections and deaths, public health officials have warned that the first is far from over.“I think that wherever there’s wood to burn, this fire’s going to burn – and right now we have a lot of susceptible people,” Michael Osterholm, head of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, told NBC on Sunday.“I don’t think we’re going to see one, two and three waves. I think we’re going to just see one very, very difficult forest fire of cases.”In Tulsa on Saturday, Donald Trump said he had asked officials to limit testing, in order to reduce numbers of new cases. On Sunday the White House dismissed the remark as a joke, but on Monday the president again said increased testing was a problem.“It makes us look like we have more cases, especially proportionally, than other countries,” Trump tweeted.Press secretary Kayleigh McEnany later said any suggestion Trump had ordered testing to be slowed was “not rooted in fact”. Asked if it was appropriate to joke about coronavirus when it has killed nearly 120,000 Americans, McEnany said: “He was not joking about coronavirus … he was joking about the media.”According to tracking data from John Hopkins University, 29 states have reported an increase in their seven-day average of new cases.Most new outbreaks are in states such as Georgia, Florida and Texas, which were among the first to launch reopening measures. Young people are especially at risk, with Florida governor Ron DeSantis warning cases have shifted in “a radical direction” toward people under 30.Across southern states, health experts have blasted a lack of social distancing as the summer begins. Younger people, officials say, are also more often asymptomatic, putting immunocompromised friends and family members at risk.The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued warnings on the need for social distancing and face masks as states reopen, rejecting Trump’s notion that an increase in testing is responsible for the spike.But Americans remain ided on wearing face masks in public. Last week, Texas governor Greg Abbott rejected a request from mayors to require masks in their cities.California governor Gavin Newsom has announced that all residents will be required to wear masks. Cases are spiking there, with hospitalizations at the highest rate since the beginning of the pandemic. The state will continue its timeline for reopening."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36ca67a9029f2db34502a713e9c0ea44c7cc673d/0_160_4425_2656/master/4425.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7db5c3f1a300a6b9e8045e6fd80d6914","title":"why doctors say uk better prepared for second wave coronavirus","story":"Drug research, well-practised NHS staff and greater awareness of dangers give reasons for hope When a deluge of coronavirus cases threatened to overwhelm the NHS in March, Covid-19 was a brand new and little-understood disease, causing panic as well as deaths. Hospitals under huge pressure did all they could.Next time round, if, as everyone supposes, there is a next time, it will be different. In a second wave, or even localised spikes across the nation, the health service will know more about what it is dealing with – and will be better able to help people recover and send them home, say doctors.First, two drugs have been shown to work to some extent, even though neither is a cure. Most exciting is the revelation that a 60-year-old steroid, dexamethasone, reduces deaths among those who are most sick – saving one in eight lives among those on ventilators and one in 25 of those on other oxygen support. Remdesivir is also useful, reducing the length of the illness.Mervyn Singer, a professor of intensive care medicine at University College London, is delighted with the dexamethasone result. Covid-19 causes inflammation in the lungs and steroids are already used to reduce inflammation, but he said “medicine is conservative with a small ‘c’”, and some clinicians worried that they suppress the immune system, “so they have generally been used later rather than earlier”. However, the Recovery trial, a global trial into possible treatments, showed how well low-dose dexamethasone works in Covid-19 and it will now become standard of care.He thinks medical staff will next time feel less anxious carrying out procedures such as intubation, which carries the risk of viral particles shooting into the air. They will also be happier about chest compression and humidification – ventilating patients in a way that allows water vapour to emerge when they breathe.“We have become more confident in dealing with it. I think we’d be much less paranoid about the risk of infection. Obviously we wear PPE but the people looking after the patients in intensive care have had a low level of infection – no different from the man in the street – which I think is important because there was a lot of fear,” said Singer.What helps now is the reduced numbers of patients in intensive care with breathing problems. Even in bad flu outbreaks, it was never like the peak numbers for Covid-19. “Normally we’d have two to three of these patients in an intensive care unit. We got up to 62 at one time,” Singer said.“When you have got one nurse to one patient doing everything we normally do, it’s a very different kettle of fish from one nurse to four patients.”Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u0026nbsp1918 influenza pandemic\u0026nbspthat killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics.How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u0026nbspresurgence in infections\u0026nbspdespite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u0026nbspcramped dormitory accommodation\u0026nbspused by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.In June 2020, Beijing suffered from a new cluster of coronavirus cases which caused authorities to re-implement restrictions that CHina had previously been able to lift.Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune iniduals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry right now is that with\u0026nbspa vaccine still many months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.Early on, he and colleagues at UCL realised fewer patients needed ventilation than had been forecast. The assumption that the UK would need 18,000 ventilators when it had 8,000 was one of the reasons it was thought the NHS would be unable to cope with the epidemic – and that led to the lockdown.But only half of the sickest patients were intubated and put on a machine, while just as many have been given other help with their breathing, such as with the use of a Cpap (continuous positive airway pressure) mask. The long-term outcomes are better.Clinicians also now have more idea of which patients are likely to become sickest. There was a lot of talk earlier on about the “cytokine storm” triggered by the patients’ immune system going into overdrive and attacking its own cells. “If you look at the data, it isn’t particularly high,” Singer said.There is a hyper-inflammatory reaction from the body, but it manifests in a different way and can be measured by a standard inflammatory marker called C-reactive protein, or CRP. “It’s part of the body’s host response. It goes up hugely in Covid, whereas cytokine levels don’t go up very much,” he said.It means a patient’s CRP level can be checked on arrival in hospital. It is the patients who are more hyper-inflamed who are more likely to die. “We can target those patients more or less as they come through the door,” said Singer.One of the big and alarming surprises has been the damage Covid-19 does to the heart and circulatory system. “There is a really increased risk of clotting, probably due to damage to the blood vessels,” said Prof Sir Nilesh Samani, the medical director of the British Heart Foundation. “The virus attacks the lining of the blood vessels and makes them more likely to clot.”People who have had heart attacks or strokes are more vulnerable to the virus, which can also cause them in sick patients. “The heart attacks are peculiar,” said Samani. “It is the smaller arteries downstream that are affected, where the inflammation is more acute.”One small study looking at the lungs of people who died, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found they had nine times as many blood clots as people who died from swine flu (H1N1).Knowing the danger, many hospitals are now giving those at risk anticoagulants and antiplatelet therapy soon after admission. These are drugs that thin the blood, making clotting less likely.“The lesson we have learned is that we should treat these people before they have the clot,” said Samani. The risk can be measured by looking at the levels of D-dimers in the blood. These are proteins – the leftovers from the normal clotting of blood when people have a wound that heals, for instance. But high levels can indicate a clot is forming.The British Heart Foundation, together with the government’s National Institute for Health Research, is supporting six major research programmes to discover more about the effects of the virus. These will combine data from hospitals, information about our health and lifestyle, genetic studies, and imaging and artificial intelligence techniques.That research, and much more in other fields, will help find the optimal way to treat Covid-19 patients and reduce the death rate when – and if – it returns."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4500f164afa936e22cd9a2a5d497f43502f5100/0_214_5364_3218/master/5364.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a874c36819e3efe4586e2b60d59f4a8","title":"coronavirus live news covid 19 update china us uk brazil latest updates","story":"China halts imports from food plant where 481 tested positive New York shops and bars reopen Lisbon brings back lockdown restrictionsCanada’s prime minister Justin Trudeau on Monday pushed back against pressure from airlines to reopen the nation’s borders, saying moving too quickly could spark a second wave of infections.“I understand there are a lot of tourism firms and airlines who would like us to be able to once again to welcome tourists,” Trudeau told a daily briefing, according to Reuters.Last week, a group of 27 leading executives added to calls for looser air travel restrictions in a open letter published in the Globe and Mail newspaper.A senior official with Air Canada, the country’s largest airline, urged the government on Monday to quickly reopen borders and dilute quarantine requirements, citing what other nations were doing.“Otherwise our sector and the Canadian economy will suffer far longer than it needs to,” Ferio Pugliese, senior vice president of government relations, told the House of Commons health committee.Canada and the United States last week extended a ban on non-essential travel to late July. Washington and Ottawa introduced month-long restrictions in March and renewed them in April and May.“I understand how difficult this is and how frustrating this is for some people but ... we are going to be very, very careful about when and how we start reopening international borders,” Trudeau said.Bank of Canada governor Tiff Macklem told reporters later on Monday that “airlines are going to take longer to come back than some other parts of the economy”. Hello everyone, I’m taking over from my colleague Damien Gayle. As always, please do not hesitate to get in touch if you have relevant updates to share, you can email me or message me on Twitter.Key updates in our global coronavirus coverage so far on Monday include:Confirmation that the Ryder Cup, due to be held in September at Whistling Straits, will be postponed until 2021 is expected next week, writes Ewan Murray in an exclusive report for the ’s sports desk. The PGA of America has announced the first major of the year, the US PGA Championship, will be held in early August without spectators. Talks between the PGA of America and the European Tour, who preside jointly over the Ryder Cup, and local government officials in Wisconsin are now close to completion despite a public line of “no change” to existing arrangements. Work on the spectator build at Whistling Straits, ordinarily well under way by now, is not believed to have meaningfully started.With health and safety concerns to the fore – playing the biennial competition without spectators has never been a serious option – postponement is now seen as the most responsible solution. As recently as last month, hopes had been raised that the Ryder Cup could take place. The relevant parties have considered the US and Europe facing off in front of reduced numbers, with around 25,000 per day mooted, but that isn’t now thought viable amid coronavirus concerns. Ongoing travel restrictions – such as quarantine – are also a factor.More than half of all US states have reported a rise in new coronavirus cases, with some breaking daily records, Kenya Evelyn reports from Washington for  US. Amid fears of a second wave of Covid-19 infections and deaths, public health officials have warned that the first is far from over.“I think that wherever there’s wood to burn, this fire’s going to burn – and right now we have a lot of susceptible people,” Michael Osterholm, head of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, told NBC on Sunday.“I don’t think we’re going to see one, two and three waves. I think we’re going to just see one very, very difficult forest fire of cases.”In Tulsa on Saturday, Donald Trump said he had asked officials to limit testing, in order to reduce numbers of new cases. On Sunday the White House dismissed the remark as a joke, but on Monday the president again said increased testing was a problem.“It makes us look like we have more cases, especially proportionally, than other countries,” Trump tweeted.According to tracking data from John Hopkins University, 29 states have reported an increase in their seven-day average of new cases.The Netherlands reported zero new deaths from Covid-19 on Monday, the first day since the beginning of March that the country’s pandemic death toll has not risen. Deaths reported by Dutch national institute for public health are not necessarily from the past 24 hours, so it cannot be confirmed that no one has died from coronavirus-related illness. But it is the first day since 12 March that no death has been reported. The country’s total death toll is 6,090. Sixty-nine more people had tested positive for the virus, according to the latest update, pushing the total number of cases in the country so far to 49,658. The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus around the world since the outbreak began has passed 9 million, according to Johns Hopkins University. The US-based research university, which keeps a tally of official statistics, said that so far 9,003,042 cases had been reported. The United States is the world’s worst affected country by case numbers, with nearly 2.3 million cases alone, followed by Brazil with nearly 1.1 million, then Russia, with nearly 600,000. According to data collected by the World Health Organization, Sunday saw the biggest rise in cases so far, with 183,020 new infections reported by health authorities around the world in a single day. The Americas is the world’s worst affected region, followed by Europe, then the Eastern Mediterranean, according to WHO data.The vice-president of the European Central Bank, Luis de Guindos, has warned that the eurozone economy may be in for more pain if measures aimed at containing the coronavirus outbreak are eased too soon, Reuters reports.“There are substantial downside risks, in particular if the easing of containment measures turns out to be premature or their impact on productive capacity is more persistent,” De Guindos told an event in Frankfurt on Monday, the first he has attended in person in several weeks.But he added that the risk of the bloc’s economic crisis morphing into a financial crisis had “receded materially” since March.French Guiana is battling a surge in Covid-19 cases, with the head of the French South American territory’s health authority suggesting that infections are spreading from across the border with Brazil, Associated Press reports.The R number, which indicates how many people will be contaminated on average by an infected person, has climbed to 1.8, said Clara de Bort, head of the regional health authority. That suggests each infected person is passing the virus on to nearly two other people on average.Speaking on France-Info radio, De Bort said French authorities were considering reimposing movement restrictions on the territory’s 300,000 people to bring the outbreak back under control. The outbreak is expected to peak in July. “The peak still hasn’t been reached,” De Bort said. “We fear that we’re only at the beginning of the upswing of the epidemic.”She suggested it was impossible to stop the illness crossing from Brazil: “The pressure from our immense neighbour and the 700 km (400 miles) of frontiers that we share is necessarily huge.”Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, has come under fire for failing to pay tribute to the more than 50,000 citizens who have lost their lives to Covid-19, writes Tom Phillips, the ’s Latin America correspondent, in Rio de Janeiro.Brazil’s official death toll – now the second highest in the world – officially rose above 50,000 on Sunday. On Friday the number of confirmed infections rose above one million, also the second highest total after the US.But according to the Brazilian media, Bolsonaro – who has repeatedly trivialized the pandemic – was silent about the dead and their families between Friday and Monday.“Despite the tragic milestones we have reached in the last few days, president Jair Bolsonaro has said nothing … about the victims or the fight against this illness,” the conservative Estado de São Paulo newspaper complained on Monday. “He has also been silent on social media.”The newspaper said that by ignoring the human toll of the pandemic, Bolsonaro’s government was trying to hide the fact that Covid-19 had now claimed more Brazilian lives than guns did in the whole of 2019.In a column, Leonardo Sakamoto, a left-wing commentator, attacked Bolsonaro’s “militant denialism”. “But you can’t say he didn’t fight. Bolsonaro has fought, bravely, in the name of coronavirus – and has become known as one of its staunchest defenders in the world,” Sakamoto wrote.In an editorial, the newspaper O Globo said there was no doubt Bolsonaro bore responsibility for what was still “an unfinished tragedy”. “What is most scary is that, according to WHO officials … Brazil still hasn’t reached the peak of the epidemic.”Hi, this is Damien Gayle hopping into the hot seat for the next little while.

Mexico opted for disease modelling instead of Covid-19 testing and is now paying a steep price as it becomes the country with the seventh highest death toll in the world, according to this report for Canada’s Globe and Mail.The handling of the pandemic is also taking a toll on the popularity of Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador.Britain came close to effective insolvency at the onset of the coronavirus crisis as financial markets plunged into turmoil, the governor of the Bank of England has said.Laying bare the scale of the national emergency at the early stages of the pandemic, Andrew Bailey said the government would have struggled to finance the running of the country without support from the central bank.Asked in an interview with Sky News what would have happened had the Bank not intervened, Bailey said: “I think the prospects would have been very bad. It would have been very serious.Portugal’s prime minister, António Costa, has said some coronavirus restrictions would be reimposed in Lisbon to help control outbreaks.Costa said measures to be introduced from Tuesday included a restriction on gatherings of more than 10 people and orders for cafes and shops to close at 8pm in the capital.“Certain measures will be applied to the capital region,” the premier said a press conference after meeting with mayors of several municipalities.According to official data compiled by local media, between 21 May and 21 June, Portugal recorded 9,221 new cases of Covid-19 with most cases detected in the Lisbon and Tagus Valley regions.Costa had been tweeting recently about the reopening of Lisbon’s Teatro Nacional.Many countries that have been successful in tackling the coronavirus are encountering increases in cases due to religious events and people meeting in other vulnerable settings such as expat gatherings, the World Health Organization’s Maria Van Kerkhove has told the briefing.“Any opportunity that the virus has to take hold, it will. It is really important that countries are in a position to rapidly detect these cases,” she said."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"French president created convention in April 2019 in response to gilets jaunes revoltMinister for Climate Action and Environment says funds would go to just transitionFund will use levy on oil companies to invest in green projects over the next decade"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climateTime to restore meadows once full of insects and nectar in summer and spires of seeds in winter"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Julien BehalPA WireThe vast majority of the Irish economy and society will reopen at the end of month as the country prepares to almost fully exit the lockdown imposed following the spread of the coronavirus.The Cabinet met on Friday to sign off on a new roadmap which will see the majority of businesses reopen on June 29th.From then places of worship, gyms, cinemas, restaurants, hotels, leisure facilities and hairdressers can reopen their doors alongside museums, galleries, theatres and concert halls.All sporting activity, including close-contact sport, will resume, including team leagues for adults and children. Funding of €70 million to help the sports sector reopen was also approved by Ministers.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar stressed the public must now take “personal responsibility” as the State-imposed restrictions were lifted. “This means not entering a place if you see it is packed. It means leaving somewhere, even if you are having a good time, if you have been there for too long. It means exercising judgment and self-control for your own sake, but also for the collective good”.Most music venues can open their doors, as well as bingo halls, arcades and amusement parks. Choirs and music practice can also resume, but with strict social distancing and ideally outdoors.Gatherings will be limited to 50 people indoors and 200 people outdoors until July 20th.This is later due to rise to 100 people indoors and 500 people outdoors, although a further review will be carried out by the public-health team in the coming weeks.PreschoolsCreches, childminders and preschools will be opened only for children of essential workers, however this will expand to include all workers on a phased basis from late July. All other children’s activities and venues will be reopened from the end of the month.People will also be permitted to travel throughout the country, and travel to offshore islands can also resume. Those planning to travel to different counties will be asked to “acquaint themselves with the level of transmission of the virus in the relevant area”.There will be no specific number for gatherings in private homes but the public-health team has asked that physical distancing be maintained.Cocooning for those over 70 will continue to be recommended, the roadmap states.In its advice to Government, the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) said “the risk of a large surge of infection remains ever present and Covid-19 will continue to be a threat to the world for the foreseeable future”.“As the public-health restrictions are lifted and there are no longer detailed rules in place imposed by the State, everybody in society will now exercise their own judgment and take personal responsibility for decisions that they make about the risk of infection to themselves and others in different situations.”The existing ban on rent increases and evictions has also been extended until July 20th following Cabinet approval.Minister for Health Simon Harris said that it was “unlikely” that there would be a return to the kind of restrictions previously put in place in March, while chief medical officer Tony Holohan said the NPHET would now begin to consider measures “at a national level, or below national level” should there be a spike in cases.“It won’t be the same set of measures that we introduced in March,” he said.Mr Holohan said he did not believe the measures were being lifted too quickly. “We think it is appropriate for where we think we are in terms of the transmission of the disease,” he said.Mr Harris also said the National Screening Service would outline its plans for the resumption of routine cancer screening by the end of the month but that programmes would likely reopen on a phased basis over the summer.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4285265.1592820863!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"stormont poised to allow six people to gather indoors","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Stormont executive is poised to allow up to six people to gather in an indoor setting. File photograph: PAStormont ministers are considering further easing of Northern Ireland’s lockdown on Monday.The executive is poised to allow up to six people to gather in an indoor setting.The final decision at the meeting of the executive on Monday afternoon will depend on the latest evidence on the suppression of the disease.On Saturday, Northern Ireland’s heath trust labs reported no new confirmed cases of coronavirus for the first time since lockdown.The daily update from Northern Ireland’s Department of Health revealed there were no positive results in the 995 tests analysed in their labs through Friday.It was the first day since March that no new positive tests had been reported in a 24-hour period by health trust labs across the region. There was one coronavirus-linked death announced on Saturday and none announced on Sunday.Earlier this month, ministers approved the creation of indoor social bubbles involving one person living on their own and another household, without the need for social distancing restrictions.While a move to allow six people to gather indoors would allow for multiple people from different households to meet inside, it is set to have some social distancing guidance attached.The suppression of the virus in the region has prompted Stormont ministers to quicken Northern Ireland’s exit out of lockdown.Traffic wardens were back on the beat across the region on Monday after the lockdown suspension of on-street parking charges was lifted.From June 26th, caravan parks, campsites and self-contained tourist accommodation will be able to reopen. A week later, on July 3rd, hotels, restaurants, cafes, coffee shops, pubs and bars will be able to welcome customers back.Church services are set to resume on June 29th while a provisional date for hair salons, barbers and nail bars to reopen has been set for July 6th.Guidance advising people in high-risk categories to shield indoors is to be paused at the end of July.Stormont ministers have also announced plans for childcare services to start to look after more children over the summer.They are also seeking to maximise the number of children who can return to school on a full-time basis in the autumn by reducing the social distancing measure for pupils from two to one metres."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Percentage of adults wearing face coverings up from 34 per cent to 41 per centPatricia O\u0026rsquoConnor\u0026rsquos siblings \u0026lsquostill in disbelief\u0026rsquo at grandmother\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquocruel and brutal murder\u0026rsquoMan (60) to remain in hospital for several days after extraction from Hartstown houseFriends of the Irish Environment brings challenge to National Mitigation PlanKeith Harrison alleged bias due to judge having worked before with superintendentTommy Craggs carved into Monterey cypress tree in St Anne\u0026rsquos Park over three yearsRoss Maher (22) topless and covered in blood when he swung kitchen knife several timesMinister for Climate Action and Environment says funds would go to just transitionJackpot not yet claimed, residents of area being urged to check their tickets carefullyJudge says fortunate at least two of attacks by Pavel Kratochvil did not end up as fatalitiesActor will participate in a web livestream on Monday evening to discuss fracking and the programme for governmentFSAI says plant-based \u0026lsquomilks\u0026rsquo and sugary cereals should be avoidedWarnings had been put in place at Dollymount, Sandymount and PortmarnockPSNI appeals for information on Thomas McCabe who has been at large for more than two yearsDeadline extended last week to facilitate small number of schools who had not completed processSecond group of Defence Forces personnel due to return to Ireland on July 2ndDaily briefing reveals 32,800 less unemployment payments issued than last weekNew online survey provides \u0026lsquostark depiction\u0026rsquo of experiences of many students in IrelandRaids have taken place in Limerick, Clare and Tipperary under Operation CoronationOn Saturday Northern Ireland reported no new confirmed cases of coronavirusStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4285507.1592838810!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"winning ticket for 7m jackpot sold on south side of cork city","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe winning ticketholder has yet to make contact with Lotto HQ to make arrangements to claim their prize.

Photo:Gareth ChaneyCollins PhotosThe pro-coalition wing of the Green Party has enlisted Hollywood actor Mark Ruffalo for a live seminar on Monday night, as part of its final push to win over the support of the membership for the programme for government.Party leader Eamon Ryan and deputy leader Catherine Martin announced that Mr Ruffalo - who received Oscar nominations for his roles in The Kids are Alright and Foxcather and also played the Incredible Hulk in the Marvel movie of the same name - will participate in a web livestream on Monday evening to discuss fracking and the programme for government.Mr Ruffalo has also been a prominent environmental campaigner for many years and has been particularly active in the anti-fracking movement in the United States.The event called “Ireland’s Green Future” will highlight the programme for government’s undertaking to stop US fracked gas imports.In a statement issued on Monday Mr Ryan said: “That would make Ireland the first nation in the world to do so. Instead of powering Ireland from increased fracked gas imports, the PFG also states that Ireland will lead the world on renewable energy procuring at least 70 per cent renewable electricity by 2030.”Ahead of the event Mr Ruffalo said: “For years, US and Irish campaigners have worked together to achieve a ban on fracking in Ireland. Now the PFG is an opportunity for a monumental achievement for Ireland to become the first country in the world to ban fracked gas imports. This is crucial for our shared climate, as well as for the public health of Americans.”With both camps in the party accepting the decision will be very tight, the respective campaigns have ramped up considerably on Monday in the final hours of canvassing.While the vote is not being counted until Friday, it is a postal vote so the last votes are expected to be cast tomorrow to allow delivery to party headquarters. Some 2,000 members of the party are expected to participate in the internal ballot with a two-thirds majority required if the party is to enter coalition.The 7:00PM livestream event will be available at: https:us02web.zoom.usj84198289424‘On a knife edge’Earlier on Monday Mr Ryan says if his party’s members reject the programme for government “it would be very hard for us to go back to the negotiating table.”Mr Ryan has described the programme for government as a “left wing document” and the best approach to repair the economy.He said he did not know what would happen if party members rejected it.Opponents of the deal were also lobbying fiercely, with Green party sources on both sides predicting a tight result when the votes are counted on Friday.One Green TD said the vote was “on a knife edge” with a two-thirds majority needed if it is to be ratified.Mr Ryan agreed that the vote by Green Party members on the programme could be very close, but he was hopeful that members would sign off on the document.The outcome of the membership votes among the three parties will be announced on Friday.Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil members are expected to ratify it but all three must back the deal in order for Fianna Fail leader Micheál Martin to be elected taoiseach when the Dáil sits this Saturday.The Green Party has the highest threshold of the three parties to secure the approval of its membership.Two thirds of members registered to vote on the proposals must back the deal.ConcernHowever, one of the TDs who negotiated the deal, Neasa Hourigan, has said she will vote against the deal, while a number of Green members have voiced their concern about it.The leader of the Green Party in Northern Ireland, Clare Bailey, has also called for a no vote.Speaking on Newstalk Breakfast, Mr Ryan acknowledged that the Green Party would be going into government at one of the most challenging times possible and that there would be risks and uncertainties.The new coalition government will need to invest in public housing, public health, public transport and climate action which will require the State to be “bigger,” he said.“In the particular crisis at the moment, the best approach to get the country back working again is actually to borrow and invest in stimulus and employment. The programme for government says we’re going to do that for the next two or three years.”Following that there would need to be a review and the books would have to be balanced again in the long run. “But even then there’s an agreement that we would try to balance the current account, we would continue to borrow for capital investment,” Mr Ryan said.‘Difficult week’Speaking on Monday morning, Tánaiste Simon Coveney said he believes the deal can be approved. However, he said nothing can be ruled out, including a second general election this year, if parties do not vote to pass the draft government deal.“I think we will have to have that debate when it happens. I’m a positive person and I believe we can get this done this week and that is what the country wants us to do,” Mr Coveney said on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland.Asked if another election could be on the cards if the deal does not pass, he said: “Well I mean we can’t rule out anything. Our focus will be on getting this deal passed and putting in place a government that can work for people when the country needs it.”He said this is a difficult week for Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the Green Party because there is ision among members and politicians about the deal.He said: “In many ways, within Fine Gael there are lots of people who still find it difficult to contemplate going into government with Fianna Fáil in particular.“Politics has changed and if Fine Gael defines itself by its past and its past relationship with Fianna Fáil then I believe the electorate will move away from us. We have got to define ourselves by what we want for the future.”When asked about opposition to the deal, voiced by Ms Hourigan, he said she was part of the negotiating team that signed off on the deal.He said: “She did not get everything she wanted in the deal... nor did I”.DivisionFine Gael and Fianna Fáil are sharply ided on what to do if Green Party members reject the proposed coalition government deal between the three parties this week.Sources in the parties expect a political crisis to arise if the programme for government is not endorsed by Green members this week, with a deadline for renewing the Offences Against the State Act on Tuesday, June 30th, looming.Several senior Fine Gael figures, including a number of Cabinet Ministers, told The  on Sunday they would not form a government with Fianna Fáil and Independent TDs if the Green Party rejected the programme. Fianna Fáil sources say the party can form a government supported by or including Independents if the Greens do not endorse the deal, while some party sources also believe Labour can be persuaded to join the process if the Greens reject the proposal.-Additional reporting PA"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4284892.1592764670!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sharp divisions between ff and fg on what next if greens reject coalition","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGreen Party leader Eamon Ryan: engaged in intensive campaigning at the weekend to persuade  membership to back the coalition programme.

Opponents of the deal were also lobbying fiercely, with party sources on both sides predicting a tight result when the votes are counted on Friday. One Green TD said the vote was “on a knife edge” with a two-thirds majority needed if it is to be ratified. “It’ll be decided in the next 24 hours,” Mr Ryan said on Sunday. Several senior Fine Gael figures, including a number of Cabinet Ministers, told The  they would not form a government with Fianna Fáil and Independent TDs if the Green Party rejected the programme.‘This or nothing’“We can’t put together a government with Independents. It’s this or nothing. People need to understand what our position is,” one Minister said.Another Minister said they did not believe a Fianna Fáil-Fine Gael-Independent arrangement would result in “a sustainable government”. Fianna Fáil sources say the party can form a government supported by or including Independents if the Greens do not endorse the deal, while some party sources also believe Labour can be persuaded to join the process if the Greens reject the proposal.Some in Fine Gael spoke of a different “plan B”, which would see the Dáil asked to vote in Leo Varadkar as taoiseach on the understanding that it was only for the purpose of appointing 11 senators to complete the Seanad and allow the upper house to vote to renew the Offences Against the State Act before June 30th.If both Houses of the Oireachtas have not voted to continue the Act by then, several anti-terror and anti-gangland provisions – including those underpinning the Special Criminal Court – will lapse. Strong campaigningThere is, however, likely to be strong opposition to this idea in Fianna Fáil. It is understood the three party leaders have briefly discussed the eventuality, but have not agreed what to do if the deal is rejected.Supporters and opponents of the deal in all three parties spent the weekend engaged in intensive campaigning. Mr Varadkar and Tánaiste Simon Coveney addressed an online Fine Gael event, urging delegates to back the deal, while Fianna Fáil TDs campaigned in their constituencies. Fianna Fáil will break down the results by constituency, providing an incentive for TDs hopeful of ministerial promotions to secure strong backing for the deal in their area.Mr Coveney acknowledged in Sunday night’s Fine Gael event that the 7 per cent reduction in carbon emissions would not be met in “the first few years”, but said the average annual reduction targets would be met over its lifetime. Mr Varadkar said most of these emissions reductions would happen in the second half of the decade."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Officials prepare \u0026lsquoretaliatory punishment\u0026rsquo after anti-North balloons arrived from SouthBan on cruise ships extended beyond June 30th cases increase as more citizens return homeCovid-19 outbreak in staff at Tyson foods in Arkansas sparks Beijing U-turn on policyChina says draft law is aimed at separatist activity, subversion, terrorism and collusion abroadChina may have shut down its controversial re-education camps, but minorities are still persecutedSamira Imin\u0026rsquos father was incarcerated for three years in XinjiangDelhi says Chinese dammed a river and lay in wait for clash in which 20 Indians diedCases widely seen as Chinese \u0026lsquohostage diplomacy\u0026rsquo following arrest of Huawei\u0026rsquos chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou in VancouverInvestigators say they have found gun and are talking to two \u0026lsquopeople of interest\u0026rsquoTensions remain high despite two governments agreeing to de-escalate confrontationAustralia says it will not name country responsibleKim Yo-jong\u0026rsquos criticism of Seoul illustrates her seniority and potential to become rulerBatons wrapped in barbed wire used in high-altitude brawl in which 20 Indian soldiers diedNZ officials tracing 320 people regarded as \u0026lsquoclose contacts\u0026rsquo of pair who returned from UKClash on Himalayan border is the most serious since 1967, why now and what next?Any moves to invalidate peace deals posemajor setback to Moon\u0026rsquos efforts for more lasting reconciliation with NorthFirst loss of life in area for decades as \u0026lsquoviolent face-off\u0026rsquo between troops elevates disputeLatest in a series of threats from the Kim regime since diplomacy with US broke downFierce criticism as editor of influential Rappler website faces up to six years in jailChile replaces health minister as deaths spiral while global cases exceed 7.6 millionStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4285178.1592824987!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus who reports record increase in cases worldwide","story":"Supporters of Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro have taken to the streets of São Paulo to call for an end to coronavirus restrictions, even as the country passed 50,000 Covid-19 deaths.

Photograph: STRAFPGetty Images More than 8.9 million cases of coronavirus have been recorded worldwide with more than 468,300 deaths, according to the latest data from Johns Hopkins University.The World Health Organisation reported a record increase in global coronavirus cases on Sunday, with the total rising by 183,020 in a 24-hour period. The biggest increase was from North and South America with over 116,000 new cases.The following is a summary of the latest developments on the virus around the world:South KoreaHealth authorities in South Korea said for the first time on Monday it is in the midst of a “second wave” of novel coronavirus infections around Seoul, driven by small but persistent outbreaks stemming from a holiday in May.The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) had previously said South Korea’s first wave had never really ended.But on Monday, KCDC director Jeong Eun-kyeong said it had become clear that a holiday weekend in early May marked the beginning of a new wave of infections focused in the densely populated greater Seoul area, which had previously seen few cases.At the end of February, South Korea reported a peak of more than 900 cases in a day, in the first large outbreak of the coronavirus outside of China.An intensive tracking and testing campaign reduced the numbers to single digits by late April.But just as the country announced it would be easing social distancing guidelines in early May, new cases spiked, driven in part by infections among young people who visited nightclubs and bars in Seoul over the holiday weekend.“We originally predicted that the second wave would emerge in fall or winter,” Jeong said. “Our forecast turned out to be wrong. As long as people have close contact with others, we believe that infections will continue.”Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon told a briefing that while daily numbers may be at manageable levels, if recent infection rates continued the city could soon see hundreds of cases a day.As of midnight Sunday, South Korea reported 17 new coronavirus cases, the first time in nearly a month that daily new cases had dropped below 20. It was a drop from the 48 and 67 cases reported in the previous two days. South Korea has reported a total of 12,438 cases, with 280 deaths.BrazilBrazil, the world’s number two coronavirus hot spot after the United States, officially passed 50,000 coronavirus deaths on Sunday, a blow for a country already grappling with more than 1 million cases, rising political instability and a crippled economy.Brazil now has a total of 1,085,038 confirmed cases and 50,617 deaths, up from 49,976 on Saturday, the health ministry said. Experts say the true numbers are a lot higher because of a lack of widespread testing. Latin America’s largest country has typically recorded more than 1,000 deaths a day, but usually registers fewer on the weekends.Brazil confirmed its first case of the novel coronavirus on February 26th and passed 1 million cases on Friday. Since first arriving in the country, the virus’ rapid spread has eroded support for right-wing president Jair Bolsonaro and has raised fears of economic collapse after years of anaemic growth.Mr Bolsonaro, sometimes called the “Tropical Trump,” has been widely criticized for his handling of the crisis. The country still has no permanent health minister after losing two since April, following clashes with the president.Mr Bolsonaro has shunned social distancing, calling it a job-killing measure more dangerous than the virus itself. He has also promoted two anti-malarial drugs as remedies, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, despite little evidence they work.On Sunday, Mr Bolsonaro said the military serves the will of the people and its mission is to defend democracy, adding fuel to a raging debate about the armed forces’ role amid rumbling fears of political fragility.His comments came on the same day his supporters and detractors gathered in cities across the country, in a stark symbol of the polarization in Latin America’s largest country.ChinaChina reported 18 new coronavirus cases for June 21st, 9 of which were in the capital Beijing, the National Health Commission said on Monday. This compared with 26 confirmed cases a day earlier, 22 of which were in Beijing. Local authorities are restricting movement of people in the capital and stepping up other measures to prevent the virus from spreading following a series of local infections.USThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Sunday reported 2,248,029 cases of new coronavirus, an increase of 32,411 cases from its previous count and said that the number of deaths had risen by 560 to 119,615. The US has the highest number of cases and deaths in the world. Initial studies suggest protests after George Floyd’s death haven’t seemed to increase the rate of spread of the coronavirus, but Tom Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said it was too soon to rule out the events as a source of infections. “We know from what we’ve seen so far in the last few months that outdoors is less of a risk than indoors and that mask use has a major impact,” he said on Fox News Sunday. The rally for president Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on Saturday is concerning, he said, because people were sitting close together, few wore masks and hands were being shaken without sanitising. “All of those things will increase the risk of spread. We have seen in the past few months around the world that indoor gatherings have been the source of most super-spreading events.”The rise brings with it the possibility of renewed restrictions on activity in Europe’s largest economy - a blow to a country that so far had widely been seen as successful in curbing the coronavirus spread and keeping the death toll relatively low. Public health officials at RKI said that the country’s coronavirus reproductive number climbed to 2.88 on Sunday due to local outbreaks in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia where there is a large cluster of infection among meat plant workers. To keep the pandemic under control, Germany needs the reproduction rate to drop below one. The reproduction rate of 2.88 means that out of 100 people who contract the virus, a further 288 people will get infected. Authorities in Germany’s Goettingen and North Rhine Westphalia regions have called on police to enforce quarantine measures following the rise in local infections.UKBritish prime minister Boris Johnson will unveil the latest easing of Britain’scoronavirus lockdown on Tuesday when he will also announce the conclusion of a review into whether a two-metre rule on social distancing should be relaxed. Britain’s economy has been hammered by the lockdown to stop the spread of Covid-19 and although non-essential retailers were allowed to reopen last Monday, many businesses, particularly in the hospitality and leisure sectors, have remained closed. Some lawmakers in Mr Johnson’s party have been vocal in calling for him to drop the two-metre rule saying it was having a devastating impact on the economy which shrank by a quarter over March and April. But the government has been cautious, saying it did not want to risk a second spike in novel coronavirus cases. Britain has one of the highest death tolls in the world from Covid-19, but the number of cases has been steadily falling in recent weeks. The death toll on Sunday of confirmed cases rose by 43 to 42,632, one of the lowest increases since the lockdown was imposed in March.MexicoMexico on Sunday reported 5,343 new infections and 1,044 additional deaths from the coronavirus that causes Covid-19, the health ministry said, bringing the totals for the country to 180,545 cases and 21,825 deaths. The government has said the actual number of infected people is likely significantly higher than the confirmed cases.South AfricaThe outbreak in South Africa is about to peak and the government expects hospitals to start filling up with patients, health minister Zweli Mkhize said. The number of new infections is projected to first peak in the Western Cape, which has been hardest hit by the pandemic, followed by Gauteng and the Eastern Cape province, Mr Mkhize said in an interview with radio station Safm on Monday.FranceThe number of deaths in France from Covid-19 has risen by seven from the previous day to stand at 29,640 said the country’s national health service on Sunday. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases rose by 284 to 160,377.ItalyItaly reported 24 deaths from Covid-19 on Sunday, compared with 49 a day earlier, the Civil Protection Agency said, while the daily tally of new cases stood at 224 from 262 on Saturday. The country’s death toll since the outbreak came to light on Feb. 21 now stands at 34,634, the agency said, the world’s fourth-highest after the United States, Brazil and Britain.ThailandThailand on Monday reported three new coronavirus cases, all imported, marking 28 days without local transmission, a senior official said. The three new cases were Thai nationals returning from India and were detected in state quarantine, said spokesman for the government’s Centre for Covid-19 Situation Administration, Taweesin Wisanuyothin. Thailand has so far recorded 58 deaths related to COVID-19 among 3,151 infections, of which 3,022 patients have recovered. Taweesin said the administration was coordinating with Myanmar authorities regarding 23 coronavirus cases found among migrants deported from Thailand.AustraliaAustralia’s second-most populous state has tightened coronavirus controls as a spike in cases triggers fears the nation could be hit by a second wave of infections. Victoria extended a state of emergency by four weeks to July 20th, halved the number of visitors allowed in homes to five and delayed a planned increase in the size of gatherings in cafes, restaurants and pubs. Australia has managed to limit the total number of coronavirus cases to 7,460 by closing international and state borders, quarantining returning residents, social distancing measures and a widespread testing and tracing regime. But concerns are growing about community transmission in Victoria, responsible for 116 new cases in the past week – 83 per cent of the national total.–PA, Reuters, , BloombergEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4285289.1592825464!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus sweden starts debating rights and wrongs of approach","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeople walk in Drottninggatan during rush hour in Stockholm Photograph: Jonathan NackstrandAFP via Getty ImagesThe two sides of Sweden’s against-the-grain coronavirus strategy are visible from a small square in northeastern Gothenburg.On one side lies Gerashus care home, where more than a quarter of residents have died in the past three months, most of them from Covid-19. At the peak of the outbreak, two-thirds of its staff were absent.On the other side of the square is a bustling tram stop where dozens of people wait to head into the centre of Sweden’s second city and children come from a primary school. A steady stream of customers head into a convenience store to collect online shopping parcels or buy lottery tickets. Nobody wears a mask but most keep a metre’s distance from each other.“Life is the same really. There are people coming in all the time. You don’t think too much about corona. Everybody is going about their normal lives,” says 58-year-old Adrian, working in the store from behind a Plexiglas counter.As the only EU country not to adopt a harsh lockdown, this light-touch coronavirus strategy has sparked enormous international attention – especially from right-wing populists who believe the virus has been over-hyped.Sweden has chosen to focus on public health in the broadest sense, aiming to keep as much of society open as possible, including restaurants, schools and fitness centres as well as its borders. The Scandinavian country of 10m people has relied on voluntary recommendations for social distancing and homeworking in their effort to flatten the curve enough to allow its healthcare system to keep functioning.But a far higher death toll per capita than its Nordic neighbours has led Norway, Denmark and Finland – all of whom locked down – to open their borders to each other but keep them closed to Sweden.Swedes appear bewildered by the sudden scrutiny they are under. There is a widespread feeling that their decision to keep schools open for children up to the age of 16 was a wise one, but also that they have failed to protect their most vulnerable in care homes such as Gerashus.Acting rationallyMany Swedes were initially reassured that its response to the crisis has been led by healthcare experts, not politicians, fuelling a belief that it acted rationally as other countries responded emotionally. But the stubbornly high death toll – 102 new deaths were announced last Wednesday, more than Norway has had in the past two months cumulatively – has led to sharper domestic criticism of officials, including Anders Tegnell, the state epidemiologist who crafted Sweden’s approach.The result is that everything is now up for discussion and the debate about whether Sweden’s approach has been right or wrong is just starting inside the country.Leif Dotevall, communicable disease control officer in the region around Gothenburg, argues many people may be viewing Sweden’s strategy through the prism of whether they believe in lockdowns or not, rather than the overall health impact. “It makes the analysis right now skewed: you are so obsessed by your idea of the strategy and that emotional analysis makes you blind to the whole picture,” he adds.But Elisabet Lann, the Gothenburg city councillor responsible for elderly care and a member of the opposition Christian Democrats who is sceptical about the government strategy, says 200 years of peace and neutrality have left Sweden slow to react. The response has been cloaked in a self-image of a country that believes it behaves calmly while others are impetuous.“We don’t like to be irrational because of feelings, or be frightened to make irrational moves,” she says. “We look at other countries as more impulsive.”‘We are open’Situated on Sweden’s west coast, Gothenburg is home to some of the country’s biggest company from Volvo Cars and truckmaker Volvo AB to ball bearings manufacturer SKF and healthcare group Molnlycke. It is also home to some of the country’s most deprived areas such as Bergsjon, the northeastern suburb where Gerashus is situated and where unemployment before the coronavirus crisis was almost three times that for the city as a whole.Vastra Gotland, the region of 1.6m people that includes Gothenburg, has had 649 Covid-19 deaths so far, more than the 598 in Denmark, 326 in Finland or 242 in Norway, all of whom have more than triple the population. Sweden as a whole has suffered 5,053 deaths.Henrik Tornqvist, a priest in Bergsjon, is one of those who has marked the change since March: he used to perform three or four funerals a month, now he does the same number each week. Up to 1,000 people a week used to attend homework groups, lunches and services at the church. “We are open but we don’t have a normal life,” he adds.He restarted services for the Midsummer holiday last weekend but with a congregation reduced from the usual 120 to 30.Maria Ottensten, the head priest for northeastern Gothenburg, says of Sweden’s strategy: “We can keep going this way. It’s boring but we can keep it going. Closing everything down, you can’t do it for very long.”SchoolsClose by is one of the symbols of the Swedish strategy’s success: the primary school. Children up to 16 have gone to school throughout the crisis. Locals hail the policy for helping with children’s mental health as well as allowing parents to keep on working. “I like playing with my friends, and not being inside all day,” says one teenager playing basketball outside the school.In the centre of Gothenburg, a class of nine and 10-year-olds from the French school has stopped in front of a statue of King Charles IX. Stefan, one of the teachers, says of the decision to keep schools open: “I think it’s been good. I’m not afraid of getting corona from them. If we close down the school, society will collapse because you need to have someone home.”Gitte Caous is the director for the district of Eastern Gothenburg, which includes Bergsjon, and she emphasises that health is about more than purely preventing deaths. “A country doesn’t just consist of elderly people. It also consists of children, companies that could go bankrupt etc. Take suicides – people take their lives because they have been socially isolated,” she says.Not all schools in Sweden have been open. It closed down those for over-16s as well as universities, judging that they could cope better with distance-learning and reduce the pressure on public transport from older students who often have to travel further.Camilla Alenas, headteacher at SKF’s Technical College which has 96 students, says the past three months have been challenging. “We have seen we need to work on mental health. The students haven’t said, ‘Oh, I need help’ like they used to”, she says, adding that the school has had to help some poorer pupils get access to the internet. She is worried about those graduating: “It’s a bad time to go into the job market.”‘This is a bit too normal’Truckmaker Volvo underscored this by announcing more than 4,000 job cuts last week. The hit to Sweden’s economy from coronavirus will be sizeable, raising the question over whether it is more influenced by the lack of a lockdown or by the spread of the virus.SEB, one of Sweden’s biggest banks, now forecasts gross domestic product will decline 5 per cent this year, similar to its estimate for Norway and worse than Denmark’s latest guidance of a 4 per cent contraction. Unemployment in Sweden could hit 12 per cent, according to SEB, well above its financial crisis peak and almost double its pre-Covid rate.But Sweden’s economy is expected to do far better than the European countries most affected by coronavirus, such as the UK, France, Italy and Spain.Hakan Samuelsson, chief executive of Volvo Cars based in western Gothenburg, says its Europe sales fell 50 per cent in May but June is likely to be “much better”. He now expects a V-shaped recovery. “It will hurt the economy. But we can’t isolate this. We can’t close down our economy or our company and wait for a vaccine to come,” he says.He adds that many talk about Covid-19 deaths but few discuss how many die each day from alcohol abuse or suicide. “A bad economy where people lose their income will cause social problems. Politicians need to recognise that closing down the economy will have negative effects,” he says.The evidence from shops and cafes in Gothenburg that have stayed open throughout the pandemic is more mixed. A waiter at Cappuccino, a cafe in the city centre, says: “It’s generally been quieter but now the days are warmer it’s the same. It’s back to usual – it’s kind of strange.”In the evening, bars close by are packed and young men are drinking beer while playing crazy golf. “I’m scared this is a bit too normal,” says one woman, trying to get her newborn baby to sleep in a pram.In Bergsjon, where wages are lower and unemployment higher, shops are suffering more, a sign that a lack of a lockdown is not enough to keep the economy going when people are afraid of the virus. At Tintin’s hair saloon, one of the hairdressers says business has more than halved.“We hope it comes back but people are scared. There’s a lot of infection here. We are afraid soon it could be like Italy,” he says. The woman behind the counter at Horsed Beauty, a local clothes shop, adds: “It’s slow. There are not so many people because of corona.”‘We have failed the elderly’Like most countries with high per capita death rates, Sweden has suffered a large number of deaths in care homes, in its case about half of total deaths. At Gerashus in Bergsjon, 28 of its 102 residents have died since March. The ward for dementia sufferers was particularly badly hit.One day, says Inger Bomark, head of elderly care in eastern Gothenburg, 66 per cent of staff were off so temporary workers – often with few qualifications and bad language skills – were pressed into action, often working in several different wards or care homes.“We have completely failed with old people,” says Anna Skarsjo, a care home nurse who is also head of the Kommunal trade union in western Sweden. She says the country has paid the price for decades of neglect, and that there were little-to-no plans on how to deal with Covid-19 in inidual care homes and a lack of protective equipment.When she started working as a nurse 26 years ago, five staff would look after 10 residents now there are three or four workers for 16 residents, she says.“One can’t expect a three-course meal when you pay for a hot dog,” she adds.The bigger question for Sweden is whether the problems in its care homes invalidate its entire strategy. Given that many countries have suffered about half their deaths in care homes, some in Sweden argue its elevated death rate is merely a function of the high infection level in society.Lann says: “I’m not sure if the strategy is right. If you choose a total lockdown it comes with a huge cost for schools, mental health. But a more common sense strategy requires more strict guidelines for elderly care. You can’t combine a common sense strategy with some kind of common sense in care homes.”Dotevall argues that Sweden has a larger number of elderly people than other European countries and problems with its care homes for years, meaning the focus on the lack of a lockdown may be a red herring.“I’m not sure that the lockdown problem is the main thing, I think the problem lies more with the structure of care homes,” he says, adding that many Swedish care homes are too large and disconnected from the rest of the healthcare system while workers are often badly paid, poorly qualified and on hourly contracts.“The situation for care home workers has to be improved. We have degraded the value of looking after old people,” he says. Ottensten, the priest, says it reflects the political choices of recent decades: “We have done nothing for care homes and lots for children.”Another aspect of Sweden’s focus on broader public health rather than narrowly trying to reduce deaths from coronavirus is that there is more talk about the invisible issues related to the pandemic such as mental health and domestic violence, even though the long-term impact – as for all countries – is impossible to discern yet.Ing-Marie Larsson, head of social services in eastern Gothenburg, says: “The most vulnerable in our district, who have poor mental health, have had it very tough.” She adds that all crime has gone down except that related to drugs.Domestic violenceDotevall says domestic violence appears to have risen significantly despite no formal lockdown while many 16- to 19-year-olds with an immigrant background only got warm meals at school, which is now closed. “If you see society in the broader sense with restaurants and cafés and businesses, what happens in a total close-down? I don’t know. But when you analyse coronavirus, you have to see what has happened in all these areas – the economy, mental health and not just in the old people’s sector.”In Gothenburg, as in Sweden as a whole, there is a sense that many of these questions could take years to decide. There are worries about the high death rate and the level of new coronavirus infections. Its excess deaths this year are proportionately higher than Norway and Denmark, which have similar population density and cultures, but less than the UK, Belgium or Italy.But for every Bergsjon with a high death and infection rate, there is another deprived area such as the neighbouring district of Angered that has been far less affected by coronavirus.“All of us who work with this, every day and night, we think, ‘Was this right or wrong?’” says Dotevall. “Some days we think we were right and other days not at all. Finally, we may be surprised to see the whole picture.” – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"World community urged to reject move to intensify \u0026lsquoprofound human rights violations\u0026rsquoAmple evidence uncovered of movement\u0026rsquos widespread persecution of Yazidi minority and other ethnic minoritiesSarah Hegazi\u0026rsquos simple gesture at a concert led to outrage, persecution and heartbreakDemonstrations against prices and wages erupt in Sweida and spread to DeraaAnnexation would be incompatible with international law, Maas warnsTerror group ramps up attacks as crises including coronavirus provide opportunityGovernment pressed to speed up talks with IMF and donors to secure funds and halt slideBritish-Iranian woman seeking release after first furlough from jail in Iran since 2016Police and security force officers killed in roadside bomb and gun battleHealth authorities confirm more than 3,000 new cases on two consecutive daysOpponents warn that US-backed plan would lead to independent Palestinian stateWar and coronavirus-ravaged country to get $1.35bn from UN and Saudi ArabiaTension rises in region with Israel planning to extend sovereignty to Jewish settlementsGiven lack of other options, authorities used restrictions as main tool to fight pandemicFormer cabinet minister Saad al-Jabri was strategic architect of Saudi counter-terrorism effortsPrime minister claims allegations are a \u0026lsquodeep-state\u0026rsquo, left-wing political witch-huntLong-serving politician will become first sitting prime minister in Israel\u0026rsquos history to stand trialPA president cites imminent threat of Israeli annexation of parts of the West BankFirebomb attack on home claimed the lives of a couple and their 18-month-old sonWHO forecasts coronavirus will kill 42,000 and infect most of 28 million populationStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus.

A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role.

Thousands have been made redundant, with strict visa regulations forcing them to return to the UK, with little time to catch their breath.  It’s almost 11 years since Selina Dixon traded her claustrophobic commute from Surrey into Central London for her expat dreams of Dubai.“I was spending four hours a day on the train,” she tells The .The fashion marketer left behind the early morning drizzle and commuter grind, for a new life in the UAE. One which promised year-round sun, tax-free salaries, and the opportunity of adventure.“It’s not about the glitz and glamour, whoever has been fortunate enough to live here know there is much more behind the façade,” she says.An estimated 240,000 Britons call the UAE home, working as everything from air hostesses to teachers.Dixon was made redundant a few weeks ago, now she is living off her meagre savings. In weeks her visa will expire, and she wont be able to renew it unless she finds a new job.“Every day you wake up, you’re looking on LinkedIn. Speaking to contacts and your network, but then you have to be mindful there are so many people going through this.”With thousands of people flying in and out of the UAE every day in normal times, the country was always vulnerable to Covid-19. A  stringent lockdown saw swathes of the economy shut. Though some 40,000 cases of the virus have been registered, Dubai is slowly beginning to open up, yet the economic recovery will likely take many years.Ninety per cent of the UAE’s population are expats, and a study out this month by Oxford Economics, a quantitative analysis firm, estimates that the country of nine million could lose up to 900,000 jobs, and some 10 per cent of its population – British expats are likely to be among the worst affected.At least part of the difficulty lies in the UAE’s Kafala – or sponsorship - system. A visa scheme wherein residency is tied to your job. Companies may sponsor a foreigner for residency as long as they employ them, but the moment someone becomes unemployed, a count-down begins on the expiry of their visa.As Dixon says, “Dubai is a place that without a visa - it’s difficult.”Though the government has announced some visa waivers, those who have lost their jobs since March 1st have thirty days to find a new job, or their visas become invalid, and they will be hit with daily fines.It means that those like Dixon may be forced to return to the UK for the first time in years. “It was not a choice that I was ready to make, but one that I may have to make.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ancient cup cup discovered hebrides loch former royal navy diver","story":"A 5,500-year-old cup has been discovered by a former Royal Navy er in the mud of a loch in the Outer Hebrides.Archaeologists are said to be very excited over the find which could provide clues to the lives of the mysterious early islanders.The cup was found on the Isle of Lewis on Friday by Chris Murray.Mr Murray described it as a beautiful example of the Neolithic age and had been the first person to drink from it in thousands of years.Mr Murray has also previously discovered similar bowls around artificial stone built islands, known as crannogs, in the Outer Hebrides which have led to a startling re-writing of history.Crannogs date back to more than 1000 years older than Egypt\u0027s pyramids and before Stonehenge.Of the latest find Mr Murray from Stornoway said: It is the cup of our ancestors, a very ancient early Neolithic bowl or drinking vessel around 5,500 years old.I had an idea there might be some items around the crannog on the loch. It was only about four feet down and I saw this tiny fragment sticking about a quarter of an inch out of the mud.So I dug away and after 20 minutes out came this beautiful example of the period... To think it is older than Stonehenge, Callanish and the pyramids is just fantastic.I have been in touch with archaeologists from Southampton and Reading universities who are very excited about it.”Mr Murray also recovered 40 shards of pottery from the loch.Archaeologists in Scotland have made astounding discoveries in the islands\u0027 lochs in recent years.Mr Murray has previously scoured Loch Arnish, Loch Langabhat and Loch Borgastail on Lewis and made a number of finds.It shows that people were building these islands long before the pyramids and Stonehenge. It really is startling what we are finding out.These man made islands were clearly very important to early Hebrideans. Some of the pottery is now even called Hebridean Ware. Some of the bowls were scallop shaped and even the rims were decorated.The archaeologists don\u0027t know why they were throwing these pots into the loch nearly 6000 years ago - was it a sacrifice to water gods? I just decided to e on them out of curiosity and I couldn\u0027t believe my eyes - on some lochs it was full of pottery. It was incredible - a real archaeological treasure trove.The search was first sparked in 2011, when Mr Murray recovered a set of remarkably preserved Neolithic treasures submerged around a crannog.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"interviewchristian bruckner best friend sure took madeleine","story":"The former best friend of the man suspected of abducting Madeleine McCann says he is sure that the German paedophile took the young girl.In an extraordinary interview with the , Michael Tatschl, an Austrian drifter who lived with Christian Brückner in Portugal said he has sat down with police and told them all about his “sick” and “perverted” friend, who used to brag about his criminal exploits.Now, he has urged Brückner to “admit it to the police and close it for good”.With striking neck tattoos, a close cropped haircut and a large piercing on his left nipple, Tatschl spent years travelling across Europe living in camper vans.Speaking from his home outside Graz, Austria, where he has finally settled, the 46-year-old is adamant. I know he did it,” he claims.“I was living with him at the time. He was my best friend and he was definitely a pervert and more than capable of snatching a child, for sexual kicks or money.I was sure it was him the minute the police came to find me in Austria. They were very clear with me from the first minute. They said \u0027we are investigating Maddie McCann and Christian Brückner’ and I told them I knew it already. I was convinced it was him.”Speaking for the first time about his old friend, Tatschl described how he became involved with Brückner in Portugal in the early 2000s.The pair lived together, drank together and ultimately committed crimes together.I was staying at his house and camping in a van in the garden. We spent a lot of time together and had good fun.But he was definitely quite a strange character.“He was always quite criminal. He liked to brag about the crimes he had done and planned to do, and how he aimed to steal as much money as he could until he reached his dream of having €1 million. Then he would stop.It was rich pickings there in Praia da Luz. He was always breaking into apartments in the area and bragging about it to me,” Tatschl claimed.“He was a very good burglar and would easily climb up to first floor apartments when tourists were out.He would climb up to the first floor and steal everything, lots of money, valuables and so many passports. In fact hundreds of passports and lots of watches. Rolexes and other expensive watches.He had a hiding place in the house in the rafters in the roof. He had all the money and passports hidden up there, Tatschl claimed.The property in question is a farmhouse just outside Praia da Luz which Brückner rented from a British man. Neighbours said he used to race down the dusty gravel track in his Jaguar and have heated shouting matches with a string of girlfriends. Tatschl said Brückner was in a relationship with a German woman 20 years his senior at the time.It is also where a camcorder was discovered that allegedly had footage of Brückner raping a 72-year-old tourist at a luxury villa in 2005. The video was destroyed, but the testimony of the two men who saw it helped convict Bruckner of the crime last year.“That’s how I found out he was a sick b******.“It was of this elderly lady who was chained to a wooden post and she was being beaten and raped.“But I admit I got sucked into some of his schemes,” said Tatschl.Taking fuel seemed pretty harmless and we did it for a few months.The cops caught us red handed, caught us stealing diesel and we got eight-and-a-half months in prison on remand waiting for a trial in Portimao.It\u0027s just a small prison, so we got to spend a lot of time together.”In 2006, while the pair were in jail, the farmhouse was robbed, and the money, valuables and camcorder was taken.The father-of-one says he “cannot believe” that Portuguese detectives have not yet searched the former home they shared.When the pair were released from prison, Brückner moved into the distinctive white and yellow VW Westfalia campervan, while Tatschl said he left Portugal for Orgiva, Spain.He had lost the house but he was still enjoying living in the area. I think that confused the police a little as they were not sure where he was living exactly when Maddie vanished,” said Tatschl.The next time I saw him was in late May or early June 2007 and he arrived in Spain with his big American campervan, the Winnebago, the one with the swimsuits.He parked it up in Orgiva and came looking for me. It was the only reason he had come to Orgiva to find me. He knew that I was living there and he knew I had connections to the marijuana world and could help him make money.We all wondered where he’d got the money from.I remember specifically having a conversation with an English guy who lived there and we both said how on earth could have had that vehicle? “We assumed a big drug deal or something like that. Now I suspect it was Maddie.He was only there that time for a couple of days and went on back to Germany selling marijuana.”Brückner has a string of convictions, ranging from molesting a six-year-old girl in a playground when he was just a teenager, to raping a 72-year-old American woman in a horrific attack in Praia da Luz more than a decade later.Now, he has been identified as the prime suspect in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann. German authorities say they have evidence that she is dead, and that Brückner “did the deed” but they do not have enough evidence to charge him.He was definitely a pervert and all his friends thought that about him. He had some sexual issues but we didn’t think that he liked young children,” Tatschl said.Christian was always on the dark web. He would talk about it and he always had internet in the houses he rented.I don’t know exactly what he did but I suspect it involved drugs and pornography.He was always bragging about money and making money. He even talked about selling kids maybe to Morocco.I didn\u0027t really think about it at the time. Just brushed it off as joking.”Things changed when he watched an eight-part series on the McCann case in March last year.When I saw the Netflix documentary I knew immediately that he was guilty.The part where the female tourist talked about the man turning up at her door while her child played by the front door, the creepy guy with acne and blonde hair. I just knew it was Christian for sure.”Days later, police arrived at Tatschl’s front door.“I had two Austrian police and two German Police turn up at my house. I was then taken to the police station where I told them my story over 14 hours.It was the first week of April last year and they had me in the police station from 10am to 6pm on the first day and then from 10 am until 4pm the next day.They were very clear with me from the first minute. They said \u0027we are investigating Maddie McCann and Christian Brückner’ and I told them I knew it already. I was convinced it was him. I told them ‘I know what you want. I hope I can help.’”I really hope they can finally close this case for the family and find Christian guilty for what he has done. He needs to admit it to the police and close it for good.”Last week, lawyers defending Brückner said their client “denies any involvement” in the McCann case.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"heatwave could lower coronavirus transmission rates study shows","story":"At the winter solstice, on December 21, the virus could survive for more than five hours in the weak sunlight, although indoors it is likely to last for days.   In fact, sunlight is so effective at fighting coronavirus that authors Dr Jose-Luis Sagripanti and Dr David Lytle argue that lockdown measures could actually have harmed people and increased viral spread.Sunlight includes ultraviolet radiation which damages the DNA of viruses. Viruses tend to survive better in cold weather because they have a fatty protective coating which degrades when it is warm. While the melting of the coating allows the virus to invade the warmth of the body, it dies if the casing disintegrates outside.During the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918, doctors noticed that patients who were nursed outdoors appeared to fare better. Bright sunlight can quickly heat up surfaces beyond 90F (32C) even if the outside air temperature is lower. The University of Oxford also recently conducted a review into whether climate conditions were playing a role in the transmission of coronavirus, also found that cold and dry conditions appear to boost spread.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"hysteria germanys surging r number shows absurd way measure","story":"If you are of a nervous disposition you might want to look away as a I reel off estimates of Germany’s R number: 1.06 on Friday, rising to 1.79 on Saturday and 2.88 on Sunday. Given that an R of more than one is supposed to indicate an epidemic that is growing, Germany is – on this measure at least – in the grip of a huge second spike of Covid-19. Should that country – and indeed us, too, given we are just over the North Sea – not be battening down the hatches and admitting we were foolish in relaxing lockdown too soon?Well, no. Here is another figure to digest. Over the whole of Germany in the past seven days there were 3,280 new cases of Covid-19. That works out as 3.9 per 100,000 people. What does that look like? Think a mid-sized town like Bath, Worcester or Rochdale and imagine that four people caught the virus last week. Oh, and only one of them showed any symptoms. That is the extent of Covid-19 in Germany at present.The apparent acceleration in Germany\u0027s R number shows the foolishness of focusing so much on a single figure. The R number might have some meaning in the right circumstances, but publishing a single R for Germany doesn’t mean a lot at present. The rise in the number is entirely due to an outbreak in an abattoir in the town of Gutersloh in the region of North Rhine Westphalia, where 650 workers were found to have the virus. That is a closed environment kept at a chilled temperature which seems to have been an ideal place to promote the spread of the virus. It tells us nothing about Covid-19 in the rest of Germany where, according to the Robert Koch Institute, the epidemic continues to decline.  The R number is, in any case, only a crude estimate. It is the average number of people onto whom each infected inidual is estimated to have passed the virus. Except no-one really knows how anybody catches the virus.  Did the abattoir workers catch it by being coughed over by their colleagues in the work canteen? Did they catch it via some sort of cleaning process, involving a fine spray of water droplets, or from contact with a cold surface on which the virus was present?  If investigators have any insight into this they haven’t revealed it so far. All we do know is that abattoirs around the world have had a problem with Covid 19 – and that the conditions within them have little resemblance to the outside world. The models used to calculate the R number, however, are just looking at the raw mathematics of it. Paradoxically, the abattoir outbreak would have had a lower impact on Germany’s R number had the nationwide incidence of the disease been much higher. It has come out at a shocking 2.88 because there are few cases elsewhere in the country to dilute the infections at the plant.When the history of Covid-19 comes to be written, one issue which will need addressing is how mass fear was spread by the constant feeding of statistics by government and their agencies – figures which many people struggled to put into perspective. Here’s just a little more perspective. Germany so far has recorded 8,882 deaths from Covid 19.  That is less than 1 per cent of the approximately one million people who die in Germany every year.    More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"muslim convert plotted blow st pauls boasted lax security iconic","story":"A female Muslim convert boasted to an undercover officer how easy it would be to blow up St Paul’s Cathedral as she plotted a suicide attack, a court has heard.Safiyya Amira Shaikh, a 37-year-old mother from Hayes in west London, said she wanted to kill as many as people as possible by detonating a bomb at Christmas or Easter.She carried out a reconnaissance mission, visiting the cathedral to fine tune her plan, before telling an undercover police officer there was very little security at the iconic building.Sheikh, who was born Michelle Ramsden, wrote on a secret messaging app: This most famous church to King and Queen. All there (sic) weddings been there hundreds of years. I really thought it would not be possible. But it easy.”Believing she was speaking to fellow jihadists, she said she would borrow her daughter’s non Islamic clothing, to avoid suspicion and would detonate a suicide belt packed with explosives.During a sentencing hearing at the Old Bailey on Monday, prosecutor Alison Morgan QC described Sheikh as a violent extremist who pledged her support for Islamic State.Ms Morgan said: She engaged with others, who she believed to be of a similar mindset, to instigate and plan a terrorist attack involving the use of improvised explosives to attack St Paul\u0027s Cathedral and a hotel nearby.In furtherance of her attack plan, she visited the cathedral to assess its security arrangement and the best place to detonate a bomb.She stated that her intention was to kill herself and as many other people as possible.The court heard that Shaikh travelled to central London on September 7 2019, ready to attend morning prayers at St Paul\u0027s the next day in order to scope out security protocol and work out how to carry out her plan, with the ultimate aim of achieving martyrdom.The court heard she confessed online: I would like bomb (sic) and shoot til death. But if that not possible I do other way. Belt or anything. I just want a lot to die. InshaAllah.She added: I want do something in hotel and church. Than (sic) run and kill kuffar (non-Muslims) everywhere I see them until am shot down. Is this possible. And to get weapons. If I had choice I blow the church to ground. With kuffar in it.The court heard how Sheikh had converted to Islam in 2007 after being impressed by the kindness of a local Muslim family. But she quickly became disillusioned with moderate versions of the religion and sought out extremist doctrine online.On September 24 last year, she met an undercover officer in Uxbridge to hand over her bags, believing they could be fashioned into explosives.Then, on October 13, the female undercover officer cancelled a second meeting and police forced their way into Shaikh\u0027s flat to arrest her.Shaikh has admitted preparation of terrorist acts and dissemination of terrorist publications on Telegram.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"vast ocean plutos surface raises fresh hopes extraterrestrials","story":"A vast ocean buried below Pluto\u0027s surface has raised fresh hopes of extraterrestrial activity, a study has suggested.Deep beneath an ice shell over 60 miles thick, the ancient body of water could hold the ingredients to life beyond our planet.Analysis of images from NASA’s New Horizons mission shows that Pluto was hot when it first formed, rather than a celestial snowball as previously thought.The ocean is thought to have existed for around four and a half billion years - older even than the seas on Earth.Planetary scientist Carver Bierson said: Even in this cold environment so far from the sun, all these worlds might have formed fast and hot - with liquid oceans.By examining Pluto\u0027s features today we can begin to understand its birth four and a half billion years ago.We are pretty sure water is one of the ingredients for life.”Suggestions of an underground ocean Pluto were explored in 2016, yet this new study gives a fresh indication of how it came to exist.Previous theories of its formation suggested that the dwarf planet began melting slowly over time due to radioactive decay.Instead, Pluto has had an ocean that has been slowly freezing for all of solar system history,” said Mr Bierson.Astronomers have long presumed that life would only be found on planets such as Earth, which are found in an area of space which is not too hot or too cold to sustain life - dubbed the ‘Goldilocks zone’.Publishing their findings in the journal Nature Geoscience, the researchers from California University in Santa Cruz said this gives fresh hope of life elsewhere on icy planets known to us.Their research suggests that other objects at the edge of the solar system were once hot with oceans, meaning similar bodies of water could still exist today.Mr Bierson said: The long-term chemical interactions between these oceans and the rocky materials below may have implications for ocean chemistry and the potential habitability of these distant icy worlds.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/06/22/09/wwdc.jpg","title":"apple event 2020 live latest wwdc iphone update","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Apple is about to hold its WWDC event, revealing updates for every one of its platforms.As well as new versions of the operating systems for its iPhone, iPad, Macs, Apple Watch and TVs, the company could reveal major new changes including the introduction of entirely new chips for its Macs.It is the 31st time that Apple has held the event.

Hold the door for stragglers. Chatterboxes unwelcome. Now, health agencies and medical experts are urging elevator riders to follow additional rules: wear masks. Tap buttons with an object or knuckle. Avoid speaking when possible.If riders follow those recommendations, “there’s essentially no risk in an elevator,” said infectious-disease physician Colleen Kraft, associate chief medical officer at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“It is a short period of time,” she said. “If you are wearing a mask and others are masked in the elevator, I don’t think it poses any risk.”Joseph Allen, director of the Healthy Buildings programme at the Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health, said it was understandable that elevators may cause anxiety. “It’s a natural choke point in the building,” he said. “We’ve been told to keep six feet away from others.”Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?Intensity, frequency and duration are three factors that determine exposure to a hazard, Mr Allen said. For most office workers, the frequency of elevator rides is low – perhaps a round-trip or two on a workday. And at a minute or less for most trips, the duration is short.Occupancy restrictions and no-talking rules aim to reduce intensity by limiting the amount of virus released as droplets or aerosols. The elevator is “a place where risk can be managed quite effectively,” Mr Allen said.Masks and face coverings, too, are essential. Ms Kraft cited a phrase that has become common among infectious-disease experts: “My mask protects you, your mask protects me.”New York plans to permit office workers to return to their buildings on Monday, Democratic Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters. Coronavirus cases continue to decline there, unlike swaths of the South and Southwest, where cases have risen.Although many white-collar employers are reluctant to order workers back this summer – Facebook, Google and other large tech companies will allow remote work to continue until 2021 – Mr de Blasio estimated that 300,000 people will return to work in his city starting on Monday.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailNew York’s reopening guidelines mandate that elevators in office buildings stay below half-capacity. Employers “must advise workers and visitors to wear face coverings in common areas including elevators,” according to the reopening plan. Elevator surfaces should be frequently cleaned and disinfected.Ten people fit comfortably in each of the 62 elevators that shuttle up and down Manhattan’s One World Trade Centre, the tallest building in the United States. Those cars will be emptier than usual when workers return.“We are limiting the number of passengers in our elevators to four. And face coverings are required,” said Jordan Barowitz, a spokesman for the Durst Organisation, the company that manages the 104-story skyscraper.Limited research exists to describe elevators during pandemics past or present. When Lee Gray, an architectural history professor at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte who wrote a historical account of 19th-century elevators, hunted for examples from the 1918 influenza pandemic, he found little except for photographs that show that elevator operators wore masks.In April, Richard Corsi, dean of engineering at Portland State University and an expert on indoor air quality, shared on Twitter a crude simulation of an elevator ride. If an unmasked person rode an elevator up 10 floors while speaking on a phone and coughing once, Mr Corsi’s model predicted that infectious virus particles would linger as the elevator returned to the bottom floor.But that’s just one scenario, Mr Corsi cautioned, from a not-yet-published calculation. We are our own source of ventilation.“People drag air with them, especially if they’re a group moving out,” Mr Corsi said. “To get a fair dose, there needs to be a pretty high concentration at pretty high level of stuff per litre of air,” such as riding next to an infected person speaking or coughing for several minutes. “The key is to minimise the time you’re in an elevator with somebody that’s infected.”A May report from a hospital in Wuhan, China, evaluated public spaces, including elevators, for the presence of the virus. Swabs of elevator buttons detected viral genetic material, though the study authors did not report cases of infection linked to those surfaces.While people should be careful when touching surfaces they haven’t cleaned, Kraft advised against wearing gloves. It’s too easy to misuse them or be lulled into a false sense of security, she said. Instead, use a toothpick, a corner of shirt fabric or another barrier to touch buttons. Some companies are trying to make this easier – Isla Bella Beach Resort, a luxury hotel in Florida, has started handing out branded rubber-tipped styluses for guests to press elevator buttons.There is no easy way to avoid using elevators in a tall building. Asking employees to walk in stairwells may be a fire hazard or physically onerous. Adding more elevators is costly. “I don’t think that’s economically viable,” Mr Gray said, because building owners would have to replace valuable tenant space with shafts. Some elevator companies are working on integrating elevators with apps, he said, which allow riders to summon a car via their phones.To remain physically distanced, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention recommends maintaining six-foot separations even while in an elevator. To Mr Allen, that’s not practical – and may have a negative unintended effect.I went back to work, but London’s deserted streets made me gasp“That really means that they’re saying one person per elevator ride,” he said. “In some of these big buildings, if we have one person ride an elevator, we are going to have hundreds, if not thousands of people in the lobby. And that creates a greater exposure.” Instead, Mr Allen suggests people file into the elevator in a checkerboard pattern, perhaps guided by stencils on the floor, to stay somewhat separated while avoiding crowds in the lobby.“Everyone has a role to play here,” Mr Allen said. That includes building owners, who can post signs about properly using elevators employers, who can stagger shifts to avoid rush-hour surges and elevator riders, who can direct sneezes into an elbow or turn to face the wall.“If everyone does their part,” he said, “we can reduce risk collectively.”back to work\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Users post “Parleys” that can be commented on, “echoed” (like retweets) and voted on.It is available on the web, as well as on the App Store for Apple users and the Google Play Store for Android users.In May 2019, founder John Matze said the site had approximately 100,000 users in total. In June, 200,000 Saudi Arabian users joined the site to protest claimed censorship from Twitter.Twitter had approximately 326 million users at the time.How is Parler different from Twitter?The most prominent difference between the social media sites, apart from their size, is their attitudes towards content on their platforms.Parler is more tolerant of speech that other platforms would deem offensive.In its guidelines, it references the FCC’s definition of obscene content which asks if the work is sexual in nature, if it “ is offensive,” and “Whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.”Parler advises users not to “use languagevisuals which is sexual in nature” and not to “use languagevisuals that are offensive and offer no literary, artistic, political, or scientific value”It has also made exceptions for content from prominent users, such as Mr Trump, that would otherwise breach its terms and conditions and be taken down were it tweeted by another user.Who is on Parler?Katie Hopkins recently joined the platform after being removed from Twitter.“Keeping Twitter safe is a top priority for us – abuse and hateful conduct have no place on our service and we will continue to take action when our rules are broken” it said in a statement.Other prominent users include Donald Trump’s son Eric Trump, far-right activist Laura Loomer who chained herself to Twitter’s headquarters, Mr Trump’s campaign manager Brad Parscale, and far-right activist Candace Owens who infamously said that “If Hitler just wanted to make Germany great and have things run well, OK, fine.”Since then, some Conservative MPs have joined Parler. These include the MP for Mansfield Ben Bradley, MP for Guildford Angela Richardson, and MP for Wycombe Steve Baker.Accounts have been made for other MPs including MP for Crawley Harry Smith and Daily Mail columnist and wife of Michael Gove Sarah Vine, although it is currently unclear if these are legitimate.What do people post on Parler?Jewish News website Forward has said that the app is “full of fury, fear and conspiracy theories” with notable antisemitism and Islamophobia.“The belief that Jews are running the world, encouraging immigrants to flood America’s borders, controlling the media and generally working behind the scenes as master puppeteers are easy to find on Parler” it continues.Antisemitic conspiracy theories about Mark Zuckerberg and George Soros are also commonplace.Many users are also vocal supporters of Mr Trump, and have developed far-right communities on the platform.Upon signing up to the website, Parler recommended trends that were popular “right now” included #trumptweetsmatter, #kukluxklan, #georgesoros and #covidiots.There were also a number of tweets related to Christianity, with hashtags including #2NDCOMING and #godisloveUnder the #kukluxklan were six posts. Two of which were about the recently deceased Senator Robert Byrd, a member of the Klan who came to embrace civil rights and desegregation in the 1970s.Another was a tweet quoting American news commentator Van Jones from 29 May.Two more were from October 2019, related to Clifford the Big Red Dog memes that reference the Ku Klux Klan.The final two were about “antiwhiteracism” and the Klan’s founding, respectively.It is unclear why Parler’s algorithm surfaced this recommendation to a new account. The Independent has reached out to the app for comment.In May 2019, CBS News reported that Parler would not suspend accounts, no matter what was posted.Are there other apps like Parler?Inside the social network used by alleged Pittsburgh synagogue shooterOther social networks with “free speech” ideologies include Gab, another platform where far right-wing iniduals take advantage of its leniency to spread hateful messages.Before killing 11 Jewish people at the Tree of Life synagogue, Robert Bowers allegedly posted on Gab: “I can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I’m going in.”Bowers had also used the account to post numerous racist and antisemitic memes.Parler and Gab also exist as part of an assortment of apps designed to provide solutions to those who have been deplatformed, such as Bitchute, an alternative to YouTube.

Such a shame,” another added.Other people who found the brightness levels to be acceptable were just generally flummoxed by the plot.“Obviously it was very stylish but does anyone know what the hell was going on?” one person wrote.Another viewer stated: “I feel like I fell asleep and missed about 10 episodes of The Luminaries.”The series, which stars Himesh Patel, Eva Green and Bono‘s daughter Eve Hewson, continues tonight (22 June) at 9pm on BBC1.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Two of the stores – in Ross-on-Wye and Leominster – reopened on Monday 15 June.“Being able to shop in person, especially at smaller independents, is a joy,” owner Andy Rossiter, pictured above, says. “I think lockdown made a lot of people realise that they don’t want all their shopping to just land at their door, but booksellers also know they need to work hard for their audience. It’s not simply a case of just opening your doors.”Rossiter has been busy preparing the stores, moving fixtures and checkouts so that staff and customers can socially distance while browsing for books.Carry out a risk assessment: employers will need to carry out Covid-19 risk assessments in consultation with their workers or trade unions.Maintain social distancing: employers should redesign workspaces to maintain social distancing between people and stagger start times.Manage transmission risk:\u0026nbspemployers should look into putting barriers in shared spaces, creating workplace shift patterns or fixed teams.Reinforcing cleaning processes: workplaces should be cleaned more frequently, paying close attention to\u0026nbspdoor handles and keyboards.“We have installed Perspex screens at till points, bought hand sanitiser stations for the entrances to our stores and placed tape and signage throughout so we can clearly indicate the social distancing rules within our stores,” he says.The bookshops have reopened with less members of staff and they have limited their opening hours from their pre-lockdown seven days to just five. Rossiter has also been consulting staff and getting their input on the UK Government’s coronavirus advice.“Our trade body, the Booksellers Association, has been brilliant at reading and interpreting this advice to make it bookshop-specific and releasing it in digestible and accessible weekly bulletins, he says.“Booksellers love serving customers, and we’ve been serving our local community for a decade, so seeing those regulars again and having that relationship start to return to normal will be fantastic.Surinder Josan, owner of All Seasons DIY, a family-run shop, explains how he has used strict safe workplace measures to keep his shop doors open and his businesses afloat.“All Seasons DIY is a family-run shop which was established over 40 years ago, run by myself, my wife, and my mother. My son and daughter work in the shop around their university studies as well,” Josan, below, says.The family decided to shut the shop when school closures were announced. But after just a week they decided to reopen the business in order to serve the local community, who relied on the store for essential food and other items.“In order to reopen, we had to reassess how we both serve and interact with our customers,” Josan explains. “We adopted several new measures to comply with social distancing to keep both ourselves and our customers safe.”These new measures they adopted included safe distance markers outside the shop, to limit the number of people in store at any one time, installing screens at the checkout areas, encouraging contactless payments, lowering the minimum card spend to £1, and offering hand wipes to customers.“The number of customers who have come in and complimented us for it is unbelievable. They say when they come here they feel really safe,” Josan adds.Blend Coffee Co is an independent coffee shop based in Portslade, East Sussex, near Brighton. The two directors behind the business, Oli Crawley and Tom Jennion, have introduced a range of measures so they could confidently reopen for staff and customers.“Our primary concern is to keep people safe, so to make sure our coffee shop was ready to be reopened we implemented a number of safer working measures,” says Crawley.These new measures included a deep clean of the shop prior to reopening, implementation of a new ordering layout and adopting a new policy which stipulates that no customers are allowed inside the store.Working alongside Crawley and Jennion are a further three members of staff.“Only the directors returned to work to alleviate any pressure on our barista team feeling they need to work,” says Crawley. “This also allows an operational analysis of all our new protocols to ensure they are efficient and safe.”The checkout system has now been moved to the front of the shop, Blend now only accepts card payments and there is a new waiting area outside the shop.This plan was developed after we undertook a risk assessment and analysis of the premises to ensure that customer-staff interaction could be maintained and sustained in a safe manner. We ran a test prior to reopening to ensure that our new measures would work and allow us and our customers to stay safe,” adds Crawley.For further information from the UK Government on how employers, employees and the self-employed can return to work safely, click hereThis is Government advice for EnglandWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms.Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort. Visit pickforbritain.org.uk to find out moreEat seasonal and local vegBut that’s not the only way to support the industry right now. Simply eating more in-season local produce will help to prevent wastage.A wide range of vegetables are currently being harvested in the UK. These include asparagus, cucumbers, mushrooms, courgettes, spinach, summer squash, radishes, beetroot and tomatoes – and buying and cooking with this seasonal veg is a great way to contribute to the farming industry.​In need of some recipe inspo?

That’s why there\u0027s never been a better time to try something new.Among the wide range of different species found in UK waters are mussels, crab, mackerel, herring, rainbow trout, hake and coley (or saithe).

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them. They are very comfortable to wear.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Each section features a famous face, including Morgan Freeman, Whoopi Goldberg and Sir Paul McCartney, and is signed by Sir Peter, 87.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesProceeds will go to two beneficiaries, including The Independent\u0027s Help The Hungry Now appeal partner The Felix Project.Today, Ms Lumley said it was an “honour” to be part of the fundraising effort.

It is a fabulous way of making life worth living.”Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mDame Judi said: “How wonderful that Peter Blake’s amazing artwork will have a new lease of life for such good causes. I’m very glad that maybe my left eyebrow has gone to good use.”Italian actress Caterina Murino, who also stars in the work, said: “The world is upside down. We fight for our life, we fight for the life of our brothers, and this is the feeling I have when I contemplate Sir Peter Blake’s masterpiece!

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Remember 5G started in China. Wuhan is one of the provinces where 5G has been rolled out.”The programme aired in April, when a number of phone masts were attacked by conspiracists.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?Last month Ofcom forced Loveworld to detail on air how it was found to have broken the rules, judging the broadcaster had risked “significant harm” to its viewers. It said at the time it would consider taking further steps.On Monday, Ofcom issued a new decision notice saying that it did not plan to take further formal action against Loveworld. The Christian network had promised to review all its broadcasts to avoid repetition of the 5G conspiracy, use a time-delay so live programmes could be edited and educate its staff on compliance with Ofcom’s code, the regulator said.However, the document revealed that Loveworld had been forthcoming only in the second of two rounds of communication with investigators – after it retained legal representation. Initially, Ofcom said, “the licensee considered that the content on Loveworld News did not raise any issues under the code”.Ofcom’s sanctions panel came away with “significant concerns about Loveworld Limited’s compliance procedures in light of the first set of representations received”, it said, adding that executives planned to further “engage with” Loveworld in order to assuage those fears.Regulators summarised their position: “The panel recognised the licensee’s right to hold and to broadcast views which erge from or challenge official authorities on public health information and that may be considered controversial.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It has four core beliefs: family, integrity, teamwork and success – all integral pillars of its Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme.Put together by Sharon Gray OBE and the federation’s head teachers, it’s designed to welcome pupils back to class after lockdown. “Everybody in the Embark community has done their bit,” says Gray, a headteacher for 20 years, mostly in special schools supporting youngsters experiencing social, emotional and mental health difficulties and schools going through challenges.“It’s been all hands on deck,” executive headteacher and Trust leader of Embark’s schools Matthew Crawford adds. “Even two weeks into lockdown we were thinking about our children returning to school, whatever date that may be.”Safety at school1. Anyone who is unwell or been in contact with somebody showing coronavirus symptoms should stay away from schools, colleges and childcare settings2. Hands should be cleaned more often than usual with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds and dried thoroughly. Alternatively, hand sanitiser or alcohol hand rub can be used3. Promote the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach to coughing and sneezing4. Clean frequently touched surfaces regularly using standard products, such as detergent and bleach5. Help to minimise contact and mixing by altering classroom layout and timetablesWith regards to physical changes that parents and pupils can expect to see in corridors and classrooms, Embark is working with Government guidance and undertaking a thorough, bespoke risk assessment for each of its schools. “It can’t be a one-size-fits all approach,” Crawford stresses.According to Anna Upton – head of the 240-pupil Chaucer Junior School in Ilkeston, Derbyshire – questionnaires were sent out to reconnect with parents, through which they could express concerns and suggest ideas about the return to classrooms.According to Upton, staggered breaks and how drop-offs will work were important issues that were flagged in questionnaires. “But the risk assessment the Trust has put in has allowed us to make a comprehensive plan and we can communicate that to the parents,” she explains.“What the Trust have done with the programme is to implement nine stages which support our schools to open as safely as possible, supporting the staff parents and the children. The risk assessment means that I, as a headteacher, can do what’s right for my school.”Chair of trustees Sarah Armitage emphasises the importance of teamwork based around a guiding principle: families first. We look after families, so we reach out we talk.” she says.“Then there’s teamwork. Let’s harness the power of the team so it’s not the headteacher sitting by themselves with all these things to think about – that load is shared.”Armitage’s back-to-school outlook is optimistic too: “We have created something with this programme that we hope will be massively beneficial. Our role as leaders is to keep that going, carry on putting emotional needs at the heart of everything we do, because then children are able to learn and benefit – and move through this crisis.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Charities have warned that some medically vulnerable people could be forced to choose between financial security and their health, after Matt Hancock announced that “shielding” measures which have confined 2.2 million inside their homes for the past three months are to be lifted in England at the start of August.In the latest in a series of significant relaxations of lockdown, the health secretary said that from 6 July, people shielding from coronavirus will be able to gather in groups of up to six people at a two-metre distance outdoors, while those living alone will be allowed to form a “support bubble” with another household, visiting one another as often as they like and staying overnight.And from the end of next month, clinically vulnerable people will no longer be advised to shield and will be able to visit shops and places of worship and return to their workplace if they cannot do their job at home, but will be advised to stick to social distancing rules.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut at the same time, they will no longer be entitled from 1 August to claim £95-a-week statutory sick pay and may be forced instead to claim Universal Credit or other benefits if they are unable to go back to work because of health fears.People with conditions including some cancers and respiratory diseases, as well as transplant recipients and some pregnant women, were told to remain at home and avoid face-to-face contact from 21 March, though the guidance was later eased to allow meeting one person from another household outdoors.Age UK said the new relaxation would be manna from heaven for elderly people who have been isolated from their families, but the charity demanded clarity from the government on the rights of older employees who fear it may not be safe for them to go back to work.Created with Sketch.Silence for key workers who lost lives to coronavirus Show all 30Created with

warned the blanket lifting of shielding will add to anxieties for many vulnerable people.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?This announcement does not give people greater freedom, as the shielding guidelines have only ever been optional, said Ms Peters. Instead, it risks taking away people’s freedom not to go to work or to the supermarket if they do not feel it’s safe to do so. The government needs to think again and continue to support those most vulnerable to becoming seriously ill from the coronavirus, or we could see people being forced to choose between their financial security and their health.Nick Moberly, chief executive of the MS Society, said that people who have been shielding are desperate to get back to normal life. But he said he was gravely concerned that key support measures like food packages and Statutory Sick Pay might be taken away prematurely. Without this help, and with many people still terrified of infection, for some the idea of normal life returning will feel more like a threat than an opportunity, he warned.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Additionally, those who now may have no choice but to return to work must be given the right information so that – together with their employer – they can ensure their working environment is safe.”More than 3 million free boxes of essential food and 1 million free medicine packs have been delivered to people stuck in their homes, while more than 500,000 NHS volunteers have provided help including telephone calls to support iniduals at risk of loneliness as a result of self-isolation.Enhanced support will remain available from NHS volunteers and local councils, and iniduals will retain priority for supermarket delivery slots and continue to be offered help with shopping, medication, phone calls and transport to medical appointments.And new guidance will be issued encouraging anyone concerned that their workplace may not be Covid-secure to speak with their employer to agree a plan for returning to work and adjustments that may be needed before they go back.Mr Hancock said that the changes were possible because the rates of infection have fallen to an average of less than 1 person out of  1,700 with the virus outside hospitals, compared to 1 in 500 four weeks ago.  He said: “I know this has been incredibly tough.“Shielding has involved not leaving your house for months, not seeing people you care about, not being able to wander to the park for some fresh air, or even pop to the shops for something you need. This sacrifice has been for a purpose, and I want to thank every single one of you. “We knew it was a difficult ask, but these measures have been vital in saving lives. Now, with infection rates continuing to fall in our communities, our medical experts have advised that we can now ease some of these measures, while keeping people safe.” Deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries said that shielding has had an impact on the mental health of many of those affected.“The prevalence of the virus in the community is now lower and chances of getting infected are reduced, so we believe it is the right time to relax some of the advice so people can start to regain a degree of normality once more in their daily lives,” she said. “People should continue to follow social distancing guidance when outside their homes, as well as frequently washing their hands, to minimise the risk of becoming infected. We will continue to monitor the evidence closely and adjust the advice accordingly if there are any changes in the rates of infection that could impact on this group.” Speaking at the daily Downing Street press conference, Dr Harries warned that Britons should not regard the increasing relaxation of lockdown as an indication that life can go back to how it was before the pandemic.“There is a critical point here that says just because life is feeling a bit more back to normal don’t suddenly jump to where you were this time last year, she said. We need to learn to go forward with restrictions in our lives.Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK said: The fact there\u0027s now a roadmap out of lockdown for those who are shielding will be manna from heaven for many older people who we know were worried they were being forgotten as the nation starts to get back to some kind of normal life.The changes announced for July are modest and while a welcome easing of the existing rules will still require grandparents to choose which family with which to form a support bubble, unless they only have one child - not at all easy for many I\u0027m sure.The government will now write to all iniduals on the Shielded Patient List with updated information on shielding advice and the ongoing support that will be available to them.

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe GNA, backed militarily by Turkey, called Mr Sisi’s threat a “declaration of war,” and refused to halt its offensive. “We reject this, condemn it and consider it an act of aggression, a blatant intervention, which amounts to a declaration of war,” the GNA said in a letter on Sunday.The Arab League is scheduled to discuss the confrontation in Libya during an emergency session on Tuesday, but Tripoli is boycotting.  Libyan civilians are trapped in the crossfire of Haftar’s proxy warLibya’s general Haftar swindled out of millions by western mercenariesLibya has a chance at peace but Russia and the US are in the wayDanger of ‘miscalculation’ as powers scramble for position in LibyaFears of revenge attacks as Haftar’s forces flee Libya stronghold“We urge parties to commit to a ceasefire and resume negotiations immediately,” the US Embassy declared in a tweet, but efforts at diplomacy appeared to be failing. Turkey and its allies appear confident of a win and in no mood for a deal, and Mr Haftar and his supporters abroad, humiliated in weeks of battlefield advances, are reluctant to give any concessions from a position of weakness. “The Turks had a point,” said one western diplomat involved in Libya affairs. “They had to establish deterrence. Now they are acknowledging that they want to take control of the whole territory. They are saying Haftar has to go.”Libya’s civil war has been deadly, disruptive and gruesome. Hundreds of thousands have been displaced and hundreds killed. Last week came the discovery of mass graves filled with scores of bodies in the city of Tarhouna, where a militia loyal to Mr Haftar was pushed out last month by GNA forces.“Civilians in Libya continue to suffer disproportionately,” Stephanie Williams, the acting UN envoy to Libya, said last week in a presentation. “One million people are now in need of some form of humanitarian assistance.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailSirte, a city of some 50,000 people, is significant as the last major urban cluster before a set of crucial Libyan oil facilities and depots located on Libya’s eastern Meditarranean shore and controlled for now by forces loyal to Mr Haftar. It is home to a local population filled with supporters of Gaddafi who are allied with Mr Haftar and remain intensely hostile to the Islamist-tinged government in Tripoli.  It was controlled by militias loyal to the GNA until earlier this year, and both Ankara and the Tripoli government have said they would halt their offensive and be open to peace talks once it and Jufrah are under their control.Egypt boasts significant air and ground forces which could boost Mr Haftar in the battlefield and challenge any forces Turkey and the GNA could muster. But Marsa Matrouh, the last city at the Egyptian border where its troops are garrisoned, is some 15 hours away from Sirte. Meanwhile, Turks and allied GNA militias have a strong presence in Misurata, which lies less than three hours from Sirte, and Ankara has been flooding western Libya with military material and personnel for months. “Egypt’s political will to enter a physical contest with the Turkish-backed GNA coalition is not big,” said Jalel Harchaoui, a North Africa specialist at the Clingendael Institute in the Netherlands. “Turkey and the GNA forces are ready to move forcefully into both Sirte and Jufrah any day now.”Mr Sisi has appeared disappointed in Mr Haftar’s failures but is also under pressure from financial backers in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, who are hostile to the GNA’s inclusion of populist Islamist factions and see Turkey as a strategic threat. Egypt also views events in Libya with grave concern, worried troubles could spill over into its borders.“I believe the assertive language is serious and could lead to some form of action or military deployment even if largely symbolic,” said one Egyptian military analyst. “It appears Egypt’s intent is to force ceasefire negotiations by acting as counterbalance to Turkish and GNA strength on the ground.”The conflict in Libya has drawn in various international powers and their local backers. On the one side is Mr Haftar, the eastern commander and former CIA asset who is supported by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Russia and France. On the other side is the GNA in Tripoli, which in addition to Ankara has begun to receive the implicit blessing of Italy, Germany and the UK.Backed by UAE air power and Russian and Sudanese mercenaries, Mr Haftar launched an ill-fated offensive to take control of Tripoli last year. All of his gains were wiped out in a few extraordinary weeks after Turkey forcefully intervened, dispatching drones, anti-aircraft machinery, military personnel, and Syrian mercenaries to back the GNA forces. After initially supporting Mr Haftar, the White House under President Donald Trump appears to have settled into indifference. On Monday, GNA Prime Minister Fayez Serraj and high-profile interior minister Fathi Bashagha reportedly received a delegation of US military commanders from Africom, the US military force in Africa, amid concern about the deployment of Russian fighter jets in Jufrah. “I  don’t think the Trump administration is willing to be associated with someone who’s losing and also a war criminal,” Mohammed Ali Abdallah, a GNA envoy to the US, said in an interview.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

There have been more than 170 new cases of Covid-19 since last week, marking the biggest increase since the virus\u0027s spread was close to being eliminated in April.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

That is something her devoted husband, Scott Mitchell, has been dreading.The couple married in  with some cynics snfily declaring it would never last, mainly because of the -year age gap, but Scott proved them all completely wrong.He adores his we and has put his le on hold, and his physical and mental health at risk, to take care of his Barbara.Scott has also helped to raise funds and awareness for dementia charities, even taking part in the London Marathon with a group of Barbara’s friends from EastEnders.It has been deeply sad to see how this disease has ravaged one of the most delightful women in showbiz.I always adored interviewing Barbara. She was sunny, funny, full of fascinating stories and always interested in everyone and everything.She would have a laugh with the crew, a cheery chat with our production team and was exactly the same whether the cameras were rolling or not.I know a lot of famous actors and entertainers who are grumpy gits until the red light goes on. Barbara was never like that. She is a consummate professional, but also a delightfully warm human being.I remember seeing her at an event in London, where she was swamped by photographers and members of the public. She’s so tiny I couldn’t actually see her in that large sea of people, but what I did observe was how everyone came away with an autograph or a selfie.Barbara is old school. She always said she owes her fame to the public and that they deserved a smile, a cheery wave and a quick photograph.That’s why she is so adored and why we are so very upset she is having to go through this anguish. Scott says her speech is growing worse and she now struggles to find the words to express herself.She ends up sitting shaking her head in sadness and frustration. Barbara is also getting up two or three times a night, becoming unsteady on her feet and falling over. Scott is worried sick that she will suffer a really serious injury.Sometimes Barbara looks at old photos of herself and asks, “Who is she ” and increasingly she doesn’t recognise Scott, which cuts him to his very heart and soul.This disease is so brutal, because it chips away at the sufferer, steals their memories and erodes what makes them unique. You gradually lose the person you love and have to mourn them while they are still alive. That’s why the work both Scott and Barbara have been doing is so vital.When she bravely told us she was ill two years ago, the Alzheimer’s Society saw visits to its website double and one-off donations to the charity rose by  per cent.She made a plea to the PM to help carers and sufferers, and to increase funding, and Barbara was one of the few people that made Boris Johnson stop waffling and actually listen.Dementia is a second epidemic within this pandemic, which is why we need more documentaries like the ones from Ross.There are , sufferers that we know about in the UK, and with us all living longer that number will carry on increasing.Relatives caring for those blighted by the disease can often feel alone and helpless. GPs and the NHS do their best, but it can be a lottery as to what expert care is available.As we have seen during this crisis, care home workers are an extraordinary group of people who treat their frail and elderly patients like a second family, but no one really wants to put a beloved parent or partner into a nursing home.There comes a time, however, when there is no other choice. Scott is now facing that prospect and it is tearing him apart. I also spoke this week to the musician Naughty Boy, whose mum Zahida suffers from dementia.He is a devoted son and lives with his mum to take care of her. Naughty Boy is backing Dementia UK’s Lives On Hold campaign, which focuses on carers and how draining it is for them, especially since lockdown. He wants to stress that there is help out there. I was touched at how he makes sure there is at least one thing every day for his mum to look forward to, to give her joy.He tries to see some light in the darkness and it’s also something Scott has always tried to do. He has to be Barbara’s memory and keep a hold of the love they have for one another.Eventhey have to be parted so she can go into a home, nothing can take that love away from him or anyone  going through the same sad experience.IF you are going to quote Game Of Thrones, then for the love of God at least get it right.Tone deaf Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab dismissed those who support the Black Lives Matter campaign by taking a knee, as seeming to “get the idea from Game Of Thrones”.This was not only hugely insulting, but Raab didn’t even bother to get the phraseology right. In Game Of Thrones, the characters are willing to die before they would BEND the knee in front of despots and royalty.In the real world it’s about expressing solidarity against racial inequality.Raab believes the heartfelt gesture is a “symbol of subjugation and subordination” and he would only do so for the Queen and his we. Those who take the knee, including footballers at theof the Premier League this week, and many protesters here and in the US, were astounded by his crass remarks.Following such wide­spread incredulity and anger, Raab has been furiously back-tracking. I do hope his Twitter clarication is genuine and not just another Government damage-limitation tactic.If this really was an episode of Game Of Thrones, he would have had his a*** handed to him by my favourite character, Sandor Clegane, known as The Hound.After that encounter, I guarantee he would never again be able to bend any part of his anatomy.HOLLYOAKS actor Adam Rickitt is an astonishingly candid and brave man. He not only spoke about his mental health at a time when it was considered career-destroying, but has talked frankly this week about being infertile.Adam suffers from an auto-immune disease that has made it impossible for him to ever father children. The -year-old has ankylosing spondylitis, which has had a devastating effect on his sperm count.While other men might have felt embarrassed about it, Adam has been refreshingly honest. He revealed the doctor told him most men have three million sperm, but he only had two. Not two million but TWO.He and his we Katy Fawcett, a top correspondent with Good Morning Britain, are very happy with their three dogs. Adam has been equally upfront about his mental health and suicidal thoughts. Since meeting Katy in  his le has turned around and, alongside acting jobs, he’s running a craft beer bar and shop. The couple call it their “baby”.They adore each other and are lucky to feel complete without kids.GWYNETH PALTROW’S latest attention- seeking wheeze is to bring out a candle that “smells of her orgasm”. This is a follow-up to last year’s model that bore the catchy title, “This candle smells of my vagina”.Not sure about you, but I have no wish to have my living room reeking of Gywn or anything to do with her sex le.I also cannot begin to imagine the sheer buttock-clenching embarrassment suffered by her two teenage kids.I think what her candles really smell of are pure unadulterated bulls**t.THE Oscars and Baftas have been delayed for a few months due to Covid-, so this could be a good time for the film industry to have a rethink about the whole business of award shows.Instead of a seemingly never-ending run of ceremonies, perhaps there should be a cull. In the US they could keep the Oscars for films, the Emmys for TV and the Tonys for theatre, and here the Baftas, NTAs and Oliviers.Then each event would be special, rather than a seemingly endless parade of bored-looking stars like Renee Zellweger, above, done up to the nines and wishing they were at home.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No matter that I am not, nor have ever been, a member of the Conservative Party.I would never be forgiven by some people, who just couldn’t understand why an ethnic minority person would have sympathy for Conservative policies. At best we’ve been hoodwinked at worst we must just be plain evil.It often feels like we are not allowed to think for ourselves, outside of the orthodoxies set down by left-wing political groupthink.In the days of fighting to set up my school, and in our first few years of establishing ourselves, I received racist emails and threats of violence — from the Left.There were protests outside my school and abuse was shouted in my face from militant union members opposed to free schools.My detractors tried hard to discredit me in ways that made sense to them.There was even a running Wikipedia battle over my heritage, lasting for years.It was regularly edited to state that I was of Indian descent, while some people claimed my ancestry to be Indian Ugandan, and thereforethat I must hate black people.It was absurd, and I didn’t know from one day to the next what race my Wikipedia page would say I was.While it seems a bizarre thing to fight over, some opponents clearly believed that my criticisms of the education system and my support for free schools could be discountedI wasn’t black.My experience ten years ago is why today I have the greatest sympathy for Conservative MPs such as Priti Patel and Kemi Badenoch. Heaven knows what actual Tory MPs from ethnic minorities must have to endure.Mirza has been working with the Conservative Party for many years and her simple appointment to this role has enraged her detractors. For them, a “good” ethnic minority is one who always toes the leftist line.So play around with my Wikipedia page, make me Indian with a couple of keyboard strokes, and suddenly not only have they wiped my mother out of existence, but my words don’t really matter any more. This accusation of “not being black enough” raised its ugly head when Priti Patel was accused of distracting from the racism facing black people by highlighting her own experiences — assomehow her struggles were worth less because she is of Indian heritage .That being called a “P**i” as a young girl wouldn’t have had the same crushing, hurtful impact as any other racial slur. Similarly, Munira Mirza has been accused of not being able to understand the experiences of black people because she is of Pakistani origin.The recent protests inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement should have provoked serious conversations about the meaning and impact of race we all need to explore the nature of racism and what to do about it.But it is clear to me, from the black boxes on Instagram to the meaningless supportive BLM statements on corporate websites, that few people are interested in examining race in our own society.Most people want an easy fix, a stamp of approval that will allow them to be branded a non-racist so that they can go back to their normal lives, satisfied that they are a good person .This is not even remotely helpful to anyone, it’s simple box ticking but the desire to signal “anti-racism” instead of just not being a racist is so prevalent that at times I wonder whether human beings have the capacity to distinguish between the two: The signal and the reality.This tick-box race culture goes hand in hand with the oppression Olympics. Hierarchies of race are the easy bingo card that allows ethnic people to be ticked off on a sheet.Chinese  Sorry, only two oppression points for you. Black  Wow, that’s ten points! You go straight to the top!This is why,you are merely interested in appearing to be non-racist, rather than actually being a non-racist, you will buy into the idea of this totem pole of oppression.You will ignore that race and class are so much more complex than this.My father was of Indian heritage, but he came from a much poorer environment than my black mother and grew up without any shoes.Le is more complicated than the tick-box culture allows, butyour only interest in race is to do enough to signal to everyone that you aren’t a racist, then you will promote that hierarchy enthusiastically, because it is the perfect prop for your non-racist dissimulation. It doesn’t require any thought or effort.The reality of being anti-racist requires years of reading and discussion, befriending a iety of black people, including ones who think dferently from you politicallyand really coming to terms with one’s own uncomfortable feelings around race. Signalling requires a black box on Instagram and instantly everyone approves of you. You can see why most people choose the simpler option.In fact, spending a letime helping black boys realise their potential, something Black Lives Matter should approve of, instead of earning me adoration as a black box on Instagram does, has given me many enemies.My -plus years of improving young people’s lives is meaningless next to the superficial letters of support for BLM, because making a useful dference to people’s lives is less important than being seen to do so. It is a wonder why anyone ever does anything truly good at all.But there is one way of being anti-racist in a very simple and real way that takes no time at all.Allow Priti Patel, Kemi Badenoch and Munira Mirza the right that so many white people enjoy and take for granted: The right to think for themselves.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mums.And when you are responsible for home-educating your children as well as working out how to feed them three meals a day while holding down your job and everything  you used to do before children went to school at home, there is a strong incentive to get those schools open. And quick.Perhaps less so when someone  is taking care of all that stuff for you.Getting our classrooms back up and running may well take a bit of lateral thought, because of course it has to be safe to do so. But on the basis we can now pop to Zara or Ikea, surely we can open our schools safely Few disagree that lockdown should have included schools, but they need to open as soon as it is safe to do so.Yes, these things all need proper managing and organising. So why don’t schools ask local business leaders to help them with the logistics and arrangements To socially distance safely, we may need to cut class sizes in half and have twice as many classrooms, so why not look to use dferent spaces, for example empty community halls, empty libraries, empty offices etc.What about outdoor learning in small groups If we cut classrooms by half we will need twice as many teachers.So how about encouraging unemployed graduates to work as teaching assistants Or asking retired teachers to come out of retirement, just as many nurses did at the beginning of the pandemic.You know you can find the solution when it’s your problem to solve. Which is why any government and any Cabinet should be as representational of “real le” as possible, which is why we need more women advising the Prime Minister.That said, no doubt many women just don’t fancy a le in politics. When you look at the abuse, death treats, and sexism they face, who can blame them.But unless there are people from all walks of le — including women — in the Cabinet, then the issues that affect real people will not be properly tackled or solved.Just look at the incredible effect that some of the world’s female leaders have had when they’ve acted swtly and decisively in the face of Covid-.Germany’s Angela Merkel has kept deaths in her country down to just  per million — compared to  per million in the UK.New Zealand’s inspiring Jacinda Ardern has overseen a remarkable response to the pandemic which involved a rapid, draconian lockdown.Only  people died there. She has been widely praised for her strength in leadership.These daily UK Government press briefings have made it all too clear that we are crying out for more women at the helm.The steady stream of menfielding questions on the topics of the day has been alarming. Priti Patel’s appearances could be counted on one hand.It does make you wonder whether we’d be in a healthier positionmore women had been given more prominence in Boris’s Cabinet.I think we would be.Until recently, many people knew Maya Jama as the girlfriend of rapper Stormzy, but they broke up as a couple last year.What people are now gradually realising is that she has had a fantastic career in her own right – and she proved it last week when she stole the show while co-presenting Peter Crouch: Save Our Summer on BBC.And it wasn’t because her low-cut top, inset, raised a few eyebrows, though certainly not mine.As she rightly pointed out, she can dress how she pleases.She stole the show because she is good at what she does and is engaging.At the age of  she has already done a stint on MTV, DJing on Rinse FM, a job on Radio , and now she is presenting Saturday night TV.Andit weren’t for Covid- she would be acting in her first film around about now too.Plus, as a sideline she is launching a skincare range and has a mysterious big project brewing – rumoured by some to be Strictly Come Dancing.In fact, she said in an interview this week that lockdown is the first time since she was  that she has had such an extended rest .All of this would be impressive for any -year-old but way more so when you know that Maya’s father was in and out of prison for much of her childhood. And not only that – in  when she was , her then boyfriend, Rico Gordon, was killed in a shooting.These are the kind of le experiences that can lead young people down a very dferent track to the one that Maya has put herself on, and for that alone she deserves our admiration.But really we should admire her solely because she is so good at what she does, and such a brave and eloquent voice for her generation.Kate Ferdinand has announced she is pregnant and expecting her first child with husband of nine months Rio.It really could not happen to a nicer or more deserving couple, as evidenced by the fact that when they told Rio’s three children – Lorenz, , Tate, , and nine-year-old Tia – the youngsters jumped up and down with joy.That is the reaction of children who have been made to feel happy, secure and, above all, loved by their father and his new we, despite having gone through the pain of losing their mother.Kate put the video on Instagram with the caption: “The crazy house is about to get a little bit crazier . . . every time I watch this it makes me cry, the best reaction. Baby Ferdy, we are all so excited to meet you.”Good luck to them.About bloody time.This is an opportunity to be seized.If we think carefully about how to spend the money in the right way, we can achieve a great deal of good in this country – and God knows we need that right now.I am sure I’m not the only one having mixed feelings about shops reopening and the huge step back towards “normality” that we all took this week.On the one hand it feels like a huge relief.Thank goodness things are moving again.On the other, I’m a bit worried about how to get out of my pyjamas, start wearing make-up and navigate my working wardrobe again.On balance, though, I’m excited for us to all start doing what we can to get the economy growing again.Talking of shops reopening, I didn’t enjoy the level of scorn being heaped by people on social media on to the huge queues outside Primark stores, which re-opened on Monday.I think before they are so judgmental they should stop for a minute and consider that many people do not have credit cards so cannot shop online.But not only that – say what you like about Primark clothes, one thing they are is cheap.Families with kids who have grown out of their gear over lockdown couldn’t wait to get in there to grab what they needed, and there was a distinctly snobbish element to some people’s judgment.They should think before they speak.Photos of Reese Witherspoon running in a baseball cap with her face concealed by a mask made me realise celebs everywhere – especially those with lockdown hair and faces that might need a bit of  TLC – are seeing this season’s new must-have accessory as an opportunity to conceal a multitude of sins.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They do what they are told to by top brass but these horribly mixed messages are not a good look.It was once commonplace to hear that this country has the best police force in the world. When was the last time you heard that But it was true. Think of the late PC Keith Palmer, who died in  while heroically preventing a kne-wielding Islamist terrorist from entering the Palace of ­Westminster.Yet during this lockdown, there has been a steady draining away of respect for the police.How we all chortled to learn that in Hampshire,  per cent of police are now overweight or obese — the fat-buttocked blue line.While in London, when a ­protester leapt in front of the PM’s car causing a minor crash, it was hardly a complete surprise to see day-dreaming officers gormlessly staring off into space, as oblivious as Keystone Cops in a coma.There is a growing lack of respect for the police and that is the reason why  officers were injured in one weekend.The ordinary copper has been poorly led, leading to inevitable inaction the moment they are met by protesters or a crowd of eager shoppers at Nike Town.Their own senior officers seem far more concerned about ­displaying their politically correct credentials rather than anything resembling law and order. More than  years ago, the Macpherson Report into the death of Stephen Lawrence in South East London found the Met Police to be ­“institutionally racist”.There has been a great overhaul in the force since.It is hugely welcome that there are Black Asian and Minority ­Ethnicofficers now in senior Scotland Yard roles. This was long overdue.But there is still a long way to go before the force can be regarded as being truly erse.Five of the nation’s police forces have only one black officer.Forces in Durham, North ­Yorkshire, Warwickshire, Dyfed-Powys and North Wales had only one black officer in their ranks each as of March last year.This doesn’t mean our officers should be drawn into events like the death of George Floyd , miles away.It should be self-evident that British police were not in any way responsible for that death in Minneapolis.And yet a statement issued on behalf of Britain’s Chief Constables solemnly stated: “We stand alongside all those across the globe who are appalled and ­horried by the way George Floyd lost his le.“Justice and accountability should follow. We will tackle bias, racism or discrimination wherever we find it.”But the appalling racist violence of American cops — or indeed, when the police go on a violent rampage in Paris or Hong Kong — should not be clumsily confused with the issues our bobbies face here.As the violent clashes of the past few weeks have demonstrated, our officers should be focused on our own problems dealing with crime on our own streets.PAMELA ANDERSON ­promotes fake leather vegan handbags.You would never guess it’s mostly plastic.The bag, I mean.

No, not her clothes – the horses.“Doing this year’s Ascot at home,” sighs Lizzie.Just as well. They would never have let her into the Royal Enclosure carrying that glass of champagne.SIR KEIR STARMER, Labour’s gutless leader, is scared ­witless of upsetting his union paymasters so he can’t bring himself to admit that opening our schools is safe – despite sending his own children to school throughout the lockdown.Same old Labour – always hypocrites when it comes to educating their children. One law for them etc.Meanwhile, the Government is finally showing some urgency about getting the schools open again for all, pumping £billion into state schools over the next year, including £million for the most disadvantaged children.It beggars belief that non-essential shops have reopened while schools remain closed or see only a trickle of pupils.There are no non-essential children.DOMINIC RAAB says he would only take the knee for his missus and the Queen.Cue widespread and totally predictable outrage from the likes of Labour’s permanently apoplectic David Lammy.But as Raab’s Jewish father Peter fled the Nazis as a six-year-old Czech in , I don’t think the Foreign Secretary needs lessons in opposing racism from anyone.And to many of us, “taking the knee” looks like a servile and empty gesture, bowing down before the great gods of woke.During World War Two, there were those who thought Dame Veras songs were too sentimental for fighting men who might never see home again.But with We’ll Meet Again and The White Clfs Of Dover, Vera gave hope in the darkness all around.It is signicant that the Queen chose that immortal phase “We will meet again” in her address to the nation at the height of the pandemic.Some songs last for ever.DAN WALKER, the BBC presenter, mocks a supporter of the online campaign Defund The BBC as “a Russian bot” – meaning a fake account run by foreign communists who seek our demise.Oh, Dan! Defund The BBC was started by a smart young Glasgow University student called James Yucel.And there are millions who believe that the funding model of the BBC is laughably old-fashioned in the age of Netflix, Amazon and the rest.Sometimes I think it is the BBC’s preachy, ridiculously overpaid presenters such as Gary Lineker, Emily Maitlis and deluded Dan Walker, above, who are the Russian bots – planted to hasten the end of the BBC.Great, but Lewis is paid £million a year by the Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One team – and , forced labourers once toiled in Mercedesfactories in Nazi Germany.I drive a BMW, who also used slaves under the Nazis.When it comes to symbols of racism, Lewis, German carmakers take some beating.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

His calls echoed Chair of the Education Select Committee Robert Halfon who last week told The Sun the rule should be cut in schools, given the lower risk of children transmitting the disease. He said: I hope we do it soon . What they could do is possibly have dferent social distance rules for dferent organisations.  might be able to be relaxed a bit in schools, because of the low risk of transmission and because of that low transmission you can have slightly dferent rules in a dferent place.

I would hope that schools would be first on the listbecause schools have to come back. Mr Halfon told the Daily : Potentially this could mean that schools go back earlier than September, and we could get more years back for a few weeks before the summer months.

This will not break me, I will not give in nor will I back down. I will continue to proudly stand for what I believe in.”The banning of the Confederate flag at races comes amid the global Black Lives Matter movement, with protests across the US demanding racial equality following the death of an unarmed black man at the hands of police.However, outside the Talladega Speedway circuit, several drivers displayed the banned confederate flag that is a popular symbol for some in the southern part of the United States - but has historic ties to pro-slavery movements.Vehicles waving the flag were seen lining the bouled outside the race track in Lincoln, Alabama, while a plane flew above the track sporting a banner of a Confederate flag that read, Defund NASCAR.The message made reference to the recent protest slogan of “defund police” during demonstrations demanding racial equality.Major cities across the nation have seen widespread demonstrations demanding for change following the death of George Floyd in Minnesota on May  in Minneapolis.Tensions have been stoked further by president Donald Trump, as the presidents supporters faced off with Black Lives Matter protesters on Saturday in Tulsa during his first campaign rally in months.Confederate flags have been a familiar sight at Nascar races across its -year history.Defenders of the blue and red flag of the breakaway confederacy states in the US Civil War deny that its racist, arguing that it is a symbol of Southern heritage that commemorates soldiers who fought with honor.The flag is based on battle flags used by a number of armies in the American civil war between Southern slave-owning states and rest of the Union in the north.The most well known was the banner flown by General Lees Army of Northern Virginia.It bore the familiar white stars on a blue cross set against a red background.After the war it became a symbol of rebel pride and was also known as the Dixie flag and the Southern Cross.Later in the early th century it was adopted by the Ku Klux Klan as it waged a white supremacist terror campaign against black people.Its appearance in the  film Gone With The Wind inspired a widespread nostalgia for the flag a symbol of the Old South.Supporters who use it today say it represents Southern US heritage and the sovereignty of inidual states.It still appears in the corner of the official flag of Mississippi, the only US state flag that includes it since Georgia changed its design in .But for many, its a symbol of slavery and racism that had been a familiar sight at stock car events for more than seven decades.Following the discovery of the noose in Talladega, NASCAR said said it will do everything possible to find who was responsible and “eliminate them from the sport.”Referring to the incident on Sunday, a NASCAR statement read: “We are angry and outraged, and cannot state strongly enough how seriously we take this heinous act.“As we have stated unequivocally, there is no place for racism in NASCAR, and this act only strengthens our resolve to make the sport open and welcoming to all.”Wallace - who drives for Richard Petty Motorsports - said: “Over the last several weeks, I have been overwhelmed by the support from people across the NASCAR industry including other drivers and tea members in the garage.“Together, our sport has made a commitment to driving real chance and championing a community that is accepting and welcoming of everyone.Nothing is more important and we will not be deterred by the reprehensible actions of those who seek to spread hate.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A warming Arctic has accelerated the melting of Greenlands kilometres-thick ice sheet, resulting in a net loss of  billion tonnes of ice mass for the year – accounting for about  per cent of total sea level rise in .In April, the UNs WMO confirmed the past five years have been the hottest on record globally.

Now, with infection rates continuing to fall in our communities, our medical experts have advised that we can now ease some of these measures, while keeping people safe.”  Current guidance says: “If you’re clinically extremely vulnerable, you’re strongly advised to stay at home as much as possible and keep visits outside to a minimum .”They are told to avoid indoor spaces and large groups and to stay  metres from people outside of their household.From July , they will be able to meet in groups of six people as long as they observe usual social distancing rules.They will also be able to leave their home to exercise as much as they like.Those forming support bubbles can treat everyone within the group as part of the same household.NHS volunteers and local councils will continue to provide support beyond July to people who have been shielding.They will still be able to access supermarket priority delivery and get help with drugs and transport to appointments.The government will write to people on the list to inform them of the changes.Communities Secretary, Robert Jenrick said: I want to reassure everyone that we will continue to deliver the unprecedented package of  support including food and medicine deliveries until the end of July. You will be sent information that will explain what support is available after that, you will not be on your own.Whilst clinically extremely vulnerable people should continue to follow strict social distancing measures, they will be able to participate in more activities such as visiting shops and places of worship.Those who need to work and cannot do so from home will be able toto work as long as their workplace is Covid secure.It comes as the latest scientic evidence shows the chances of encountering the virus in the community continue to fall.Across England, the Covid reproduction number is currently . to . - down from . to  last week, according to the latest figures from Sage.Britains Covid- alert level was downgraded from  to  last week, paving the way for the relaxation of the two-metre rule.Dr Jenny Harries, Englands deputy chief medical officer, said: “Shielding was introduced to safeguard those who, at the start of the epidemic in the UK, were thought to be most clinically vulnerable in our communities. We know how dficult this period has been and the impact shielding has had on many people’s mental health.“The prevalence of the virus in the community is now lower and chances of getting infected are reduced, so we believe it is the right time to relax some of the advice so people can start to regain a degree of normality once more in their daily lives.“People should continue to follow social distancing guidance when outside their homes, as well as frequently washing their hands, to minimise the risk of becoming infected. We will continue to monitor the evidence closely and adjust the advice accordinglythere are any changes in the rates of infection that could impact on this group.”Dr Harries also said those shielding should take advantage of the expected good weather this week to get used to reintegrating themselves back into society.Speaking at the daily Downing Street briefing, she said: We may well have some summer weather a little in our favour too and therefore our advice to those shielding is to take some steps now to start coming back to a more normal lestyle.Asked whether children who have been shielding shouldto school, she added: “What we know is there are almost certainly a large number of children who are not going to school at the moment because parents are concerned that they should be shielding.“An example is asthma. Those children are at very very low risk from Covid, but they are at signicant risk of getting left behind in their education.“By September, when we’d anticipate schools will be fully open with all children attending, there should be much fewer children on the shielding list who’d need to be away from school.”Mr Hancock also thanked the . million people in England who have been shielding since the country went into lockdown on March .He said: “I want to thank all those who have been shielding for so many weeks for their commitment to the shielding programme.

It is vital that before anyone in the extremely clinically vulnerable group goes back to work that employers can clearly demonstrate how they are going to be able to keep people safe, whether that’s through socially distancing or providing protective equipment.”Genevieve Edwards, chief executive at Bowel Cancer UK, said: “These are huge steps which we know will come as a welcome relief to many. But for others, the new guidance is likely to cause anxiety, particularly about ing to work. “We urge all employers to implement government guidance and take every measure available to allow those shielding to continue to work from home and where this isn’t possible to ensure a safe, socially distanced working environment is in place for their .”Lynda Thomas, chief executive at Macmillan Cancer Support, said: “We know that for lots of people who have been isolating this will be welcomed news, as they may have been separated from loved ones for a long time.However, others may be feeling incredibly anxious about what’s to come and the news that shielding measures are easing may be bitter sweet for many in this extremely clinically vulnerable group. They will want to be confident that they can go out and spend time with small groups safely, without risking their health.“For those facing ato work, the Government needs to make sure there are no gaps in the support available.

Boris Johnson is said to be looking at new ways to relax the rules as part of a wider announcement on easing lockdown tomorrow. Tomorrowaposs address to Parliament was expected to cover the reopening of pubs and hairdressers on or after July  - and could relax the two-metre rule. Now the Dailyhas reported there are plans for a change to support bubbles too. Downing Street has not confirmed the plans and thereports there is no final decision. A senior government source confirmed ministers were considering allowing more social contact from July , but did not specythat would be in the form of bubbles or other social contact, such as gathering outdoors. The system has let two households in England join together permanently since June  - allowing people to break social distancing rules for the first time. The system has reunited kids with grandparents, and allowed some couples who live apart to have sex after three months away. But millions have also lost out due to tight rules on the scheme.  Currently bubbles must consist of two households only, and one of those households must have only one adult. Each household can also be in only one aposexclusiveapos bubble, forcing people to make dficult choices about whether to see a parent or a lover. A senior government source told the Daily : There will be an expansion of social bubbles, but the details are still being finalised.  One option is said to be letting two households join together, as with the current rules, but to scrap the limit on numbers in each household. A second option is set to be allowing a bubble of any number of households, but with a cap on the overall number of people in each bubble. A source told the : The question with bubbles has always been how you help families reunite to the maximum possible extent without too much risk. The scientistsapos main concern has always been infections spreading from one household to another, which is why this is one of the more dficult decisions we have to take. Boris Johnson is expected to announce lockdown easing plans to Parliament tomorrow lunchtime after consulting his Cabinet in the morning. The PM said he has been sticking like glue to his plan to start reopening the hospitality and leisure sector from July  - including pubs, restaurants, cafes, hotels, cinemas, hairdressers and more. But itaposs likely not all sectors will reopen at once, due to the danger of pushing aposRapos - the number of people each Covid- carrier infects - above one. Rules will be tightened in some areas, with ministers looking at making people register when they enter a pub to make contact-tracing easier. And No warned any widespread breaches would lead to this weekaposs changes being axed first.

Since March millions of clinically vulnerable people have been shut indoors practically the whole time, until recently not even leaving for exercise. Now a plan to unlock those doors - in two stages on July  and August  - has been revealed by the government. From July  shielding people can go out and meet up to five friends - andthey live alone, form a aposbubbleapos with another household. From August , the advice to shield ends completely. Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced: Now, with infection rates continuing to fall in our communities, our medical experts have advised that we can now ease some of these measures, while keeping people safe. But charities warn there is too much dangerous ambiguity and people could have vital support withdrawn - or feel forced back to work unsafely. Sick pay and a system of food deliveries will end on July  - which campaigners fear could leave shielded people in the lurch. So what are the changes announced today and what are the implications for you and the ones you love  Hereaposs the announcement explained.What has the government announced today  The government has announced major changes to the .million people in England who have been asked to shield from coronavirus. Since March, those deemed aposextremely clinically vulnerableapos to Covid- were asked to stay in their homes and not leave at all, even for exercise. Those rules lasted until June  and have remained unchanged, apart from a big tweak on June . This tweak allowed shielded people to go outside for the first time - either with their household or,they live alone, with one person . It was criticised for being announced on a Saturday night by Boris Johnson without full details.  Who is supposed to aposshieldapos  The aposshieldingapos group in England is .million people classed as extremely clinically vulnerable, who were specically advised to stay at home at all times due to Covid-. A full list is here, butyou are in the shielded group you should have been contacted directly. People received the advicethey have a condition that makes them vulnerable to contracting or becoming seriously ill from Covid-. It includes people undergoing chemotherapy or radiotherapy, anyone with cystic fibrosis or COPD, or those with signicant heart conditions. There is a misconception that shielded people are over  - this isnapost true. Some shielding people are over , but not all. Some over-s are shielding, but not all. Is shielding compulsory  No - there is no law forcing people to shield but it is advised for their own protection. The government says there is a package of protective measures, including a helpline and food deliveries, to help people who canapost rely on friends and neighbours for supplies.  What will change from July   From Monday  July, there will be two major changes for all .million people who are shielding in England. Firstly, people who are shielding will be able to join gatherings of up to six people outdoors. These gatherings can be from up to six dferent households - but anyone from separate households must maintain a -metre distance. This follows the rules that were unveiled for the rest of England from June . Secondly, people who are shielding and live alonewill be able to join the apossupport bubbleapos system topair up permanently with one other household. They will be able to break the two-metre rule with people inside their bubble to hug and kiss. This follows the same rules as the current bubble system outlined on June . In other words, one of the two households - the shielded household - must be a single-adult household. Each household can only bubble up with one other household.  What will change from August   From Saturday  August, the .million clinically vulnerable people in England will officially be told they no longer have to shield from the virus. It will bring to an end a period of isolation lasting more than four months. While they should strictly follow social distancing rules, they will be able to go back to workthey cannot work from home, and visit shops and places of worship. Will shielding support end on August   Not completely - but a lot of it will. The governmentaposs direct food parcel and medicine deliveries will end. Matt Hancock confirmed they “continue to the end of July”. And shielding people will no longer be paid Statutory Sick Pay - unless they develop symptoms or are told to isolate. That brings them in line with the rest of the population. The government claims help wonapost simply end at the stroke of midnight on July . NHS Volunteer Responders will still be able to help with collecting shopping or medication, a regular friendly phone call, or transport to appointments. Shielding people will also retain their priority for supermarket delivery slots. But Nick Moberly, Chief Executive of the MS Society, warned: “We are gravely concerned that certain key support measures – such as food packages and Statutory Sick Pay – will be taken away prematurely. Without this help, and with many people still terried of infection, for some the idea of normal le ing will feel more like a threat than an opportunity. WhatIaposm scared toto work on August   Itaposs up to you and your employer - not the government. This is likely to prompt a major row from campaigners who want guaranteed legal protection for workers. The government press release says: From  August, those who need to work and cannot do so from home will be able toto work as long as their workplace is COVID secure, adhering to the  guidance available. But it does not say what will happenpeople feel too frightened or clinically vulnerable to go back. And government sources confirmed this would be a conversation between a worker and their employer - rather than a set legal protection. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told employers: We expect you to do the right thing. Nick Moberly, Chief Executive of the MS Society, warned: “Those who now may have no choice but toto work must be given the right information so that – together with their employer – they can ensure their working environment is safe. We also need clarity on what ‘carefully following social distancing’ means in the real world, in situations like shopping or meeting friends. There is still far too much room for interpretation, and this ambiguity could put people in danger. So are shielded people now under the same rules as other people in England  No. Between July  and August , there are only specic changes. Shielding isnapost being lted completely at that point. Shielded people are still advised not to go to the shops. To make things more confusing, while the aposbubbleapos and aposgroup of six outdoorsapos rules will currently bring shielding people in line with the rest of England, this might not last. Both those rules might be changed for the rest of England - the non-shielding - by the time they come into effect for the .million people who are shielding. We donapost know yet, but itaposs possible. From August , shielding people are still advised to continue to follow strict social distancing measures so the rules are more or less the same as the non-shielded. But they are still at higher risk.  Whatmy family already bubbled up with someone  in June  Then youaposre a bit stuck. Single-adult households in the rest of England have already been able to bubble up with one other household since June . But households are only meant to pick one bubble buddy and stick with that one, not switch around. This meansyou, a family of four, have already decided to bubble up with your non-shielded sister, you shouldnapost then bubble up with your shielded dad. Could I end up having to shield all over again  Yes,there is a second wave of the pandemic. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the shielding list will be maintained and “we stand ready to support people to shield againthat is what’s clinically required”. Mr Hancock also said there could be local shielding ordersthe virus flares up in one particular city. “We will have the ability to do that and we’d consider that as part of a local lockdownthat is what was clear advice, he told the Mirror.

This yearaposs exams were cancelled completely due to the pandemic. The current timetable says next yearaposs exams start in May  and must end before a contingency day of  June . But Tory MP Alec Shelbrooke askedthe entire season in England could be pushed back into July.He said it would allow students and teachers more time in the classroom to try and complete the curriculum. Answering him in the Commons, Mr Williamson said the MP had raised an important point about how do we add more teaching time in. The Cabinet minister confirmed: Weaposll be consulting with Ofqual about how we can move those exams back. [Therefore] giving children extra time in order to be able to learn and really flourish and do incredibly well. It came as Mr Williamson insisted he was planning for a fullof every single child in every year group from September. Scotland and Wales are bringing back some pupils on a rota or part-time to avoid the spread of the virus. But Mr Williamson - who will outline a full plan for September next week - insisted he was planning for a fullof every single child in every year group back into school.  Boris Johnson has insisted he wants all children back in school five days per week from September.He said last week he did not want part-time learning or half days, adding: “I’m making no bones about it, I think that’s the way forward for our country. Unions warned last week it would be impossible to reopen schools fully in September with the current distancing rules in place. Current distancing rules force schools to split pupils into -strong aposbubblesapos, doubling the number of classes. Since then Mr Williamson has hinted the groups of  could be doubled into bubbles the size of normal classes, with  pupils each.  This could cause chaosthere is an outbreak, becauseone pupil tests positive for Covid- all those in the same bubble would have to isolate for two weeks. Boris Johnsonaposs official spokesman said: The PM is determined that children should be back in school in September and we want to do everything we possibly can to deliver that. “It’s important that children attend school and we don’t want them missing out on the benefits and the value of education”. Askedhaving children back in class five days a week was government policy, the spokesman said: The Education Secretary will publish a plan but you’ve got the PM’s words from Friday. He was pretty clear he wants all kids back in schools in September. Mr Williamson last week unveiled a £billion catch-up fund for schools.  Today Shadow Education Secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey slammed the fund for not including nurseries or colleges - despite an early wrong press release claiming it would. She said: Less than an hour later the Government amended the press release. The funding was not for early years and -, it was £ million, not £ million, it would not be available until September and now I hear that schools will need to find % of tuition funding themselves.

A study of , adults found three quarters have had songs playing in the background while they work, with  per cent admitting this is something they do on a daily basis. Four in  believe the tunes help them to be more efficient and productive, while  per cent said it motivates them to get their work done. Another  per cent even claim it helps them to stay relaxed and a fth believe they work harder when plugged in. It also emerged three quarters have been listening to music while working from home and  per cent believe this should be encouraged in the workplace. A spokeswoman for Panasonic, which commissioned the study, said: Listening to music can really help you work - whether it helps to get us aposin the zoneapos or simply blocks out the distractions around us. A blast of music can give workers faced with boring tasks or endless to-do lists the motivation they need to get the job done. When nothing  seems to make us productive, the right music can get us in the right frame of mind to complete the job quickly and efficiently. The study also found the average worker spends two-and-a-half hours of their working day listening to music.  During this time, they will listen to an average of  songs. A quarter have even curated a aposworkapos playlist specically for times when they need to be productive. But while three in  employees said their boss encouraged them to listen to music on the job,  per cent said tunes were allowed but not necessarily encouraged. And a fth arenapost able to listen to music while they work at all, despite a sixth claiming they struggle to work without it.  More than half of those polled, via OnePoll, said they preferred working with a bit of background noise, as opposed to getting on with their to-do list in silence. Music was also revealed as the most popular way to keep things from getting too quiet, with  per cent naming it as their top sound to hear while working. The study also found that in a third of workplaces, music is played over speakers in a communal area. And while  per cent of those just play the radio, one in seven say their eager bosses went all out and compiled a work playlist.

But according to Professor Susan Michie, a member of the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies’subgroup on behavioural science, some people do not know how to correctly put a face mask on and are putting themselves and other commuters at risk.  According to the gov.uk website, a face covering “should cover your mouth and nose while allowing you to breathe comfortably”, YorkshireLive reports.“Wash your hands or use hand sanitiser before putting it on and after taking it off,” the website advises. “Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth at all times and store used face coverings in a plastic bag until you have an opportunity to wash them. “Do not touch the front of the face covering or the part of the face covering that has been in contact with your mouth and nose. Once removed, make sure you clean any surfaces the face covering has touched.” However, Prof Michie says many people appear to be wearing their face coverings below the nose and holding the front of items to remove them, rather than using the straps behind the head. She told The Sunday : “Any time one goes out and around in parks and down the street this is the sort of thing you see.” Prof Michie added a national campaign might be needed to “train” people on how to wear their face coverings correctly.  “I think the main thing is that where you have a behaviour that requires some kind of skill, and some kind of routine and procedure to make it effective, then usually it’s not enough to say do this, ie transmit knowledge, but we also need to have training. “If it’s a question of skills, ie the behaviour surrounding the putting on, off and wearing of , then it does require skills training.”Last week, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan warned Brits may have to wear face masks for the next year. He told LBC: This is part of the new normal. For the foreseeable future, I believe for the next year or so, wearing face coverings is going to become the norm rather than the exception. I was pleased when the PM accepted the need for us to wear face coverings on public transport, and make it mandatory.

For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, click here   He knelt down at the floral tributes to read cards and look at soft toys, including teddy bears and unicorns, which had been left by dozens of friends and neighbours. The touching message on one card read: “To Fiona, my bestie forever. Thank you for the great memories we made together. You showed me exactly what a best friend is. “I will miss you very much. It’s never goodbye, just a see you soon. All my love, Hayley xoxoxo.” At one stage, the heartbroken dad looked up at the burned-out flat and wept uncontrollably.  He was supported by family members and escorted by two police family liaison officers as he left after the painful visit.The dad, who loved making TikTok videos for his children and who hoped to go to Florida with them when lockdown  was over, was too upset to speak. Expressing his grief on social media, he posted: “How I miss them already. Now I know what it feels like when your world comes crashing down.” It followed an earlier message from the distraught dad, which read: “Rest in peace u little angels.” Alex had walked to the nearby Esso garage on Friday night to buy sweets and crisps for his children, only toand find the family home engulfed in flames at about pm. The Scottish Fire and Rescue said six crews who rushed to the scene were met with a “well developed” blaze in the first-floor property. The three children were taken to Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in  Glasgow. All three were pronounced dead a short time after being admitted.Detectives went door-to-door yesterday as they talked to neighbours moments before Alex arrived at the scene. A police spokesman said: “An investigation is under way to establish the exact circumstances of this incident.  “Anyone who has information that could assist our inquiries should contact police via  quoting incident number  of June , .” A fundraising page has been set up for the family and was on course to double its target just over  hours after it was started by a friend.

Here, she explains why itaposs so important. Why in Britain, in , are black people still marching against racism and injustice  In a hard-hitting series, launching today on Windrush Day – the nd anniversary of the Empire Windrush arriving at Tilbury – we’ll look at issues affecting black British lives and why they matter. We start with health. I was honoured to play a role in commissioning a brilliant group of writers who are telling stories long overdue. I hope you read them in the spirit they are written in – a desire to deepen understanding of the issues and create a fairer society, where people are no longer judged by the colour of their skin, but by the content of their character. Mirror writer Adenike Adenitire takes a closer look at four of the most devastating health issues affecting Britainaposs black community. Here is what sheaposs found. Blood cancer  Orin Lewis OBE and we Beverley De-Gale OBE run the charity African Caribbean Leukaemia Trust. For  years it has worked to help patients with blood cancer and other illnesses to find stem cell, blood or organ donors, as there is an extreme shortage in the black community. ACLT was founded in  after the couple’s then six-year-old son Daniel De-Gale was diagnosed with leukaemia. He became the first black person in the UK to receive a stem cell transplant from an unrelated donor. Daniel unfortunately passed away in  at the age of  as a result of multiple organ failure. Orin says: “There is a pandemic virus called racism that is affecting all sectors of society, including health. The Royal College of Nursing came out last week to admit they’ve got a big problem with how black and other nurses from ethnic minorities are treated. “And we see it because our struggle to fund our work to save lives shouldn’t be this hard after nearly  years.”For details visit aclt.org.Sickle cell Sickle Cell Disease is Britain’s biggest genetic blood disease, affecting , people in the country – mainly those of African and Caribbean heritage. Episodes of excruciating pain may occur, which are treated with strong painkillers such as morphine. Those suffering from the condition are at risk of complications such as a stroke, blindness and bone damage. The disease can also result in deathnot treated properly. Approximately  babies are born with SCD in the UK every year but problems of lack of awareness and funding remain. John James OBE, CEO of Britain’s leading sickle cell charity The Sickle Cell Society, says: “Sickle Cell is something that has been known about for over  years but there has been very limited innovation research and development into modying treatment. Why is that  “Some people would ask: ‘If this was the biggest blood condition in the UK but it was affecting predominantly white people, would it still be the same ’” Dame Elizabeth Anionwu, who won a Letime Achievement Award at the Daily Mirror’s Pride of Britain Awards for transforming care for people with sickle cell disease, agrees that patients can face undue prejudice. She says: “There is still an issue about pain relief. “There are still some iniduals of African or Caribbean heritage, who are patients, but are thought of as drug addicts because they need drugs like morphine.”More information is avilable at sicklecellsociety.org.Mental health As a black person in the UK, you are four times more likely to be detained under the Mental Health Act than a white person, according to data collected from NHS Digital. Figures have shown black men are  times more likely to have serious mental health issues such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, yet only % of psychologists are from BAME backgrounds. An independent report conducted by the Centre for Mental Health noted that experiences of racism “appear to be a major influence on the mental health of black boys and young men that wear down their resilience during teenage and young adult years”. The study, which spoke to just under  participants, “found evidence of the incrementally damaging impact of a stream of negative media representations and demonising portrayals of black culture that led men to ‘mask’ their true selves”. Eche Egbuonu’s first experience with mental health issues was during his final year of university. The college lecturer, , from Hackney, East London, said: “There was an identity crisis I went through, where I was surrounded by lots of people but I still felt at my loneliest.” In , he suffered a psychotic episode of mania after having a dispute with his family. The police were called to the home and he was taken to a cell while a bed was prepared for him at a hospital. He says: “Some of the ways they got me into the cell seemed very heavy-handed given the fact that I had not been violent towards the officers or any other inidual. “So I could not understand that level of force or the need to place me in a prison cell.” Child birth  Black women in the UK are five times more likely than white women to die during childbirth according to a  report from Mothers and Babies Reducing Risk Through Audits and Confidential Enquiries. Candice Brathwaite, blogger and author of best-selling book I Am Not Your Baby Mother, understands this only too well after her own experience seven years ago of giving birth to her first child, daughter Esmé-Olivia. The  year-old says: “From beginning to end it was a mess. I was induced and left to wait hours for pain medicine while I was surrounded by labouring white women who seemed to be covered in this maternal care. It really felt like I was an annoyance.” After giving birth, Candice started feeling very unwell and told midwives. She says: “Their attitude was very much ‘you are overthinking it’ and ‘you are just having baby blues’.” But just two days after going home, baby Esmé fell asleep on Candice’s chest and the weight of her tiny body was enough to burst a septic sac growing underneath Candice’s C- section wound.

The circle of shafts, believed to be , years old, is said to be the biggest prehistoric structure ever discovered in the UK. It was found just under two miles northeast of Stonehenge at Durrington in Wiltshire, and is thought to date back to the same period. It is not yet known what it is for - but it is possible the centre of the circle could have been a holy site.Prof Vincent Gaffney, one of the leading archaeologists, told: “This is an unprecedented find of major signicance within the UK.Key researchers on Stonehenge and its landscape have been taken aback by the scale of the structure and the fact that it hadn’t been discovered until now so close to Stonehenge.” And he continued: “I can’t emphasise enough the effort that would have gone in to digging such large shafts with tools of stone, wood and bone.” The newly-discovered settlement includes a henge, or circular structure, made of timber posts.  It could demonstrate that Neolithic people were able to count - as placing the shafts so precisely could only have been done by counting paces. So far  shafts have been found, each more than five metres deep and  metres in diametre. Archaeologist Nick Snashall, of the National Trust, said: As the place where the builders of Stonehenge lived and feasted, Durrington Walls is key to unlocking the story of the wider Stonehenge landscape. This astonishing discovery offers us new insights into the lives and beliefs of our Neolithic ancestors.The circle of pits is signicantly larger than any comparable prehistoric monument in Britain.

But Kate surprised everyone when she dropped an extra third photo of her family - and we think itaposs our favourite of the lot. The cute snap looks far less staged than the other two, showing the family in a bundle on the floor playing and laughing. All three of the relaxed snaps were taken at their countryside home, Amner Hall, where the family have spent lockdown. Charlotte looks adorable in a pair of denim dungarees featuring a zebra and a flamingo, with her hair in two plaits, while her brothers look cute in polo shirts and shorts. One of the other snaps shows the birthday boy sitting on a swing with his youngest, Louis, on his lap while George and Charlotte stood around him. The other shows Wills lying on the grass with the kids climbing on top of him. The family moved to their Norfolk home before lockdown was introduced, and Kate and William have been homeschooling their oldest two children there. In an interview last month, Kate explained that one of the big issues theyaposre having is that George is more interested in his little sisteraposs school work than his own. Speaking to Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield on This Morning to launch her new photograph project Hold Still, she said: George gets very upset because he wants too get involved in Charlotte’s projects!Making spider sandwiches is far cooler than doing literacy work.  She also opened up about how the family have found the lockdown, including not being able to see the rest of the Royal Family and Kateaposs parents Carole and Michael Middleton. She said: Itaposs really hard. We hadnapost done a huge amount of FaceTime and face calls but obviously weaposre doing that a lot more. And actually, itaposs been really great. We try to check in daily with family members and speak to them about news and things like that.  In some ways weaposve got a lot more contact and a lot more face time than prehaps we would have done before. But it is dficult, itaposs hard to explain to a five and a six, nearly seven, year old whataposs going on. The schools have been great in supporting them as well. Hard times but weaposve got the support out there I think.

They are believed to have been set up by members of the chan community - an anonymous website notorious for its trolling culture. It planned to get other white women to follow suit and then troll them for taking part, and in turn undermine the true message of Black Lives Matter. The first post chan containing the #BaldforBLM hashtag was made on Thursday, June  by an anonymous American user. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, click here    It read: Hereaposs the plan: Get #BaldForBLM trending on Twitter and Instagram.The idea is to get women, particularly white women, to shave their heads for BLM. Guilt them into getting rid of their straight white hair to show solidarity with black women. The post contains an image of a woman with a shaved head - the same image appears high on a Google search for the term girls with buzzed hair. The hashtag #BaldforBLM has since been used tens of thousands of times on Twitter, often by newly created accounts encouraging others to shave their heads. But soon after the campaign began and the hashtag began to trend, parts of the internet began to fight back. Twitter user @Lizzeth_Lemon responded to a popular tweet from a new account, claiming that it was using her photo. She tweeted: Hi yaposall, those pictures are of me. I did NOT shave my head for some fragile white performative b******t, I lost my hair during chemotherapy in  and loved that bald look so much I kept it buzzed. The K-Pop community - who love South Korean pop music - also started to fight back. They have a huge online presence and can use it to drown out other agendas as they have such a following.The K-Pop fans began to flood the #BaldforBLM hashtag with short, K-pop videos made by themselves to take over the hashtag and claim it for themselves.One K-Pop fan tweeted: Just found out about another fake hashtag: #BaldForBLM which is a Chan troll tag once again. KPOP twitter from #goBaldforBLM come take these MOFOs down. Dr Kaz Ross, a lecturer in Asian Studies at the University of Tasmania, has researched online far right groups.

Stina Jensen says she is appalled that such information was so easily available to her son Keelian, who took his own le at the age of  after reading several websites and a video on YouTube, the video sharing site owned by Google.Mrs Jensen, who was taken completely by surprise by the death of loving and gentle son, told News how internet search giant Google should be doing more to prevent people finding horrendous suicide material.She said: The night before he died, he started out searching very normal things. He was right into Xbox and he had searched when this new game was coming out. He searched the moon and stuff like that, very normal things. I clicked on what he had clicked on. I was shocked because I thought any child out there could do this. The search terms he typed in were very specic and should have raised red flags. The tragic story of Keelian, from Coominya in south east Queensland, has echoes in the UK case of Molly Russell, whose dad Ian Russell has campaigned for tech giants to take urgent steps to protect young people and stop hosting harmful content.Molly was just  when she killer herself just days before her th birthday in  after viewing suicide material on Instagram. Mr Russell, from Harrow, north London, who runs the Molly Rose Foundation in memory of his daughter, has urged: “For the safety of young people, the s need to do something quickly to make the internet safer.” He said last year: “It’s still all too easy to find such dangerous content.” He added: “In the hours between us saying ‘sleep well’ and the terrible dawning of next day, Molly’s only other influence must’ve come from beyond our house, beyond our love and protection - from the internet.”In May last year we reported how Health Secretary Matt Hancock met Facebook, Snapchat, Google and Instagram and they agreed to fund the Samaritans to help identy dangerous content and create a best practice guide to tackling it. The Government will appoint an independent regulator to hand out fines and hold tech bosses personally liable for harmful content. But legislation might take two years. Speaking alongside Mr Russell, Andy Burrows, associate head of child safety online with the NSPCC, said: “Until we have legislation passed the Government should monitor whether s are playing ball with this interim code of practice [and] name and shame those that drag their heels.”  In this latest case, Keelian had begun searching for information on how to take his own le at around am. He had struggled with mental health issues and his family said he wore his heart on his sleeve, was sensitive and affectionate, but appeared to be in a good place before his death last month. His death took everyone by surprise, with no warning signs.  When searching using the words Keelian did that morning, an ad for a free, -hour telephone crisis support service does appear.

He said: “He was a pervert and more than capable of snatching a child for sexual kicks or money.” We can reveal that Austrian drter Mr Tatschl was grilled last year by German and Austrian police investigating Madeleine’s disappearance.He reportedly told them how his pal bragged about burgling rich tourists’ holiday apartments.  Mr Tatschl, , claimed that Brueckner, , also boasted about “selling kids” – although there as been no evidence found of this so far – and he fears Madeleine was sold to a sex ring.  He claimed: “He was always bragging about money and making money. He even talked about selling kids, maybe to Morocco. “I think he probably sold Maddie to someone. Maybe a sex ring. I was living with him at the time. He was my best friend. I know he did it.” Mr Tatschl claimed that Brueckner was obsessed with the dark web and suspects he used it to deal in pornography and drugs.He also claimed Brueckner had a secret spot in his home in Praia da Lux where he kept stolen loot. Mr Tatschl’s name emerged last week after Portuguese authorities granted access to Brueckner’s court records.They showed Brueckner was locked up on remand with Mr Tatschl after they were caught stealing diesel from lorries.Mr Tatschl, a dad of one who is now back in his native Austria, said he expects an arrest is “imminent” in Madeleine’s case.In his first ever media interview, he described Brueckner as a “strange character”. He said: “He was definitely a pervert. All his friends thought that about him. He had some sexual issues.I really hope they can finally close this case for the family and find Christian guilty for what he has done. He needs to admit it to the police.”  rueckner befriended Mr Tatschl in late . Mr Tatschl began living with him in early  at his farmhouse in Praia da Luz, Algarve, which Brueckner shared with his German girlfriend. Mr Tatschl said: “I was staying at his house and camping in a van in the garden. We spent a lot of time together and had good fun. He did not take drugs at the time but liked to have a drink.” Mr Tatschl claimed that Brueckner bragged about regularly robbing holiday flats.He alleged: “He was a very good burglar and would easily climb up to first-floor apartments when tourists were out.He would steal money, valuables and passports. He had a hiding place in his house, in the roof. He had the money and passports hidden up there.He added: “Christian was always on the dark web. I don’t know exactly what he did but I suspect it involved drugs and pornography.”Mr Tatschl said he was “sucked in” to Brueckner’s le of crime. In April , the pair were caught by police stealing diesel from two lorries in Portimao, Algarve. They spent over eight months on remand in jail awaiting trial. Mr Tatschl claimed that while they were in jail, Brueckner got a pal to clear his home of the alleged stolen loot.He claimed: “He ordered a friend to get rid of any evidence of burglaries or robberies. But this guy and another friend ended up robbing the house and took all the valuables and money. “They also got a video camera from the house, which was how I found out he was a sick b*****d.On that camera was a video of him raping an old woman. It was of this elderly lady who was chained to a wooden post and she was being beaten and raped.”It is not believed that the woman in the video was the American pensioner Brueckner was later convicted of raping and is currently serving jail time for in Germany.After Brueckner’s release from prison, he stayed in Praia da Luz, living in the VW Westfalia van that police later seized.Mr Tatschl said: “I think that confused the police as they were not sure where he was living exactly when Maddie vanished. But he had his van and was living free.” Mr Tatschl moved to the hippy enclave of Orgiva in Andalusia, Spain, in April , weeks before Madeleine, three, vanished on May .He said Brueckner turned up in “late May or early June” driving a Tfin Allegro winnebago. It was in this vehicle that police found a stash of girls’ swimming costumes in .Brueckner also allegedly bragged he could hide “drugs and children” inside the ft-long van.Mr Tatschl said: “He parked it up in Orgiva and came looking for me.“We all wondered where he’d got the money from  It was a big expensive thing. We assumed it was from a big drug deal or something like that. Now I suspect it was Maddie. “He was only there for a couple of days and went on back to Germany. Mr Tatschl lost touch with Brueckner and ed to his native Austria several years ago to start a family. It was while watching last year’s Netflix series The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann that he became convinced his friend was responsible. He claimed: “When I saw the documentary I knew immediately that he was guilty.The part where the female tourist talked about the creepy guy with acne and blond hair, I just knew it was Christian for sure.”Within weeks of the series airing, German and Austrian police knocked on Mr Tatschl’s door. He was interviewed by detectives over two days in April .

They added: We have had these types of clouds before above Kiev Oblast, Ternopil Oblast and Vinnitsa. An anvil cloud, also called cumulonimbus incus, is a cumulonimbus cloud which has reached stratospheric stability and has formed the characteristic flat, anvil-top shape.

The Union of Concerned Scientists estimates between , and , people died as a result of the disaster, whereas Greenpeace places the figure much higher at between , and ,.  Many people living hundreds of miles from the explosion site fell ill with illnesses in the aftermath of the disaster. People experienced everything from strange cancers, to birth deformities and other serious illnesses.

Spanish newspaper El Pais report up to , people in the town of Nauta have received the treatment with Leonardo Tello, the director of local radio station Radio Ucamara, telling reporters the side effects have been terrible. Tello said that since May, the mayor of the province and an Evangelic alliance have called citizens, using radio stations, to be vaccinated with ivermectin asit were a vaccine against coronavirus. In Nauta, at least , people have received it. He said that many of those who had received the treatment had suffered an increase in their heart rate whilst others have warned of diarrhoea as a side effect. Tello says that local Evangelical pastors have linked coronavirus with the devil and the end of the world, offering the injections as a salvation. Wadson Trujillo, the head of the indigenous community in Cuninico, said that volunteers from the Misiones Evangelicas de la Amazoniahad gone to the area to give injections of ivermectin to villagers, saying that it was a medicine passed by law that gives positive results as a vaccine. He said: Almost everybody here had coronavirus symptoms and they are fighting against it with homemade medicine. He said that seven of the  coronavirus tests carried out in the community had come back positive, saying that they now have face masks for the whole population. Local media reported that in the Peruvian Amazon, where around one million people live and around , people are indigenous, fear of coronavirus has seen the widespread use of traditional medicines which have not been proven effective against the virus.The General Management of Medicine of the Ministry of Health of Peru have already warned about the use of ivermectin saying that it has not yet met all the requirements for use on humans. The ministry said: Ivermectin for animals should not be used as a replacement for ivermectin for use on human beings in order to treat coronavirus.

They are doing the same to support other temporary NHS services across Scotland.Our people have worked around the clock with health boards across the country to offer new, technical solutions to help frontline health workers get on with their jobs during this crisis.Our frontline staff in contact centres across Scotland – including Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow and Greenock – have risen to this unprecedented challenge. We’ve received a huge surge of customers asking for faster connections to help with home working, home schooling and running their businesses remotely.These colleagues – most of whom can now work from home when they want to – have performed a critical role keeping our customers, including frontline health workers and vulnerable people, connected.The people in our two  contact centres in Scotland are also playing a critical role, answering lesaving emergency calls.I couldn’t be more proud of how my colleagues have responded to these challenges and their desire to help us all through this crisis.Jane Wood, BT Group director in Scotland, Edinburgh.COVID- is seriously not a jokeGlobally kills thousands of folkYou start coughing, you can#t breatheWithout a respirator, this earth you#ll leaveSocial distancing is now in placeKeep two metres apart, not face to faceWash your hands frequently and well hours on surfaces it can dwellShop infrequently, for essentials onlyDon#t mix with othersyou#re lonelyKeep in touch by text and phoneDon#t put yourself at risk, stay aloneIt#s hoped soon this contagion will peakThen we canto normal, so to speakDon#t travel to other towns by carIt can spread the virus near and farSports, socialising and most work on holdThe alternative could cause damage untoldSupport the NHS, essential workers and neighboursThen we#ll defeat this virus by all our laboursDugald MacGilp, Lochgilphead.Sir,We are looking for people who have the passion to bring communities together, believe in the power of co-operation and who hold the well-being of their community at the forefront of their mind.The successful #Member Pioneers# will receive full training and business support as they help groups and iniduals during the coronavirus pandemic and beyond.

Now we find the bullying problem here is equally as bad.The survey results have particular impact and resonance at this point in time, given the dedication of health and care staff during the coronavirus crisis.This type of behaviour has been anecdotally reported for years, so is not a huge shock, but it is nonetheless disgraceful.Apologies are of little use. Action is needed and the bullies must be confronted. That they were allowed to behave in this way for so long is the real shocker.Their own managers have questions to answer. Why was this not nipped in the bud  Is there an ongoing lack of management training and support Whatever the reasons, it has to stop now.Minard folk were surprised to find themselves in the papers, on television and on the radio this week. They deserve the attention, but communities across Argyll equally merit praise for their kindness and community spirit.Again, it comes as little surprise.That#s the way we do it in Argyll."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert spruced up and ready for tee off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMembers will come back # in good time # to a spruced up and tidy Glenralloch.Maintenance and improvement work has carried on at Tarbert Golf Club in line with current guidelines.The committee reports the course is in immaculate condition with  greenkeeper Graham Prentice on top of things.The greens were hollow-cored earlier in the year and are gradually filling in and some welcome heat and rainwill enhance the greens.Other #rainy day# jobs have been carried out by volunteer members, which has helped the overall appearance of the course.Club secretary John MacNab successfully applied for the small business grant.

People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

It shows contempt for those in the NHS who have risked their lives to save others. It shows contempt for those who have died without their loved ones by their side. It shows contempt for all of us who have stuck by the rules to protect our lives and the lives of others.Boris Johnson has asked us to #move on# but this issue will not go away. This is a wound that will continue to fester.Dominic Cummings continues to be a major player in government decisions and rules, those rules he so shamelessly flaunted without even an apology.

In this monthly column, she shares her wildle diary ndash and pictures!THE day I first visited Musselburgh was not one to write home about.I came to town to see the house I had already agreed to move in to. Most people would organise a viewing before deciding to move in however, since it was my fianceacutersquos childhood home, I had simply said YES!Our move-in date was already confirmed, meaning this visit was just a formality.Upon seeing the amount of work the house still needed as it underwent considerable renovation, my initial reaction was one of utter petrication that it would not be completed on time.The weather was not particularly favourable either. Drenched in the cold September rain, I had lost my appetite to explore the area, which now seemed grim and gloomy.By contrast, my second visit to Musselburgh is one worth remembering.I had come to check on the progress of the house and to join a group of birdwatchers for a stroll around the Esk and the lagoons.The walk started at the river mouth, from where we watched a couple of cormorants sunbathing.It was not long before someone raised the cry: ldquoA kingfisher!I promptly directed my camera to where everyone was looking, and I saw him: a beautul, bright blue kingfisher.After that sighting I knew my le would change.Moving to Musselburgh ended up being one of the best decisions I have made .Since that day I have been studying this wee bird.Every spare moment is spent at the river watching for our kingfisher.It has become my all-encompassing obsession.Each encounter teaches me something new and I never stop learning.This one bird inspired me in many ways, such as helping me understand the importance of fieldcraft in wildle photography, and allowed for some unforgettable captures.So, without further ado, let me formally introduce Mr KingfisherhellipThe kingfisher is an unmistakeable bird, with its metallic azure blue back and bright orange breast.The bird is usually glimpsed, a sudden flash of glistening blue, flitting at the riverbank.If you are luckyenough, the bird may comfortably land near you.Usually, despite its exotic colouration, the bird is dficult to spot sitting on a branch surrounded by foliage, a kingfisher successfully blends into the landscape.I have spent hours in the field and can still struggle to spot a perching kingfisher.When I locate a bird, I identy the sex by the birdrsquos beak: the malersquos is completely black, whilst the femalersquos is orange underneath.Kingfishers are territorial and they will hold their ground against other iniduals.Breeding season is the only time when the male and female tolerate each other and share territory.The choice of feeding ground is extremely important as the bird is dependent on it all year round.Each area covers at least km of slow-flowing fresh water or lake, but this may extend anywhere up to km.The resident male I have been watching for almost three years exhibits slight migratory behaviour it travels upstream during the breeding season, whilst it spends the winter months near the river mouth. For its fishing ground, a kingfisher will often choose a shallow pool in the river bend.They are not titled ldquoking fishers for nothing and are experts in this field.Before ing, they sit patiently on a perch, bobbing their head back and forth to assess the exact position of a fish.Once it has spotted a fish, it es headfirst at speeds up to mph.The kingfisher enters the water with beak half open and eyes protected by its third, transparent eyelid.A split second later, the bird emerges, beak first, and flies back to the perch.Here, it twirls the fish so that it may be held by the tail, proceeding to bash it against the perch to kill it and break the spine, making it easier to swallow.If you have a favourite animal you would like me to feature next month, or are looking for advice on how to spot and photograph a kingfisher, contact me through my website or social media channels.

But the journey became more than I anticipated, and gave me a new angle on Einsteinrsquos theory of relativity.To reach the island I went on a cycle with my good friend Gareth. He is a keen cyclist, and in my early days I was too. I literally cycled hundreds of miles a week. It gave me freedom and a sense of adventure.Over the last couple of decades my cycling adventures have signicantly declined. Those long adventurous rides I used to go on, well they have been a thing of the past, especially after my beloved bike was stolen years ago.But then, during the lockdown, my wee daughter Skye decided she wanted to learn to cycle, and with gritty determination she did so, magically on the same path in the Greenhills at Prestonpans where I learnt so many years before.So another friend very kindly leant me a bike and I was able to accompany my daughter around the then quiet streets of our town as she developed her confidence.I enjoyed this, and it was good exercise, but it began to give me itchy feet and a nostalgic longing to re-experience some of the joys of my youth and head off onto the open road and go exploring on two wheels under my own steam.So when Gareth suggested we go for a ldquovery short cycle ride to visit Green Craig island that I had heard so much about, I gladly accepted.The destination was just beyond the big gates of Gosford House in total just under five miles away. And, of course, the road follows the coast, so no horrible hills to climb.So I set off, with my children waving at me asI was going to war, and met Gareth outside Cockenzie House as arranged.It was from here I became increasingly aware of the depreciation my body has suffered since my last long cycle.The road was, as far as I could ascertain, flat.There was a very slight breeze on my face to cool me, so in theory it was perfect cycling conditions.But something was wrong I was very quickly puffing and panting as I tried to keep up with my friend, who was coasting effortlessly in front of me.I could feel my face turning red and an old lady walking her small dog looked up and gave me a sympathetic glance as I passed her.I was cycling faster than she was walking but not by much.Then another cyclist passed me, at what seemed to be close to the speed of light, at least compared to the pathetic speed I was travelling.It was at this moment I noticed Gareth was well ahead of me, and talking to himself, as he believed I was still just behind him.So I called out, ldquoGareth, slow down a wee bit! He waited for me to catch up.ldquoSorry, I said, ldquofeel free to cycle ahead but I will have to go slower.ldquoYou want to go ahead  he asked.ldquoNo, I said, ldquo we do that we may be in danger of falling over due to lack of velocity!And so we headed out of town.My comment about velocity had put me in mind of Einsteinrsquos theory of relativity that speed is not absolute and objects move at a speed relative to one another, and that this affects the passage of time.My time was most certainly being slowed down. Never had that short journey felt so long.I discovered small hills I had driven over but never noticed. I became acutely aware of the power of gravity, and I lost count of how many stops I needed before we finally arrived at our destination.But what elation when we did arrive: I was shocked on one hand at just how unfit I was, but on the other I had a sense of achievement.We locked our bikes and headed along the coast to the island. The tide was out which meant we could reach it without getting our feet wet.Gareth was keen to find a trig pole which he had discovered was on the wee island. It was used by early map makers but we didnrsquot find it.We sat on a log, and Gareth offered me a cup of tea from his flask. Hersquod bought an extra cup, and we sat there, two metres apart on an old log looking out to sea, talking. It was the best cup of tea I can remember in a long time.The island isnrsquot much in itself, more like a tuft of land or gloried sandbank, just beyond the coast.But itrsquos the location and what you can see from it which makes it special, both in terms of wildle and landscape. And history too is all around.The sea comes in fast at this point and it was soon moving in a pincer motion, enveloping the wee tuft of land to make it an island once again.Itrsquos that which perhaps excites the childhood imagination in us, beating the tide before being marooned or maybe being marooned could be the best bit!But we left just in time. The sea lapped at our feet as we walked past the huge concrete blocks from wartime and we discussed the goings on in the world.As we reached our bikes I noticed some dens made by previous visitors.Impressive constructions, showing perhaps that the lockdown for many of us has given us an opportunity to explore and discover our own area in ways perhaps we never did before.Then we set off home. The journey back gave me a new phenomena to contemplate that a road can feel uphill both ways when you are an unfit, overweight man on a bicycle.Gareth insisted on cycling with me all the way home, you know, just in case.But I made it, and got a kind reception from my kids who asked me, ldquoWhere have you been all this time, you must have gone really far Well in one way I had. Not in terms of actual physical distance perhaps, but certainly in terms of having an unexpected and unforgettable adventure with a kind and understanding friend."},{"url":null,"title":"man-stamps-mark-unique-present-idea","story":"Donald Malone ndash originally from Whittingehame and who runs his own wildle education business, Wildside Nature ndash is using stamps from all over the world in a iety of dferent ways as interesting gt ideas for people.He explained: ldquoI collected stamps when I was a child, aged seven or eight.ldquoThen about  years ago my interest in them restarted.

Wuhan, Iran and later Italy, we knew that losing your sense of smellwas a signicant symptom of the disease.Now, after months of reports, both anecdotal and more rigorous clinical findings, we think we have a model for how this virus may cause smell loss.One of the most common causes of smell loss is a viral infection, such as the common cold, sinus or other upper respiratory tract infections.Those coronaviruses that donrsquot cause deadly diseases, such as COVID-, Sars and Mers, are one of the causes of the common cold and have been known to cause smell loss.In most of these cases, sense of smell s when symptoms clear, as smell loss is simply the result of a blocked nose, which prevents aroma molecules reaching olfactory receptors in the nose. In some cases, smell loss can persist for months and years.For the novel coronavirus , however, the pattern of smell loss is dferent. Many people with COVID- reported a sudden loss of sense of smell and then a sudden and fullto a normal sense of smell in a week or two.Interestingly, many of these people said their nose was clear, so smell loss cannot be attributed to a blocked nose.For others, smell loss was prolonged and several weeks later they still had no sense of smell. Any theory of anosmia in COVID- has to account for both of these patterns.This suddenof a normal sense of smell suggests an obstructive smell loss in which the aroma molecules cannot reach the receptors in the nose .Now that we have CT scans of the noses and sinuses of people with COVID- smell loss, we can see that the part of the nose that does the smelling, the olfactory cleft, is blocked with swollen soft tissue and mucus ndash known as a cleft syndrome.The rest of the nose and sinuses look normal and patients have no problem breathing through their nose.We know that the way SARS-CoV- infects the body is by attaching to ACE receptors on the surface of cells that line the upper respiratory tract.A protein called TMPRSS then helps the virus invade the cell. Once inside the cell, the virus can replicate, triggering the immune systemrsquos inflammatory response. This is the starting point for the havoc and destruction that this virus causes once in the body.Initially, we thought that the virus might be infecting and destroying the olfactory neurons.These are the cells that transmit the signal from the aroma molecule in your nose to the area in the brain where these signals get interpreted as ldquosmell.However, an international collaboration showed recently that the ACE proteins the virus needs to invade the cells were not found on the olfactory neurons.But they were found on cells called ldquosustentacular cells, which support the olfactory neurons.We expect that these support cells are likely to be the ones that are damaged by the virus, and the immune response would cause swelling of the area but leave the olfactory neurons intact.When the immune system has dealt with the virus, the swelling subsides and the aroma molecules have a clear route to their undamaged receptors and the sense of smell s to normal.So why does smell notin some cases This is more theoretical but follows from what we know about inflammation in other systems.Inflammation is the bodyrsquos response to damage and results in the release of chemicals that destroy the tissues involved.When this inflammation is severe, other nearby cells start to be damaged or destroyed by this ldquosplash damage. We believe that accounts for the second stage, where the olfactory neurons are damaged.Recovery of smell is much slower because the olfactory neurons need time to regenerate from the supply of stem cells within the lining of the nose.Initial recovery is often associated with distortion of the sense of smell known as parosmia, where things donrsquot smell like they used to.For many parosmics, for instance, the smell of coffee is often described as burnt, chemical, dirty and reminiscent of sewage.Physiotherapy for the noseOlfaction has been called the Cinderella of the senses because of its neglect by scientic research.But it has come to the forefront in this pandemic. The silver lining is that we will learn a lot about how viruses are involved in smell loss from this. But what hope is there for people with a loss of smell now The good news is that the olfactory neurons can regenerate. Theyrsquore regrowing in almost all of us, all of the time. We can harness that regeneration and guide it with ldquophysiotherapy for the nose: smell training."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/10676858.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"new-bbc-documentary-series-jamie-genevieve-great-indoors-air-week","story":"The make-up artist, who is a worldwide star on YouTube and Instagram, will star in the three-part series Jamie Genevieve: Great Indoors on BBC Scotland onThursday at . pm.It comes after the success of her first documentary for the networks BBC Scotland channel Jamie Genevieve #Unfiltered.The former Cathkin High School pupil started out working in make-up counters in Debenhams in Glasgow.Now she is known for her how to make-up demonstrations on YouTube.The new mini-series focuses on how Jamie and husband Jack is coping in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic from trying her hand at hairdressing to baking."},{"url":null,"title":"list-glasgow-shops-administration-lockdown","story":"Here we look at some of the businesses who will no longer be operating in the city and the ones under threat.Remnant KingsCity location: Howard StreetA total of  stafflost their jobs from the firmrsquos bases in Glasgow, Hamilton, and Edinburgh after the administrators were called in.The firm, which started in Glasgow in , said that although they were historically profitable, they have since suffered from declining turnover and trading dficulties in recent years caused by changing consumer habits.:Glasgow firm Remnant Kings goes into admistration resulting in job lossesOasis and Warehouse GroupCity locations past and present: Buchanan Galleries, Silverburn, Princes Square, and Glasgow Fort.The company behind Oasis and Warehouse went into administration in April when Deloitte was appointed as administrator.All stores haveclosed indefinitely whileonline sales have stopped.Reports say the fashion brands have been sold to restructuring business Hilco in a deal which includes stock but not the  stores or  concessions.Hash Ladha, chief executive of Oasis Warehouse, previouslysaid: ldquoThis is a situation that none of us could have predicted a month ago, and comes as shocking and dficult news for all of us.ldquoWe as a management team have done everything we can to try and save the iconic brands that we love.:Oasis and Warehouse who have shops in Glasgow fall into administrationCath KidstonCity location: Gordon StreetCath Kidston said they will not reopen their shops when lockdown ends.They called in the administrators in April with the closure of shops costing around  jobs.It is understood that the owner of the retro fashion brand has secured a deal to buy back the brand and its online operation.

Itrsquos not just in the countryside that they have become a large part of our lives, a source of ersion, fascination and even, or so I have felt, of company. Stepping outside in the morning is like entering the Usher Hall during warm-up, a discordant and energetic orchestra of flutes, pipes and trumpets. As I brush my teeth, I sometimes see Wilf, the blackbird with the silver ankle ring, by the chimney, letting the wind ruffle his feathers. He has a very keen look, and when our eyes meet, you feel you have been noted. By evening, his spot is taken by a pair of turtle doves which perch side by side on the TV aerial, well camouflaged against the dusky sky.Alan saw Wilf enjoying a bath in a puddle the other day, near his HQ, in the centre of the village. On our first social gathering in months ndash a glass of wine in a neighbourrsquos garden one warm evening ndash Wilf landed on the lawn beside us, hopping behind our chairs, and unperturbed by our friendsrsquo inquisitive dog. Clearly he considers every garden to be his private food department. Theirs is Fortnum and Mason to our Lidl.A barn owl has been seen in the village lately, out hunting before dark. The photos show a beautul, ghostly creature with a heart-shaped pale face, after which Hoolet is named. It was gliding low between trees and across the edge of rough fields. I hope it kept its distance from the blue tits, because other birdsrsquo chicks are the perfect snack for owls and their owlets. That comes as little surprise, but it wasnrsquot till recently that I learned that the woodpeckers haunting our garden might be lingering near the nestbox in hope of a tasty snack. A large one had taken up position on the gatepost, a few days ago, within earshot of the nest. Squirrels, meanwhile, are the stuff of blue titsrsquo horror movies. They have been known to gnaw away at a nestbox entrance to reach the birds inside.The charm most of us find in bird le and nature is often a rose-tinted perspective. For birds, every day is a challenge, a survival exercise tougher than anything the SAS could conceive. Often Irsquoll see the older blue tits, decidedly dishevelled, stuffing themselves on our peanut feeders as they boost their blood sugar levels ahead of another caterpillar hunt. Occasionally a scattering of feathers in the flowerbeds indicate where a cat has brought down a weary or unwary bird. The RSPB says that the avian massacre by cats ndash estimated to be over  million a year ndash is a natural winnowing, with only the weak or ill falling prey. Irsquom not convinced. It sounds like a half-truth, aimed to prevent all-out conflict between bird and feline lovers. Not that the two are mutually exclusive.Danger is all around,yoursquore small and feathered. Friends were out for a walk beyond Hoolet recently, and spotted a flock of sparrows, feeding on grass-heads. Suddenly, not six feet away from them, a sparrowhawk swooped and snatched one of the birds. The speed of the attack, and the hawkrsquos audacity, were startling.Nor was this a first sighting of this turbo-charged predator that moves at the speed of a bullet. Occasionally I catch one ing between our house and a neighbourrsquos garden. As it flashes past the kitchen window, you know this is no idle reconnaissance. From its perch high in the sycamore, it has spied something delicious. The best you can hope is that, for the creature caught in its crosswires, the end is mercully swt.With less traffic, you see far fewer birds flattened on the roads, especially pheasants, which usually seem positively eager to examine the chassis of approaching cars. Our neighbours were nevertheless worried that theyrsquod found a pegged-out pheasant among their poppies. Hearing them calling to us through the beech hedge ndash by now almost as impenetrable as the Berlin Wall ndash we hurried over to offer first-aidrequired.The glittering, fearless ndash and pea-brained  ndash beauty, which has been parading our gardens since springtime, was far from dead. It had simply settled itself into an earthy dip to enjoy the sun. This would explain the dusty hollows Irsquove been finding of late in the shrubbery, asan easter egg-sized UFO had landed. Unfazed by the humans clucking anxiously around it, the pheasant only roused itself and got to its feet when it heard us approaching on the gravel.Another frequent visitor is the young hedgehog which has taken to walking up the road to the house, around tea-time, and disappearing into the back garden. Seeing it approach, I stuck my head out of the door into the pouring rain, and noticed it has a limp. Seen from behind, it lurched on one hind leg, like a trolley with a wonky wheel. Since it was going at a lick, and obviously knew exactly where it was heading, I left it to get on with it.Itrsquos a matter of days before the blue tits will be out of their nest, and bouncing around the garden. In a second-hand bookshop last year I found a guide to making your garden more bird friendly. In a chapter on building nestboxes for dferent species, it advised that, after the breeding season, these boxes must be cleaned, to protect future broods from disease. This must be how landlords feel when the end of a tenancy is approaching. The need to disinfect is clearly universal. Unique to providers of avian accommodation, however, is the warning to brace yourselves for finding addled eggs, or the remains of chicks that failed to thrive.

His immediate task  The further easing of the lockdown in England without causing a surge in new cases.Ahead of the main act announcing something this week, Downing Street sent a warm-up man in the shape of Englandrsquos Health Secretary, Matt Hancock. On the dove-ish side of the lockdown easing debate, he was perhaps better placed than some to reassure the public that it would be safe to get back out there into pubs, restaurants, and schools.Sky Newsrsquos Ridge on Sunday was first to run the rule over the numbers with Mr Hancock. By presenter Sophy Ridgersquos reckoning, the contact tracers were only reaching two people a week.: Revolutionary vision for post-Covid ScotlandFar from being a sign of failure, said the Minister, this was a good thing. It showed there was spare capacity in the system, and that was because the number of new cases was falling.So to the much hyped app, meant to be the jewel at the centre of what the PM promised would be a ldquoworld-beating system of track and trace. With the failure of the Isle of Wight trial and still no date as to when the software will appear, the app has become a Bennettian ldquochip in the sugar, a sign of standards not being met and promises unfulfilled.Asked when the app would be ready, Mr Hancock said he was not going to put a date on it . ldquoIrsquom highly confident it will happen, said the Minister. By the time he reached The Andrew Marr Show this had become ldquoWersquoll get there with the app.Nick Robinson was standing in for Andrew Marr, whose father has died. The Today presenter was among those who deputised for the Scot after his stroke in . Robinson would have found the format much the same: start with the papers, end with a Minister, and pause in the middle for something lighter, in this case interviews with Kristen Scott Thomas, who stars in one of the Talking Heads, ldquoThe Hand of God, and Nicholas Hytner, who directs three of them.One major change Robinson could not have predicted are the by now regular slots on Marr for experts. Both Professor Sir Ian Diamond, the UKrsquos National Statistician, and Professor Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stressed that coronavirus had not gone away and there was no room for complacency.Professor Piot, described in his introduction as something of a star in the fight against viruses ndash the ldquoMick Jagger of microbes someone had called him ndash said he would be okay with a relaxation of the two metre rule as long as masks were worn in public places. He also called the quarantining of people entering the UK ldquouseless and urged the UK Government to appoint a Covid- tsar at Cabinet level.: Former FMslates blended learningIn all his answers he was as clear as day, unlike Mr Hancock who had to do the usual thankless ministerial task of talking about a subject while not giving anything away before the official announcement.In lieu of detail Mr Hancock had come bearing a new word: ldquomitigations. Besides mask wearing this appeared to include adopting the New Zealand system of asking people for contact information when they go to a pub or restaurant. Expect ldquosign here for a pint headlines in England.Robinson was not going to let Mr Hancock go without bringing up the Ministerrsquos breach of the social distancing rules, as caught on camera last week when he patted a colleague on the back in the Commons. ldquoIt was just totally natural, said Mr Hancock. ldquoThis shows how dficult social distancing is. All I can do is say Irsquom incredibly sorry for this momentary breach. Itrsquos because Irsquom human. Wersquore all human. It sounded like another headline in the making.One person determined not to make the headlines was Iain Stewart, the new Scotland Office Minister, making his first appearance on Politics Scotland.Mr Stewart, the MP for Milton Keynes South, got his job because the previous incumbent had resigned over Dominic Cummingsrsquo dash to Durham. But Mr Stewart had little to nothing to say on that to host Gordon Brewer. Nor was he keen to share his thoughts on extending the furlough in Scotland save for telling the Scottish Government to be ldquomore ambitious on reviving the economy.ldquoAll yoursquore doing is telling us things we already know, said Brewer.

It was her proud claim that not one of her children left without being able to read and write. Coincidentally, it seemed that the majority of them wanted to learn, teachers and parents were respected and discipline was applied rigorously, despite the widespread poverty.I find it dficult to understand why, in our modern system of free education, more and more children seem to prefer to roam the streets, rather than apply themselves to learning the basic Rs. Interestingly, the children of immigrants seem to appreciate this more than our home-grown lot.I wonder why this would be Carol MacDonald, Troon.POLITICIANS and high-ranking civil servants behind the decision for \"blended\" schooling, aka part-time school, are largely cushioned from the consequences of their decisions: they dont have to choose between working and educating their children at home because they have jobs where they can be flexible about hours, can afford for their partners not to work full-time, can afford private tutors or to send their children to private schools whichthey are not offering full-time schooling in August will still be offering much more than state schools.But it isnt just the children of politicians and high-ranking civil servants who are protected from the consequences of their decisions about lockdown.

Itrsquos a hefty chunk of money but we have been amazed at the response, added Mr Gill.Two of the Platinum memberships, which offer letime membership, a chance to have the memberrsquos name highlighted in the clubhouse, access to an annual Platinum membersrsquo event, and a gt of a tie or scarf, were sold to people with direct links to the Brora area.One, Bernard Ledworth, who moved to Brora in , told the clubrsquos website: ldquoSince I arrived in this small remote village, I soon realised how important visitors are to the survival of the golf club.ldquoLocal membership is small and membership fees remarkably low for a course of this quality. The golf club needed to reach out to its worldwide fan base, as well as its local members, in order to get financial aid.ldquoMany golf clubs worldwide will disappear over the next few months. We could not allow Brora to be one of them.ldquoBrora committee acting quickly, as they did, has given us a fighting chance of survival ndash but much more is needed.Another, Les Steel, who has family links to the area, said he had opted to buy the pound, membership rather than putting the money in the bank or stocks and shares. ldquoIrsquove effectively paid  years of golf at once, he added.Brora was established in  as a nine hole course and was extended in  to  holes.Five times Open Champion and prolic golf course designer James Braid visited the course in  and infor just pound plus travelling expenses, submitted plans for a redesigned -hole layout.The course is regarded as particularly challenging due to the North Sea wind and its natural obstacles.President Andy Stewart said: ldquoWe were looking forward to a bumper year of visitor numbers, projected at pound,, before the COVID- pandemic halted us in our tracks in March.ldquoWith a dependence on visitor income, we have had to be creative in our thinking to drive new revenue and we have simply been overwhelmed with the love for us from across the world.ldquoI think we always knew we had members and visitors who love our links. But, when that support all comes together at once, I think it has just been incredible for all of us to realise just how well regarded the golf club is.ldquoIt really has been fantastic."},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-mark-smith-agree-nicola---scots-looking-history-identity-wrong-way","story":"Nicola Sturgeon touched on whatrsquos causing the issue the other day when she was asked whether black history should be included in the school curriculum. Yes it should, she said, because children need to have a better understanding of their identity and where they come from and Scotlandrsquos history, good and bad. ldquoAnd when it comes to colonialism and slavery, she said, ldquothere are aspects of Scotlandrsquos history that are pretty shameful and we have to be prepared to face up to that.I agree with Nicola. I also agree with the historian Tom Devine ndash who would dare do anything   ndash when he too said last week that Scots have failed to face up to their involvement in the slave trade and I agree with him about the reason for it: the Scottish sense of victimhood. ldquoIt is very dficult for a people who see themselves as victims, said Sir Tom, ldquoto accept that in their history they had also been oppressors.:Mark Smith: Staff are refusing to work on JK Rowlingrsquos new book because of her trans comments. Good on themBut this is where it gets complicated. Most of us would probably agree that a consensus is building that Scots need to do more to acknowledge and disseminate the fact that we were deeply involved in colonialism and slavery. Indeed, in his  book The Scottish Nation, Tom Devine goes further: not only were Scots involved in imperialism, the Scottish missionaries that were to the fore in Africa, India, and where gave it a moral imperative. In other words, not only were we up to our oxters in it, we convinced everyone that building a British empire was the right and moral thing to do Godrsquos work.The question is though: to what extent is a sense of victimhood, and a denial of the true picture, still a problem  Sir Tom believes things started to change in the s and that a greater interest in Scottishness led to a greater willingness by Scots to accept their past, but Irsquom inclined to agree with Nicola Sturgeon that the problem hasnrsquot really gone away and that therersquos more to do in facing up to the shameful parts of our past. Ms Sturgeon was talking about schools, but it doesnrsquot end there: therersquos politics, popular culture, social media, everywhere.And thatrsquos the problem with the tendency to turn away from the more shameful bits of history and see ourselves as victims ndash ones who suffer rather than ones who inflict suffering ndash because itrsquos pretty much there wherever you look. Many of our most celebrated historical figures are icons of suffering ndash Mary Queen of Scots in particular ndash but Irsquom afraid you can also see the same narrative in  in the way some nationalists argue for independence: we must be free, they say, because under the English we are suffering.This mentality of suffering is also particularly prevalent in the way Scots see conflict ndash a point well explained in a recent Zoom chat I sat in on involving some of the historians who belong to the Scots at War Living History Society. One of the great myths about the First World War, they said, is that Scots suffered more per capita than other parts of the UK and that the infantrymen who were sent over as canon fodder were disproportionately Scottish.:Mark Smith: What the row over Glasgows war memorials tells us about ourselvesNone of itrsquos true. Scots werenrsquot just infantrymen being sent over the top by English toffs, they were officers and doctors and they didnrsquot just serve in Scottish regiments. There were also Scots in the general staff and, of course, the man who was running the whole thing, Douglas Haig, was a Scot, the point being that there were Scots at the top of the British Army and at the top of British society and British government and theyrsquore still there today.Getting more Scots to accept this point is not going to be easy though, as one of the historians who took part in the Zoom call, James Taub, pointed out. When people have identied with a message all their lives, he said, theyrsquore going to be reluctant to change. Whatrsquos more, as Mr Taub said, much of the modern Scottish identity comes out of our perception of important historical events and the idea that Scots suffered more. History isnrsquot just who we were, itrsquos who we are, and thatrsquos true even when wersquove got the history wrong.Which leaves us with the dficult job of putting it right. Nicola Sturgeon is unlikely to agree that the tendency to see ourselves as victims rather than oppressors feeds into the way some nationalists frame the case for independence. But the First Minister does seem to be suggesting that wersquove been getting it wrong in the way we educate children about some of our history. In supporting the inclusion of black history in the curriculum, she also seems to be suggesting children need to know more about the role Scotland played in the oppression of colonialism and thatrsquos undoubtedly a good idea.:Mark Smith: Cruel and unjustied: the legal case against the Scottish Government that you might not have heard aboutHowever, it needs to go further than that because wersquore all guilty of telling the same, wrong story. We do it when we talk about English imperialists and donrsquot talk about Scottish ones. We do it when we talk about our lonely imprisoned queens and not our brutal warrior kings. And we do it when we talk about Scottish infantrymen on the Western Front and not the Scottish officers who were running the war.And we do it too, Irsquom afraid, when we talk today about Scots suffering in the shackles of the UK. The idea, I suppose, is that Scots have suffered disproportionately in the past and that wersquore still suffering now and in some ways, the story is understandable ndash the role of victim is better than the role of oppressor. But the truth is we have always been both and itrsquos time for what Nicola Sturgeon says she wants: a proper understanding of history, the story of the good and the bad, the story of who we were and who we are.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Wersquove seen huge increases in families claiming social security support, piling financial pressures on families who can least afford it. Parents are struggling to make ends meet and are already cutting back on food and essentials,\" she said.\"As the job retention scheme tapers off, we fear further unemployment and hardship ahead. Social security should be an anchor in stormy times, putting more money in familiesrsquo pockets.\"It comes as research by Save the Children and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation found that seven in ten of Scotlands poorest families have had to cut back on food and other essentials while half have had to borrow money to get through the coronavirus lockdown.More than half of families on Universal Credit or Child Tax Credit in Scotland have been pushed to borrow money since start of crisis ndash with many relying on expensive forms of credit.Ms Telfer added that they are calling on the UK Government to provide a leline for children by increasing the child element of Universal Credit and Child Tax Credits by pound per week. They are also calling on the Scottish Government and councils to provide a \"dignied, cash-first approach\" to free school meals over the summer holidays.Across Scotland the claimant count has soared by % from , to ,.Eastwood, which had the lowest levels of unemployment on the Scottish mainland saw numbers rise by two-and-three-quarters- the third highest of all  constituencies.The analysis also reveals that the region with the smallest rise in claimants at just .% is an area with already high levels of unemployment - Greenock and Inverclyde. In , the Inverclyde council area was rated as the most deprived in Scotland by the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation , with Greenock Town Centre the most deprived community.And there is an east-west ide in terms of the effect of Covid- unemployment, with the six Edinburgh constituencies seeing a rise in claimants typically running at two-and-a-half times over the three months - about half the rate in Glasgow which has seen a % increase.Dave Moxham, deputy general secretary of the Scottish Trades Union Congress said it feared a disproportionate unemployment hit to fall on young people going forward with the October end of the furlough scheme presenting a \"clf edge\" with government either forced to accept very high employment or to act to invest in jobs.ldquoThe spike in unemployment and the impending furlough clf edge underline the fragility of the Scottish economy with its high reliance on the service sector. The coronavirus crisis has been layered on to an economic system that wasnrsquot working. Large parts of Scotland have never recovered from industrial decline, relying on out-of-town shopping centres to inflate a local economy built on consumer debt, while other parts are dependent on the low-waged tourism and hospitality sector which is unlikely to recover anytime soon.\"Liz Cameron , chief executive of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce said that to prevent mass unemployment, support needs to be aimed at sectors such as renewable energy where there can be growth.She said the UK should align unemployment benefits to reskilling and retraining focused on sectors such as decarbonisation, green energy, manufacturing and digital which is expected to show growth going forward.\"There is no easy fix, but we need to remain focussed, party politics aside, to tackle the global economic and jobs crisis we face,\" she said.\"Scotlandrsquos economy has proven particularly vulnerable to the effects of the pandemic. This is in part due to Scotlandrsquos heavy reliance in certain sectors, for example tourism and our independent retail and hospitality businesses in particular. They were the first to close down and are at the end of the road map to be able to restart completely.ldquoWe have already seen major employers such as Rolls Royce and several major hoteliers forced to enter discussions on redundancy which will inevitably mean even more job losses.ldquoThis situation has been partly shielded by the financial support provided to businesses through the UK Governmentrsquos Jobs Retention Scheme. With this financial support being reduced and finally withdrawn, businesses being unable to trade, earning no income to pay wages, there is no viable alternative. The unemployment situation in Scotland is also compounded by the fact that we tend to lag behind other parts of the UK in terms of economic performance even before the pandemic.ldquoWe also need quick solutions targeted in the right areas to support those graduates and school leavers who are just entering the employment market. We will need to roll-out retraining and upskilling modules that are quick and agile that match up with the needs of Scotlandrsquos economic sectors. Only by aligning our workforce and the needs of the economy will we be able to help large numbers of iniduals to keep their jobs and secure new ones. Anything less will do permanent damage to the economy and to our skills base. \"Last week it emerged that Scotlands unemployment rate was now the highest among all the UK nations.The Office for National Statisticssaid unemployment in Scotland for people over  was .%, compared with a UK rate of .%.Unemployment rose by rose by , to , between February and April as lockdown hit the labour market.And ministers said the figures were a clear indication of the challenge facing Scotland as a result of the pandemic.Scotlands unemployment rate went up from .% in the previous quarter.Meanwhile the latest figures show Englands rate now stands at .%, Wales is at % and Northern Ireland is at .%.The figures only captured the first five weeks of lockdown.AScottishGovernment spokesman said: \"We know the scale of the challenge facingScotland as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and understand that many people will be feeling a deep sense of anxiety about their livelihoods.

said: \"It seems unlikely that age, sex and deprivation explain the pattern of COVID- deaths in Inverclyde in comparison with NHS GGC.\"Report authors John ODowd, NHS GGC clinical director, and John Burton, public health information manager, saidthat it appeared thatInverclyde was just unlucky early on in the health emergency adding thatsocio-economic deprivation has a profound effect on COVID-

those in the most affluent areas.\"\"This analysis is challenging to perform at a partnership level due to the smaller numbers involved.\"Mr ODowd and Mr Burton state: \"In the early part of the

can therefore see that with standardisation for age, sex and deprivation, whilst a higher mortality rate remains, the dference may have arisen by chance.\"Thereport into Covid- deaths in Inverclyde

Inverclyde than in other areas.\"The report adds: \"The most likely scenario which explains the excess deaths in Inverclyde is that the pandemic took hold earlier in Inverclyde in comparison with other areas of Scotland and NHS GGC.\"This fits with the higher positive rates of COVID- testing in Inverclyde, and with the higher admission rates of patients with COVID- in Inverclyde.\"This most likely reflects the early nature of the pandemic experience in Inverclyde, and a greater propensity to admit cases where there was no experience of their clinical needs at an early stage of the pandemic.\"There is no evidence that the quality of care or access to care was worse in Inverclyde, as the admission rates were higher than across the rest of NHS GGC, and there was no dference in the

A storm in  showed something strange in the sand at the Bay of Skaill and the Laird, William Graham Watt, went on to excavate part of a , year old village. After reading the original reports, I now know that this isn’t true. The real story is more interesting.The Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, has three papers on Skara Brae. The first was by Samuel Laing, who visited the site in autumn .“Two chambers have been completely excavated, together with the passage and parts of the entrances to other chambers by Mr William Watt, a relative of William Watt, Esq of Breckness, residing at Skaill, to whose zeal the scientic world is indebted for the discovery and exhumation of this interesting relic of antiquity.#When I saw the credit being given to a relative of William Watt Esq, rather than the man himself, I remembered my father, Peter Leith, telling me that his father, also Peter, had told him that a dferent William Watt, known as Black Willie, had been the man responsible.In the  Census, I found the Laird living at Skaill, aged , with a son William, aged . His son and heir, William WG Watt was  and living at Kierfiold, so there were two sons called William.In James Irvine’s  book, ‘The Breckness Estate’, I read that William G Watt had a natural son, William, who in  was given £ a year and free board, “so long as he chose to remain a clerk in the house.”The story then turned into a neat circle. I followed up a reference in the book and found it was an Orkney Herald article written by my grandfather. It was about Hugh Miller’s book ‘Rambles of a Geologist’, in which Miller recorded his visit to Orkney in .My grandfather had written: “Another interesting person, who has already been mentioned, was William Watt of Skaill. This was not, as some readers may suppose, the laird of Skaill, but a distant relative who made his home there. He was well-known to everybody as “Black Willie” from his dark hair and complexion. Like Miller, he was a self-taught geologist, he always carried a little bag with a hammer and chisel to dig out any fossils he came across. He brought some of his more interesting specimens for Hugh Miller’s inspection and they had an interesting discussion. When Skarabrae was first dug into in the ’s, it is certain that Black Willie took an active part in the work and saw to it that anything found was safely preserved.”I looked up the references to William Watt in the book and found that Hugh Miller had come with a letter of introduction to him and described him both as an intelligent geologist and an intelligent palaeontologist. He showed Watt, along with Dr Garson of Stromness, where his famous discovery, the Astrolepsis fossil, lay.To read about the second and third papers on Skara Brae and what Patricia found out, see page  of this week#s edition of The Orcadian.Patricia Long is a tourist guide based in Stenness with a strong interest in social history.

However, as we work towards recovery and more peopleto work and further local leisure opportunities begin to open up it is vital that measures are put in place to protect everyone’s health.“Transport operators continue to play a key role in supporting essential travel and in ensuring passenger confidence in public transport while maintaining physical distancing.

The financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here are two examples of how companies have been helped, and what support is available.Source: Her Majesty’s TreasuryAn unprecedented package of UK Government financial support has helped firms like Q-Mass in East Kilbride weather the coronavirus crisis. Director Ronnie Robertson said lockdown hit his company’s order book, but the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been vital to help them hang on to their valued staff.Ronnie said: “Before this, we had quite a good order book, with three to four months of work planned, so we were pretty worried where it was going to take us.” At first, he was worried how he would keep Q-Mass’  staff on the payroll, but then the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme was announced.It offers UK Government support to pay  per cent of staff’s wages up to £, a month, and the scheme has now been extended until the end of October.Q-Mass manufactures bespoke parts for the oil, gas and defence industry so staff training is important. Ronnie said: “Our staff are very highly skilled. We’ve gathered a bunch of people here and trained them up and taken on apprentices. We do a lot of training, we’ve got good people, we train them a lot and we want to hang on to them.”He found applying for the furlough scheme quick and straightforward. He said: “It was surprisingly easy and we were surprised that the money came through relatively quickly.”Now staff at the firm who’ve been furloughed are gradually ing to work, with strict safety measures in place. Ronnie said: “We’ve put a day sht back on and we’ve still got a few office people working at home, with quite a few still on furlough.And because of the size of the building, maintaining a two-metre distance hasn’t been a problem for ing staff.“The workshop’s a big, wide open space and we have to keep cleaning things like photocopiers and touch screens, but it’s been quite straightforward.”Now Ronnie’s looking forward to a brighter future. He said: “I feel like we’re on the side of the valley and we’re looking across to the other side and it looks absolutely fantastic. Getting through the next few months is crucial for us. We have a really good bunch of people and we want to hang on to them. The furlough scheme has helped us to do that.” vw, px\"  Planning, forward thinking and invaluable help from the UK Government has enabled a Northern Ireland firm to ersy and remain solvent. When Covid- struck, Newtownards baby product manufacturer Shnuggle’s owners Sinead and Adam Murphy were prepared thanks to advice from their export colleagues in China.Sinead said: “We reduced our out-goings, put on pause our marketing spend in the business. We just tried to protect the cash that we had.“The first impact was our customers that we sell to in Asia. They all went into lockdown so our orders and sales to them stopped. But also a lot of our production happens out in Asia so our factories went into lockdown.“Luckily we had bought a lot of stock beforehand. We were so relieved that we had, at least we could carry on trading with our UK and European customers.” With around half of the company’s sales in the UK and Ireland and half in the export business, Shnuggle had to rely on their local retail-base.Sinead continued: “Baby items were classed as essential goods which was a huge relief to us. This meant as long as we could socially distance within the warehouse we could continue trading and selling online.“All of our business is supplying other retailers like John Lewis, Mamas and Papas, Amazon. But our online sales actually grew because everyone was at home and maybe an element of panic buying.”Shnuggle took advantage of the furlough and Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Schemeschemes.Sinead said: “We furloughed five out of our  team, and were able to access the Business Interruption loan through Ulster Bank.“That was our biggest headache and stress, we owed signicant amounts of money to them and we didn’t have the cash as we needed time to sell our products.”Shnuggle also received a £, Small Business Grant.Adam said: “Furloughing was brilliant, and the CBILS was the one that was the best for us because it meant that we could keep all our suppliers happy.“So even though we had a temporary dip in our sales, and obviously the inventory was sitting there ready to sell, it just kept us solvent and the cash flow moving.” vw, px\"  Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"owners asked to let coastguard know if boats are left unattended ","story":"Boat owners are being reminded to please inform the coastguardthey will be leaving vessels unattended for any period of time.The Aith leboat was called out on Sunday evening after reports of a small boat lying empty near an uninhabited isle to the west of Scalloway.While no missing people had been reported in the area, the volunteer crew of the Charles Lidbury were asked by local coastguard officers to make their way to the scene and investigate.The call out came at .pm and the leboat team steamed south to where the skf had been moored – near the skerry of Sanda Stour at the entrance to Weisdale Voe.On arrival the small boat was recognised by a crew member – who then made contact with the boat#s owner to confirm that they were safe and well.

While NIE Networks staff will still not be entering customers’ homes to obtain a meter read at this time, they will call at customers’ doors and ask them to read their meter while they wait. Meter readers will be able to take readings from meters located in outside positions as normal.NIE Networks is urging customers to protect its meter readers and themselves by continuing to observe social distancing protocols. Ben Cupples, Meter Reading Manager at NIE Networks, explained the importance of recording a precise meter reading for the customer.“Providing a precise meter reading will ensure that your electricity bills accurately reflect your consumption,” he said. “Our meter readers will call to your home and will record the reading you provide while we wait.“If you are unable to read your meter for any reason oryou are not at home when we call, we will leave a card with information on how to submit your meter reading online via the NIE Networks website, via email or over the phone.”Mr Cupples explained that while meter reading activity would resume it would only be carried out with the health and safety of the public and meter readers in mind.“The safety of our employees and customers is our utmost priority. “If you see our meter readers out and about, we would ask that you please help them by standing at least two metres away. Likewise, we will stand at least two metres from customers’ doors at all times.“We are continually reviewing how we undertake our meter reading activities in light of COVID- and we are looking forward to being able to resume our normal way of working with customers at some stage, but we will only make that decision when it’s safe to do so.” NIE Networks is reminding customers that you only need to submit your reading to either NIE Networks or your supplier – there is no need to do it twice. Customers unable to submit a meter reading will receive an estimated bill from their supplier based on their usage history.If a member of the NIE Networks team arrives at the door, they will always show identication. If a customer is concerned about the identity of a caller to their home they can call the PSNI ‘Quick Check’ service on .

Victor Leonard, chairman of the international youth football competition at which Rashford was twice a winner with Manchester United, has always been impressed with the manner in which the young England international striker has handled himself. As Rashford vowed to continue helping those in need after successfully forcing the government to reverse its decision not to provide free school meal vouchers during the summer, Mr. Leonard described the footballer as an inspiration to everyone. He added: “We first came across Marcus in the Manchester United squads that came across to Northern Ireland to compete in our tournaments. “He was a smash hit as United went on to win the Premier section in  and  but you could not help but admire the way, even at a young age, Marcus conducted himself. “We have been across to United many times and it was always very clear how highly regarded he was as a player and a person.” Rashford came off the bench in United’s  final victory over County Tyrone at Ballymena Showgrounds and started when the Red Devils triumphed  months later against defending champions Vendee from France. Victor added: “I think he is an inspiration to everyone. He has been so passionate about this issue but gone about attempting to bring change in a highly commendable manner. “He is a credit to his family and his club and we at STATSports SuperCupNI are privileged that he is one of our tournament graduates who has gone on to achieve greatness in his football career and also through his campaigning for something in which he believes so fervently. “Hopefully he will continue to be an inspiration to all of us.” Rashford has raised about poundm to supply around three million meals to vulnerable people while working with charity FareShare UK during the coronavirus lockdown. In an emotional open letter to MPs, Rashford drew on his own experience of relying on free school meals and food banks growing up. He said his story was all too familiar for families in England.

The February Dail election saw signicant gains for the Green Party throughout Ireland as people voted for transformative change - a fairer society and a serious effort to tackle climate breakdown. Intensive negotiations aimed at forming a coalition government involving multiple parties followed. A draft programme for government is now on the table and it was negotiated in good faith by a very committed group of TDs.However, I am voting no on this offer of government. I believe that a better deal is possible, one which can deliver a just transition to a fairer society and a low carbon economy. Across these islands we face the huge task of recovering from the Covid- crisis. The frailties of our economic system, built on fossil-fuelled over consumption, have been laid bare. The challenge is to build back better and deal with climate crisis and Covid- concurrently. Emerging data shows that the poorest in our society have borne the brunt of Covid- and we know that climate breakdown is an emergency for all, especially those facing economic hardship. That#s why governments across these islands must prioritise our most vulnerable and lay the foundations for just and sustainable societies. Unfortunately, the draft programme for government fails to do that and reverts back to fiscal conservatism. It imposes regressive taxation through carbon and sugar taxes while maintaining the status quo on corporation tax and the top rate of income tax. Transformative change was called for by the Irish electorate this year and there is growing recognition of the need to build back better. Along with a signicant number of Green Party members and elected representatives from across this island, I believe that a better deal is possible. It#s time for the parties that promised positive change earlier this year to step up and deliver.

Transmission of Covid- within the community was now very low, she explained.This arrangement provides a balance between enabling much-needed social contact, enhancing support networks and allowing informal childcare arrangements to resume, she said.This is a crucial development in alleviating some of the childcare pressures being felt by parents at present.Mrs Foster praised the people of Northern Ireland for adhering to the restrictions, saying she was proud, but also cautioned that the virus has not yet gone away, and warned against complacency.Covid- still has the capacity to wreak havoc again as unfortunately we#re seeing in Beijing in recent days where they have discovered a dramatic rise in infections at hotspots and also in Germany and as we look at north Wales as well to see the clusters that have developed there, she said.Complacency is a luxury that we cannot afford.She added: We#ve had to deal with a novel coronavirus whose behaviours are still not fully understood, and whose symptoms can y among those who are unlucky enough to contact it. Some people have been fortunate to have little or no symptoms.

I grew alpines, achillea, helichrysum and physalis.I was also into exotic dried flowers and went to a local florist shop every week to buy blooms, like proteas.When he was , Will started working in Jim Bell#s florist on Broughshane Street in the Co Antrim town every Saturday, wiring and mossing wreaths and spending all the money he earned on seeds.From there, Will developed a keen interest in art and photography and at the age of  moved to London to study for a BAdegree in Fine Art at Central St Martins.Two years later Will was working in department stores Selfridges and Harvey Nichols for internationally acclaimed florist Jane Packer, who had provided the flowers for Sarah Ferguson#s wedding to Prince Andrew in July .The royal connections don#t stop there as Will later moved to Moyses Stevens in Cha#s Sloane Square, which held the Royal Warrant for the late Queen Mother and currently for the Prince of Wales.Among those who regularly graced the store were the future Duchess of Cambridge and Princess Beatrice.Because we were based at the back door of Peter Jones department store we would have had a lot of celebrity clients like Courtney Love, Brian May, Claudia Schfer and Lulu.Kate Middleton used to come in to buy hyacinths and I always found her to be very polite, Will recalls.The last occasion she came in was in  just before her engagement to William was announced and there were about  paparazzi outside waiting for her.Beatrice also came in to buy peonies and was very nice and friendly.We would have provided flowers for Prince Charles, usually wreaths from him for memorial services.A letter would arrive to us on a motorbike from Clarence House and then we would send the flowers out.After five years at Moyses Stevens, Will moved to McQueens and was initially based in the headquarters at Clerkenwell, prior to moving to manage the team of florists based at Claridge#s Hotel.We would have got requests for bouquets in a particular colour or specic type of flowers from VIP guests so I#d have to contact one of our suppliers to source them, Will said.It could be very stressful at times and involve long hours - especiallyyou were told that someone like Madonna was coming the next day and needed a certain type of lily in one of the suites or penthouses that would then have to be found.One of the highlights was having to build a tree with red roses hanging on it inside the hotel#s French Salon for a wedding, while Christmas was always a big undertaking.After  years in London, Will ed to Ballymena two years ago to support his father John who had been battling bowel cancer.Now at the age of  he#s left the hustle and bustle of big city le behind and is back on Broughshane Street where he recently opened his new business, Le Jardin Sauvage .This building had been lying empty for five years and after passing it one day I thought it would make for a marvellous greenhouse as it#s all glass, Will said.Will was all set to open just before the Covid- lockdown and had great plans to provide flowers for the upcoming wedding season until many marriage ceremonies were postponed.He adds: Instead I turned my attention to tropical house plants which has paid off as a lot of people seem to want good quality orchids and unusual hanging plants which are all fashionable again.The focus now is all about more green and plants that were popular back in the s like ivy and air and spider plants.I spent the lockdown getting the place all cleaned up and filled with plants with my two parrots, Onslow and Sammy, for company.While it has been a challenge opening at this particular time, I#m very optimistic as I have a great passion for what I do and I#m bringing a bit of London back to where it all began.

But, for now, all that has stopped.Fans of the local game have been left scratching their heads wondering what to do with their Saturday afternoons since the game came to a halt in March due to Covid-, never mind trying to wrap their minds around the proposals to bring back the action. Whether the club you love often basks in the glory of lting the Gibson or Irish Cups, or you trod home thinking what might have been, the Irish League is like no other in terms of the friendships forged on those Saturday afternoons.Certainly, some of the best memories this reporter has made in his  years is sharing Glenavon#s Irish Cup wins in ,  and  with his family. Who knowsthe Irish Cup will finish at all this season, but fans will not be able to share that special cup-winning feeling with the players, their friends and their families.Four Irish League fans who miss their weekend football fix spoke to the Belfast , looking back at those Saturday afternoons that feel so long ago and discussed what they are doing now to try and fill that void.Cltonville supporter Brian Smyth , Glentoran man David Kerr , Newry City fanatic Laura Hillenand Lurgan Blues fan Michael Scottwere all in agreement - it is not just the football, but the social aspect of our local game that has been missed over the last three months.Brian, a Green Party councillor in Belfast, described following his beloved Reds as an outlet and misses the unique quirks of the Irish League.If you#re invested in it, it#s family, he said. Your family is a bit of a melt sometimes, but that#s what the Irish League is, it#s your family.You miss it. You miss the characters and there is a social aspect to the Irish League. We don#t go there for sexy football. Sexy football comes along once in a generation for most teams, like Cltonville from  to  with Liam Boyce and Joe Gormley.You go along because it#s an extension of your family and you#re invested in it and you love it.I#ve been keeping myself busy with my council stuff, but I miss football. I#m a Manchester United man as well and a mate of mine said that the matches are back, but football isn#t, as the fans aren#t there.Michael was forced to watch old football fixtures on TV and YouTube at the beginning of lockdown.Like all those dedicated to following their team home and away every Saturday afternoon Michael, who is the editor of the Ulster Gazette in Armagh, has been totally knocked out of his weekend routine. I found that really, really hard. I missed that routine of getting up on a Saturday, going to the match, seeing my mates, have the craic, maybe stay on for a wee while afterwards and then come home, he said.I#ve been going out for a walk on Saturday afternoons, and like everybody  I ended up painting the fence. There was wee jobs in the house you end up doing.I miss meeting up with my mates. Saturday would be the day I would see a lot of people that I hang about with.You do miss that and obviously going to match might lead to staying on and getting a couple of pints or going round to a mate#s house for a pizza or a bite to eat. My routine on a Saturday now is basically get up and sit in a dferent room to the one I work in.Meanwhile, David#s Saturday afternoons at The Oval consisted of working with Glentoran#s media team, but all that has changed since Covid- struck.Focusing on nostalgic periods in the Glens# history during lockdown, David has been trying to bring a bit of Irish League football back into people#s lives through the club#s social media channels.You don#t have that usual routine of getting up, seeing what your mates and family are doing and heading to the ground, he explained.It#s the wee things you miss. I drive down and see that green mecca of mine that#s The Oval, so you miss that. You miss the smells, the taste of the burger and maybe getting a drink after the game.I think whether you#re a fan of Warrenpoint, Institute, Linfield, Glenavon, Cltonville or whoever, you all still have that same social side and I think that#s a massive part that everybody is missing and can#t wait to get back to.My job is trying to bring people closer to the club and Irish League football, so I guess I miss going out and speaking to people to create content.David added that no matter what your day job is, everyone who attends the game is the same when the referee blows the whistle at pm.Newry City#s Press officer Laura has even started supporting Hertha Berlin with their blue and white striped kit after the Bundesliga was the first major league toto screens.Her weekly routine consisted of attending committee meetings on Mondays, watching the players train on Tuesday, the under- games on Friday and seeing the first team play in the Championship on a Saturday.Going from that to nothing at all has been particularly tough.I would go to the matches with my sister and my daddy, she said. We all support Newry, so you#re getting to spend time with your family as well. My mummy is sick of the sight of us.Supporting local football is a great way to be part of the community and make friends.A large amount of our support would be the older generation and aren#t into social media, so without face-to-face contact they have no link to the club, so I#m sure as hard as it is for me, it#s harder for them.During this break we have launched a #KeepYourHeadUp campaign, getting videos from people from all over the sporting community - even a referee - to promote positive mental health and to keep your head up until we are back together again. Hopefully that#s sooner rather than later.Irish League football can generate a lot of negativity, mainly from those who don#t watch the local game, be it through the perceived quality of football or attendances, but Brian feels that is what makes our league.You even miss the games where there#s just  fans or less, he added. You can hear everything and the stuff coming out of people, which can be slightly outrageous, but it#s in your head for the rest of the week and it gets you through.I#m missing the routine, I#m missing the familiarity and I#m missing the social aspect. I think my we would prefer me going to watch a match.It is now up to the powers that be to get the ball rolling again, whenever that may be...

Carried high by his brothers, Detective Garda Colm Horkan made his final journey through the streets of his home town to the church where he was baptised over  years ago. Described as one of nature#s gentlemen, the horror of his violent, inexplicable, senseless death has left his family, colleagues, friends and community crushed with shock. Read More Murdered Garda Colm Horkan laid to rest after funeral in native MayoFrom am unormed gardai began to line the km route from Colm#s home on Ballyhaunis Road in Charlestown, Co Mayo, to St James# Church. By .am a crowd of hundreds had swelled to thousands. His colleagues stood tall in silence. They waited, and nobody spoke, nobody moved. At .am the funeral cortege turned from the square toward the church, the only sound was the slow exact footsteps of the regional ceremonial unit, walking either side of the hearse. One hundred yards from the gates of the church Colm#s remains passed from the shoulders of his brothers Aiden, Brendan, Dermot and Padraig to six members of his Garda family. Colleagues from Castlerea, among them those who prayed over his body in the moments after his brutal death, lined each side of the churchyard. As his coffin entered the doors of the church Ave Maria echoed around the church grounds and up and down the streets.Read More Colm Horkan: Country observes minute#s silence to honour police officer killed in line of dutySupt Goretti Sheridan, Colm#s superintendent in Castlerea, broke the suffocating silence. Stepping slowly to the altar, she announced a nationwide minute#s silence to remember Colm and his sacrice. Welcoming everyone, chief celebrant of the Mass and Charlestown parish priest, Monsignor Tommy Johnston, described Colm as someone who was deeply loved. He added simply Colm Horkan was a man of goodness. In his homily Monsignor Johnston described the collective shock of Colm#s death and explained how he came to hear about the tragedy. The gunshots that rang out in the early hours of Thursday morning echoed not just in the town of Castlerea but right across the country, spreading a story of tragedy and sadness and the loss of le of a Detective Garda, he said.Commissioner Drew Harris said he felt immense sadness but also a great privilege to be asked to speak in tribute to Colm. Detective Garda Colm Horkan epitomised what all of us as members of An Garda Siochana should strive to be, he said.He was approachable, well-known and respected in his local community and also in Castlerea. His policing service was characterised by his hard work and his diligence.As the Mass drew to a close Colm#s brother Brendan paid an emotional tribute to his brother. He had all the values you would associate with a good and decent human being. He was kind, considerate, selfless and, above all, loyal to the core, he said.Colm commanded respect wherever he went, time spent in his company was precious, and there was always a laugh and a joke to be had with that disarming, beaming smile of his lightening up a room and brightening up many a dark hour and day. He loved le and lived in the best way he knew how.Belfast Most ReadBobby Storey: Hated by the RUC, Sinn Fein figure was the hardest of IRA hardmenMankilled and six young people injured in Killyleagh crashUVF gang in -hour terror rampageLoyalist hits out at East Belfast mob #torturing the Protestant people#Father#s Day: NI personalities on what makes their dads so special ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Publicans in Derry who took a ‘massive’ financial hit by closing ahead of St Patrick’s Day in the interest of public safety have encouraged the public to ‘support their local’ once they reopen. Northern Irelands hotels, bars, restaurants and cafes can reopen from July . William McGuinness and his business partner Phil Nolan own Paedar O’Donnells, The Gweedore and Fty Seven nightclub on Waterloo Street. Before the government issued any formal directive for businesses to shut, Paedar’s led the way by announcing that it was closing its doors on March . googletag.cmd.push It came two days before the busiest date on the calendar for Irish bars, St Patrick’s Day. “It was a matter of conscience for us,” Mr McGuinness said, “the general feeling at the time was that the NHS was going to be under pressure and we thought St Patrick’s Day would have been a petri dish for infection and we didn’t want to be responsible for that.” Boris Johnson’s order for all non-essential businesses would come over a week later on March . Derry City and Strabane has the second lowest COVID- death rate of every council area in the country and just  positive Coronavirus cases to date – also the second lowest in the country. googletag.cmd.push Chair of the British Medical Association in NI, Derry doctor Tom Black, has credited the part played by local businesses who took their cues from the Republic of Ireland. Mr McGuinness said they’re happy they made that decision even though the business took a ‘massive hit’ because of it. “St Patrick’s Day is our busiest day of the year and we were thinking about retirement soon but this thing has thrown it all up in the air. “We knew that, but we were just concerned about the health of Derry people.” Paedar’s missed out on grants because it didn’t meet the criteria but employees were furloughed. The rebuild will be a slow process, Mr McGuinness said, as the pandemic took its toll. DIFFICULT From July  pubs and bars will be allowed to trade but must serve food and operate on a table service basis. Pubs that do not serve food will be allowed to sell alcohol outdoors, such as beer gardens, also restricted to table service. Mr McGuinness said that will make it ‘very dficult’ for small bars like Paedar’s with limited outdoor space. Permission to use that space is absolutely essential in his view. He added: “I would object to the fact that restaurant bars are allowed to open but bars aren’t allowed to serve inside. “I think the risk is higher in a restaurant bar with adults and children being served food and drink whereas we’re just serving alcohol to adults. “With food there are all sorts of utensils but we just have glasses and disposable plastic. “I don’t see the sense in holding us up because we don’t do food.” The ‘rush’ is now on to ready the bar for customers and bar owners like Mr McGuinness are looking to the government and local authorities for guidance. Paedar O’Donnell’s has been cleared of tables and chairs to allow for the walls to be freshly painted and floors nished ahead of the grand reopening.  Mr McGuinness hopes that the government advice is relaxed to allow bars to serve indoors. They’re awaiting further guidance before spending any money on Perspex screens or other safety measures. He concluded: “We’d encourage people to come back but it’s going to be very limited space. “We don’t have the tourists, we were a very busy bar at weekends, and we’re not going to get those numbers in – nowhere is – because Derry people like to go out on a Friday and Saturday and nowhere will be able to cater for them because of social distancing. “There’s no money to be made in the next few months that’s the reality. “But hopefully over timeit is under control and there’s no resurgence maybe we can get back to some normality.” INFORMATION The owner of numerous bar-restaurants in the city including the Bentley, The Magnet and Molly Malones, Tony O’Connor, is also seeking clarity. “I’m surmising that they’re working on it at Stormont but we need more information about social distancing and so on,” he said. With all of his restaurants serving food he’s assured by the fact that customers can sit indoors but is unsure as to whether dining customers can stay longer to socialise. Mr O Connor said: “Every one of our premises will be opening on July  because of the food situation. Out of our six bars, five of them have outdoor areas.” This week he held a meeting with management and they’re ‘all positive and raring to go’. Like many businesses, the pandemic has been a ‘nightmare’ for Mr O’Connor but he realises that everybody is on the same boat. The Irish government ‘deserves a massive pat on the back’ for closing bars before St Patrick’s Day, he said, because ‘you would have had thousands and thousands across Ireland’ spreading the virus. “A lot of bars lost out on revenue there, no money was coming in and none getting paid out, so you just start over again,” he added. AMAZING  Bars have been actively discouraged from staging live music events or screening football matches to minimise the urge for customers to ‘dance’ or ‘hug each other’ after a goal is scored. It’s Mr O’Connor’s aspiration that the bar will be allowed to have a singer-songwriter, two-piece band performing or DJ providing entertainment. The local businessman said they will have hand sanitisers at each entrance, on every floor, at every table and also behind the bars and in kitchen areas for staff. “I’d rather not open as to have big screens in front of the bar because I think it takes the atmosphere away. “We have enough space so we can take tables away to create distance,” he stated. They’re also considering an App on which people can order food and drinks but are awaiting further guidance. And extra staff will be on hand to carry out an increased cleaning schedule. Looking to the future, Mr O’Connor would like to see visitors to the city from other parts of the island. He said: “I think Derry will get a good turnout because we handled the pandemic well as a city, there was a low number of Coronavirus cases. “I can’t wait to get my teeth back into it, we’ve been doing nothing the past few months, and the not knowing is the worst thing. “We’ve been doing takeaways but getting fully open is going to be amazing. “We’d invite people to get back out and support your local. “Self-awareness is key, Derry has played a blinder, it should be recognised and people here don’t have to be told to social distance, they’re fully aware.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Patrick McGonagle, , whose address was given as Old School Lane in Shantallow appeared in court on June  charged with breaching his bail conditions on June  by ‘intentionally exposing his genitals’. The defendant had been released on bail on June  after being charged with common assault, namely throwing bread at a woman and attempting to grab her, and disorderly behaviour in a public place. A police officer said that on June  the PSNI became aware of a video circulating online showing a man acting in an ‘indecent manner’. googletag.cmd.push It was brought to the attention of police by community representatives and family members of children who witnessed it. McGonagle was identied in multiple reports. The officer said the incident took place at Old School Lane where the -year-old was seen ‘defecating in view of children’. A -year-old recorded the incident. The officer added: “He used chip shop wrappers to wipe himself. He was extremely intoxicated.” Police located the defendant at Old School Lane and he charged straight away. Objecting to bail, the officer said on June  McGonagle was warned about his behaviour and not to be intoxicated in a public place. googletag.cmd.push The court heard the -year-old has  previous convictions and two suspended sentences. There is an ‘extremely high risk of reoffending’, the officer added, ‘this man is incapable of not being intoxicated in a public place.’ Defence barrister Stephen Mooney said his client pleaded guilty to the offences before the court on Monday at the first opportunity and it was adjourned for a pre-sentence report. McGonagle was not in a position to be interviewed by the police due to his level of intoxication. Mr Mooney told the court that back in   the -year-old spent a ‘very signicant’ period of time in custody on remand. He was then found ‘unfit for trial’ because of his mental capacity and the prosecution was discontinued. The defence barrister said it is not so much a ‘fool’s pardon but a street drinker’s pardon’ as he is a well-known street drinker. His alcoholism is being criminalised because of his inability to stay sober, he added. Mr Mooney asked for bail to be granted with strict conditions attached. District Judge Peter King said ‘you’re absolutely correct’ and any bail conditions would have to include a prohibition on alcohol which would set him up for ‘spectacular failure’. He added that McGonagle may upset the ‘wrong person or group of people and find himself facing more dficulties’. The defendant was remanded in custody due to a ‘clear risk of reoffending’ to appear by way of video link on July .

From  July, people who are shielding will be able to meet up to sixpeople outside the home, as long as social distancing is strictly observed. In addition, people who are shielding and living alone will be able to form a support bubble from July  with one other household. These easements are based on the continuing reduction in the rate of community transmission of the virus in Northern Ireland. Further details will be provided in writing to people who are shielding. This letter will also set out plans to put shielding on hold from  July. googletag.cmd.push Minister Swann said:“I have no doubt that shielding has played a key role in saving many lives. It has undoubtedly been extremely dficult for those who are shielding. I have listened with great sympathy to what people have told us about feeling isolated and how they have missed their loved ones. “I know these easements that take effect on  July will be welcome news to many as we move towards the pause in shielding from the end of July. “However, I am also very conscious that there will be some who are apprehensive about this change. I would therefore, once again, repeat my call to everyone to continue to observe social distancing and to be considerate of the fact that the people you meet may have been shielding for many weeks.” googletag.cmd.push The Minister added that people who are shielding must strictly follow public health advice on social distancing and hand washing. “While the risk of being infected has reduced, the virus still constitutes a serious threat to those who are shielding should they get it. “It is important to remember that because of your underlying condition, Covid- will remain a threat to you. At the same time, it is accepted that shielding has been really challenging and that being stuck indoors indefinitely is bad for mental and physical health. What we all have to do in these dficult times is try to strike the right balance. “This is about minimising any risk as much as possible, being aware that all contacts with the outside world must be managed really carefully. “Keep your distance, wash your hands, don’t touch your face, avoid touching hard surfacesyou are out. Wherever possible, avoid enclosed spaces where social distancing is hard to maintain – such as public transport and shops.” The easements in shielding guidance from  July were agreed at today’s Executive meeting. This includes meeting up to six people outside the home providing social distancing is strictly observed. People who are shielding alone can form a support bubble with one other household. Social distancing is not required with this other household. This will allow people to visit, stay over and spend more time with the second household. The second household can be of any size. Both households should not be part of more than one bubble and should continue to socially distance outside the bubble.

This is dferent. Last weeks edition of this column made two proposals for a new-look Derry senior football championship. Both were based around the inclusion of isional teams and in part two, we put some flesh on the bones. The thought process is the poorof players from the intermediate and junior grades coming through to the Derry senior football team in the last decade. Of  players used in league and championship, by five dferent managers, none hail from junior clubs and  from intermediate, one less than Ballinderrys club total. googletag.cmd.push Also, the decade saw Coleraine, Slaughtneil and Ballinderry dominate the competition. Its great for the clubs in question, but in a bid to help raise the quality overall. A county team needs more options. In Sideline Views proposal,  senior clubs have been selected on the basis of the last five years of the senior championship. The  teams who reached at least one semi-final were joined by Swatraghand Dungivenas the highest placed teams in the  league standings. The other three teams are isional teams picked from the rest of the clubs. Foyle Oaks , North Derry and South Derry. googletag.cmd.push Logistically it will be dficult to fit in around hurling. So in a case where Tiarnaacuten McHugh is trying to balance North Derry, Drumsurn and Kevin Lynchs, it will be far from ideal. A balance will be needed and proper dialogue between all three managers, with the players training regime at the heart of it. The senior championship will need to be played off over dferent weekends to intermediate and junior. This would be a stumbling block as it stands, with so much tied up in the leagues. Under this new concept, leagues would be totally dferent from championship. Leagues of  with a two up two down relegation, would be devised with one thing in mind – getting as many games as possible. The CCC would allocate rounds on the weekends the NFL is on. Club games are on Friday or Saturday night, with the county taking place on Sunday. The county manager names his starting  and anyone outside of that, who didnt see any meaningful game time in previous round, is eligible for club football. It would need checked with the county physio, buta player is going to be of any benefit, they need competition in the legs. The advantage is having more games on a more regular basis, with more room to balance the club championship commitments. It would help avoid loggerheads at a time of year when it really matters, it would help get rid of the alarming drop-off rate from players being caught between two stools. A situation where nobody wins and in the case of Derry, it leaves a situation that stles any continuity. ON THE DRAW Last week, Liam Tunneyrandomly picked  numbers and the draw was populated as you see below. It has some mouthwatering ties. North Derrys clash with a Dungiven side clambering their way back to their decline is the tie of the round, with the late Sunday night billing at Owenbeg. The appointment of former Dungiven manager Michael OKane and Darren McShane as managers of North Derry will add a bit of spice along the sideline. South Derrys debut in the championship see them up against a ravenous Slaughtneil, who have aim to win back the John McLaughlin Cup after a two year absence and have the astute Paul Bradley at the helm. In the opposition dugout is Ronan Rocks who will know the intermediate scene well and has an handle on the up and coming minor talent from his time with Derry Us. He is joined in the South Derry management team by Hugh Mulholland, who never misses a club championship game and will know Slaughtneil inside out. Foyle Oaks, under the management of Michael McLaughlin and Joe Gray, come up against Loup, with Paddy Bradley in his first season in charge. Lavey and Coleraine renew their  final rivalries. The #SidelineView Derry SFC ROUND  Thursday.South Derry v Slaughtneil  Friday.Ballinascreen v Bellaghy  Saturday . - Glen v Greenlough . - Loup v Foyle Oaks  Sunday . – Swatragh v Ballinderry . – Coleraine v Lavey  Sunday . - Magherafelt v Banagher . - Dungiven v North Derry  There is a glance at what the isional teams could look like. FOYLE OAKS: Kieran Reilly, Eoghan Concannon, Kevin Lindsay, Tomaacutes McCrossan, Neil Forester, Michael Sweeney, Jordan Curran, Michael McLaughlin, Caolan Doyle, Oran Armstrong, Marty Donaghy, Paddy OKane, Odhraacuten McKane, Ben McCarron, Conor McGee.SUBS: Daryl Moore, Fionain Smyth, Conor Johnston, Shane McGahon, Gavin McShane, Aaron Kerrigan, Colin Murray, Conor McGee, Paul Quigley. NORTH DERRY: Oran Hartin, Eoin Ferris, Oisin Duffy, Tiarnaacuten Woods, Niall Ferris, John OKane, Gerard OKane, Neil McNicholl, Mark McCormick, Eoghan Duffy, Eoin Bradley, Niall McGowan, Fergal Mortimer, Gary Keane, Richard King.SUBS: Pearse McNicholl, Dara Rafferty, Damien Brolly, Cahir Mullan, Daryl Mullan, Martin McGonigle, Collie Mullan, Kevin OConnor, Jude McLaughlin.

At the end of the season, two from the first teams eliminated will meet in a play-off to stay in the senior championship. From the last five years, form will be assessed for wins, draws and defeats, as well as scoring totals to pick the two lowest performing teams, who will play in a relegation play-off. The loser will drop to intermediate, with the intermediate winners promoted to the senior grade.

Of  players used in league and championship, by five dferent managers, none hail from junior clubs and  from intermediate, one less than Ballinderrys club total. googletag.cmd.push Also, the decade saw Coleraine, Slaughtneil and Ballinderry dominate the competition. Its great for the clubs in question, but in a bid to help raise the quality overall. A county team needs more options. In Sideline Views proposal,  senior clubs have been selected on the basis of the last five years of the senior championship. The  teams who reached at least one semi-final were joined by Swatraghand Dungivenas the highest placed teams in the  league standings. The other three teams are isional teams picked from the rest of the clubs. Foyle Oaks , North Derry and South Derry. googletag.cmd.push Logistically it will be dficult to fit in around hurling. So in a case where Tiarnaacuten McHugh is trying to balance North Derry, Drumsurn and Kevin Lynchs, it will be far from ideal. A balance will be needed and proper dialogue between all three managers, with the players training regime at the heart of it. The senior championship will need to be played off over dferent weekends to intermediate and junior. This would be a stumbling block as it stands, with so much tied up in the leagues. Under this new concept, leagues would be totally dferent from championship. Leagues of  with a two up two down relegation, would be devised with one thing in mind – getting as many games as possible. The CCC would allocate rounds on the weekends the NFL is on. Club games are on Friday or Saturday night, with the county taking place on Sunday. The county manager names his starting  and anyone outside of that, who didnt see any meaningful game time in previous round, is eligible for club football. It would need checked with the county physio, buta player is going to be of any benefit, they need competition in the legs. The advantage is having more games on a more regular basis, with more room to balance the club championship commitments. It would help avoid loggerheads at a time of year when it really matters, it would help get rid of the alarming drop-off rate from players being caught between two stools. A situation where nobody wins and in the case of Derry, it leaves a situation that stles any continuity. ON THE DRAW Last week, Liam Tunneyrandomly picked  numbers and the draw was populated as you see below. It has some mouthwatering ties. North Derrys clash with a Dungiven side clambering their way back to their decline is the tie of the round, with the late Sunday night billing at Owenbeg. The appointment of former Dungiven manager Michael OKane and Darren McShane as managers of North Derry will add a bit of spice along the sideline. South Derrys debut in the championship see them up against a ravenous Slaughtneil, who have aim to win back the John McLaughlin Cup after a two year absence and have the astute Paul Bradley at the helm. In the opposition dugout is Ronan Rocks who will know the intermediate scene well and has an handle on the up and coming minor talent from his time with Derry Us. He is joined in the South Derry management team by Hugh Mulholland, who never misses a club championship game and will know Slaughtneil inside out. Foyle Oaks, under the management of Michael McLaughlin and Joe Gray, come up against Loup, with Paddy Bradley in his first season in charge. Lavey and Coleraine renew their  final rivalries.

At the end of the season, two from the first teams eliminated will meet in a play-off to stay in the senior championship. From the last five years, form will be assessed for wins, draws and defeats, as well as scoring totals to pick the two lowest performing teams, who will play in a relegation play-off. The loser will drop to intermediate, with the intermediate winners promoted to the senior grade.

With handsanitiserat the door to every store, one-way systems, contactlesspayment, and limits on customernumbers, the new normal might take a while to get used to. Around half the shops in Foyleside Shopping Centre were open on Tuesday morning, with Dunnes Stores attracting the biggest crowds. Staff in Marks and Spencers and Boots, which have remained open throughout the pandemic, were glad to see a bit more hustle and bustle in the centre And with sales on in Debenhams, Dunnes and Marks and Spencer, many shoppers remarked on how happy they were to be out spendingagain. googletag.cmd.push But while the shops are open, cafes and coffee shops in the shopping centres remain closed for now. Mary McLaughlin, who hasnt been shopping in the city centrein over three months, said shewas glad to be back. This is my first day back up the town and Im all hyper with it, she said. I havent been up thetown since way beforeSt Patricks Day Its been awful not being able toget up the town, butas long as we are all healthy thats the main thing. Its just great to get out again. Ive been looking forward to it. Self-confessed shopaholic Geraldine Deery has been yearning for the social side of shopping. googletag.cmd.push Im ashopaholic and its been drivingme crazy, she said. I missed going up the town and meeting people and having a chat. And I really miss going in for a cup of coffee with my sister. Ive gone abit crazy buying things, Im making up for losttime of the weeks I missed. The management at Foyleside, The Richmond Centre and Debenhams have clearly put a lot of timeand effortinto establishingand marking out one-way systems and there are plenty of signs in place reminding people to keep to the two metre social distance rule. You do be a bit nervous because youre looking at the floor, trying to make sure you are going the right way, said Mrs McLaughlin. Everything is well spaced out and the floors are all marked out. Although Im glad I came out early because its quiet at the minute. Derrys small independent retailers are also slowly getting back to business after getting the go ahead this week, David Thomas, whose jewellery shop and workshop Thomas Goldsmith has operated from Pump Street for over  years, has been surprised that some of his fellow small traders havent reopned yet.  Ive just been for a walk round and Ive noticed that a large number of small independents arent openat the minute. This is the second dayinto it and they are taking their time to get back to work. Maybe thats their own choice. It surprisedme because to rebuild businessagain is important. For a lot of them who have furloughed staff and who are self employed as it were and are receiving payments they are thinking I wont risk it because theres a safety net there. But obviously that safety net is going to start disappearing. Business has been quite slow this week, but MrThomas is hopeful that shoppers will be back. We arecompleting the work we werent able to complete in March after the guillotine came down and we werent able to finish. And then we were hit by problems in the supply chain but that has started to ease up. In the last two weeks it has relaxed and things are filtering thoughnow. Were now able to complete things we should have done in March so weve stillgot that momentum from then, but in terms of work coming through its going to be a bit slow. There are a lot of people are being made redundant or who havent been able to claim grants and things like that. But on the other hand there are people who were furloughed and had to stay at home and werent able to spend money and they should have a fairly healthy bank account and they are desperate to get out and buy stuff. Mr Thomas has made changes to the way the shop operates in order to comply with the new regulations. Only one customer is admitted at a time, staff are usingfacemasks and hand sanitiser, and jewellery that has been tried on is being cleaned before it goes back on th shelf. People are understanding and respectful, remarked Mr Thomas. He feels that lockdown has given people time to reflect on their work le balance and lestyle. People are saying it will never be the same, he said. We were all chasing our tails a bit, workingvery hard. Does it have to be like that  Can we take things a bit easier  Do we have to be rushing off to Portugal on cheap flights  It has been strangeto sit at home in the garden and look up and see the skies totally clear. Many of Derrys charity shops have also reopened their doors, with Oxfam, Kinship Care, the Red Cross and Cancer Focus back in businessearlier this week. However, the three month closure has meant some stores are struggling with low stock levels. Deborah Tracey is the manager at Cancer Focus on Shipquay Street, which opened in May .  The shop reopened last Friday after a week of cleaning and preparation and have been busy ever since. Inside there is hand sanitiser at thedoor and a one-waysystem in place. Most people have been using the hand sanitiser before they come in, said Ms Tracey. We have been busy with people bringing stuff in and buying stuff too. People seem to feel confident coming out to shop now and theyare glad toget back to a bit of normality. Cancer Focus has amanager and deputy manager but all the other staff are volunteers. Some of our volunteers have been worried about coming back because they are older and more at risk, said MsTracy. So weare lookingfor newvolunteers now. We provide everyonewith shields, masks and gloves for their safety. Cancer Focus has also launched an appeal for donations. Any donations to the shop must be quarantined for  hours when we receive them, said Ms Tracy. We are looking for donations of clothes, bric-a-brac, shoes, bags and books. If you would like to make a donation to Cancer Focus or to enquire about becoming a volunteer telephone .

At present, hospitality businesses have to adhere to strict licensing laws in terms of serving outdoors. However, local councils have been encouraged by the Northern Ireland Executive to take a flexible approach to the situation to support the sector as it emerges from the coronavirus lockdown. Derry City and Strabane District Council is currently looking at ways it can help local businesses. They have launched a short survey asking for peoples opinions on the matter. The survey can be filled in here -https:bit.ly eohTnm googletag.cmd.push A council spokesperson said: The hospitality and retail industries have been some of the hardest hit in terms of lost revenue during COVID-. They will also be one of the last to fully emerge from the lockdown. With the impact of the pandemic and the resulting social distancing measures that must continue when businesses reopen it is essential that we start to reimagine how theservice industries can adapt and operate in the current circumstances.New business models and taking hospitality and trade outdoors will play a signicant part in the survival of the service industry locally. Using private and public spaces such as pavements, car parking spaces and events spaces such as Guildhall Square, Waterloo Place and the Canal Basin in Strabane could be part of the solution. googletag.cmd.push To achieve this, Council and key stakeholders including Department for Infrastructure and the Department for Communities will be adopting a flexible approach that seeks to facilitate innovation - whilst ensuring appropriate controls such as Insurance, disability access, enforcement and public health are in place.

There has been some criticism of theof time it will take to complete the improvements, with no upgrade work planned before the delivery of the project. googletag.cmd.push “Full delivery could take another - years, which does not address present needs,” said Cllr McPeake. “Rural areas such as Mid-Ulster need to have immediate interventions in broadband improvements to remain economically competitive and meet the needs of local homeowners. “Broadband availability has become a service utility which is equally essential as water, electricity or any telecommunications. “In recent months I have been inundated from constituents who cannot access sufficient broadband speeds for home-working, home-schooling or basic socialising. “Small to medium sized businesses are also struggling to achieve adequate speeds to operate their businesses in rural areas.” The Carntogher councillor has asked residents to detail their experiences in order to help with the evidence gathering process. “An integral part of the NIAO reporting evidence gathering process is having anecdotal evidence of the challenges of home working or home schooling during the ongoing public health crisis. “I would encourage anyone who is experiencing dficulties with Broadband provision during the COVID- Pandemic to email their experiences toinfo@icban.

His book has been described in The Independent as ldquoone of the finest pieces of modern nature writing in recent years. In this extract the autistic teenager shares his joy of the natural world on a day out to Murlough with his sister and brother.OUR garden is thrumming with birds today: coal, blue and great tits, blackbird, thrush, magpie, jackdaw, rook, all of them revelling on the grass, pecking at the feeders.I could happily watch them all day but rain is coming from the east, so we decide to go west to the coast at Murlough to stay in the sunshine. I usually despise being in the sun. I find its light too bright, its heat too hot, and it can make me feel astherersquos nowhere to hide. But with this rain coming, I feel like being on the dunes at Murlough, pressed by warmth and sea breezes.The ancient dune system here is six thousand years old, fragile and spectacular. The unusually high dunes were formed in the late th and th centuries by massive storms, and were used by people in the Middle Ages as rabbit warrens to provide them with meat and pelts.Grazing rabbits encouraged the grassy heathland here, but when myxomatosis first broke out in the s, as it did in other parts of Ireland and Britain, the population was almost wiped out. With fewer rabbits, sea buckthorn and sycamore could grow, turning heath to scrubland. Now the National Trust have intervened at Murlough, managing the landscape so it reverts back to heath mdash and judging from the copious pings, it looks like the rabbits are thriving again, too.The day is sparkling, the wind is shaking and shaping the clouds. Lorcan and Blaacutethnaid want to swim, so I stroll along the beach with my binoculars. Shapes out at sea stop me: a trinity of torpedoing gannets. They swoop, wheel and suddenly drop, spiralling until the last second when they transform into arrows before hitting the water.Swallows are overhead ndash I can see their small bodies so clearly, weightless and constantly moving. I feel myself rising with them.My dark, knotted thoughts seem to be staying away at the moment. I feel as free as the gannets and swallows. If they can live their lives, shouldnrsquot I do the same  Can I breathe and live and also fight  The natural world mdash which includes us mdash is facing such enormous challenges that itrsquos easy to become overwhelmed and depressed. But we must fix them, andIrsquom no longer here, alive, I canrsquot be part of the solution.What is it thatrsquos holding me back  Anxiety  Depression  Autism  These are the shackles. Surely, I can break free. Or at least I can accept these things as part of me. I have no answers, but the lightness of these thoughts and these days weave my body and mind with everything around me. The only thing that I am really bound to is nature ndash as we all are.Lorcan and Blaacutethnaid are running towards me, and I run to them, and then we run together, exultant. We slow down in unison, all feeling the same pull of the large peculiar shells dotted around the beach. We each pick one up and hold them outstretched, delicate porcelain in our hands.They look like pale planets, pockmarked with symmetrical lines. I rattle mine, listening to the whisper of sand and the past. These are sea potatoes mdash a type of sand-burrowing sea urchin mdash with pocks that once held spines and a bleached calcium carbonate shell that could so easily shatter on land or at sea. Each one is a miracle. So many miracles washed up at once.We start to collect them and Lorcan decides to name three of the best specimens Sandy, Sam and Sandra. He holds a conversation with them, three sea potatoes, which makes us laugh so hard that tears well up and almost flow, and wersquore still laughing as a warm rain starts to fall on us.Under dark skies, I feel completely unburdened of any doubts in my own abilities to help our planet. Instead, I feel energised and ready. Sopping wet and cold and with chattering teeth, still giggling madly, I feel hope pouring in the rain. Being myself is enough.Diary of a Young Naturalist by Dara McAnulty is published by Little Tollerand can be bought online, or at No Alibis bookshop in Belfast..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"A lifetime of capturing Ireland’s scenic beauty  ","story":"AMATEUR photographer Chris Laverty spent a letime capturing Irelandrsquos scenic beauty.The former Queenrsquos University computer centre manager travelled extensively, always with his camera, and always with an eye for the magic of the countryside around him.

As we work to do so, our absolute priority will be to keep our patients, service users and staff safe. the statement adds.The health trustrsquos insistence that emergency services will be restored at the Downe comes ahead of a meeting with a Sinn Fein delegation to discuss the issue.Spearheaded by South Down MP, Chris Hazzard, the delegation will be seeking assurances that all services will be restored to their previous level.Ahead of the meeting, Mr Hazzard said that due to the pandemic, the local community was left without access to vital services at the Downe due to the health systemrsquos response to coronavirus which ldquorequired what amounted to extraordinary measures for an extraordinary time.The MP said the Downe was left ldquounrecognisable as emergency and outpatient services, amongst others, closed from the end of March.ldquoWhere required, all available staff and equipment from these units was also requisitioned for use in other parts of the South Eastern Trust area, he continued.ldquoIn agreeing to the radical reconfiguration of the Downe, the community made a big sacrice in order to accommodate the unprecedented demands made by both health trusts in the fight against Covid-.Insisting that it was the right thing to do at the right time, Mr Hazzard said there is now an onus on trust management to respond in kind to the community.He said the recently published recovery plans have delayed the restoration of vital services to the community, causing signicant concern amongst many who fear that ldquotemporary closure might inevitably mean permanent removal.Mr Hazzard said the Sinn Fein delegation will be calling for the full restoration of services at the Downe and will also be meeting with the chief executive of the Southern Trust to call for services removed from Newryrsquos Daisy Hill hospital to be reinstated.Rowallane DUP councillors are also demanding the full restoration of services at the Downe Hospital, highlighting the importance of reopening the emergency department as soon as possible.Cllr Billy Walker said it was ironic that within hours of confirmation that the Downpatrick ED would not reopen at this stage, the South Eastern Trust revealed via social media that the Ulster Hospitalrsquos emergency department was extremely busy.ldquoThis is nothing new, he declared. ldquoThere is a clear need for the Downersquos emergency department to reopen now.

However, bearing in mind the scheme is all but shovel ready, this should be a simple case of signing the commencement orders with construction starting as soon as possible.Mr Hazzard said the roads minister has a capital budget of more than poundm to be spent this year, suggesting that very few projects are as advanced as the Ballynahinch bypass.ldquoThere is no logical reason why this long overdue project canrsquot get the green light for construction as a matter of priority, he said.The MP added: ldquoIn light of the severe economic impact of Covid- and the ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the commencement of this scheme would be a welcome step towards improving both our local economy and the wellbeing of our community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Darragh Cross residents bring cheer to local residential home  ","story":"RESIDENTS from Oakland Court in Darragh Cross made the most of the lockdown by having socially distanced nights of entertainment while helping the residents of a nearby residential home.From hosting fun events such as bingo and discos, they raised pound for Willowview Residential Home in Saintfield.Oakland Court residents would like to thank Darragh Crossrsquo Vivo shop for its donation of prize hampers and everyone who donated prizes and gts.In turn, all residents and staff of Willowview Residential Home would like to say pay their gratitude to to all the residents of Oakland Court and Darragh Cross Vivo for their kindness and thoughtfulness..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"DNA testing on dog dirt  ","story":"SENIOR Newry, Mourne and Down Council officers say they will need time to research the issue of using DNA testing on dog dirt in a bid to trace animals which are allowed to use public areas as open air toilets.Members of the local authorityrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee will discuss the issue at their virtual meeting later today.A motion on the issue tabled by Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown at the March meeting of the full council was referred to the local authority committee for discussion.Dog dirt poses a major health risk, especially to children, who could potentially lose their sight as a result of coming into contact with it.Cllr Brown said there was a need to consider innovative ways of tackling the issue which has been raised on a regular basis by elected representatives across the local authorityrsquos seven DEAs.He is keen for the local authority to investigate the viability of using DNA testing in a bid to identy offenders and aid enforcement officers to dish out fines.Cllr Brown is also eager for council officials to draw upon best practice from other councils who have introduced such a scheme in a bid to crack down on the dog fouling issue.In addition, he wants the local authority to roll out what he has described as an ldquoenhanced public awareness campaign focusing on the dangers of dog fouling.Ahead of tonightrsquos council meeting, officers are recommending that Cllr Brownrsquos motion is agreed to allow them time to research similar schemes which have been introduced where.In addition, officers say that they will need to understand the time and resources required to implement such a scheme locally beforereporting back to the council committee.Politicians, who have previously asked for more enforcement staff to be deployed across the district to deal with the dog fouling problem, say the highly contentious issue is one of the single most complained about problems in the area.They say that despite valiant efforts over recent years by council officials and others, the issue has not been adequately addressed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Drive in assembly at Crossgar primary school  ","story":"CEDAR Integrated Primary School in Crossgar has said farewell to its P pupils.Staff held a drive-in leavers ceremony for the outgoing P class last Friday.Parents and carers were invited to park in the playground and watch the  pupils receive folders of their work from their time at Cedar.They also received a survival kit for lsquobig schoolrsquo, as well as trophies for sports, arts and ICT,.

However, all facilities will close at pm.Within the next two weeks, additional council toilet facilities will reopen at three locations in Newcastle mdash Castle Park, Central Promenade and South Promenade, with council-owned toilets at Spelga Dam also set to reopen.The council says it is reopening toilet blocks between am and pm as part of a ldquophased approach balancing service provision, resources and the health and safety of the public and local authority staff.The organisation says that reopening public toilets will increase the districtrsquos tourist offering, confirming that work is underway to open additional toilet blocks on a phased basis with the hope to have as many as possible open at the height of the summer.But a warning has been issued that the reopening plan depends upon available resources to ensure that all facilities are serviced to the standard required.ldquoIt is vital to provide facilities that are maintained to a level that mitigates the risk of cross-contamination and possible transfer of Covid- among members of the public, said a council spokesman.Council officials say the measures taken to reopen public conveniences include increased frequency of cleansing and inspection, social distancing and hand washing signage and hand sanitisers provided outside each facility.In addition, the local authority says that its plan to reopen all public conveniences across the district will be continually reviewed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Removal of statue is ‘ridiculous’  ","story":"CALLS for the removal of a statue in west London in honour of one of Killyleaghrsquos most famous sons have been branded ldquoridiculous by a local politician.The statue of Sir Hans Sloane is included on a list of monuments that should be removed over his perceived links to slavery.Activists from the Black Lives Matter movement want the statue in honour of Sir Hans removed, while a campaign has been launched to replace it with a tribute to former Cha footballers Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Eidur Gudjohnsen.It is Sloanersquos marriage to Elizabeth Rose mdash the daughter of a wealthy slave planter in Jamaica ndash bringing him a one-third share of the net profits from her fatherrsquos vast plantations, which has put him on the list of Black Lives Matters campaigners.In addition, campaigners want to rename streets named after Sir Hans in the highly fashionable Knightsbridge area such as Sloan Square because he derived part of his wealth from his slave owner father-in-law who owned plantations in Jamaica.The collections of Sir Hans Sloane helped found the first museum in the world - the British Museum - and he was personal physician to three dferent English monarchs. He was also famous for discovering milk chocolate.Born in Killyleagh on April , , Sir Hans died in Cha in , aged  and described as the worldrsquos greatest collector who, from his earliest years, catalogued and carefully encased every artefact that he found.Over the years he accumulated nearly , items many of which today are on display in the British Museum.Close to the picturesque harbour in Killyleagh stands a copy of the London statue in honour of Sir Hans with a local councillor branding the campaign to take down the statues in the capital as ldquoridiculousCllr Billy Walker insists that the pioneering physician was not a slave trader and that the clamour for many statues to be taken down was becoming ldquosilly, urging the Government to show some backbone on the matter.He said Sir Hans was ldquorevered in his home town where people were proud to have a copy of the statue to a man who did so much for the world.Cllr Walker continued: ldquoSir Hans gave us the concept of free museums, found a cure for smallpox and pioneered science and medicine to do away with magic for treating illness.ldquoHe also promoted the use of quinine against malaria, discovered milk chocolate and was the first man to lead both Royal Colleges. Sir Hans also treated the poor for free and was no slave trader.Cllr Walker said Sir Hans left Killyleagh for London when he was  where he studied chemistry, before deciding on a career in medicine, qualying in France and ing to London.He was subsequently appointed as the personal physician to the governor of Jamaica and it was there that he discovered drinking chocolate.When he ed to England, Sir Hans was able to market his find and Cadburyrsquos promoted this drink for many years.Cllr Walker said that Sir Hans, who has a centre named after him in his home town, encouraged inoculation against ious diseases and for  years was President of the Royal College of Surgeons and a Fellow and hard working secretary of the Royal Society for many years.ldquoWe in Killyleagh are rightly very proud of Sir Hans and his links with our town, he continued.The councillor added: ldquoI hope that his statue in London will remain in place as he was a man of great distinction which is evidenced by the fact that there is now a centre dedicated to him in his home town. Killyleagh is fiercely proud of Sir Hans and his achievements..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Restoration of emergency services at Downe must be top priority  ","story":"THERE is substantial disquiet within our community concerning the future of the emergency department at Downe Hospital.The time is now long overdue for the South Eastern Trust to confirm that its intention is to restore our emergency department service to its pre-Covid- level and to provide a firm indication of the date on which it believes that that will happen.Clearly, that date cannot be far into the future.Downe Hospital has played a crucial role in the emergency response to the Covid- pandemic. In addition to the services directly provided at our local hospital mdash the peoplersquos hospital mdash Downe staff were redeployed to other healthcare facilities andcontributed enormously to the NHS effort.When the emergency planning was taking effect, it was the clear understanding of many local political and community representatives, that the emergency department service would be restored immediately upon the conclusion of the pandemic.Whilst there is clearly a signicant possibility of a so-called second surge in infections mdash and we are all aware as to just how serious such a second surge could be mdash at the same time there is increased normalisation of health provision across the North.The restoration of the urgent care service previously provided at the Downe must be a top priority as part of this normalisation. It should have been included in the June action plan, published by the health trust last week.Just last week, as attendances were increasing at the remaining emergency departments, including at the Ulster Hospital, it was apparent that existing facilities are and will be unable to cope with demand.During the Covid emergency planning, decisions were taken to temporarily close the emergency departments at the Downe, Daisy Hill and the Mater hospitals.Just last week, trade union representatives received categorical assurances from the Southern Trust about the re-opening of about Daisy Hill Hospital. Similar assurances are now required about the Downe.There is also a signicant impetus gathering now for the implementation of restructuring of healthcare services generally, and of urgent care in particular, across Northern Ireland.Decisions about the future of healthcare, particularly urgent care, afford an excellent opportunity to redress health inequalities that have arisen and been perpetuated by the historic under investment in the health service by successive governments and by the pursuit of centralisation policies.Many people believe that those centralisation policies played a crucial role in leaving us facing into a pandemic with insufficient hospital beds, insufficient intensive care beds, insufficient ambulance cover, insufficient ventilators and insufficient healthcare workers.Any change to emergency and urgent care provision is only permissible where it happens with the consent of the people.In the final analysis, decisions about the allocation of healthcare resources are political decisions taken by politicians, elected by the people and not by bureaucrats. Tiers and levels of bureaucracy make no dference to where ultimate responsibility lies.I have a great deal of sympathy for the recently appointed health minister, Robin Swann, who within a few weeks of his appointment, found himself facing the biggest public health emergency in the history of the National Health Service.I would respectfully suggest that Mr Swann should insist upon the criteria for change stated by Michelle OrsquoNeill when she was Health Minister.The now Deputy First Minister stated in November  that local people should be at the centre of decision-making processes in designing and delivering services. The , people who marched through Downpatrick in support of the Downe Hospitalin the Love the Downe Rally on February , , would certainly agree with that.As far back as , Dr Michael McBride, speaking at the sod cutting ceremony for the new Downe Hospital, said that ldquothe emphasis would be on making the health system respond to the patient rather than the patient to the system. I concur with that.In the Down Recorder of November , , after the publication of the Bengoa Report, Michelle OrsquoNeill was quoted as saying: ldquoWe will deliver care and support in the most appropriate settings, ideally in peoplersquos homes and communities.Again, I would concur with that.If there is to be a change in urgent care provision across Northern Ireland, no one can expect to be immune from that change. At the same time, change would only be possible or acceptableit is to create a better service for all of the people and a fair and equitable distribution of services.Many people in this area believe that we have had a very raw deal for over  years from the health service and some politicians.It sometimes seems to be forgotten that the National Health Service is free at the point of use, but it is certainly not without cost. It is the people who pay for it.Rural communities have particular characteristics and needs that must be addressed, in terms of at the most basic, accessibility to services. Like everyone , they have rights.Access to healthcare is a right, not a privilege.If it is to be the case that urgent care is being restructured, citizens in rural areas which, for this purpose, includes virtually anyone outside the Greater Belfast area, cannot be expected to forego services so that Belfast can continue to enjoy a proleration of emergency services, with not one but two Type  emergency departments on the scale of that at the Ulster Hospital, on its overdeveloped and cramped site, the Royal Victoria Hospital and the Mater, with the Type  unit at the Lagan Valley hospital, just seven miles from Belfast, a similar distance to that travelled by the people of Ardglass to the Downe hospital.Of course, Type  emergency departments are also to be found at Antrim and Craigavon, neither of which are far from Belfast and are linked by the best possible road infrastructure.Logically, it would seem, that the existence of two Type  units in Belfast is not sustainable, given the apparent massive pressure on services.We were told by the Department of Health at the time of the January  public meeting in Downpatrick Cricket Club that the purpose of that meeting was to enable local people to ldquofundamentally shape, inform and influence the criteria to be used to deliver services in the future.We hope that is still the case and await meaningful engagement with the community before change is implemented.The then deputy permanent secretary was quoted as having said that the then Minister would want to see ldquoongoing engagement in redesigning services. I am sure that the current Health Minister has the same views.The challenge for the Health Minister in the future must surely be to develop a fair and equitable distribution of services that would end discrimination against rural communities and ensure that all services, including ambulance services, are readily accessible to all of the people.It is worth remembering as well, that there was actually a .%in the attendances at emergency departments in Northern Ireland between December  and December . In the same period, attendances at the Downe Hospitalrsquos emergency department rose signicantly.Decisions about change in the health service are political decisions. All of the major parties form the Northern Ireland Executive, which is collectively accountable for the program for government and all that it delivers or fails to deliver for the people.It is imperative that any attempt to change or restructure healthcare provision in Northern Ireland is done so in full consultation with the end users of the services, who are also the paymasters for it. This will be very dficult, as history has created a deep mistrust between substantial elements in our community and the Department of Health.Our community has suffered greatly from repeated cuts to services and the ruthless pursuit of a centralisation agenda a pursuit that has continued even in recent years when the NHS in England and Wales has been investing in and supporting smaller hospitals, recognising their crucial roles at the heart of local communities and using technological advances to support them.If it appears that Covid- is being used as a cover to implement long-standing Department of Health policy, then any changes would be resented by the community and in fact rejected by it. This would lead to an irreparable breach of trust between the people and the State.If an attempt is made to in any way reduce the services that are currently on offer at the Downe Hospital, this community, as it has done before, will rise up in righteous indignation.Twenty five thousand people took to the streets of Downpatrick in February . If our emergency department is not restored within a reasonable timescale mdash a matter of weeks mdash it is very likely that this area will see an unprecedented display of anger, with , plus people on the street, with legal challenges about any perceived abuse of process and a community-wide campaign, a cross-community campaign and political upheaval at the highest level of government.The people of East and South Down have had enough. They have reluctantly sacriced local services, as a temporary measure in the short term, but their resolve should not be underestimated.The people of Newcastle, Ballynahinch, Castlewellan, Ardglass, Killough, Clough, Downpatrick, Strangford, Crossgar, Lower Mourne and the vast surrounding rural hinterland need these services.Farmers, fishermen and builders need emergency care as much as ever, so too do the tourists who flock into our area every year and probably will do so in even greater numbers this year.It is time to restore the Downe Hospitalrsquos emergency department and it is time to concentrate investment in local services, delivering for the people who need the services, where they need those services.The NHS must serve the people from ldquocradle to grave. It is a part of the social contract between the people and those who govern them.Politicians and administrators come and go. The Downe hospital must live on, developing all the time the range of services it offers.Equality demands nothing less..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Revered servant of local cricket  ","story":"Robin Walsh remembers Alfie Linehan, the distinguished Downpatrick cricket stalwart who died last yearTHE great paradox of Alfie Linehan was to be found in his disposition on the cricket field and off it.At the crease, his was a belligerent style, hitting the ball farther than anyone , compiling his runs in a manner that kept the scorers busy. Beyond the boundary!Yet this domineering, almost bullying, approach belied one of Irish cricketrsquos truest gentlemen off it: soft-spoken, never a word that offended, never a word against him.In one of the most distinguished legacies to the local game, the late Downpatrick farmer captained the Ireland team before turning to administration in the roles of chairman and president of the Northern Cricket Union and president of the Irish Cricket Union.Yet it was where it mattered most, at the grassroots of the game, that Alfie left his indelible mark.His devotion to the Downpatrick club and its famous international ground The Meadow was boundless and le-long, from underage player to captain of the club, coach and ultimately chairman and president.He either played or captained Downpatrick in five NCU Senior League, three Senior Cup-winning sides and an Irish Senior Cup triumph along with his older brother Hugh, another talented batsman whose death at the age of  dealt a terrible blow to Alfie.In later years it was a source of great pride that Hughrsquos son, Paul, was to captain the club and daughter Anne played for Ireland.His wersquos nephew, James Cunningham, also captained the club.Alfiersquos hard-hitting ways over four decades from the s took him to  Irish appearances mdash six of them as captain mdash in the days when international caps were much less liberally awarded, and his contribution to the success of NCU representative cricket has rarely been equalled.Administration was an endless labour of love at local, provincial and national level. Such was his accommodating nature that he chaired countless committees ranging from solving an umpire shortage in the NCU to raising funds at ICU golf days.His contribution to his local community extended far beyond the boundaries of the cricket club.In his day he was a member of the NI Sports Council, a director of his local hospital trust and president of Ardglass Golf Club.Alfiersquos friends were legion, none more close than Cecil Walker, that leading light of the Lisburn club.Their playing days over, they travelled the world with their wives watching international cricket and storing delightful memories of new friendships, whether tales of the Bodyline era over tea with Harold Larwood at his home in Sydney, or a fond mention by David lsquoBumblersquo Lloyd from the commentary box.Of all thatrsquos been written down the years about Alfie Linehan, one game has been overlooked and yet it speaks more than any of his commitment to Downpatrick.It was Saturday, August , , and Downpatrick were due to play Lurgan. It was also the day of Alfiersquos wedding to his beloved Mary. No problem: wedding in the morning, cricket in the afternoon, reception in the evening, off on honeymoon the next day.Of all the tributes paid to Alfie none has been more signicant than that on BBC Televisionrsquos Sports Personality of the Year programme last December.He was included in the prestigious roll of honour of international sports personalities who had died during .

Not a single new case of the virus was detected at health labs across the Province, the first time that has happened since the introduction of the crippling lockdown at the end of March. The number of new cases has been falling for weeks of course, but we have probably reached the ‘no new cases’ landmark sooner than some expected. Health minister Robin Swann, who suffered despicable online abusein the early weeks of this crisis, and not forgetting some criticism from partners in government, deserves praise for his handling of the crisis. Mr Swann has often struck an ominously downbeat and cautious tone during press conferences, particularly during the beginning of lockdown, and while that was frustrating at times, in the long run it might have influenced people to adhere to the rules on staying at home during the full lockdown, and latterly following social distancing advice as restrictions have been eased. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Critics might say Mr Swann was excessive in his prediction about the total number of deaths Northern Ireland could suffer, and he was certainly far out with his numbers. A long path to recovery now stretches ahead. Economically, the cost of the lockdown has been crippling, and there will be further pain ahead for businesses here who simply couldn’t sustain several months of little or no income. The Executive’s greatest failure has been on education. It was an obvious move to bring back children on a staggered basis at the end of this month, as much for their social wellbeing as anything , but incredibly, even a full-timefor pupils in September, has been placed in doubt. If we continue along the current path, and there is no second surge, it would be unthinkable for schools not toproperly in autumn.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

in one of his articles that such a progressive town as Penarth was without an operatic and dramatic society, writes Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Societypresident, Mary Gardner.The response to his outcry was quickly taken up and within three weeks the Penarth Operatic Society was formed.The Societyrsquos first production was Gilbert  Sullivanrsquos Iolanthe, played at The Hippodrome which later burnt down, and what a glittering opening evening it must have been as the audience wore evening dress.The review featured next day read, ldquoBrilliant Initial Performance.More newsVale council issues

new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One, PODS presented the very special play, Last Man Standing, which also won a NODA award for Best Drama.In , PODS decided to do pantomime, and this has been a greatly gratying and popular addition to the companyrsquos output.Itrsquos wonderful to see children in the cast having on-stage experience, and then those children in the audience, perhaps for the first time, enjoying and loving live theatre.PODS is a very busy Society putting on four shows a year, a musical, two plays and a pantomime.Mrs Gardner said: ldquoThis year, sadly and very upsettingly after much hard work by all involved, the covid- virus struck as PODS had just set-up at the Paget Rooms ready for its run of Goodnight Mister Tom, only to be told the venue would be shut down next day.ldquoSince January, the Society had also been rehearsing for its May musical, The Full Monty, and that too has had to be cancelled.       ,params: .pushldquoNevertheless, when this terrible emergency is over the company will put on these two productions sometime in the future. ldquoPODS is proud of its achievement in giving much pleasure and entertainment to the local community with its first-class shows over the last  years, and its goal is to make its centenary in  with the help of its faithful audiences, friends and patrons.PODS is always ready to welcome new members, but at the moment it cannot meet or rehearse due to the covid- restrictions.It might be some time before restrictions are lted on groups being able to rehearse together, or audiences allowed back in theatres, meanwhile PODS members keep in touch

station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh Government is keen for Wales to become

including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

These include:Communication of health information, and how effective it isCultural issues relating to the suitability of health and social services for BAME communitiesIncome and employment insecurity, which is experienced disproportionately by BAME communitiesPoor quality of ethnicity data, which is preventing accurate analysisHousing overcrowding and environmentThe financial burden created by migration statusThe role of structural and systemic racism and disadvantage.The report is by the BAME Covid- expert advisory group, set up by First Minister Mark Drakeford to look at the reasons why people from BAME communities were more likely to be adversely affected by coronavirus.:One of its two sub-groups was tasked with examining the socio-economic factors, chaired by Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna, professor of management and organization at Cardf Business School, Cardf University.\"Therersquos an overall theme running through our research for this report. It centres on long-standing racism and disadvantage, and the lack of BAME representation within decision-making processes,\" said Professor Ogbonna, who is also a trustee and vice-chair of Race Council Wales.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is, in some respects, revealing the consequences of a lack of action on race equality.ldquoMany of the issues wersquove highlighted have been identied and discussed previously, but they havenrsquot been addressed in any systematic and sustained way.Analysis of Covid- related deaths across England and Wales by ethnicity showed that people from a black ethnic background are at a greater risk of death involving COVID- than all other ethnic groups.The Office for National Statistics study showe that the risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males, and nearly two-and-a-half times higher for black females than white.Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for black males and around one-and-a-half times for black females. Signicant dferences also remain for Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Indian men. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsPoliticsProposed name for leisure centre under the spotlightArmagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council’s Ulster Unionist grouping will meet today to discuss a range of matters including the name of a new £ million leisurecentre.By The NewsroomMonday, nd June , : pm\"\"A perspective of the new South Lake Leisure Centre in Craigavon.The meeting of the UUP council group is, the Local Democracry Reporting Service understands, due to take place at pm, just over two hours before Council’s monthly meeting at which the DUP will present a controversial proposal to name the South Lake Leisure Centre ‘Centinary Leisure Centre’.The proposal looks certain to ide the chamber and due to the make up of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council, the Ulster Unionist Party’s vote will be crucial to its success or failure.SDLP Councillor Joe Nelson has called on the UUP to vote against it and described the move as “nothing more than a political stunt”.“The proposal will be taken by the Catholic Nationalist community as another insult by the DUP group on Council as it continues to try and drag us back to the ‘Ballygobackwards’ days of Craigavon Council,” said Councillor Nelson.“It is a slap in the face to nationalist people and I would urge the Ulster Unionist Party to stand up and be counted.”The Alliance Party has also come out in opposition to the proposal, with party group leader, Councillor Eoin Tennyson concerned such a move would require an equality impact assessment.“Any change at this late stage would mean further delay to the opening of the centre and additional cost to ratepayers as an Equality Impact Assessment would have to be satisfied, signage replaced at a potential cost of more than £k and planning implications would have to be considered,” said Cllr Tennyson.“We may even find ourselves in a position where residents are left without leisure provision altogether for an extended period.”He continued: “The centenary of Northern Ireland is a signicant event in our shared history, and of course it is right that we mark it in a thoughtful, inclusive and informative way.“Now, more than ever, people want to see their councillors showing leadership, working together and focused on the ongoing pandemic.“Engaging in political point-scoring or afaux fight over the name of a leisure centre ismerely a distraction from that.”Speaking last week, DUP group leader, Councillor Mark Baxter said of the proposal: “Our country celebrates a great milestone on May  next year, our th anniversary as a nation within the United Kingdom.“Given the current economic situation, we, as a party, discussed a fitting and inexpensive way to mark this signicant anniversary, so we will propose that the Council officially name the new leisure centre in Craigavon as the ‘Centenary Leisure Centre’.”A decision on the proposal will be taken at tonight’s full meeting of Armagh City, Banbridge and CraigavonBorough Council.Sinn Fein was asked for comment.Adam Morton , Local Democracy Reporting Service\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\"

","story":"Health Minister Robin Swann has announced plans to pause the shielding advice that was issued to people ahead of the Covid- peak in Northern Ireland. From  July, subject to the rate of community transmission continuing to be low, people will no longer need to shield and should instead follow the same guidance and precautions as those considered to be generally vulnerable. That involves taking particular care when out and about - and strictly maintaining social distancing.Letters will be issued in the coming days to all those covered by shielding informing them of the planned change.Mr Swann stated: “I have been clear that shielding would not last one minute longer than it needed to. We have now reached the point where,the current trends continue, there will be no need for anyone to shield after  July. “I have listened to many of you and to the challenges you have faced during this period. I am in no doubt as to the dficulties shielding has presented for a great many people.“It is unrealistic to think these dficulties will just vanish because the need to shield has ended. That is why the letters we issue will provide details of the support which will continue to be available up to and after  July.“While my announcement today will be welcome news for many who are shielding, some will view the prospect of an end to shielding with great anxiety. I want to assure them that they should decide what to do at their own pace. Everyone will approach this situation dferently.“As is so often the case at present, this will be about weighing up the options and making informed choices. Going outside can bring some degree of potential risk but this can be mitigated and minimised by strict social distancing. Staying indoors indefinitely is not good for anyone’s mental or physical health.“Finally, I would ask everyone to be considerate as people end their periods of shielding.We should all continue to social distance, but in the coming weeks I want you to be particularly understanding of the fact you might be encountering someone who has had to stay at home for many weeks. Please be aware of this, show respect and kindness to all and keep your distance.”  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_acfdbcbafdc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_badfcfccbefccbf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
