Yet it has featured in a number of the director general’s statements in recent years. He has compared the BBC to the military, the monarchy and the NHS, emphasising its indispensability to political and cultural life. These appeals didn’t seem to win the BBC many friends in the corridors of power, but the Covid-19 pandemic has given the broadcaster a renewed sense of purpose, just as its legitimacy crisis was deepening and its relationship with the government reached a nadir.Hall’s soft nationalism is well suited to crisis management, resonating with popular ideas of British people keeping calm and carrying on. It is also ingrained in the BBC’s history and institutional DNA, and is arguably inherent in the very medium of mass broadcasting that the BBC pioneered. Scholars of broadcasting, and indeed executives of the BBC, have noted the way in which the organisation has acted as “social cement” since the 1920s, fostering a shared sense of communality through royal occasions, sporting events, popular dramas, concerts and festivals.This might seem harmless enough under the circumstances, but the rhetoric of “the national broadcaster” also implies, however obliquely, a responsibility to display reverence towards authority and maintain a close relationship with officialdom and the state. Such an approach has historical precedent. Ever since the general strike of 1926 – when the BBC maintained its “independence” in return for making no genuine effort to exercise impartiality, taking the side of the government over the workers – there has been no clear line drawn between it being a state, national or public broadcaster. The BBC has occupied a grey area between authentic independence and direct state control.Today, there is empirical evidence that the BBC’s output reflects the perspectives of Westminster and Whitehall, along with experts, thinktanks and pundits who operate in or close to that world. In mundane terms, this means that social and geographical proximity to the largely London-based elite significantly increases your chances of being in a BBC editor’s phonebook. But the rather narrow range of opinion that appears in routine BBC reporting is further narrowed during periods of crisis, when governments seek to control information more tightly in accordance with their political strategies.Our present situation is different to industrial disputes or wars that have tested the BBC in the past, including the situation of total war to which it has been compared. During the second world war, the BBC was brought under the authority of the Ministry of Information, which for a time was headed by its founding father, John Reith. No such arrangements are in place today, and there is no national unity government. However, parliament is shut down and the main party of opposition is in a period of transition, meaning that a key source of criticism is muted.Just as significant is that, in response to the health crisis, state-sanctioned medical and scientific experts have in effect been incorporated into the state, blurring the line between independent expertise and government policy. Scientific experts and elected politicians are speaking in one voice through managed briefings, which are arguably allowing politicians to escape scrutiny via appeals to scientific authority.All this makes independent scrutiny of the government’s response to Covid-19 more difficult, and the situation is compounded by the sense of responsibility felt by a self-described national broadcaster that during this crisis is a key medium for government communications. According to its editorial guidelines, the BBC should be delivering essential information in the interests of public safety, but maintaining independence from the government. This should mean ensuring a clear distinction between public service information and independent journalism. The BBC has offered some limited space to criticisms of the government’s slow response to the pandemic and its failure to introduce large-scale testing or provide personal protective equipment, but it has too readily been co-opted into the government’s communication strategy.Obvious questions are not being raised in daily briefings and obvious international comparisons are not being made. Recently, as the UK daily death toll rose to a level not seen before in Europe, BBC News led on the government’s “Herculean effort” to provide PPE to NHS staff. It then spent the next few days reporting closely on the improving health of the prime minister and on Easter Sunday, as the UK approached 10,000 deaths, the lead story on its its homepage bore the headline: “Boris Johnson hails NHS staff.” This is PR, not journalism, and the lack of scrutiny of policy at such a crucial time will not make the public any safer.In exceptional circumstances, people tend to turn to governments for guidance and to official sources for information. This is not merely a frightened response, it is also a rational reaction to a situation that requires the authority and coordinating capacities of the state. But these crucial powers also require independent media to scrutinise and challenge the policies, and to provide a range of opinion, expert opinion in particular. As an organisation occupying an awkward position somewhere between an official instrument of the state and an institution of civil society, the BBC is struggling to perform that role.• Tom Mills is lecturer in sociology at Aston University.

It must learn from that mistakeIn mid-February a colleague mentioned that for the first time in his life he was more concerned than his mother, who had been relatively blase about the risks of Covid-19. It felt odd for him to be telling her to take care. We are both professors in a department of infectious disease epidemiology, and we were worried.Two months on, that anxiety has not gone, although it’s also been joined by a sense of sadness. It’s now clear that so many people have died, and so many more are desperately ill, simply because our politicians refused to listen to and act on advice. Scientists like us said lock down earlier we said test, trace, isolate. But they decided they knew better.Am I being unfair? The government assures us that its decisions and timing are based on science, as if it is a neutral, value-free process resulting in a specific set of instructions. In reality, the science around coronavirus is in its infancy and developing daily, with researchers across the world trying to understand how the virus spreads, how the body responds – and how to treat it and control it. The speed at which our knowledge has increased is impressive, from the sequencing of the virus in January through to having candidate vaccines in early February.Mathematical models are being refined to predict the extent and speed of spread and estimate the impact of control methods. My own group is studying the response of communities, showing how the epidemic is amplifying existing social inequalities. People with the lowest household income are far less likely, but no less willing, to be able to work from home or to self-isolate.But while scientists carry out observations and experiments, testing, iterating and discovering new knowledge, it is the role of policymakers to act on the best available evidence. In the context of a rapidly growing threat, that means listening to experts with experience of responding to previous epidemics.When I say that politicians “refused to listen”, I am referring to the advice and recommendations coming from the World Health Organization, from China and from Italy. The WHO advice, based on decades of experience and widely accepted by public health leaders and scientists around the world was clear – use every possible tool to suppress transmission. That meant testing and isolating cases, tracing and quarantining contacts, and ramping up hygiene efforts.The UK did well in the early phase, but then, on 12 March, the government alarmed many public health experts by abruptly abandoning containment and announcing that community case-finding and contact-tracing would stop. The aim was no longer to stop people getting it, but to slow it down while protecting the vulnerable.The evidence underpinning the government’s decision appears in a report from 9 March summarising the potential impact of behavioural and social interventions. The report did not consider the impact of case-finding and contact-tracing, but it did suggest that the biggest impact on cases and deaths would come from social distancing and the protection of vulnerable groups.And yet social distancing was not recommended then. That day, 12 March, after hearing with disbelief the government announcement that didn’t include widespread social distancing, I recommended to my team at Imperial that they should work from home for the foreseeable future. Indeed, I have not been to my office since.Neither the advice nor the science were followed that week. My colleagues, led by Neil Ferguson, published a report on 16 March estimating that without strong suppression, 250,000 people could die in the UK. The government responded that day with a recommendation for social distancing, avoiding pubs and working from home if possible. But there was still no enforcement, and it was left up to iniduals and employers to decide what to do. Many people were willing but unable to comply as we showed in a report on 20 March. It was only on 23 March that a more stringent lockdown and economic support was announced.So where to now? Once again, public health experience, including modelling, leads to some very clear recommendations. First, find cases in the community as well as hospitals and care homes isolate them, and trace their contacts using a combination of local public health teams and digital tools.Second, know your epidemic. Track the epidemic nationally and locally using NHS, public health and digital surveillance to see where cases are continuing to spread. This will be essential so that we can start to lift the lockdown while shielding the population from hotspots of transmission. Build community resilience by providing local support for vulnerable people affected by the virus and the negative impact of the control measures.Third, ensure transmission is suppressed in hospitals, care homes and workplaces through the right protective equipment, testing, distancing and hygiene. Investigate the differential effects on black and minority ethnic groups, and provide appropriate protection.Fourth, ensure that the most vulnerable, socially and medically, are fully protected through simple access to a basic income, rights for migrants, and safety for those affected by domestic violence.Many, including the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, say that now is not the time for blame. I am not looking to blame – but for scrutiny so that lessons can be learned to guide our response. We need to avoid further mistakes, and ensure that the government is hearing, and acting on, the best advice.• Helen Ward is professor of public health at Imperial College London"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0baa99ddb08ac18b6b8eb668bc107a33519ebae/639_128_6259_3757/master/6259.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0881a72fa710da21b59d971185e5c6d","title":"why gene attell may be the most unfortunate celebrity baby name yet","story":"Amy Schumer has announced that she has changed her new son’s name – after realising it sounded like ‘genital’.

It’s affecting the whole world.”According to US lawmakers: “‘Wet’ markets in particular pose a threat to global public health because wildlife comes from many different locations without any standardised sanitary or health inspection processes.”Animal Equality argues that the markets are not only “inhumane” and a source of “intensive suffering inflicted on farmed animals”, but that they are also a “threat to public health”.But experts who know the markets well say that they are just one link in a chain of both legal and illicit wildlife trade that needs intensive regulation, monitoring and enforcement to reduce heath risks, demand and consumption. In China, much of Asia, and some other parts of the world, a “wet market” is a term used for any market where fresh meat, fish, vegetables and fruits, and other perishable goods, are sold in an open-air setting. The “wet” part comes from sellers sloshing water on produce to keep it cool and fresh.While the markets may be considered unsanitary by western standards, most wet markets in China do not sell live animals other than fish in tanks, or sometimes in open pools.Many markets in China stopped selling live poultry after widespread avian flu outbreaks led provinces and local governments to ban such sales over the past decade.And while it is rare to see wildlife sold in these markets, the practice has continued in poorly regulated sites, such as the now-infamous Wuhan South China Seafood Market, which was suspected to be a primary source for spreading Covid-19 during late 2019.“If we really want to prevent future pandemics, we have to do a lot more than just stop live wildlife being slaughtered at markets or wild meat being sold at markets,” Debbie Banks, head of the tiger campaign at the Environmental Investigation Agency, told the .“In some countries, wildlife is commercially harvested and commercially farmed and transported direct to restaurants, consumed at private banquets, and used in traditional medicine, so there is a need to address demand and other retail venues besides wet markets,” she said.Using terms such as “wet markets” in debates on the issue also risks further stoking misconceptions and cultural prejudices, argue some.“This call for a ban comes from cultural differences often mixed with prejudice,” Kartini Samon, a Jakarta-based campaigner with the nonprofit Grain who has studied wet markets in the region, told the . “Wet markets are very common and have a long history in many places in Asia.”The Wuhan market was closed on 1 January. Authorities in China placed a temporary ban on all trade in wildlife in late January, including any trade in wildlife to be consumed for meat, to be used in traditional medicine, and for fur and other purposes.Further fine-tuning of the laws and regulations around the trade is ongoing. But it is the regulatory environment that allowed for such trade at the Wuhan market and the networks that supplied it that needs to be addressed, say experts, not simply the existence of the markets themselves.Across many countries wet markets provide an important outlet for small farmers to sell their produce, said Samon. “In a country like India or Indonesia, between 25 and 40 million people rely on wet markets and informal food vendors for their livelihoods.”And while markets like Wuhan’s may be an outlier for their trade in live wildlife, others say that more needs to be done to address general sanitation and hygiene at wet markets.Pfeiffer believes that over time many wet markets will disappear in places like China due to changes in consumer preferences and convenience.Some supermarkets already try to replicate a “mini-wet market” atmosphere with a butcher available under familiar reddish lighting for shoppers to chat with about which cuts are more fresh in a way that is harder to do in larger, impersonal, brightly-lit supermarkets.“I do think that wet markets are an issue when it comes to food safety standards and to adverse environmental impact. But that can be dealt with by regulation and raising awareness among consumers and traders,” Pfeiffer said.“We need to focus on changing the demand, because as long as that is there it will be a way for people to trade in wild animals and their products,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e31352ddcbca0262cc2659c4dcdb5da0558c9812/0_11_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c711200caa3987ddc7d51835dcf9173","title":"self isolating animals species social distancing wwf","story":"WWF has compiled a list of animal species whose social behaviours make them self-isolation experts.

Traditionally, it would have made its way into a shepherd’s pie, which is now more often made with fresh mince. Whichever you use, this dish will cheer the bleakest Monday, and you can make it up to the point of baking a day or two in advance.500g leftover roast lamb, or 800g raw minced lamb, hogget, mutton or goat, preferably shoulder, but not lean (or even beef mince if you can’t get hold of any of those)2 tbsp beef dripping, or lamb dripping, if you have it1 large onion2 large carrots3 celery sticks2 sprigs each rosemary and thyme1 tbsp flour300ml lamb or beef stock1 tbsp tomato puree2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce1.5kg floury potatoes (eg, rooster, kerr’s pink, maris piper, king edward)100g butter1 tbsp whole milkNutmeg, to grate (optional)If you’re starting with roast meat, roughly chop it into fairly small chunks, stripping off and discarding any large bits of fat or gristle if there’s a lot of fat, you may need to add more meat, to make the total up to around 500g. Or see step 9 for alternatives.Whether you’re using roast meat or raw mince, heat the fat in a large, heavy-based casserole dish over a medium-high heat. Fry the meat in batches until crisp and well browned all over, not just beige – with roast meat, be careful not to dry it out. Transfer the browned meat to a bowl and repeat with the rest.Peel and thinly slice the onion, and peel and cut the carrots and celery into fairly small dice. Pick the leaves from the rosemary and thyme, and roughly chop, discarding the stems (or keep them to flavour another dish). In the same pan in which you browned the mince, turn the heat to low-medium and add the onion– add a dash of oil if the pan is on the dry side.Cook until the onion begins to soften, then add the carrots, celery and herbs. Continue cooking, stirring regularly, until all the vegetables are tender, but not soft or browned.Sprinkle over the flour, stir to incorporate it into the vegetables, then pour in a little of the stock and scrape the bottom of the pan to dislodge any stuck-on bits.Stir in the tomato puree, followed by the remaining stock and Worcestershire sauce. Return the meat to the pan, turn up the heat and bring to a simmer.Turn it down to low-medium again, cover and leave to simmer gently for 45 minutes. Remove the lid, simmer for another 15 minutes, then set aside.While the meat is cooking, peel the potatoes and cut any large ones so they’re roughly the same size as the smallest. Put them in a pan of well-salted water, bring to a boil and cook until tender – how long this takes will depend on the size of your potatoes. Drain and put back into the hot pan to steam dry.Roughly chop the butter. Mash or pass the dry potatoes through a potato ricer back into the pan, then work in the butter and milk, until you have a smooth, fluffy mash. Season to taste with salt, black pepper and nutmeg, if you have it. Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)390Fgas 6.Spoon the meat mixture into a 30cm x 20cm ovenproof dish and top with the mash– I find it easiest to do this by scattering large dollops across the dish – then gently flattening it out until you have even coverage. Drag a fork down the length of the dish to create ridges in the potato, then bake for about 30 minutes, until lightly golden on top.You can swap sweet potato for the ordinary sort, if you like – treat it in exactly the same way. The sweetness works brilliantly with the savoury flavour of lamb. If you don’t have quite enough meat, or are trying to cut down, make up any shortfall with cooked lentils, adding them to the mix in step 5 along with the meat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a04f2945c04b178ff805415637da3696d05c6df4/0_137_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4fa015c572e7f13c627bb3e2d997025d","title":"rene higuita scorpion kick football isolation","story":"For too long I’ve avoided confrontation with inoffensive platitudes and nostalgia – now I’m here for clicks and retweetsThe existential crisis for football writers is real as we approach week four without our subject matter. All of us – even the most experienced Sunday Supplementers (your Winters, your Samuels, your Liews), have done “I miss football” and “Does it matter anyway?” We do and it kind of does. So what now?Like a manager desperate for a result at any cost – perhaps you revert back to old tactics, your Wilsons analysing the influence of 1920s Hungarian tactics on Dave Bassett, your Delaneys and all your Harrises giving their mentions another hammering by questioning Middle East states buying Premier League clubs.My fallback, as Barry Glendenning politely puts it on the  Football Weekly podcast, is “What I did on my summer holidays” journalism, perhaps something about my dad and my childhood and amateur football. It resonates – other people have dads, play football and were, at one point, children.Maybe it’s time to accept the inevitable and trot out some transfer rumours. How many of us will sleep better tonight if we speculate where Jack Grealish, Declan Rice and Donny van de Beek might be in six months? As long as it’s outside – and permitted – that will surely do.It’s too early for “What isolation has taught me”, given many of them are already in people’s drafts, and sports journalists should make a collective solemn vow never to publish them. Really, you just need a column to go in off your backside and then they’ll start to flow.One alternative, for all of us, is to completely reinvent ourselves. After all, no one can see you and the only thing we’re really concentrating on is trying to avoid people walking directly towards us. If it doesn’t work, no one will remember and you can blame it on the lockdown.So here goes. For too long now (not that anyone would notice) I have been avoiding confrontation, trying to keep gainful employment by just offering inoffensive platitudes and harmless nostalgia. Well not any more. I’m here for clicks and retweets. Here to cause controversy for the sake of it. The 5G conspiracy theorist of football. Here to expose what the mainstream media – excluding Eamonn Holmes, of course – have tried to hide from you for years. In footballing terms that means taking something good and exposing it as somehow fraudulent.It’s 6 September 1995. A meaningless England friendly against Colombia at Wembley. We all know the moment. René Higuita’s scorpion kick to clear Jamie Redknapp’s overhit cross. A moment so extraordinary it ranked 94th in Channel 4’s 100 Greatest Sporting Moments in 2002, above Arthur Ashe winning Wimbledon and one place below Zola Budd’s and Mary Decker’s collision in 1984.But Higuita’s scorpion kick was a fraud. I know. I was there. Not many of us were. As Richard Williams wrote in this paper: “If there were in reality even half the officially reported number of 20,000 spectators in the stadium it would be a surprise.”It was my second England game, and my second goalless draw after watching a stalemate with Norway the previous year when Dennis Wise filled the troublesome left side and Steve Bould played his last game for his country. Anyone who was at that game would be forgiven for being put off international football for life.There were first starts for Nicky Barmby and Steve McManaman, while Redknapp got his debut. It turned out to be John Barnes’s final outing in an England shirt. That should be the story of this game when we look back. A man who scored that goal at the Maracanã, who gave us hope where there had been none against Argentina in ’86, who had to put up with vile abuse for much of his international career.But it is Higuita’s game. In the  in 2007, the brilliant Marcela Mora Y Araujo said: “His scorpion kick in a friendly against England at Wembley is of undeniable wow status, and… served to position him in fandom psyche as one of the most entertaining players ever to grace the pitches.”David Ospina talked about it on the eve of the 2018 Carabao Cup final: “We were delighted … we talked about it a lot. It was great he did it at Wembley, too. For us Colombians, Higuita is a really important figure, it’s nice that he is remembered here for something special.”After the game, Higuita said: “It’s the sort of thing only one person can do. I have a massive repertoire but I don’t plan them ahead.” I beg to differ, René.“Goodness me!” exclaimed Ian Darke in commentary. “Have you ever seen anything like it in your life from a goalkeeper?” Well yes I had. For the entire warm-up. Over and over and over again. Scorpion kick after scorpion kick after scorpion kick. When it happened in the game, I remember thinking: “I’ve seen that before, about 25 minutes ago.” And it was offside and the ball from Redknapp was so perfect you wonder if he was in on it – there’s your 5G mast right there.You may ask whether this really matters? Why can’t we just have fond memories, even if it means we can’t handle the truth? It’s also quite obvious now that in attempting to move away from my “What I did on my summer holidays” Fisher Price school of journalism, I have drawn upon a story quite literally from my summer holidays.And while we’re here, I should point out that even if Higuita did see the linesman’s flag, and even if he did practise the move, so what: it’s still some feat to pull that off and make clean contact.

The sky is blue, the weather is hot and it’s the third World Cup quarter-final. Hip hip! Or should that be Hup Hup? No, because we’re totally impartial around here. Vamos!Holland name the hamstrung Marc Overmars on the bench, while Patrick Kluivert returns in place of Clarence Seedorf. He will partner Dennis Bergkamp up front. Argentina make one change, Roberto Sensini replacing Nelson Vivas in defence. For the winners: A semi-final against world champions Brazil.  Here, would anyone like a large helping of jingoism? With a nice slice of xenophobia on the side. Assuming you haven’t been living under a rock for the last week or so, you’ll have heard about the slightly controversial match that took place in St Etienne four days ago. So, no prizes for guessing who England fans will be supporting here. Plus they’re suckers for hard-luck stories. Backing the Dutch will feel normal. Which way will it go, though? All hype aside, Argentina are fortunate to be in this quarter-final at England’s expense. After all Glenn Hoddle’s side were magnificent on Tuesday night. Only, nothing went their way, Paul Scholes missing a glorious chance to make it 3-1 and lights out in the first half, David Beckham having a wee meltdown, Diego Simeone being Diego Simeone, Alan Shearer foolishly elbowing Carlos Roa as Sol Campbell ‘scored’, a curiously-placed ot denying Michael Owen when he went on another of those engrossing runs of his, a blatant handball in the area by Jose Chamot going unpunished during extra-time, David Seaman somehow letting in Roberto Ayala’s atrocious penalty in the shoot-out and Kevin Keegan predicting that David Batty would score his. Oh Kevin! You make your own luck and all that, but still. If that match proved anything, it is that Argentina, for all their exquisite talent, are very much there for the taking.Then again, Argentina might say the same about Holland. And with good reason too. The Dutch drew two of their group games, only managing a win against South Korea, and were then downright shabby against Yugoslavia in their second-round match. With the match poised at 1-1 in the second half, they were let off the hook when Predrag Mijatovic plonked a penalty against the bar, before Edgar Davids won it for Holland with a hit-and-hope effort from the edge of the area in the last minute. Again, there’s terrific flair in that side, but it’s yet to really catch fire. But what do I know? Both sides are still unbeaten. It’s bound to be tight.The mere mention of Rob Rensenbrink should be enough to send a shiver down the spine of any Holland fan old enough to remember the 1978 World Cup. Rensenbrink, of course, is the byword for footballing misfortune, the man who stared glory in the face and blinked. He was the man who could have altered history, who could have defined a generation. Instead he was the man who missed – in the last minute of the World Cup final.With the match against the hosts Argentina delicately poised at 1-1, Holland had a free-kick just inside their half. From the centre circle, it was sent long into the Argentina area by Ruud Krol. The defending was poor, Argentina’s right-back allowing the pass to bounce through to Rensenbrink, whose run had gone unnoticed by his supposed marker. The attacker reached the ball before the goalkeeper Ubaldo Fillol, stuck out his left leg and poked a shot goalwards from the left side of the six-yard box.  As he made contact with the ball, Fillol clattered into him, which would hardly have made a difference to Rensenbrink if his effort had rolled into the empty goal. How could it have? With the last kick of the match, he would have won the World Cup for Holland, for the first time, four years after they had lost in the final to West Germany. But the ball took one final bounce on its journey and that was all it required to alter the shot’s trajectory, kick fatefully away from goal, on to the near post and back out into the area. It was hacked clear, and moments later the full-time whistle blew.Needless to say, Argentina scored twice in extra-time to secure a 3-1 victory. They, not Holland, had their name on the trophy for the first time. Eight years later, they won it for the second time. Twenty years later, Holland have not gone closer. Today they have a chance for revenge, an opportunity to reach the last four at Argentina’s expense. Will Rensenbrink be watching?Kick-off: 3.30pm BST, 4.30pm in Marseille (or 7.45pm BST in the year 2020)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/982d01296ead4fdc314eadd9c30bf49739afc396/0_128_5168_3102/master/5168.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f188bf34d408d3342cf52c8262d2b2f","title":"deep inequalities of social distancing in south africa in pictures coronavirus","story":"In densely populated townships and cities, the army and police have been patrolling the streets to enforce strict measures to curb the spread of coronavirusAll photographs by Jérôme Delay for AP"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/292aead8aa90ea1b77e682a247506bcd62b0a61b/0_153_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=3065ab7970e7e7a64d134fbfb3575836","title":"bittersweet symphony the best lockdown orchestras and choirs online","story":"From the Lyon orchestra’s wake-up Grieg to La Scala Philharmonic’s Pachelbel, here are some of our favourite virtual performances – with a shout out to the skilled sound engineers and tech teams behind the scenesRotterdam’s Philharmonic Orchestra was among the first in Europe to exploit the wonders of smartphones and video editing, featuring the musicians locked down in their living rooms, each introducing themselves before playing the Ode to Joy theme from Beethoven’s Choral Symphony. A nice touch allows you to download the music for each instrument and play along too, whatever level you’re at. And, here’s Bamberg Symphony Orchestra’s take on the same famous theme, this time with added conductor.Here’s the famous Morning Mood from Grieg’s Peer Gynt Suite to wake us up, courtesy of the charming musicians of the Orchestre National de Lyon. (Watch to the end…)Opera North’s orchestra had been due to perform Strauss’s Also Sprach Zarathustra in concert in April and decided that the show must go on – virtually. Forty musicians in UK homes and one conductor, in Sweden, donned concert garb and perform the first few minutes of Strauss’s composition (most famously used in Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey). Look out for the cymbal player’s extra help, and the bassoonist in a very elegant fox mask.La Scala’s Philharmonic Orchestra sent Easter greetings in the shape of this short and very sweet extract from Pachelbel’s Canon.Like Rotterdam’s musicians, the Orchestre National de France also opt to introduce themselves – a lovely touch given how anonymous orchestral musicians usually have to be. They play Ravel’s Boléro, a piece in which the slow build makes it almost perfect for this kind of treatment. Here’s the New York Philharmonic’s virtual version on the same piece.Elgar’s Nimrod (from the Enigma Variations) is also a popular choice.

Next up: the firebrand rocker who gave his tales of blue-collar life universal appealBorn to Run (1975)By 1974, Bruce Springsteen was two albums deep, with a reputation as an urgent, vivid young songwriter. Mainstream success, however, still eluded him. In desperation, his record label awarded the then 25-year-old a colossal budget to make a third album. The responsibility of such investment and expectation weighed heavily on Springsteen he spent 14 months on the record – including six months on the title track alone, refining, redrafting, trying desperately to replicate the sounds he heard so clearly in his head.The result was not only a resounding success, it was a lesson, too, in musical craftsmanship, from the wall of sound-style production and arrangements to the immaculate structure its ebullient songs of escape (Thunder Road, Born to Run) tempered by admissions of defeat (Jungleland, Backstreets). And he had opened up as a lyricist: his previous records had documented the nitty-gritty of Springsteen’s own New Jersey scene, but now he moved away from the specific toward the universal. There were still screen doors and porches and Chevrolets, and Mary and Magic Rat and Maximum Lawmen, but it was a broader, blue-collar sensibility that could resonate anywhere one that looked beyond the giddy distractions of young manhood and found disillusionment and complexity. Born to Run was “the album where I left behind my adolescent definitions of love and freedom,” he said. “It was the iding line.”Darkness on the Edge of Town (1978)The deluge of success that followed Born to Run (and a considerable stretch of legal wrangling with his former manager) meant that Springsteen began its successor in a state of retreat. Again, his approach to recording was laborious: a year in the making, 70 songs written, 10 tracks chosen. As on Born to Run, he weighted exuberance against muted reflection the eagerness of Badlands or The Promised Land balanced by more contemplative numbers such as Factory, or the drowsy and dejected Racing in the Street. The record culminates in the title track still one of the finest songs of his career.It was this album that truly established Springsteen as the great storyteller of American heartland rock. Again, there are automobiles and interstates, girls won, money lost, but here it is raw rather than romanticised tender, lusty, spirited, these are tales of hard work and hard luck, of resignation and resolution. Musically, it differed enormously from Born to Run’s wall of sound effect. Here, each instrument seems to enjoy its own moment: there comes the staggering force of its drums, a flash of guitar, tremor of organ, the wild flourish of piano and saxophone. It’s a quality that perhaps contributes to the sense of inidual struggle, isolation and desire that runs through these stories, the sense that each of us dreams for something greater. The Promise, a 2010 film documenting the album’s making, gives extraordinary insight into Springsteen’s exacting working methods.To understand The River, its mingling of the blithe and the bitter, it helps to consider the way Springsteen once described it in an interview: “Rock’n’roll has always been this joy, this certain happiness that is in its way the most beautiful thing in life,” he said. “But rock is also about hardness and coldness and being alone.” At first listen, that combination might make for a strange record. How could an album kick off with the jangle and street swagger of The Ties That Bind, parade on through the raucous Sherry Darling, the snarling Jackson Cage, the chart-pleasing Hungry Heart, and come to rest some while later on the devastating quietness of the title track, with its depiction of a shotgun wedding and a life curtailed?With continued listening, however, it is that precise marriage of joy and coldness that brings The River its fully fleshed plausibility. A double album, several of its songs had been discarded from the Darkness sessions, while others were crafted over the many months of another extended recording session. While its emotional heart undeniably lies in its title track, along with Stolen Car, Point Blank and Independence Day, the album also carries great gusts of romance, such as the unwavering devotion of Drive All Night.Born in the USA (1984)Arriving in the flush of Reagan’s America, Springsteen’s seventh album could easily be taken for an act of patriotism: its title a statement of national cocksuredness, its songs an exercise in scale and volume and bullishness, its cover, depicting a blue-jeaned, white-teed Springsteen before a star-gled banner, suggesting a certain kind of brash, imperialist, bombastic Americanness. Many of the Springsteen songs sewn into our collective consciousness hail from this album, and are perhaps the reason why so many still regard him as a grease monkey writing singalong ditties about cars and girls. But Born in the USA is in fact a vastly more complicated album than this, and precisely the reason why it’s worth listening to Born to Run, Darkness and The River before returning to its run of familiar tunes.Far from an operation in braggadocio, its 12 tracks are in fact an unlikely marriage of rousing rock’n’roll hooks and progressive politics, born in an era of welfare cuts and hawkishness. Later, Springsteen would describe the title track as a kind of blues, an antiwar song mourning the effects of the conflict in Vietnam. Even without such context, the album is full of consummate songwriting – from the isolation and frustration of Dancing in the Dark to the sultry modern skiffle of I’m on Fire. It’s an album that feels ripe and complete. Perhaps owing more to its misinterpretation than its nuance, Born in the USA was a staggering success, spawning seven Top 10 singles. It’s still one of the bestselling albums of all time.Before Springsteen became Springsteen, before the E Street Band was born, The Boss fronted another New Jersey rock outfit named Steel Mill, which had a cult following along the Shore and beyond. This live recording of Goin’ Back to Georgia, from 1969, doffs its cap to the Allman Brothers and carries just some of the swarthy, hellfire energy that earned them a reputation as a staggering live band.Born to Run, by Bruce SpringsteenSpringsteen’s autobiography, published in 2016, is an unfalteringly honest account of the songwriter’s life, his experience of depression and his relationship with his father. The audiobook version, read by the man himself, really brings his words alive.Bruce Springsteen: ‘I think I just wanted to be great’, by Adam SweetingIn the wake of 911, Springsteen wrote and recorded The Rising, an album that reunited him with the E Street Band for the first time since Born in the USA, and saw him reflecting upon the impact of the terrorist attacks. Adam Sweeting’s interview around the time of its release in 2002 is strikingly open.We Are Alive, by David RemnickThe New Yorker’s extensive profile with the then-62-year-old Springsteen, from 2012, is an impeccable tracing of a life and career. It follows Springsteen from rehearsal to stage on the Wrecking Ball tour, taking in his marriage, his politics, and the death of E Street saxophonist Clarence Clemons along the way.

The tune itself is obviously a bit of a banger anyway, and I knew it would sound brilliant on the drums.”One viewer commented: “THIS IS EVERYTHING. You’ve won Wednesday 15 April, 2020. Congratulations.” Another replied, “Wednesday? Owain just won the first half of 2020 ... maybe the whole of 2020!!”Harry Potter buses for free NHS transportMagic-themed buses, which used to transport visitors to and from the Harry Potter studio tours in London, have been repurposed as free transport for NHS staff.The elaborately decorated buses were lying out of action after the coronavirus lockdown led to the closure of the Warner Bros Studio Tour. The coach company Golden Tours decided to donate the vehicles for NHS use.“We are delighted to announce that Golden Tours buses, usually used to shuttle sightseers to the Warner Bros Studio Tour London, will now be used to safely transport key workers to and from the hospitals,” the company said. “We couldn’t be happier to help the wonderful and hardworking NHS staff in any small way we can.”The buses will take staff between Watford General, St Albans City and Hemel Hempstead hospitals in Hertfordshire, with on-board social distancing rules maintained at all times.Paul da Gama, from the West Herts hospitals NHS trust, called the move a “wizard idea”, adding: “Our workforce has been depleted due to sickness or self-isolation and so it’s really important that those staff who are well, but have transport issues, can come back.”Village in Scotland turns phone box into community larderA disused red phone box has been transformed into a mini food hub, stocking groceries and other essentials for residents struggling with the coronavirus lockdown.Muthill, a village in Perth and Kinross, Scotland, is home to 675 residents. Corinna Robertson and Susan Crawford decided to set up the “take what you need” service after realising just how badly the lockdown had hit some people.“We realised this is worse than we thought. People are off work and have no income and it’ll take a while for them to get money through,” said Robertson, a 52-year-old garage worker who was recently furloughed.The larder, which was set up on 9 April, is particularity useful for those who cannot drive and who might struggle to get to the nearby town of Crieff to stock up. “The response has been incredible. The local pub, which no longer has income, donated chocolate Easter lollies for kids,” she added. “It’s great community spirit.”They have even considered keeping the hub open after the lockdown finishes to help people get back on their feet. “People might be in this predicament for a while, being behind with bills.”A water mill on the River Stour in Dorset, which Thomas Hardy used to enjoy visiting, has gone back into commercial production to help meet the demand for flour.Sturminster Newton Mill, usually a working museum producing a small amount of flour for tourists, has milled a tonne of wheat in 10 days – usually the amount it processes over the entire visitor season. It has sold the wheat to local bakers and grocers.Imogen Bittner, the miller, said: “We were due to open on 28 March and had already bought our grain for the season. Without visitors we’ll be taking quite a hit but this will help to make up for a bit of the lost income. It’s not only helping us but the local community because there is a shortage of flour.”There is thought to have been a mill on the spot since Saxon times. Thomas Hardy spent 21 months in the village and worked there on his novel The Return of the Native. He and his first wife, Emma, went for walks to the mill.On Wednesday, the former Tour de France champion Geraint Thomas began a 36-hour “ride” in the garage of his Cardiff home to fundraise for the NHS.Thomas is intending to complete the fundraising challenge on a high-tech static bike in three 12-hour sessions, representing the demanding shifts of NHS workers.The cyclist set up a bank of screens to record the details of his ride and communicate them. He also has a screen for a Netflix feed. He was being sustained by messages of support, plus coffee and Welsh cakes.Within a few hours he had reached his target of £100,000 for NHS Charities Together – but kept pedalling on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fb04114fe4a9443e2a7f3abc4fa79bfc039eb29/94_90_2966_1780/master/2966.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a61eae18c2cb1d0c3c0521f016044d5","title":"why have the uk and germany taken different approaches to covid 19 testing","story":"In February, the UK and Germany were taking a similar approach to testing for coronavirus.

There were two cancelled sessions and the lead players were put into isolation.Barnier came down with coronavirus in March and has recovered. Frost, who had “mild symptoms” of the virus, is no longer self-isolating. While the two leads were confined to their homes, the EU and UK continued working on draft legal texts, but progress ground to a halt.In a joint statement, the two sides said recent technical work had been “useful to identify all major areas of ergence and convergence”, but they agreed there was a need to organise further talks “in order to make real, tangible progress in the negotiations by June”.The next round will begin next week, with further talks scheduled for the weeks of 11 May and 1 June. Agendas for the negotiating sessions have not yet been published, but are expected to cover the 11 key topics of post-Brexit talks, including trade, security policy and fisheries.During the video call, Frost told Barnier the UK did not intend to seek an extension to the 11-month transition period, which ends on 31 December 2020.Yet EU diplomats are increasingly convinced that London will ask for an extension, as the fallout from coronavirus hammers the global economy and consumes political energy across Europe.Any decision to extend the transition must be agreed by both sides by 1 July and would require a deal on new payments into the EU budget. The transition period – which keeps the UK in the EU single market and customs union without voting rights – can be prolonged for up to two years, but only once.As the clock ticks down, EU diplomats are dismayed the UK has failed to produce a draft legal text on fisheries, despite a goal to agree on fishing rights covering 100 shared species by 1 July.The absence of a UK text is perceived as an attempt by the British to gain the upper hand by attempting to delay difficult issues until the last minute. EU sources insist there will be no agreement on anything without a deal on fish.The two sides have not narrowed their differences on any of the major sticking points, such as agreement on common environmental, social and competition law standards for free trade, or the role of the European court of justice.Last Friday the UK handed two legal texts to the EU, covering energy and law enforcement, adding to previous documents sent to Brussels, which cover trade, air safety, air transport and civil nuclear.The British have irritated EU diplomats by denying Barnier permission to share these texts with national capitals. That means the 27 EU member states, who will make the ultimate decision on the terms of the future relationship, are relying on analysis and summaries from Barnier and his negotiating team, rather than the original documents.The commission has published its 440-page draft legal text online, reflecting its longstanding Brexit transparency policy – and the reality that documents rarely remain secret for long in Brussels."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/044d932aebd8552bab0b30e2d091c647fd3d1f12/0_121_1997_1198/master/1997.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=f78577a2643e86b617a3efb926a4d4d9","title":"uk coronavirus live government lockdown exit strategy covid 19 latest updates","story":"Health secretary sets out plans for social care Keir Starmer calls on government to set out lockdown exit strategy third of all deaths in Scotland last week attributed to Covid-19Thank you to everyone who got in touch with tips and suggestions today – your input is invaluable. That’s it from us here on the UK side, but if you’d like to you can continue following the ’s worldwide coronavirus coverage over on our global live blog.Here are the main points from Matt Hancock’s press conference. And as we build capacity further over this month and then beyond to that 100,000 a day target by the end of this month we’ll expand further those who are eligible for tests - all as part of the plan to get a hold of this virus and make sure that we support the key public services that we need as this moment.On the issue of the peak, our view is that it is probably reaching the peak overall. That is what the flattening shows. But Whitty also said the number of deaths might go up tomorrow. That was because, after every weekend, there was a dip in reported deaths at the weekend, and for two days afterwards, followed by a rise. And he said deaths would continue at a high rate for a while. He went on:At the moment we are not yet at the point where we can say confidently and safely this is now past the peak and we can start thinking very much about the next phases. Whitty also said that the experts did not know yet what the reproduction number for coronavirus was (the rate at which it is transmitted). It was between 0.5 and 1, he said. (One is the point where one new person gets infected for every person with the virus etc. The reproduction number has to be below 1 for the epidemic to be on the decline.) He said the better the understanding of this number, the more easy it would be for the experts to anticipate what would happen next.I’m pleased to say that working with Public Health England, the care sector and many others, we are introducing new procedures so we can limit the risk of infection while wherever possible giving people’s closest loved ones the chance to say goodbye.This badge will be a badge of honour in a very real sense, allowing social care staff proudly and publicly to identify themselves, just like NHS staff do with that famous blue and white logo.

King Jr, who was described as a devoted father to his 10-year-old daughter, died on Saturday an hour after being brought to hospital after isolating at home with symptoms consistent with the virus, said Arnold Barrientos, the pastor of the Jesus is Lord Church in Oxford.King Jr’s wife, Twilight, is recovering after she was also taken to hospital.In a loss that has shaken the large Filipino community in the Oxford area, King Jr’s colleague, Rico, died on Friday from suspected coronavirus. He had been working at the hospital since arriving in the UK from the Philippines in 2004. His wife is a healthcare assistant.Tributes have been paid to a pregnant nurse who died after contracting Covid-19, with more than 40 NHS staff now said to have died during the outbreak, PA reports.Mary Agyeiwaa Agyapong, 28, who worked as a nurse on a general ward at Luton and Dunstable University Hospital for five years, died on Sunday.She is survived by her husband AJ and their baby girl, who was delivered successfully by emergency caesarean and is doing well, according to the Bedfordshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, who called Agyapong a “highly valued and loved” member of staff.A GoFundMe memorial appeal was set up by a colleague for her husband and daughter.The government has confirmed 19 deaths amongst those working for the health service, but announcements from NHS trusts and tributes from loved ones indicate the true number is higher still.A 34-year-old Polish national has been arrested after 14 kilos of cocaine was found hidden in a consignment of protective face masks attempting to enter the UK via the Channel Tunnel, the Home Office said.On Tuesday, Border Force officers at the UK control zone in Coquelles, northern France, stopped a Polish-registered van.The officers searched the vehicle and found a box of 15 wrapped packages concealed within the van, which was transporting boxes of protective face masks.The contents of some of the packages were tested and proved positive for cocaine.Ian Hanson, Border Force regional director for Coquelles, said: This seizure shows the lengths drug smugglers will go to. It is despicable to think they would try and exploit the current situation in this way to get their dangerous drugs on to the UK’s streets.The driver was arrested and the investigation passed to the National Crime Agency. He remains in custody being questioned. The masks have been detained pending checks by regulators.Here is an extract from the press release issued by the Department for Health and Social Care on 18 March showing that the government did commit to increasing the rate of coronavirus testing to 25,000 within four weeks. Today is exactly four weeks from the day that press release was issued, but that target has been missed.The copy that was sent to journalists by email was headed: “Government to rapidly boost Covid-19 testing in coming weeks”. It said:As many as 25,000 people within NHS hospitals will be tested for coronavirus every day as part of a major national effort to boost testing capacity, the government has confirmed today.With a focus on ensuring the highest priority cases are tested first, officials are working to rapidly increase the number of tests that can be conducted by Public Health England and the NHS in laboratories, with the expected surge in capacity ready within just four weeks.The copy of the press release on the government’s website is worded slightly differently. It says:Officials are working to increase the number of tests that can be conducted by Public Health England and the NHS to 25,000 a day.The increased capacity is expected to be ready within 4 weeks, with highest-priority cases being tested first.At the press conference Matt Hancock, the health secretary, wrongly claimed that the government had not committed to reaching the 25,000 a day target by today. (See 5.45pm.)My colleague Rowena Mason says Matt Hancock was wrong when he said the government never committed to achieving 25,000 tests a day by the middle of April. (See 5.45pm.)Whitty says he does not know what the impact of the lockdown will be on domestic abuse. But this is a huge problem. He says you have to consider potential mental and physical damage.Q: The government said 25,000 tests a day would be carried out by the middle of March. We are at 15 April, and we have not reached that. So why should we believe you will reach 100,000 a day by the end of April?Hancock says that is not right. The government said it would reach 25,000 tests a day by the end of April. He increased that to 100,000 tests a day, he says.Q: Northern Ireland is extending the lockdown for three weeks. (See 4.31pm.) Is that what you will decide for the UK?Hancock says this will be decided at the Cobra meeting tomorrow.Q: When the government relaxes the lockdown, will it be relaxed across the UK at the same time? Or will different rules apply in different places, because the coronavirus epidemic is at different stages in different places?McLean says the slide she showed earlier on people in hospital beds is relevant.She says London was ahead. But since the lockdown was introduced in the same places at the same time, you would expect to see hospital admissions flattening off at the same time. That is happening generally, she says. She says in London admissions are dropping off more quickly. Maybe one of the reasons that the number of people in hospital beds in London seems to be falling faster is perhaps, because cases rose faster, here people responded to the earlier bits of advice about staying away a little bit faster.Hancock says the testing policy change for care home residents comes into force today.Q: There are 1.6 million people working in social care. How many of those people will be able to get tests, and when? And what are you doing to address the funding crisis in social care?Hancock says councils have been given extra money to fund social care.On testing, he says the NHS does have the capacity to increase testing. The CQC is investing where testing is most needed. He says at the moment there is spare capacity in the thousands. And he says that this will be ramped up to 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed970dad8926612b4ad9a6375360a103231ce1af/0_210_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bbd1d08e6c68945b44cdeb496ee45672","title":"scientists confirm dramatic melting greenland ice sheet","story":"Study reveals loss largely due to high pressure zone not taken into account by climate modelsThere was a dramatic melting of Greenland’s ice sheet in the summer of 2019, researchers have confirmed, in a study that reveals the loss was largely down to a persistent zone of high pressure over the region.The ice sheet melted at a near record rate in 2019, and much faster than the average of previous decades. Figures have suggested that in July alone surface ice declined by 197 gigatonnes – equivalent to about 80 million Olympic swimming pools.Now experts have examined the level of melting in more detail, revealing what drove it. Crucially, the team note, the high pressure conditions lasted for 63 of the 92 summer days in 2019, compared with an average of just 28 days between 1981 and 2010. A similar situation was seen in 2012, a record bad year for melting of the ice sheet.The team say the climate models of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have not taken into account such unusual conditions. If such high pressure zones become a regular annual feature, future melting could be twice as high as currently predicted, a result that could have serious consequences for sea level rise.Writing in the journal the Cryosphere, Fettweis and his co-author Marco Tedesco from the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University report how they used satellite data, climate models and global weather patterns to explore the melting of the surface of the ice sheet last year.Using models, the pair also found that about 560Gt of meltwater runoff was generated in the summer of 2019. The surface mass balance, the amount of ice the sheet gained from rain and snowfall minus the amount lost through meltwater run off and evaporation, was just 54Gt a year– about 320Gt a year lower than the average across the earlier decades, and the greatest such drop on record.Further analysis showed the level and distribution of melting to be closely tied to a number of factors, including levels of snowfall and reflection of sunlight – known as albedo – as well as cloudiness and absorption of sunlight. All of these, they note, were influenced by the persistent high pressure zone over the ice sheet last summer.Dr Poul Christoffersen, a glaciologist at the Scott Polar Research Institute at the University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the study, welcomed the research, noting only 2012 had a higher meltwater runoff in recent years.“Clearly, this shows that extreme melt events are becoming a lot more frequent,” he said, adding that the new study showed that persistent atmospheric high pressure was an important factor, resulting in clear skies and a lack of snowfall in the south and warm, moist air being brought to northern parts of the ice sheet. “In that sense, the extreme melt years can be seen as natural events exacerbated by climate change,” said Christoffersen.Prof Andy Shepherd from the University of Leeds said a fall in surface mass balance was concerning. “If that drops below zero, then the ice sheet is no longer viable because in every year it is losing more ice than it gains,” he said, adding that that was not even counting the loss of icebergs. “Even if the glaciers stopped flowing, which is not going to happen, it would mean that the ice sheet still can’t survive,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58e946204a7e464c8ddea57c0d9267452028e3f8/0_318_3524_2114/master/3524.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9bbda6a2348f2f567a71f85c2656f2d","title":"traffic noise reduces bats ability to feed","story":"Experiment finds species try to avoid audible road sounds The thunder of road traffic is likely to drive away bats, according to a study, which found vehicle noise caused bat activity to decrease by two-thirds.Researchers played noise recorded from the A38 dual carriageway in Devon, with a “dusk average” of 26 vehicles passing per minute, in locations where different bat species flew and fed. The wild bats, including pipistrelle species, Daubenton’s and the greater horseshoe bat, were monitored with bat detectors placed beside, and 20 metres away, from the recorded noise.Ultrasonic sounds from vehicles were found to impede some bat species’ high-frequency echo-location calls, which they use to find insect prey such as moths. But more significant was that most bat species sought to avoid audible traffic noise.Matthews said the effect of ordinary traffic noise on bats meant that the adverse impact of new roads on bat populations was likely to be more far-reaching than realised.She said: “This is important, as it means we could expect to see negative effects continue at a considerable distance from the road. We know that lower frequency road noise travels well beyond 50 metres – the scale at which ecological impact assessments are conducted.”Dr Henry Schofield, from Vincent Wildlife Trust, which jointly funded the research, said: “We have become increasingly aware that bat species face barriers in the landscape that impede their ability to access suitable feeding areas and reduce their chances of survival. Along with habitat fragmentation and artificial lighting at night, this research has added road noise to the list of anthropogenic factors reducing habitat quality for these protected species.”While studies have shown that traffic noise causes birds to sing more loudly and be less responsive to alarm calls, there has been little research on how it affects other wildlife.The relatively silent streets during the coronavirus crisis appear to be a boon for many species, and the researchers are hoping to study the impact of much-reduced traffic levels on bats.According to lead author, Domhnall Finch, the findings suggest formal ecological impact assessments should be required whenever there are significant increases in traffic flows, not only when new roads are built."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1a492d40bbfa7cbd79f24dc3ccd20d124a8f076/0_78_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16fc2f8e0e3130406cd8cc8929d5db88","title":"have you become unemployed due to coronavirus","story":"If you live in the UK and have lost your job due to the coronavirus pandemic, we would like to hear from youAccording to a former Bank of England official, unemployment in Britain  may surpass the levels reached during the Great Depression in the 1930s.David Blanchflower, professor of economics at Darmouth College in the US, said unemployment was rising at the fastest rate in living memory.If you have become unemployed due to the pandemic, we would like to hear from you.When were you made unemployed and what were the reasons?

Shifting the centrepiece of the cycling calendar will involve a delicate juggling act with the other two Grand Tours, the Vuelta a España and the world road championships, and the five “monument” one-day Classics all jostling for space at the end of the season when it is hoped that major sports events in Europe will resume.The news was greeted with delight by the four-times champion Chris Froome, who confirmed this week that he has largely recovered from the accident that cost him a ride in the 2019 race. “The news many of us have been waiting for,” he said through Twitter. “Some light at the end of the tunnel – assuming all goes well.” Apart from during the two world wars, the Tour has never been cancelled, and many in France will see plans for its resumption as a sign that life may return to normal after the coronavirus pandemic.“I was glad to hear that the Tour will take place at a later date,” said the French cyclist Julian Alaphilippe. “There may be fewer people watching but it will still be a huge fête with lots of joy and motivation.” The Tour will stick to the route scheduled from 27 June, starting in Nice, heading west through the Massif Central to the Pyrenees before looping back to the Alps.“Holding this event in the best conditions possible is judged essential given its central place in cycling’s economy and its exposure, in particular for the teams that benefit on this occasion from unparalleled visibility,” said a statement from the Union Cycliste Internationale. A rejigged calendar for the UCI Women’s WorldTour is expected by 15 May, with all WorldTour events now cancelled until 1 August.The UCI also confirmed that the road world championships in Switzerland will take place immediately after the Tour. The men’s elite time trial title is currently scheduled for 20 September and will clash with the Tour finish in Paris, potentially creating a dilemma for riders who might target both events such as Froome and Tom Dumoulin of the Netherlands. However, the men’s elite road race is pencilled in for 27 September.The official release from the UCI said that both the Giro and the Vuelta would take place after the world championships initial signs are that the Giro may be moved to October, with the Vuelta in November.National road race championships were scheduled for the weekend of 20-21 June, and will – presumably depending on the situation in inidual countries – be held on the weekend of 22-23 August. The UCI is still looking for new dates for the five biggest one-day races in the sport, the “Monuments”: Milan-San Remo, the Tour of Flanders, Paris-Roubaix, Liège-Bastogne-Liège and the Giro di Lombardia.The decision to move all major events on the international cycling calendar to the end of the season follows confirmation on Monday by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, that France’s lockdown would continue until 11 May and that major events bringing together large groups of people would not be possible until mid-July at the earliest. That made the postponement of the Tour inevitable, and the need for at least some preparation events for the 22-day race meant that rescheduling until the end of July would not have been practical.There was an initial suggestion shortly after France entered lockdown that the Tour might be held “behind closed doors” with strict limitations on spectator numbers, but this was not warmly received by officials in the stage towns who pay for starts and finishes on the understanding that large numbers of fans will bring in sizeable revenue.Officials from the Tour’s stage towns – around 50 of them according to one source – were called on Tuesday to discuss the move prior to a teleconference on Wednesday morning involving the race organisers, teams and the UCI.The new schedule should give time to the Tour’s cyclists to get out on their home roads to train as lockdowns are lifted, because at present some – in the UK and Belgium for example – can ride on the road whereas this is banned in France, Spain and Italy. “It’s the best solution to allow the riders to get their act together,” said the Groupama-FDJ team manager, Marc Madiot. “Cycling needs the Tour but the Tour needs cyclists who are in decent condition.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eee9bd3221d38f2dfa8a2f4bee6b3ac126f430e8/240_152_5615_3368/master/5615.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04df7bc82fd8f690360a42d122cd7110","title":"cricket fans lockdown familiar boredom coronavirus","story":"Anyone who has watched or played cricket is well prepared to sit in the same place for days with not much to doBy Gary Naylor for the 99.94 Cricket BlogA friend of mine remarked some 40 years ago: “I like watching cricket. It makes the rest of my life so much more interesting.” That little jibe at our game has stuck with me because there is more than a kernel of truth in its barb. Cricket can be boring. But that, believe it or not, is a good thing.My overwhelming memory of a largely happy childhood is boredom. School ided neatly into stuff that was too easy and stuff that was too hard (I mean, me – woodwork?) Both ends of the spectrum brought their own flavour of boredom.Summer vacations were worse. Six weeks stretching into the distance with no alcohol, no girls, no television (Pebble Mill at One – really?). Pontins? Hated it. A week in a Lake District caravan? Hated it. Organised activities? Hated them. The egotism of the adolescent boy is truly boundless.It wasn’t boring for all 60,480 minutes – though sometimes it felt like that – because there was cricket on the telly! Draw the curtains to keep out the light (though you still couldn’t see the ball very well – and that’s if the cameras picked it up at all) and there was a blazered Peter West or Tony Lewis welcoming us to Lord’s or Headingley, with England seven down and still 176 runs in arrears.And it wasn’t just telly. There were trips to Old Trafford for Gillette Cup showdowns (Lancashire didn’t have mere matches back then), bus rides to Aigburth for the annual County Championship match, or a train past the golf links, hare coursing fields and sandhills to Southport for the other fixture within easy reach. I saw a lot of cricket – and played a lot too, most Saturdays and Sundays and many Wednesday night 20-overs-a-side thrashes (that’ll never catch on).And here’s the thing – a lot of that was boring too, even for a fan. The Saturday of the Old Trafford Ashes Test of 1981 turned into an unforgettable day, but in the morning, Geoffrey Boycott and Chris Tavaré were completing a stand of 72 in 10 minutes shy of three hours. I was there, so I know it was as dull as the leaden skies overhead.John Player League matches would fill Sunday afternoons on BBC 2 during which the lugubrious tones of Jim Laker would inform us that “203 in 40 overs is going to take a bit of getting.” Peter “Dasher” Denning in the covers provided most of the fireworks.In my mind’s eye, three-day matches in the Championship would always finish the first day with a scoreboard that read something like “247-8 (innings closed), 25-1”. You might see a Ken McEwan, but you’d be more likely to see a Jim Foat.On the field, as the junior opening bowler, I could be DNB with my side declared at 157-6, and then go for a few in my first three overs, spending the rest of the match doing midwicket, as a Saturday afternoon slides into a Saturday evening, the opposition finishing on 110-5 for another draw. That’s if you’re not stuck inside waiting for it to stop raining, listening to teammates discussing patios and golf handicaps.Those teenage years spent looking across 80 yards of grass to see Bernard Reidy leave another outside off or watching Mick Malone sprawl across daytime television to the tune of 57-24-77-6 on a flat one at The Oval inoculated me against tedium.All this proved to be invaluable experience however, because – and I hate to break it to you kids out there – you’re going to spend a lot of your life bored. In fact, unless you’re very lucky, you’re going to spend almost all of your working life bored (or about to be bored).As for me? A three-hour strategy planning meeting? Bring it on. Sixteen dissertations to mark in a single day, all of which include the sentence: “The Sixties was a time of great social change.” No problem. Action planning a year-long project from conception to evaluation? Lead me to it.This capacity to resist boredom served me well in other spheres of life too. The Scala Cinema in King’s Cross would show three-hour Russian epics back to back, with tiny subtitles to squint at, and I’d just lap them up. To the National Theatre for rarely performed extended versions of Shakespeare? If you can do three hours of Hendrick you can do three hours of Hamlet. Four hours of Bryn Terfel at the Royal Opera House? Come on – I loafed in the lounge while Mark Taylor and Geoff Marsh batted all day at Trent Bridge.These are strange days indeed as we sit, confined to barracks, while a virus flits its fatal paths in the outside world. We may never have had more ways to distract ourselves, to hold back the boredom, to ease the passage of long days that we can’t quite fill. But it’s still tough, as March dragged into April and April slides on towards May. But for some of us, it’s not so bad. And for that, Chris Tavaré, I salute you.• This article appeared first on The 99.94 Cricket Blog• Follow Gary Naylor on Twitter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2b1af06ce6fb433f3de5beef32e05ce37967981/0_221_4896_2936/master/4896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5b4431b91d2229517b56d63762c451f","title":"amazon jeff bezos gains 24bn coronavirus pandemic","story":"As the US’s coronavirus outbreak first spread, Bezos saved himself from larger losses by selling a large portion of his shares. He then benefited from the best three-day stock market rally since 1933. The late rally helped Amazon’s share price to recover almost all of its losses in March.But the increased demand comes amid growing controversy over the retailer’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak.Workers have reported severe strains on warehouse teams. Many are on the frontlines packing and shipping items at warehouses where Covid-19 can easily spread.Several have confirmed cases of employees testing positive for the virus.Amazon reported its first warehouse worker death on Tuesday. The man, an operations manager who worked at the company’s Hawthorne, California, warehouse, died on 31 March.Several workers have organized strikes and walkouts in protest at lack of worker protections. Chris Smalls, a former manager assistant, was fired by the retailer after leading workers at the JFK8 warehouse in Staten Island, New York, on a walkout.Employees demanded Amazon temporarily shut down the facility for cleaning after multiple employees tested positive for Covid-19.Memos leaked by Vice News revealed company executives suggested coordinating an attempt to smear Smalls as “not smart or articulate” in response to the backlash over his firing.Several Amazon workers have since alleged retaliation for organizing. In an op-Ed for the , Smalls urged Bezos to spend more time on protecting his workers instead of stifling dissent.“Without us working, what are you going to do,” he asked. “You’ll have no money. We have the power. We make money for you. Never forget that.”Amazon did enact safety measures inside its warehouses, including a six-foot distancing rule, supplying cleaning materials and hand wipes for workers, protesters said. The company also introduced mandatory temperature checks before each shift.Despite the strain, the retail giant also announced it will resume non-essential shipping at warehouses nationwide, which was temporarily halted due to the demand for medical and other sanitary or food supplies.Amazon has also hired 100,000 extra US workers to cope with demand, and noted it will hire another 75,000.According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Bezos is one of the few billionaires to have seen an increase to his net worth since the beginning of 2020."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/914511269a11aed1ca00cf1f047c8114ba520e52/170_100_3325_1994/master/3325.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=191797e585aa28626e17b8ade1bcae9f","title":"apple launches smaller cheaper new iphone se","story":"Second-generation iPhone SE resembles older models, with prices starting at £419Apple has launched a cheaper version of its iPhone SE as it attempts to continue normal business despite the coronavirus pandemic.The second-generation SE resembles Apple’s previous design used for its smartphones between 2014 and 2017, complete with the traditional touch ID home button instead of face recognition. It costs from £419 in the UK and $399 in the US.The new phone is a follow-up to the entry-level SE from 2016, which reused the design of the iPhone 5S. The new SE replaces 2017’s iPhone 8, which was until recently the cheapest iPhone on sale, costing £479 in the UK and $449 in the US.The second-generation SE has a 4.7in retina HD LCD screen, making it one of the few smaller smartphones available. The back is glass and it has aluminium sides like the iPhone 8. It is water-resistant to IP67 standards – one-metre depths for up to 30 minutes – and has Qi wireless charging.The new 4G phone also has the A13 Bionic chip, matching that in the iPhone 11 line, meaning the technology is not dated compared with the other current iPhones.It has a single 12-megapixel camera on the back, supporting 4K video, and a seven-megapixel selfie camera on the front. It comes with at least 64GB of storage, with 128GB and 256GB options, and is available in black, white or red. It will launch for pre-order from 1pm on Friday and ships on 24 April in the UK.Having been responsible for extending the smartphone cost ceiling beyond the £1,000 barrier, with models such as the iPhone 11 Pro Max pushing it to £1,149 and upwards, recent sales figures have consistently shown Apple’s cheapest £729 iPhone 11 model to be the bestseller.Apple will hope the cheaper and smaller iPhone will help drive sales under the spectre of Covid-19 and upgrades from older models, particularly from those still using an iPhone 6, which is no longer supported by updates.Smartphones are rated by screen size measured on the diagonal in inches. The bigger the number the larger the phone, but different phones use different ratios of height to width.How easy it is to handle comes down to the width of the phone and its weight. The narrower and lighter it is, the easier it is to hold in one hand and the less likely you are to drop it.What is commonly called the processor in a phone is actually a system-on-a-chip combining the processor, graphics and other essential systems into one.Generally the newer the processor the more powerful and battery efficient it will be. Samsung, Huawei and Apple make their own, while Qualcomm is the largest supplier to other brands at the high end, with its Snapdragon 8-series range at the top.The RAM (memory) is where your apps and processes are stored when in use, so the you more your phone has the better, up to a point.Android requires more RAM than iOS, so it\u0027s difficult to directly compare them. But with Android at least 4GB of RAM is currently recommended.Different from memory, storage is where everything is stored on the phone, including apps and media. While a few phones can have their storage expanded with microSD cards, most cannot.That means you should aim for 64GB of storage at a minimum, but more if you want to store lots of photos. Cloud services such as Spotify or Google\u0027s Photos can help offload your music, photos or videos to the internet.Keeping your phone secure from hackers is essential, which makes software updates critical to patch bugs and security holes, as well as adding new features and improving things such as battery life and the camera.Not all phones receive regular updates. Apple\u0027s support of older phones is the best in the business of around 5 years, followed by Samsung and Google\u0027s three years, both from when the phone was released - not when you buy it.Battery life varies drastically between devices, and all-day battery often doesn\u0027t mean 24 hours between charges. Some may not last long enough, particularly if you\u0027re out in the evening.Battery life gets worse as the battery ages too, so a two-day battery will likely make sure the phone lasts at least a day two years later.Cameras are the current battleground between the big players, but the margins between them are slimming.Most use computational photography that combines hardware with advanced software algorithms, typically allowing multiple cameras to combine to make one image.As such the camera software makes as much difference as the hardware, and is one of the few areas that actually improves over time with updates.Multi-camera systems often offer more, such as useful zooms, portrait modes and better low-light performance, but they are not all created equally. There are also 3D cameras, which can detect facial expressions and other fun tricks.The number of megapixels (MP) also makes a difference.

History shows that iPhone purchasers seem happy to pay the premium Apple’s products command, but the current global economic uncertainty risks challenging this assumption.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9cc71a10094450f062bc66e61f277a973900442a/0_37_3780_2269/master/3780.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97c0b2739365110458461fa907b553e1","title":"the right to repair planned obsolescence electronic waste mountain","story":"Unrepairable phones and laptops are one of the scandals of our throwaway society. But the pushback is building – and the coronavirus crisis has added more pressure for change ‘Imagine you showed someone a smartphone 20 years ago. You said: ‘Here’s this thing, it’s going to be awesome, and it’ll cost $1,000. But the manufacturers are going to glue the battery in, and you’re supposed to get rid of it when the battery wears out.’ You would have thought that notion was completely bananas.”Nathan Proctor is talking via Google Hangouts from Boston, Massachusetts, about an allegedly central feature of modern manufacturing known as planned obsolescence. This is the idea that some of the world’s biggest companies have been selling us products either knowing full well that they will only last a couple of years, or having deliberately built a short life into the itemor its software.It is a charge the companies would reject, but we all have everyday knowledge of what he is talking about – the suddenly dead or “bricked” – made as useless as a brick – phone, discarded printer or broken laptop. Most of us dismiss the phenomenon as an irritating but unavoidable feature of modern life. But Proctor is the director of the Right to Repair campaign spawned by the US’s Public Interest Research Group (founded in 1971 by the celebrated activist Ralph Nader), and he wants us to see things very differently.Now, finally, across the world, tentative moves are being made to end this culture of obsolescence. In the US, Apple has recently agreed to pay up to $500m in settlements related to allegations that software updates caused older iPhones – such as the iPhone 6, 6s Plus, 7 and 7 Plus – to slow down (the company denied any wrongdoing, and insisted the technique prevented older devices from shutting down altogether). In France, the same issue resulted in a fine of €25m (£21m).In Norway, the supreme court is deciding on the battle between Apple and Henrik Huseby, the owner of a small phone-repair shop, and the company’s pursuit of claims about “counterfeit” replacement screens that he insists were taken from old Apple devices. Meanwhile, the European commission has recently announced plans aimed at ensuring that a range of products will be “recyclable, repairable and designed to last longer” as part of a plan to halve waste across the EU by 2030.Different consumer choices might also be part of the answer, and Proctor’s life as a tech consumer offers examples. The computer he is using to talk to me, he explains, is a Frankenstein PC – custom-built from parts of different computers, some of which were bought in the early 1990s. His iPhone dates from 2013. But he emphasises that what we choose to buy is much less important than the actions of governments and companies.“We’re not going to fix this problem person by person, changing how we treat smartphones. The companies that make millions of smartphones should just not make them to break.” A few computer companies do better (“HP and Dell provide access to firmware, spare parts and tutorials – they’re really good, as far as we can tell”), but their actions heighten his exasperation that many tech corporations are reluctant to follow suit.Meanwhile, the coronavirus crisis has brought our need for greater resilience and sustainability into sharp focus. Proctor noticed this from the start. “A lot of new equipment – whether it’s your electric fan or iPhone or networking equipment for your school or office – comes from China,” he says. “And because Chinese manufacturing was affected first, a lot of wholesalers saw a pretty significant increase in the demand for used equipment – whether that was laptops that schools were trying to redistribute so that kids could do homework, or hardware so that people could handle more remote operations.”But wholesalers and refurbishers found much of the equipment was locked against reuse because of manufacturers’ systems. “You can buy the hardware, but you don’t have the permissions to use it without getting some kind of new service agreement. So that’s another problem.”The idea of planned or built-in obsolescence is certainly not new – it was first written about in 1928 by the American marketing pioneer Justus George Frederick. In the words of one subsequent account: “He stated that it was necessary to induce people to buy an ever-increasing variety of things, not in order to use them but to activate commerce and discard them after a short period of time.” The concept even has its own film – in The Man in the White Suit (made in 1951, and recently screened as part of a BBC Two Ealing comedies series sparked by the lockdown), a chemist falls foul of textile producers and trade unions for creating a material that never needs replacing.Nearly a century on from Frederick’s description, it seems his idea is everywhere, and it sometimes feels as if we are drowning in the detritus of planned obsolescence. The average time an inidual keeps a smartphone is reckoned to be between two and three years. Astonishingly, according to EU research, the average lifetime of desktop printers is a mere five hours and four minutes of actual printing time. Ever-changing software spells the demise of fully functioning devices – which is why so many of us have household drawers filled with old ones, left behind – and often bricked – by the same companies that made them.Symbols of the extent to which companies make user repairs of their devices either impossible or extremely difficult are everywhere. iPhones are partly held together by Pentalobe screws, which are immune to standard screwdrivers. Some Amazon Kindles are constructed using glued plastic casing that is all but impossible to prise open. The reluctance of big companies to release information about the workings of their products is a constant source of frustration.All this is being closely watched by a Brussels-based organisation called the European Environmental Bureau. One of the groups’s key staff members, 28-year-old Jean-Pierre Schweitzer, tells me the EU’s plans for digital devices promise to extend the rules that apply to such household objects as fridges and washing machines to laptops, tablets and smartphones. “We’re talking about really serious requirements, which include things about spare parts and product information,” he says. Yet this prospect is still five or six years away, while Brexit means that even such belated moves may not apply in the UK, and our own mound of discarded electronic stuff could just carry on growing.Schweitzer has a few betes noires. “One is wireless headphones,” he says. “People single out the Apple ones, but a lot of the other manufacturers are just as bad. The problem with lots of them is that you can’t replace the batteries. As soon as they run out, that’s it. Anything where you have an issue with the battery is really problematic, because they are all lithium-ion. Those are really rare, valuable resources. But because head-headphones are so small, people just throw them in their waste bins.“Increasingly, I’m hearing a lot of complaints about products from Amazon. All of their stuff: Kindles, the hardware connected with Amazon Prime – apparently it has a very short life. We’re just getting to see that now.”When I contact Apple, I get an email about its use of recycled materials: “Apple is using recycled cobalt from iPhone batteries recovered by its disassembly robot Daisy combined with scrap from final assembly sites for brand-new Apple batteries.”I then get a second email, which points to an announcement from last year, about “a new repair programme, offering customers additional options for the most common out-of-warranty iPhone repairs.“Apple will provide more independent repair businesses – large or small – with the same genuine parts, tools, training, repair manuals and diagnostics as its Apple Authorized Service Providers.” This sounds like a modest victory for Right to Repair campaigners, but the announcement also contains a warning about using counterfeit parts.When I contact Amazon, a spokesperson says it is committed to sustainability. “We have built a refurbishment and trade-in programme that kept millions of devices from ending up in landfills in 2019 alone. We also design our products to last so that customers do not have to upgrade to new hardware every year – in fact, many of our products are still in use after five years.”With a hint that Amazon, too, is at least starting to hear the noise made by Right to Repair campaigners, it goes on: “We know we have more work to do to allow our customers to make informed choices and to provide transparent information about the environmental impacts of devices through their whole life cycle.”Martine Postma is a former journalist, and founder of the international network of Repair Cafés that began in 2009 in her native Amsterdam. Volunteers meet people who arrive with items that needs fixing, and in the process learn about bringing products back to life. The network now extends to 36 countries.In Levenshulme, south Manchester, 33-year-old Jack Laycock is one of the key organisers of his local Repair Café which, until the Covid-19 outbreak, met once a month, with five or six repairers, and at least 20 customers. When I ask him why he does it, the answer comes back in a flash. “There’s just so much waste,” he says. “It’s unbelievable how much stuff we throw away. The Earth can’t sustain it. That was my reason for getting involved. But also, where I live is quite a erse area: there’s a lot of people who just can’t afford to buy new stuff all the time.”When I mention technology, the conversation takes a forlorn turn. Computers, he says, often prove impossible to fix. And smartphones? “We don’t even take phones. They’re so fiddly and small: if the screen’s cracked, it’s possible to repair it, but we don’t have the tools.”In search of hope, I speak to Olivia Webb, the outreach co-ordinator at iFixit. The Wiki-based website is the online home for a global community and offers a world of advice about how to fix tech devices, plus a shop selling repair tools. It is starting to build up a stock of information about the maintenance and repair of hospital equipment, including ventilators.iFixit has two HQs, one in Stuttgart, the other in San Luis Obispo, California, where about 150 people work. Its origin dates back to the early 2000s, when one of its founders broke his MacBook and, on finding no helpful information online, created his own repair guide. Now the site has an estimated 10 million visitors a month – thanks to the refusal of large swathes of the tech industry to help people to do their own repairs.iFixit is a private company, but Webb also works on advocacy for the Right to Repair, which is now focused on lobbying the US government. “We were doing really well this year until the coronavirus happened,” she says. “We had got legislation introduced in 21 states. We were making progress, but when the virus happened, it threw everything into question. But we’re in a really good position, I think.”What, ultimately, is it all about? “Our goal is to take back ownership of what we have. That means being able to open it, tinker with it, change things inside it or whatever, without getting into trouble with the manufacturer. “There are thousands of tonnes of e-waste we throw away every year that are just marinating. That really has to change.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee2a5763eb94f9b7f6d888dd49d977cba81f21b3/0_61_1157_694/master/1157.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a89d7dd2027c736d56d0d4d22708f28a","title":"volunteers create worlds fastest supercomputer to combat coronavirus","story":"Participants ‘folding proteins’ on home PCs, a task that could prove instrumental in tackling diseaseThe world’s fastest supercomputer has been created from volunteers loaning spare time on their home PCs to fold proteins, a scientific task that could prove instrumental in the fight against the coronavirus.According to Folding@Home, the organisation that runs the distributed computing effort, the combined power of the network broke 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 operations per second – or one “exaflop” – on 25 March.That made it six times more powerful than the current world’s fastest traditional supercomputer, the IBM Summit, which is used for scientific research at the US’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory. By Monday, it had more than doubled that, hitting a new record of 2.4 exaflops, faster than the top 500 traditional supercomputers combined, thanks to almost 1 million new members of the network.The breakthrough reflects a huge spike in support for the Folding@Home project. Backers run a simple piece of software on their home computer, which then downloads and performs small tasks to help determine the physical structure of proteins.All complex proteins are made of one or more strings of amino acids, folded in on themselves in complex – but predictable – ways to make 3D shapes. By applying those predictable rules, even a home computer can carry out folding calculations, and when millions of home computers are running the software at the same time, the total network can far outpace traditional supercomputers.In March, Folding@Home announced a new set of tasks related to Covid-19 that would put contributors to work simulating the dynamics of the proteins that make up Sars-CoV-2 (the virus that causes Covid-19) to hunt for new prospects for drugs to tackle the disease.It is already paying off. One effort has been focusing on the “spike” protein that Sars-CoV-2 uses to invade human cells, says Greg Bowman, one of the researchers coordinating the effort. “It is well established that the spike must undergo a dramatic opening motion to reveal the interface that ultimately binds a human cell. Understanding how the spike opens up … could be extremely useful. Every step along the way could potentially be targeted with therapeutics.“Unfortunately, there is no way to watch a spike undergo this transition, at least with existing experimental techniques. Data on what the open state even looks like is also limited.” But after just a few weeks of project time, the team was able to create a simulation that showed the first stage of the “mouth” opening up.Those successes have taken the project far beyond its previous peak in 2007, when Sony built support for Folding@Home into its PlayStation 3 consoles, increasing the amount of processing power available at a stroke.Since then, interest has waxed and waned. Folding@Home and similar projects were hurt by the rise of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, which offered another, less altruistic, use for “spare” processing power: “mining” for coins that could make real money. But the project also saw a boost in early March, just days before it announced its new Covid-19 focus, when SETI@home, the pioneer distributed computing effort, shut down.SETI@home had been sending radio telescope data to computers around the world since 1999, which would then be analysed for signs of extraterrestrial life. But last month, the researchers behind it closed the program, saying they had analysed “all the data we need” for the foreseeable future.“It’s a lot of work for us to manage the distributed processing of data,” SETI@home’s organisers said. “We need to focus on completing the back-end analysis of the results we already have, and writing this up in a scientific journal paper.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5917f9514253fb0dba9f05f00ab9ba841a6cff31/0_903_4541_2725/master/4541.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0bda899d46cc81ad48c37c6bc6a063fb","title":"how do you feel when you wake up in the morning","story":"Having the right mattress is key to a good night’s sleep. Choose yours wisely, says sleep expert Dr Rangan Chatterjee Do you wake up with an aching back? With pain in your neck? Or an acute need for high-strength coffee? How you feel the second your alarm goes off tells you legions about how well you slept. And the underlying cause of your sleep issues could be literally lying under you: your mattress is the foundation to a good night’s rest.“One of the big problems with sleep is that we underestimate the importance of getting eight quality hours,” says Dr Rangan Chatterjee, M\u0026ampS sleep ambassador and author of The Stress Solution. “Once you prioritise your sleep, it automatically improves.” Sleep is fundamental to how we feel in the day. If you look in the brain after a bad night’s sleep, says Chatterjee, “you see a collapse in memory, attention, cognitive function, decision-making capacity and the ability to learn new things.” And an increased likelihood of exploding when there’s an unexpected item in the bagging area at the supermarket, because a bad night’s sleep is synonymous with a bad mood.Admittedly, we all have a few big nights out and accidental midnight Netflix binges, but sometimes we’re unable to sleep well through the night at no fault of our own. And a common culprit? That old mattress you’ve been making do with. “When your mattress is so comfortable that you can’t wait to get into bed in the evening, you send a powerful message to your body and brain,” says Chatterjee. Think of finding the right mattress as an act of self-care, up there with going to yoga or cooking a healthy dinner.Waking up covered in sweat isn’t necessarily a symptom of nightmares. The answer is more practical than that, says Chatterjee: “Being physically hot at night will wake you up. Being cool is critical to good sleep, so keep your bedroom at a cool, well-ventilated 17C.” If keeping the window open isn’t an option, or you’re still overheating, treat yourself to a cooling mattress topper or a luxury mattress with thermoregulating properties.If you often wake up feeling stiff, a memory foam mattress can feel like a miracle. The material is also supportive if you’re tossing and turning, or you have joint problems. “For some people, memory foam can be absolutely life-changing,” says Chatterjee. “The material adapts to your weight and body shape, so it’s very personalised.” As your body sinks into the mattress, you may even feel your spine start to stretch out. It’s the restorative antidote to hunching over a desk during the day.So how do you know you’ve found the right mattress? Simple, says Chatterjee: “When you lie down and you don’t want to get up.” Sweet dreams.The natural option: Made using cashmere, silk, pashmina, lambswool and cotton, the Natural Plus 1500 Medium mattress (from £499) is a pocket spring mattress with an enhanced natural and supportive feel.The M\u0026ampS Sleep Shop has everything you need for a great night’s sleep.

The secret to a good night lies in your evening routine, says  Alexandra Jones“We all have our own unique relationship with sleep, but two things are true for all of us: to sleep soundly we need to feel safe and settled in our environment,” says sleep therapist Nerina Ramlakhan, author of Fast Asleep, Wide Awake. The solution is multi-sensory. “Creating a pre-bedtime ritual, incorporating visual, physical or olfactory cues can be a good way to foster those feelings,” she says. “So my most important tip is to find a routine that helps you to drift off and to stick to it.”And it’s not just about the 20 minutes before bedtime. “From the moment you step through the door in the evening, start making the transition from the busyness of the day to a relaxed state that’s ready for sleep,” says Ramlakhan. “There are a few small tricks that can be incorporated into anyone’s evening, no matter how busy.”But where do you start? “Lighting is paramount,” says Ramlakhan. The hormone melatonin is responsible for making us fall asleep the pineal gland in our brain naturally starts to release more melatonin into the bloodstream at night. However, bright lights, especially screen light, can delay the production of melatonin by stimulating a nerve pathway connecting the retina in the eye to an area of the brain called the hypothalamus. “Candles are a good option if you don’t want to delay the onset of melatonin release,” says Ramlakhan. She recommends two hours of low light, giving the brain plenty of time to start pumping the sleep hormone into the system. Opt for the Calm Candle, £7.50, which releases a gentle fragrance mix of clary sage, lavender and sweet orange – formulated to promote relaxation.In fact, lavender has long been used as a natural sedative as far back as the 14th century, Charles VI, king of France, is said to have demanded that lavender be stuffed into his pillows to help him sleep.“My own bedroom is scented with lavender,” says Ramlakhan. Over the past 10 years, several studies have found that, neurologically, the smell of lavender oil has anti-anxiety and analgesic properties. “The scientific benefits of aromatherapy interventions are still being understood, but incorporating them into our night-time routine can make us feel calm from the associations we have with the smell.” As well as lavender, Ramlakhan uses eucalyptus because, as she explains: “It was used in my childhood a lot – and that memory makes it a potent relaxant for me. Adding something with a strong aromatherapeutic smell into your night-time routine can act like a trigger, telling your brain that it’s time for sleep.”When you’re sleeping away from home, bring your bedtime routine with you to reduce the unsettling feeling. So, if lavender is part of your night-time ritual, says Ramlakhan, “the associated behaviour and smell is likely to help you relax and create feelings of safety.” Ren Pillow Spray, £19, is blended with essential oils, including lavender.Alternatively, switching your regular shower gel to something like L’Occitane Aromachologie Relaxing Shower Gel, £16.50, could work just as well. It has a blend of essential oils that infuse the steam with a relaxing scent. “And if you’ve got time for a bath in the evening, salts are a great way to relax tired muscles,” says Ramlakhan. As well as washing away tension, This Works Deep Sleep Bath Soak, £22, smells ine and will leave your skin feeling soft and hydrated.The trick is not to leave showering or bathing too late. Like light, body temperature plays an important role in preparation for the night the process of rapid cooling after a hot shower is proven to aid sleep, but it takes about 90 minutes to reach peak drowsiness.

Not our current predicament – although, in low moments, it may sometimes feel that way. No, this is the “gather”, a ritualised round-up where Lake District shepherds sweep the local peaks to coax a diffuse flock back home for the mutton equivalent of an MOT.BBC Four’s documentary film The Great Mountain Sheep Gather was hardly the usual splashy Easter blockbuster premiere, yet it was probably the most restorative thing screened over the holiday weekend. The perennial One Man and his Dog aside, this was also the biggest herding-related TV event since ITV’s Flockstars in 2015, that ill-fated attempt to turn sheepdog trials into a celebrity circus.The Great Mountain Sheep Gather took a notably loftier approach, using unhurried aerial drone footage to help communicate the sheer scale of the task facing local shepherd Andrew Harrison and his roving team of dogs. These sweeping but pleasingly languid shots of flinty beauty were interspersed with short stanzas of poetry written by Mark Pajak and read by Maxine Peake.The result was a film overflowing with lush but hardscrabble beauty that seemed to model itself on the wandering rhythms of the gather itself, with long sections of contemplative silence – or at least what passes for silence on the fells. There was always a soothing pastoral underscore of birdsong and the occasional plaintive bleat. In marked contrast to online discourse, every “meh” made my heart leap.A lifelong farmer, Harrison has England’s highest mountain, Scafell Pike, on his patch and his 500-strong flock of Herdwick sheep were self-reliant enough to scatter themselves all over its vertiginous facets. To this layman’s tired eyes, they also seemed much harder to spot than other breeds, sporting thick woollen coats of various shades of grey, off-white and even dark chocolate brown.Equipped with a crook, Adidas joggers and a bodycam, Harrison was up before 4am to ascend to his preferred starting position. Even though this was a July morning, the elevated terrain was girdled in thick fog. As the shepherd advanced through the murk – the drone camera floating obediently at heel behind him – he would occasionally be obscured from sight, giving this doc the unexpected and phantasmagorical feel of a pagan horror movie.If the God’s-eye view from the drone showcased the Lake District landscape in all its brooding beauty, there was also the chance to sample the mossy, mulchy experience at ground-level. A sheep-cam thrust you into the stop-start bustle of the expanding herd, with all the snuffling and rustling you might expect. Footage harvested from Harrison’s bodycam simulated the sensation of striding purposefully across the moors or dipping abruptly into a brook to slake your thirst. In one memorable lull, he rested against a handy rock and the POV shot was dominated by his hands deftly rolling up a ciggie: the world’s most scenic fag break.It was not all quiet contemplation and communing with nature. By halfway through, Harrison and his indefatigable dogs – now bolstered by some fellow herders – had rounded up a considerable flock requiring constant attention to direct over the unpredictable terrain. We learned of “trods”, narrow paths favoured by sheep but yet to show up on any OS map, and felt the shared relief of navigating every animal safely through the fell gate, after which the bleak wildness gradually gave way to fields and paddocks more visibly shaped by man.The Great Mountain Sheep Gather was presumably commissioned ages ago, certainly long before we all became so unfortunately familiar with the phrase “herd immunity”. While not quite Slow TV, it does feel like a conscious attempt to tap into the renewed interest surrounding the traditional words and ways of the UK countryside spearheaded by the work and advocacy of Robert Macfarlane. That it also allowed viewers to ride shotgun on a bracing expedition through remarkable scenery at a time when our default state involves managing unpredictable levels of cabin fever made it feel especially timely.By the closing scenes, it had even become aspirational TV, as the bemused Herdwicks were brusquely but not unkindly manhandled by Harrison as he efficiently sheared off their thick coats. A meditative natural journey with a professional haircut at the end of it? Sign me up for the sequel."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9eba9821267a73d2fb97bb47cfa02d8eef4ae06/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c40ff0563481f96be32710d7749a5a4","title":"mike judge interview beavis butthead silicon valley tales from the tour bus","story":"The writer-director’s comedies – from Office Space to Silicon Valley – always sum up the spirit of their times. So why has he made an LSD-soaked cartoon about George Clinton and Bootsy Collins?Few writer-directors have been as consistent and ruthless at capturing the moment as Mike Judge, although he never actually intends to do so. “It’s always a shock when something comes out and it feels so relevant,” he says, in his laconic surfer-dude tone, talking to me by phone from his home in Los Angeles. “But I tend to look at stuff that feels as if it’s everywhere, but nobody’s talking about.”Judge, 57, is so beady at spotting what’s everywhere, his shows themselves end up becoming ubiquitous, the thing everybody’s talking about. It is impossible to imagine 90s TV without his seminal hits, Beavis and Butt-Head and King of the Hill, the former satirising the worst of youth culture, the latter fondly depicting gentle American conservatism acclimatising itself to the Bill Clinton era.He lampooned modern workplace culture in the movies Extract and Office Space, while his superlative sitcom about the tech world, Silicon Valley, managed to make comedy out of the wealthiest and most influential industry in our era. It was so bang on that Bill Gates, a superfan of the show, recommended it to fellow tech heads as a professional tool: “If you want to understand Silicon Valley, watch Silicon Valley,” he wrote on his blog.The show finished its sixth and final series last year, much to the sadness of Gates and the show’s millions of other fans. Judge insists this was the right time but he did feel a pang of regret when he read about the recent debacle with WeWork and realised he couldn’t incorporate the office space startup that lost billions into the show. “Those stories about the douchebaggy CEO who walked around barefoot …” he trails off almost longingly.But these days, it’s Judge’s 2006 film, Idiocracy, that fans cite the most. It tells the story of a man who wakes up from a long coma to find an America that has become ultra-selfish and defiantly anti-intellectual, one in which the people anaesthetise themselves by watching TV shows with titles such as “Ow! My Balls!” Meanwhile, the moronic President Camacho, played by Terry Crews, prances about like a professional wrestler rather than a politician. There are now a million internet quizzes with titles such as: “Who said it: Camacho or Trump?”In 2017, Crews said Idiocracy was “so prophetic in so many ways it scares people”. He was not wrong: in Idiocracy, the secretary of state is sponsored by the fastfood chain Carl’s Jr. Exactly a decade later, Trump’s pick in 2016 for secretary of labor was Andrew Puzder, former CEO of … Carl’s Jr. (Puzder ultimately withdrew.) “I definitely hear about Idiocracy a lot. If I go on Twitter it’s just all day, every day,” Judge says with a laugh. “Someone will post a clip and I’ll be like, ‘Huh, that is sort of like now.’” What does he think of the comparisons between Camacho and Trump? “There are a lot of similarities. But Camacho has more charisma.”Judge’s latest project is, uniquely for him, totally unconnected to the zeitgeist, and this has been an enormous relief to him. “Nothing is ever not stressful, but it is nice doing something like this. There wasn’t anyone breathing down our necks to hurry up and make a documentary about funk.”For the past three years, Judge has been quietly working on “my passion project”. While still making Silicon Valley, Judge created the first series of Mike Judge Presents: Tales from the Tour Bus, released in 2017. Using a mix of archive footage and animation so flat and simple it looks as if it’s from a fanzine, he tells the story of country music through its stars, from Jerry Lee Lewis to Waylon Jennings and Tammy Wynette.Judge’s method follows Elmore Leonard’s tip: “Leave out the parts readers tend to skip.” He picks out the best stories from each person’s life: the funniest, the most tragic, the most bizarre. It’s like someone reading out to you the best bits of a celebrity’s biography, and it’s clear the show was made by someone who loves the subject. “I just wanted to totally nerd out, it’s true,” he says.Although Judge narrates each episode, the bulk of the narrative is told by the people who knew the musicians best – band members, childhood friends, relatives, all sharing their anecdotes. “Maybe because I’m the Beavis and Butt-Head guy, they told me stories maybe they didn’t tell Ken Burns.” Country Music, Burns’s documentary, was released last year. “So the whole thing took its shape from that.”For the second series, available to stream this week, Judge has switched to funk – a genre hardly lacking in good stories. “A lot of stuff I can’t remember because I was taking acid every day from 1968 until the end of the 70s,” says Bootsy Collins in his episode, and it’s a quote that could be the series’ maxim.The first episode focuses on George Clinton – and, while it’s tough to single out the best story about a musician who once blew all his money on a spaceship, Clinton himself retells one that must come close: the time Clinton and his band, Parliament, were driving to Ohio while tripping on LSD. Suddenly their car was surrounded by what looked like zombies. Clinton was so scared he lost control of his bladder. Only later did they find out they’d accidentally driven on to the set of Night of the Living Dead. “I still think that stuff was weird,” says Clinton, understandably.But Tour Bus isn’t merely laughing at whacked-out musicians. Anyone who mainly knows Rick James from his late-life appearances on Chappelle’s Show – where he turned himself into a comedy figure of excess with lines like, “Cocaine’s a helluva drug, heh heh heh” – should brace themselves for the genuinely haunting sadness of his story.“His was one of the toughest,” says Judge. “It’s always interesting when you’re watching a documentary and you go from laughing at someone to really feeling strong sympathy. That happened in the course of me doing the interviews. I didn’t go in thinking of any of the musicians as one-dimensional, but I also didn’t know the depths of their problems.”The extraordinary stories of superstars might seem an unlikely project for Judge, someone best known for writing about ordinary people and their ordinary workplace frustrations. Yet Tour Bus becomes exactly that: the episodes about Rick James and Morris Day are about their rivalries with a work colleague, who just happens to be Prince the episode about Bootsy Collins shows him laughing at his tyrannical boss, who just happens to be James Brown. “That’s the stuff that jumped out at me. These people – I grew up thinking of them as mythical superhuman rock stars. So, to hear their really human stories, to have them brought down to earth, that was really interesting.”Judge was born in Ecuador, where his father worked for a non-profit organisation. The family eventually moved back to the US and Judge majored in physics at the University of California because he was told he would always get work with a science degree. But the world of work quickly proved to be overrated.“The first time I got a job in an office. I thought, ‘Wow, this will be great’ – because I’d only ever worked at the fast food chain Jack in the Box and in construction. But then I was like, ‘This is not great – in fact, it might be worse.’ I was alphabetising purchase orders! So my brother, a friend who was a manager at Burger King and I started talking about the weirdness of workplaces.”And from that his first animated short, Milton’s Office Space, was born in 1991. It eventually became the film Office Space. A year later came another animated short, Frog Baseball, which became Beavis and Butt-Head. From there, as they say in documentaries about superstars, he never looked back, brilliantly satirising normal life.But will he still be able to make TV shows about normal life when normality has been so disrupted? “I was thinking about that earlier today,” he says. “I was watching a movie and every time people shook hands I was like, ‘Stop! Get away!’ So I think it will affect writing, and people will be forever moulded by it, the way they were with the Great Depression. I think we will return to some kind of normal, but it will never be entirely normal.”He pauses. “And that,” says the man who has made a living out of showing how abnormal normal really is, “could be kind of interesting.”• Season two of Mike Judge Presents: Tales from the Tour Bus is on Now TV from 15 April."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8dae6fd40c70c690a19b4cd4371757914b5f52b/0_178_6528_3918/master/6528.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f598fa78fa98098a7b708c490c676737","title":"bernie sanders joe biden irresponsible not support","story":"Sanders criticizes his supporters who have so far resisted his vow to do whatever it takes to help Biden win the presidencyBernie Sanders has warned that it would be “irresponsible” for his loyalists not to support Joe Biden, warning that progressives who “sit on their hands” in the months ahead would simply enable Donald Trump’s re-election in November.Sanders endorsed Biden on Monday and was quickly followed by the crucial endorsement on Tuesday by Barack Obama of his former vice-president.Meanwhile, Sanders, the 78-year-old Vermont senator confirmed that “it’s probably a very fair assumption” that he would not run for president again, after his failed attempts to win the Democratic nomination in 2016 and in this cycle. He added with a laugh, however, in an interview with the Associated Press: “One can’t predict the future.”Sanders suspended his presidential campaign last week, setting the stage for a November general election battle between two candidates, Trump and Biden, with radically different visions of presidential leadership and America’s role in the world. The contest will unfold in a political landscape transformed beyond all recognition by the coronavirus pandemic that has already claimed at least 14,000 American lives and nearly 10m jobs.On Tuesday night, Sanders criticized his own supporters who have so far resisted his vow to do whatever it takes to help Biden win the presidency.He seemed to distance himself from his campaign’s former national press secretary, Briahna Joy Gray, when asked about her recent statement on social media refusing to endorse Biden.“She is my former press secretary – not on the payroll,” Sanders noted. A spokesman later clarified that all campaign staffers were no longer on the payroll as of Tuesday, though they will get a severance check in May.Sanders said his supporters have a simple choice now that Biden has emerged as the presumptive nominee: “Do we be as active as we can in electing Joe Biden and doing everything we can to move Joe and his campaign in a more progressive direction? Or do we choose to sit it out and allow the most dangerous president in modern American history to get re-elected?”He continued: “I believe that it’s irresponsible for anybody to say, ‘Well, I disagree with Joe Biden’ – I disagree with Joe Biden! – ‘and therefore I’m not going to be involved.’”Sanders said he would not actively campaign or spend money on advertising in the primary contests that are still on the calendar in the coming months. But he still encouraged Democrats in those states to vote for him, hoping to amass as many delegates as possible for leverage to shape the party platform and the direction of Biden’s campaign.He also vowed to continue fighting for progressive priorities such as his signature “Medicare for All” as a senator, even though Biden has refused to embrace the government-backed single-payer healthcare system.“If people want to vote for me, we’d appreciate it,” Sanders said of the roughly 20 primary contests that remain where his name will appear on the ballot. He later added, “I think you’re going to see significant movement on the part of the Biden campaign into a more progressive direction on a whole lot of issues.”Upon gaining his endorsement on Monday, Biden said: “You’ve been the most powerful voice for a fair and more just America. You don’t get enough credit, Bernie, for being the voice that forces us to take a hard look in the mirror.”He continued: “If I am the nominee – which it looks like now you just made me – I really need you, not just to win the campaign but to govern.” Biden has previously said of Sanders’ most fervent supporters “I hear you.” But some progressives are concerned that he is paying lip service more than shifting to the left in his platform.Sanders did not outline any specific plans to begin helping Biden in earnest, though he noted that he held dozens of rallies for former Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton four years ago and would be at least as active for Biden.In the short term, he said he’s essentially “incarcerated in his home” because of coronavirus social distancing guidelines and did not know when he would return to the campaign trail."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9bf564630e839c242632b7d8e77224a86cc0653/0_154_3824_2294/master/3824.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af55910e63d8d98350ed8cf86aa316d4","title":"uk coronavirus rules autism learning disabilities lockdown","story":"People with learning disabilities or autism can leave the house for exercise more than once a day and can travel outside of their local area under current lockdown measures, the government has said.The guidance, which had previously stated that non-essential workers should only leave their homes once a day for exercise or to shop for basic necessities, was amended on Wednesday.Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, more than 40 million Americans relied on food banks to get enough to eat. Now, the demand for emergency food aid is growing exponentially as millions of people lose their jobs.\u0026nbspAs this demand grows, food banks are receiving far fewer donations from retailers as people are buying in bulk, so stocks are low. This means food banks must buy more supplies to make sure they have enough to feed every hungry American asking for help.The Feeding America network of 200 food banks secures and distributes 4.3 billion meals each year through 60,000 food pantries and meal programs. They help vulnerable communities including the elderly and disabled, as well as providing free nutritional lunches for school children from low-income families.If you want to help,\u0026nbspfind your local food bank, and go to their website to donate. You can also donate to Feeding America’s Covid-19 response fund.Food banks rely on volunteers, and Feeding America and food pantries across the US urgently need help as most regular volunteers are senior citizens who are particularly vulnerable to Covid-19. If you are interested in becoming a new volunteer, use\u0026nbspFeeding America’s tool to find your local food bank or pantry but please get in touch with them first before showing up. Remember, if you’re worried about your own health or the risk to a family member, “stay home” is the advice.Feeding America also says you can help in small ways like following your local food bank on social media and sharing what they are doing online, or by becoming an advocate for the fight to end hunger in America.The updated advice reads: “If you (or a person in your care) have a specific health condition that requires you to leave the home to maintain your health – including if that involves travel beyond your local area – then you can do so.“This could, for example, include where iniduals with learning disabilities or autism require specific exercise in an open space two or three times each day – ideally in line with a care plan agreed with a medical professional.”Although those with autism and mental health conditions are advised to limit their travel, and stay as close to their local area as possible, carers and support workers who do not live in their household can accompany them.The change comes after lawyers from Bindmans LLP and 39 Essex Chambers were asked for help by two families with children on the autistic spectrum.Bindmans said one of the children, whose conditions mean it was necessary for them to leave the house more than once a day for their wellbeing, was deliberately taken to a quiet location outside of their local area because of their particular needs.The firms argued that the “inflexible policy”, which also says people should stay two metres apart from anyone outside of their household, disproportionately impacted those with certain health conditions and was “therefore unlawful and discriminatory”.After the amendment was made to the guidance, one of the affected families said they were “delighted” they could support their son’s needs “without breaking the rules”.A spokesperson for the Cabinet Office said the most important action the public could take during the pandemic was to stay home to prevent the spread of Covid-19.But, it added: “We understand that this will be more difficult for some, that is why we clarified the guidance regarding the needs of those with specific health conditions such as learning disabilities or autism.”• Coronavirus and volunteering: how can I help in the UK?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/361da5fc018f712212f61a57e15a89a5793c2543/0_0_5603_3363/master/5603.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d47856b74409b862010d84bc45299f9","title":"angela merkel announces plans reopen schools shops germany coronavirus lockdown","story":"Plans to ease coronavirus lockdown prompt clashes among state premiers over timetableConservative politicians vying for the leadership of Angela Merkel’s party argued over a timetable to exit the nationwide lockdown as the German chancellor announced plans to partially reopen schools and shops in the coming weeks.Hailing latest figures indicating a slowing down of the infection rate as a “fragile intermediate success”, Merkel said on Wednesday evening that teaching at schools across the country would start again from 4 May, initially for students in their final years of primary or secondary school.Hairdressing salons will also be allowed to reopen on 4 May if they take special steps to guarantee customers’ hygiene. Shops of up to 800 square metres in size, as well as bookshops, bike stores and car dealerships, will open again from this coming Monday.Social distancing measures will remain in place until 3 May and large cultural events, such as concerts and beer festivals, will remain banned until the end of August.Merkel “urgently recommended” people to wear protective masks on public transport and while shopping, but stopped short of making them mandatory. “We have achieved something that wasn’t guaranteed,” the chancellor said. “Our health system has kept running”.However, under Germany’s federalised system the closure and reopening of schools and nurseries falls under the jurisdiction of the states or Länder, meaning any concerted exit strategy envisioned by Merkel requires a consensus among the 16 state premiers, which has been hard to achieve.Merkel stepped out in front of the cameras to make her announcement an hour and a half late following a video conference that reportedly involved clashes between the most powerful state premiers. Disagreements over the timetable for an exit route out of the lockdown have cut across German party line in unexpected ways.Until the crisis rewired the dynamics of German politics, Armin Laschet, the state premier of North-Rhine Westphalia, was seen as the frontrunner in a trio of male politicians vying to take over the leadership of Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union, and the closest option there was to a continuity candidate.But in the heated discussion over the timetable for relaxing the current restrictions on social movement, Laschet has at times found himself at odds with the chancellor whose decisions he loyally defended at the peak of the 2015 refugee crisis.On Tuesday this week German media reported that North-Rhine Westphalia was intending to start reopening schools as soon as next week, after the end of the Easter holidays – a unilateral move that put him at odds with the head of government. “Armin Laschet, the barger”, ran a headline in the Stuttgarter Zeitung newspaper.Merkel appeared to hint at her opposition to Laschet’s stance on Wednesday when she warned against “rushing ahead” to end the lockdown.Laschet has also been accused of trying to rush researchers into providing the scientific data to support his call for a speedy path out of the lockdown. A pioneering case study Laschet helped to commission of the Covid-19 outbreak in Heinsberg, a municipality on the Dutch border that has been described as “Germany’s Wuhan”, has gained much media attention but scientists question whether its findings can already be applied to the rest of the country.For the conservative premier of Bavaria, Markus Söder, the pandemic has boosted his national profile. The leader of the Christian Social Union, sister party to the CDU, is not officially in the running to fill the soon to be vacant seat at the top of Germany’s biggest political party, but his leadership has given him a reach that is historically unusual for politicians from Germany’s southernmost state, whose strong cultural identity and Catholic roots can make its public figures less relatable further north.As others dithered over lockdown measures, Söder took decisive steps to close down schools, bars and restaurants that the rest of the country eventually followed. One subsequent popularity ranking had the 53-year-old overtaking Merkel, making him Germany’s most popular politician for the first time.In a statement on Wednesday Söder was keen to remind the public of his achievements, noting that while Germany had coped with the pandemic better than other states across the world, “we should not forget that things could have been different if we have acted wrongly or too slowly”.The two remaining candidates aspiring to lead the CDU, the veteran rightwinger Friedrich Merz and the foreign policy expert Norbert Röttgen, have meanwhile struggled to build a profile as neither of them hold executive positions. Merz, who is popular with large parts of the membership, announced that he had been infected with Covid-19 on 17 March, but has reportedly since recovered."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7200859fb487792e1336e456cb1a1b0c126614c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c3503426875ecac8614c1ddb0a46742","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance 2m cases","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:The latest numbers from Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking the spread of the virus, put the confirmed global total of cases at 2,008,850. The researchers say at least 129,045 people have died since the start of the outbreak.The figures are being compiled from official releases and media reports from around the world. Due to suspected underreporting and differing testing regimes, the figures are likely to underestimate the true scale of the pandemic.G20 finance ministers agree to suspend poorer countries’ debt payments from 1 May until the end of the year as they prepare for increased spending on healthcare systems.The Department of Health and Social Care says a total of 12,868 people have now died in hospitals around the UK. The 761 new deaths announced on Wednesday represent a fall on the equivalent figure reported yesterday 778. The figure is likely to rise once deaths in other settings are taken into account.The chief medical officer for England, Prof Chris Whitty, says he thinks the death toll is probably reaching its peak, though high numbers of deaths will continue to occur.New York City has revised its death toll sharply upwards, to more than 10,000 people, adding 3,778 people who were not tested but who are nevertheless presumed to have died from Covid-19.The number of fatalities in Italy rises by 578 on Wednesday, 24 fewer than the increase seen on Tuesday, taking the death toll to 21,645.The European Union’s medicine regulator estimates it could take a year for a vaccine to be available for widespread use.

What have they learned – and is it enough to halt the pandemic?Coronaviruses have been causing problems for humanity for a long time. Several versions are known to trigger common colds and more recently two types have set off outbreaks of deadly illnesses: severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers).But their impact has been mild compared with the global havoc unleashed by the coronavirus that is causing the Covid-19 pandemic. In only a few months it has triggered lockdowns in dozens of nations and claimed more than 100,000 lives. And the disease continues to spread.That is an extraordinary achievement for a spiky ball of genetic material coated in fatty chemicals called lipids, and which measures 80 billionths of a metre in diameter. Humanity has been brought low by a very humble assailant.On the other hand, our knowledge about the Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, is also remarkable. This was an organism unknown to science five months ago. Today it is the subject of study on an unprecedented scale. Vaccines projects proliferate, antiviral drug trials have been launched and new diagnostic tests are appearing. The questions are therefore straightforward: what have we learned over the past five months and how might that knowledge put an end to this pandemic?The Sars-CoV-2 virus almost certainly originated in bats, which have evolved fierce immune responses to viruses, researchers have discovered. These defences drive viruses to replicate faster so that they can get past bats’ immune defences. In turn, that transforms the bat into a reservoir of rapidly reproducing and highly transmissible viruses. Then when these bat viruses move into other mammals, creatures that lack a fast-response immune system, the viruses quickly spread into their new hosts. Most evidence suggests that Sars-CoV-2 started infecting humans via an intermediary species, such as pangolins.“This virus probably jumped from a bat into another animal, and that other animal was probably near a human, maybe in a market,” says virologist Professor Edward Holmes of Sydney University. “And so if that wildlife animal has a virus it’s picked up from a bat and we’re interacting with it, there’s a good chance that the virus will then spread to the person handling the animal. Then that person will go home and spread it to someone else and we have an outbreak.”As to the transmission of Sars-CoV-2, that occurs when droplets of water containing the virus are expelled by an infected person in a cough or sneeze.Virus-ridden particles are inhaled by others and come into contact with cells lining the throat and larynx. These cells have large numbers of receptors – known as Ace-2 receptors – on their surfaces. (Cell receptors play a key role in passing chemicals into cells and in triggering signals between cells.) “This virus has a surface protein that is primed to lock on that receptor and slip its RNA into the cell,” says virologist Professor Jonathan Ball of Nottingham University.Once inside, that RNA inserts itself into the cell’s own replication machinery and makes multiple copies of the virus. These burst out of the cell, and the infection spreads. Antibodies generated by the body’s immune system eventually target the virus and in most cases halt its progress.“A Covid-19 infection is generally mild, and that really is the secret of the virus’s success,” adds Ball. “Many people don’t even notice they have got an infection and so go around their work, homes and supermarkets infecting others.”By contrast, Sars – which is also caused by a coronavirus – makes patients much sicker and kills about one in 10 of those infected. In most cases, these patients are hospitalised and that stops them infecting others – by cutting the transmission chain. Milder Covid-19 avoids that issue.Occasionally, however, the virus can cause severe problems. This happens when it moves down the respiratory tract and infects the lungs, which are even richer in cells with Ace-2 receptors. Many of these cells are destroyed, and lungs become congested with bits of broken cell. In these cases, patients will require treatment in intensive care.Even worse, in some cases, a person’s immune system goes into overdrive, attracting cells to the lungs in order to attack the virus, resulting in inflammation. This process can run out of control, more immune cells pour in, and the inflammation gets worse. This is known as a cytokine storm. (In Greek, “cyto” means cell and “kino” means movement.) In some cases, this can kill the patient.Just why cytokine storms occur in some patients but not in the vast majority is unclear. One possibility is that some people have versions of Ace-2 receptors that are slightly more vulnerable to attacks from the coronavirus than are those of most people.Doctors examining patients recovering from a Covid-19 infection are finding fairly high levels of neutralising antibodies in their blood. These antibodies are made by the immune system, and they coat an invading virus at specific points, blocking its ability to break into cells.“It is clear that immune responses are being mounted against Covid-19 in infected people,” says virologist Mike Skinner of Imperial College London. “And the antibodies created by that response will provide protection against future infections – but we should note that it is unlikely this protection will be for life.”Instead, most virologists believe that immunity against Covid-19 will last only a year or two. “That is in line with other coronaviruses that infect humans,” says Skinner. “That means that even if most people do eventually become exposed to the virus, it is still likely to become endemic – which means we would see seasonal peaks of infection of this disease. We will have reached a steady state with regard to Covid-19.”The virus will be with us for some time, in short. But could it change its virulence? Some researchers have suggested that it could become less deadly. Others have argued that it could mutate to become more lethal. Skinner is doubtful. “We have got to consider this pandemic from the virus’s position,” he says. “It is spreading round the world very nicely. It is doing OK. Change brings it no benefit.”In the end, it will be the development and roll-out of an effective vaccine that will free us from the threat of Covid-19, Skinner says.On Friday, the journal Nature reported that 78 vaccine projects had been launched round the globe – with a further 37 in development. Among the projects that are under way is a vaccine programme that is now in phase-one trials at Oxford University, two others at US biotechnology corporations and three more at Chinese scientific groups. Many other vaccine developers say they plan to start human testing this year.This remarkable response raises hopes that a Covid-19 vaccine could be developed in a fairly short time. However, vaccines require large-scale safety and efficacy studies. Thousands of people would receive either the vaccine itself or a placebo to determine if the former were effective at preventing infection from the virus which they would have encountered naturally. That, inevitably, is a lengthy process.As a result, some scientists have proposed a way to speed up the process – by deliberately exposing volunteers to the virus to determine a vaccine’s efficacy. “This approach is not without risks but has the potential to expedite candidate vaccine testing by many months,” says Nir Eyal, a professor of bioethics at Rutgers University.Volunteers would have to be young and healthy, he stresses: “Their health would also be closely monitored, and they would have access to intensive care and any available medicines.” The result could be a vaccine that would save millions of lives by being ready for use in a much shorter time than one that went through standard phase three trials.But deliberately infecting people – in particular volunteers who would be given a placebo vaccine as part of the trial – is controversial. “This will have to be thought through very carefully,” says Professor Adam Finn of Bristol University. “Young people might jump at the opportunity to join such a trial but this is a virus that does kill the odd young person. We don’t know why yet. However, phase-three trials are still some way off, so we have time to consider the idea carefully.”• This article was amended on 12 April 2020.

The new, assertive brand of diplomacy is favoured not only by younger diplomats but also by the Chinese ministry of foreign affairs. Wolf Warrior is a 2015 action film popular in China.The controversy follows a series of acerbic anonymous posts on the Paris embassy’s website, ascribed to a Chinese diplomat, culminating in an article saying: “Residents of retirement homes were made to sign certificates of ‘waiver of emergency care’ the nursing staff of the Ehpad abandoned their posts overnight, deserted collectively, leaving their residents to die of hunger and disease.”The use of the French acronym Ehpad (Établissement d’hébergement pour personnes âgées dépendantes) left no doubt China was referring to France. But the French press say the Chinese claim may refer to an article, directed at Spain, in the Ouest-France newspaper. The account also denounced western politicians for advocating “herd immunity”, saying they had abandoned their citizens to a viral massacre.France has worked hard to improve relations with China, which has sent it masks, so had been reluctant to trade insults.Explaining the summons, the French foreign office said: “Some recent public statements by representatives of the Chinese embassy in France do not conform to the quality of the bilateral relationship between our two countries.”China has been embroiled in Twitter disputes not only in Europe, but in Khazakstan, Iran, Pakistan and Singapore. It has also argued with the Brazilian education minister over statements that Beijing planned world domination.In Sri Lanka, the Chinese embassy’s Twitter account has only just been restored after it was shut down for allegedly being inflammatory. The reopened account said: “When westerners publish their opinions, it’s called freedom of speech, no matter how false. When Chinese say something different from them, it’s called a disinformation campaign. Hilarious double standards.”In the Netherlands, the Chinese embassy accused the newspaper Volkskrant of running far-fetched and malicious stories. And in India, the Chinese spokesman tweeted that a call for his country to offer compensation for coronavirus was “ridiculous \u0026amp eyeball-catching nonsense”. China’s new assertiveness marks a break not only from traditional diplomacy, but from the country’s advocacy of non-intervention in the affairs of other states.Although most Chinese embassy channels defend China’s handling of the pandemic, and detail its generosity in supplying protective equipment, they also sometimes promote conspiracy theories about the source of the outbreak. It is part of a new “fighting spirit” demanded of diplomats in a memo last year by the president, Xi Jinping.The new head of the foreign ministry’s information department, Hua Chunying, last year lamented the lack of that spirit among China’s diplomats and said that in a chaotic world, with deepening rivalries, Beijing had to do more to get its case across.China says it is no longer taking criticism – such as the daily outpourings on Twitter from Donald Trump – lying down, and is legitimately defending its corner in the same way as the west, or indeed Russia. Not all Chinese diplomats approve, however, with the ambassador to Washington, Cui Tiankai, saying claims promoted by some official Chinese channels that the US marines planted the virus in China were “crazy”.In the UK, the Chinese ambassador, Liu Xiaoming, is steering a middle course. He has previously held press conferences to denounce British media criticism of China’s handling of the Hong Kong protests, and the embassy website is full of his letters to the British press, including the , challenging its stories and denouncing anti-Chinese bias. However, he has not criticised Britain’s response to coronavirus.The question is whether China is using official accounts to promote conspiracy theories. Yun Sun, a co-director of the Washington-based thinktank the Stimson Centre, testifying before the Canadian parliament, said: “What we have witnessed with Chinese foreign policy is an assiduous attempt to break away from the western discourse and re-establishment of the traditional Chinese model of hegemonic stability.”She said she had no doubt the conspiracy theories were authorised from the top."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32d28f618f4fb2a05969eeaf19be392ebf1d099a/0_318_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7245e3ff4cf710f765a38e0fdf85ee01","title":"glastonbury ponchos repurposed ppe coronavirus","story":"Festival donates thousands of garments to hospitals in south-west EnglandGlastonbury festival has confirmed it donated “several thousand” ponchos to hospitals in the south-west of England, which have been searching for alternatives to personal protective equipment (PPE) as supplies run out across the country.Emily Eavis, co-organiser, told the  via a spokesperson that the festival, which cancelled its 2020 edition because of the pandemic, had given the disposable garments to “hospitals in the West Country” as PPE stocks dwindle.Eavis confirmed the claim that had been circulating on social media that a “large well-known summer festival” was asked if it had “any ponchos going spare”, because the NHS could not source enough aprons and PPE.The news will add pressure on the government as it attempts to fulfil the demand for PPE from NHS and care workers, after reports that the UK missed three opportunities to be part of an EU scheme to bulk-buy masks, gowns and gloves.In the Downing Street press conference at 2pm on Wednesday, a spokesman implied that EU rules were partly to blame for VAT being charged on PPE.The spokesman added that the Health and Safety Executive and Public Health England were looking at how rules could be relaxed to allow some PPE items to be reused, after reports that some hospitals have already begun cleaning single-use gowns to preserve stocks.The health secretary, Matt Hancock, was criticised by doctors’ and nurses’ leaders after he urged NHS staff last week not to overuse PPE. “We need everyone to treat PPE like the precious resource it is,” he said on Friday. “Everyone should use the equipment they clinically need, in line with the guidelines: no more and no less.”Frontline staff have cited a shortage of PPE, such as gowns, since the pandemic started, with the Health Care Supply Association issuing a warning of “serious supply issues” regarding PPE in hospitals as far back as the end of March.Glastonbury festival confirmed on 18 March that the event – which would have celebrated its 50th anniversary year in 2020 with headliners including Taylor Swift, Paul McCartney and Kendrick Lamar – was off.The festival had taken a business-as-usual approach until only a few days before cancelling, but said “following the new government measures… and in times of such unprecedented uncertainty – this is now our only viable option”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03007fc77f14028518d76c40e2dec57703245b81/658_142_3677_2206/master/3677.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ccb0e0fefe3282c9f63cbe32cb3400d","title":"hundreds of students in uk sign up to rent strike","story":"Students protest about being trapped in accommodation due to coronavirusHundreds of university students have signed up to a rent strike in protest at having to pay thousands of pounds for accommodation where they have become trapped as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.Many have complained they are stuck on near-deserted campuses where facilities and services have closed. Others say they cannot afford to pay because they have lost jobs vital to fund their living costs during their studies.Among those caught up in the lockdown are international students from countries across the globe, including China, Japan, Pakistan, India and the US, who are stranded thousands of miles away from their families.“We are stuck between a rock and a hard place,” said Jamsheed Cooper, a 27-year-old masters student, who is stranded in his £650-a-month student accommodation on the Sussex University campus, unable to get home to Dubai. He is one of about 150 supporting the rent strike at Sussex.“I’ve decided to withhold my rent. We can’t leave even if we wanted to. Almost all the campus services are absolutely closed. What are we paying for? The cleaners are not even coming. It’s a ghost town right now.”Also stuck in the East Slope accommodation block at Sussex and withholding his rent is George Grammer-Taylor, 23, a first-year law undergraduate, who lost his job in a seafront bar and is now relying on savings to survive.“I’m refusing to pay because it almost feels like forced imprisonment,” he said. “There’s nothing I can do. There’s just nothing on campus. It’s desolate. A lot of people are struggling. I just feel there’s no support for students when this should be the time when the university is supporting us the most. I’m very disappointed.”A University of Sussex spokesperson said students were told in March that rental payments for the final term would not apply for those who were no longer living on campus, costing the institution more than than £5m in lost rent.While many students were able to get out, others found themselves caught by the lockdown restrictions after the universities minister, Michelle Donelan, wrote to them urging them to stay put and not attempt to travel.While all teaching has moved online at Sussex, around a fifth of student residents have stayed on campus. “Providing these students with the many services required to enable them to live on campus and support their welfare at this very difficult time has, and will continue to be, our overwhelming priority,” the spokesperson said.The university said reception and security services were available 247, as well as catering, a supermarket, wellbeing services and regular cleaning and maintenance: “We do appreciate this is an extremely unsettling time for our students on campus and we wish their time at Sussex could be different. We hope that our students know we will continue to do everything we can to respond to their needs.”Elsewhere, students living in privately owned accommodation are finding themselves tied into tenancy agreements costing thousands of pounds, even though many have travelled home to be with their families during the Covid-19 crisis.Students at the University of Warwick have also started a rent strike. While the university has waived rent and cancelled contracts for students renting on campus, many of those renting off-campus from private landlords are still obliged to pay, though many of the rentals will have been arranged via the university’s property management agency. A Facebook group in support of the strike has gathered more than 650 members.Second-year management student Alfie Brepotra told the student newspaper, the Boar: “Student tenants are already in a precarious position where it is easy for landlords to manipulate us and this crisis only highlights that, especially for working-class students and those who rely on part-time work who are now temporarily unemployed.”A Warwick University spokesperson responded: “Off-campus renting during the current situation continues to present complex challenges to everyone concerned.“Our principal and immediate focus is on student hardship, ensuring that students with real financial support needs can access the support they need through the university’s students hardship scheme, rather than taking any other action that could lead them into potentially costly, and lengthy, legal disputes, particularly with private sector landlords.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/941c3576c79a9927e56f3f3dea28feccf8142e47/0_111_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=f833036ad443ceddb3fd7fc8ea267a5b","title":"our caring medical staff deserve better","story":"Readers respond to junior doctor Rosie Hughes’ moving article, and demand answers for the lack of personal protective equipment What a wonderfully caring article by Rosie Hughes (‘I feel fear and guilt’: an NHS junior doctor on the effect of getting Covid-19, 14 April).

Before casting their vote, they underwent a temperature check, sanitised their hands and put on disposable plastic gloves.Election officials in masks escorted voters who failed the temperature check or who were not wearing a mask to separate polling booths, sanitising the facilities afterwards. About 13,000 people under self-quarantine because of the virus were allowed to vote immediately after the polls closed at 6pm local time (1000 BST) provided they had no symptoms.The elections were held as fresh infections continued to fall. South Korea reported 27 new cases on Wednesday, the sixth day in a row they have stayed below 50, bringing the total to 10,591 with 222 deaths, according to the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.The president, Moon Jae-in, is expected to receive a boost amid widespread support for his response to the crisis. His administration’s focus on aggressive testing, tracking infected people, physical distancing and mask wearing have been credited with keeping the number of infections and deaths lower than in China, the US and parts of Europe.Moon’s Democratic party of Korea and its smaller affiliate were projected to win between 155 and 178 seats in the 300-seat assembly, according to an exit poll by the public broadcaster KBS. The conservative opposition United Future party and its smaller sister party were forecast to win 107 to 130 seats.“We are going through difficult times, but the coronavirus and politics are two different things,” said a Seoul resident, Lee Kum. Another, Chung Eun-young, said she had arrived at the polling station just after it opened at 6am to avoid crowds.“I was worried about the coronavirus,” Chung said. “They checked my temperature and handed me gloves, but it wasn’t as troublesome as I had expected. I don’t like what we are going through, but I cast my ballot to prevent the wrong candidates from getting elected.”Before the outbreak, observers had expected Moon’s party to struggle, with job creation, wages and North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme dominating the political agenda.Kim Ki-chul, 33, said the recent drop in the number of new Covid-19 cases had encouraged him to come out and vote.“Compared to the way the epidemic has been handled in other countries, South Korea showed outstanding disinfecting and containment capabilities, and that has increased my trust in the government,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91033192a5896a7dcd41966ba598f717aa984fef/0_120_5118_3070/master/5118.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=447bbf4686e2c66b93b206e8ee05e1e3","title":"top academies head calls for date to be set to reopen schools","story":"Government urged to end speculation as national primary school offer day loomsThe head of England’s most successful academy trust has called on the government to set a date for the reopening of schools, as parents across England anticipate national offer day for primary schools.Hamid Patel, chief executive of Star Academies, which runs a string of outstanding state schools in London, Birmingham, Manchester and other cities, said setting a date would provide a sense of purpose and put a stop to the distraction of endless speculation.He was speaking on the eve of national offer day, when parents across England find out if their child has got a place at their primary school of choice for this September. This year it has been overshadowed by the continuing uncertainty about when schools will reopen following the Covid-19 lockdown.“Confirmation of a date will of course be subject to medical advice – but having a date in mind is essential,” said Patel. “This could either be in mid-May or immediately after May half-term.“Setting a date will provide a clear sense of purpose and avoid the confusion and distraction of endless speculation. People will be more likely to maintain compliance with social distancing measures if there is an end point in sight.”There has been increasing speculation about when schools will reopen. The government has already had to clarify they will not open straight after the Easter holidays, while some school leaders have suggested a return in July for a few weeks before the school holidays are due to start.A number of ministers are reported to be pushing for a much earlier date, suggesting that younger pupils should be allowed to return to school as early as 11 May to enable other lockdown restrictions to be relaxed.The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, calling for the government to set out its plans for lifting the lockdown, said he thought reopening schools and mass testing should be among the first priorities.The government has said it will only reopen schools when the scientific evidence says it is safe to do so. Ministers will, however, be watching other countries closely as they grapple with the same dilemma. In Denmark, where there have been far fewer deaths and lower rates of infection, children up to the age of 11 are returning to nurseries and schools this week.Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, suggested a phased approach to reopening, with certain year groups going back first. “The reality is that a vaccination against Covid-19 could be 18 months or more away. So, we are going to need an interim plan,” he said.“That could be built around social distancing measures – such as limiting class sizes and staggering break times, the use of protective equipment such as face masks, and regular cleaning of premises.”Commenting on national offer day, Paul Whiteman, general secretary of National Association of Head Teachers, which represents the majority of primary school leaders, said: “It is vital that no child going through the primary admissions process this year should be disadvantaged.“For those families not getting their first choice of school, the appeals process will be going ahead, albeit virtually. This process must be as robust as ever and be made clear to parents.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d3cfbda2a7a0fcb476054adbb4d9c2af05872ec/0_5_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8e47c6f0eb4865ff1b3d69ff20dcaac","title":"how are you affected by coronavirus in the south west of the uk","story":"If you live in the south-west England or Wales, we’d like to find out about the impact of coronavirus on you and your community.

Photograph: iStockOne in five secondary school children do not have reliable broadband and face major challenges with remote learning, a new survey indicates.The poll of more than 3,600 parents was carried out by the National Parents Council post-primary earlier this month.While the vast majority of students are in contact with teachers and receiving assignments, the findings indicate at least 15 per cent of young people are not receiving any feedback.The vast majority of students are using a combination of text books and digital tools to learn and complete assignments.School email is the most popular mechanism of communication, with text messaging services and WhatsApp also commonly used.However, up to 20 per cent of parents surveyed say do not have reliable broadband available in their household.In addition, some 30 per cent say they experience issues with connectivity such as poor speeds and intermittent service.“Broadband at the moment is very slow and breaks down quite frequently as we live in a rural area and infrastructure in the area is not capable of providing a full service as everyone is on internet,” said one parent who was surveyed.Another commented: “Sometimes the broadband strength is too weak so my son walks up the road where he can get a 4G signal and sends the work on his phone.”Primary and secondary schools across the country closed last month as part of the Government’s effort to curb the spread of coronavirus, also known as Covid-19.Most parents (79 per cent) said no difficulties had arisen in communication with schools. Where there were difficulties, most reported that these issues had since been addressed.Parents also indicated that most students have unlimited access to their devices (80 per cent).Of those with limited access, most still used their devices for more than five hours per day.In unprompted comments, many parents said they felt students with additional needs such as dyslexia were suffering from a lack of structure, routine and support.Some also felt the volume of work being sent to their children was overwhelming, with children spending up to five or six hours on homework.However, others were very complimentary and said schools and teachers had provided “incredible” supports.In its recommendations, the council calls for efforts to be placed into ensuring that all students have the means necessary to work efficiently at home, including appropriate devices and broadband coverage.It also highlights the need for inidualised supports for students with special or additional needs to ensure that they are not disproportionately affected by school closures.Responding to the survey, Fianna Fáil’s education spokesman Thomas Byrne called for increased supports for pupils home-schooling without access to broadband.“The ongoing school closures have resulted in a large-scale unplanned migration to distance learning,” he said.“While it is welcome that this survey indicates that the vast majority of students are in contact with teachers, and that our education system is responding to this new way of working, it also indicates a number of areas in which we need to urgently improve.”"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

On March 28th, the HSE introduced cocooning measuresPeople at risk who have been advised to cocoon will not face criminal sanction if they venture out, the Department of Health has confirmed. On March 28th the Health Service Executive (HSE) introduced cocooning measures for those over 70 and patients under that age who are organ transplant recipients, cancer survivors or have a serious respiratory condition such as cystic fibrosis, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The HSE has “strongly advised” those in the at risk category stay at home and not leave in any circumstances. They should get others to deliver their shopping and arrange for medications to be left outside the door. The measures have now being extended until May 5th at the earliest. The Government has passed the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020, which contains provisions to fine or imprison those who do not obey an order from a garda if that garda believes the person is making an unnecessary journey outside a two kilometre zone from their home. There was no provision in the act to sanction those the HSE believes ought to be cocooning and are not. Nevertheless, many people believed it was illegal to go out if you were over 70, with charities who work with elderly people saying it had created confusion.The Department of Health has responded that the position on cocooning is “advisory” and not mandatory and is there to protect vulnerable people. A spokeswoman added, however, that those over the age of 70 are subject to the laws about non-essential travel as everybody else is during the Covid-19 pandemic. Age Action spokeswoman Celine Clarke said elderly people are finding it increasingly difficult to cope with the cocooning. Many of them were self-isolating before the advisory was issued. “The prolonged nature of the cocooning is really taking its toll on people and they are saying that they are just going to go outside and do their shopping,” she said. “We can see from people who contact us that their level of frustration is growing. Lots of people who are over 70 are fit and healthy, and they are finding it very difficult to maintain their physicality and their health.” Alone chief executive Seán Moynihan said even fit elderly people are vulnerable to Covid-19. “In our experience there is a percentage of elderly people who are taking the odd walk, but I think after the shock and the adjustment of it, I think a lot of elderly people understand that the health services and the community are trying to protect them. “For us, it is too early to lift any of this because we don’t know when the peak will come.” However, he also acknowledged the prolonged lockdown is becoming increasingly difficult for elderly people living on their own. He added: “We recognise that the extension of the Covid-19 measures which have been put in place is vital and will no doubt save lives. It is in their own best interest. “However, we also know that the next three weeks will be very difficult for older people and the support of our communities and families will be more important than ever throughout this time.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4229452.1586948485!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus hse staff can re deploy to private nursing homes under new deal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNursing homes have been particuarly hard hit by the Covid-19 pandemic.Existing HSE staff can be re-deployed on a voluntary basis to work in private nursing homes affected by the coronavirus pandemic under an agreement reached between the health authority and trade unions.Nursing homes have been particuarly hard hit by the current Covid-19 pandemic. A total of 167 people in nursing homes have died after contracting the virus.The new agreement says moving existing HSE staff to private nursing homes should be “an absolute last resort having exhausted all other options and ensured that the private provider has exhausted every available avenue to source staff”. It says this “must be demonstrative in writing and strictly policed by the public service” and that deployment of existing health service personnel should not “create unacceptable risk or service impairment in the public sector service and staff cannot be left short staffed in public facilities”. The agreement between the HSE and trade unions on the initiative says that staff who volunteered to work in private nursing homes “ should be given the option to be assigned to a facility and reserve the right to refuse same”“. A refusal to a specific redeployment by a volunteer to the register will not constitute a ground for the use of the disciplinary procedure, it says. Siptu said on Wednesday that under the new deal a register of volunteer staff will be established.It said volunteers to work in private nursing homes would come from across the nursing, health care assistant, cleaning, chef and catering assistant disciplines.Siptu health ision organiser Paul Bell said: “Our members want to help deal with the increasing clusters of the virus among the most vulnerable service users in the nursing home sector in their catchment area. However, until now, there was no policy or protocol for members asked to provide assistance to private nursing homes which are not under the governance of the HSE.”He said that under the new agreement with the HSE the re-deployment of Siptu members would be strictly on a voluntary basis. He said a register of volunteers would be set up in each community health area in the HSE.“Volunteers will come from across the nursing, health care assistant, cleaning, chef and catering assistant disciplines. Our members will remain completely under the management of the HSE and will be assigned for agreed periods of time. They will also be provided with an adequate supply of personal protecgtive quipment (PPE) for their tasks.”Tony Fitzpatrick, director of industrial relations with the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation told RTÉ radio’s Today with Sean O’Rourke programme that agreement had been reached that in an emergency situation public sector staff would work in private nursing homes to ensure patients are cared for.There have been situations in private nursing homes where there are no staff to work particular shifts due to illness or availability, he said.All unions working together had reached an “historical” agreement for redeployment across HSE and Section 38 hospitals and facilities as well as for a massive redeployment in community assessment hubs, he said.Mr Fitzpatrick said it showed that it “falls back on the public sector to bail out other sectors” and that massive public funding of public healthcare would be needed “down the road.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4229667.1586964763!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government says no truth to social media rumours about pubs re opening","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe public health advice issued last Friday by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar that the Covid-19 restrictions would remain in place until May 5th remains the government’s position. File photgraph: Getty ImagesThe Government has denied reports circulating on social media that Tánaiste Simon Coveney has met with vintners and told them there will be a phased re-opening of pubs.A spokesman for Mr Coveney said the report, which was circulating on WhatsApp groups throughout Munster, was totally false and there was no truth at all to the suggestion that pubs were set to re-open on a phased basis.The spokesman said Mr Coveney had not met vintners in the past week and the Government was trying to establish how the story had started or where it had originated.He said the public health advice issued last Friday by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar that the Covid-19 restrictions would remain in place until May 5th at least remains the government’s position. Mr Varadkar thanked the Irish people for their forbearance in the effort to stop the spread of Covid-19. “People are wondering when life will get back to normal. We are working toward that, planning carefully, so we get there safely. No one knows for certain when that will be . . . all we can do is take one day at a time,” The Taoiseach said.Mr Coveney’s spokesman said the only place to get reliable news regarding the Covid-19 restrictions was from the National Public Health Emergency Team and the established media, not from Whatsapp groups.The closure order, which came into effect on March 15th, has led to thousands of bar staff being laid off with many vintners saying that it has put them under pressure in terms of meeting rent and other payments.The enforced closure prompted the Vintners Federation of Ireland (VFI) to ask landlords to meet their tenants and come to a mutually acceptable agreement about rent payments during the shutdown.VFI chief executive Padraig Cribben said the shutdown was putting huge pressure on many of the State’s 7,000 publicans, who do not own their own premises but are renting them from landlords who are still seeking rent.“Since the enforced shutdown we have worked with the banks, TV subscription services, drink suppliers and other suppliers to come to an agreement about forbearance and payment suspension for the coming months.”Mr Cribben said the clear majority of banks, TV service providers and drink suppliers have agreed to work with publicans and suspend payment for the coming months while the lockdown remains in place.“We need landlords to exercise the same understanding because there is little point in demanding money that isn’t there. We need to work together to get through the current crisis,” he said.

Photograph: Alan BetsonThe  It is a measure of the times we live in that the announcement of the agreement by the leaders of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil to bring proposals for coalition to their parties was the second, third or fourth item on news bulletins last night.No need to say what came before it. Yet the agreement by Leo Varadkar and Micheál Martin yesterday – albeit only the latest of a series of slow steps towards the goal of a “grand” coalition – is a truly historic move, a testament to how much Irish politics has changed and is changing before our eyes.Neither party likes it much that is the truth. They can see the electoral pitfalls, like everyone else. Martin in particular will face some difficult battles with his party to secure its agreement, though he would not be promoting something he did not believe could gain acceptance, and that means that Fianna Fáil expects to occupy the Taoiseach’s office first. Other key aspects of how the government will work, including at the very centre, must also have been agreed.To many on the outside, this will appear as a last desperate bid by the old duopoly to keep their grip on power. Inside, it will look very different. It will look like a historic compromise, putting aside of age-old differences in the public interest. Never mind for a moment that those differences are less visible to the outside to the two parties, those differences matter. Their leaders will present it as a political sacrifice – perhaps of their parties – in the public interest. Take them at their word if you like, or don’t. Either way, my guess is they will be judged on their deeds, and on their results in government.All those who voted for “change” (whatever it meant to them) at the February election will complain that the FF-FG alliance is cheating the country of the change it demanded that will be a cacophonous chorus indeed. Were they minded to take a broader view, the change-istas could equally interpret it as evidence of the revolution they have wrought on Irish politics in the 2020 election. The last redoubt of the old system has fallen.Depending on where you stand, the substance of the agreement between the two parties is more important than the symbolism. What the new government does, after all, is less important than who is in it.‘Substantial change’There is little to go on, ahead of the presentation of the agreed principles to the respective parliamentary parties today. There will be fine words about a new approach – “a very substantial change”, according to one person involved – to health and housing, to climate action, and “a new agenda for public service”.It identifies a number of “missions” for the next government, and promises a “new social contract”.It will, in the words of another person involved in the process, be “more left-wing than the Sinn Féin manifesto”, but will contain little by way of specifics about how to achieve its goals – “or how to pay for them”, says another source.This is partly because that minor detail has yet to be figured out. But it is also designed to leave room for the three smaller parties – the Greens, Social Democrats and Labour – to shape the eventual detailed programme, if they can be persuaded to join the talks. Though there is little expectation in Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil that they will.Instead, the two old parties are likely to find themselves explaining why they continue to exclude Sinn Féin from a government that draws on so many of that party’s policies. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael will not bend on that, though. It means that if they are to do this thing, they will likely do it alone.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4229628.1586973515!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"smaller parties offer cautious response to ff fg coalition proposals","story":"Smaller parties have reacted cautiously to the publication of a joint policy framework agreed between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil during talks on forming a coalition government.Green Party TDs, MEPs and Senators are to meet on Thursday to discuss the party’s response to the proposals but two party sources indicated that they believe there are grounds to enter into talks with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.“This will be considered fully, seriously, without prejudice and with an open mind,” one source said. However, there are isions within the Green Party on whether its 12 TDs should enter a coalition with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.The document, published on Wednesday afternoon, outlines 10 key “missions” for the next government and says the “overriding focus” of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael would be to improve the “wellbeing” of Irish people and society.Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael intend to approach smaller parties such as Labour, the Greens and the Social Democrats in the days ahead to see if the document can form the basis for further discussions on a programme for government.Between them the two parties have 72 Dáil seats, eight short of a majority, and both have said they want a third, smaller party and some Independents in a coalition government.‘Uncosted’Labour Party leader Alan Kelly said the framework was “uncosted” and “purely aspirational” but he welcomed the fact that the parties had come around to “a different way of thinking”. Mr Kelly, whose party has six TDs, said the document “fails to mention any concrete timelines or when any of the mooted ideas would be delivered”.“I welcome that in both parties coming together to draft this document, that they have come around to a different way of thinking on a new social contract and other social democratic policies,” he said. “The Labour Parliamentary Party will appraise this document over the coming days.”The Social Democrats, which has six TDs, said the document is “portrayed as some kind of radical change of direction but on first reading it appears disappointing”.“It is vague and for the most part simply repeats existing government policy and commitments previously made and not delivered upon,” the party said in a statement, which added that the proposals “lack timelines, costings and clear targets”.However, it said it was “welcome that both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are acknowledging that there is a need for a change in direction”.“The current crisis has highlighted the need for far greater investment in public services, healthcare, housing and action on climate change. But actions must speak louder than words,” it added.“We will take a detailed look at the document and give a further reaction in the coming days.”‘Vague promises’Sinn Féin, which Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are refusing to enter government with, described the framework as a list of “vague promises, the aim of which is to keep Sinn Féin out of government and hoodwink people into thinking they will deliver change”.Deputy leader Pearse Doherty said: “The reality is that most what is in this document will never see the light of day.”The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4229765.1586968814!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"czech republic unveils lockdown exit strategy as it declares victory over covid 19","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Health workers wearing protective face masks watch a member of the contemporary circus company Cirk La Putyka perform at the courtyard of a hospital in Prague, Czech Republic. Photograph: Martin DivisekEPAThe Czech Republic has unveiled detailed plans for a phased reopening of businesses and schools, after becoming one of the first countries in Europe to declare that it had brought the coronavirus outbreak under control.The Czech government imposed a state of emergency on March 12th in response to the Covid-19 pandemic and shut down borders, schools, pubs and restaurants and most shops, and made it mandatory for the country’s 10.6 million people to wear face masks in public spaces.Officials say those swift and sweeping measures and extensive testing helped curb the infection rate: the country has registered a total of 6,151 sufferers of the Covid-19 virus, 163 of whom have died 82 new cases were confirmed on Wednesday.Bike shops and DIY stores reopened before the Easter weekend and, despite signs of a rise in people flouting mask-wearing and social-distancing rules, the government has now laid out a timetable for relaunching the economy and schools.Farmers’ markets and car showrooms will be among the first to get back to business on April 20th, when weddings involving up to 10 people will also be permitted. Other shops will gradually be allowed to resume trading depending on their size, with shopping centres the last to reopen on June 8th.That is when cinemas, theatres, hotels, restaurants, cafes and bars will also reopen fully, though it will be legal to serve food and drink in Czech beer gardens and other outdoor areas from May 25th.Cultural, sports and other events involving up to 50 people will also be allowed from June 8th, as will larger weddings providing health rules are observed.Universities will partially reopen for final-year students on April 20th and schools and colleges will allow students preparing for final exams to attend classes from May 11th, with exams to be held from June. Younger pupils will be able to return on May 25th but attendance will not be compulsory.Continuing measures“We have the pandemic under control, we have prevented its uncontrolled spread . . . the situation is positive,” said Czech health minister Adam Vojtech. He emphasised that the timetable could be adjusted according to how the outbreak evolved, and that Czechs must continue to wear face masks. “We agreed that we would not set any date for lifting this obligation,” he said after a government meeting on Tuesday. “From our point of view, the face masks have proved to be a very important measure.”Mr Vojtech also said hospitals could start to return to providing regular services, after the Czech health system coped well with the Covid-19 outbreak.Since Tuesday Czechs can go abroad for important trips and must observe a fortnight’s quarantine on their return, but Mr Vojtech warned that “non-essential travel may not be possible even in summer.“It will depend on the situation in other countries. We do not want to give predictions without an expert opinion. We are talking about the last relaxation, and certainly it won’t happen earlier than in June. Moreover, under some conditions.”Neighbouring Poland plans to ease restrictions on some shops from Sunday, as it prepares to hold a controversial presidential election on May 10th that government critics say cannot be conducted safely and fairly during a pandemic.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4229810.1586971893!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"germany agrees cautious liberalisation of lockdown","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tChancellor Angela Merkel, minister for finance Olaf Scholz, Bavarian prime minister Markus Soeder and Hamburg mayor Peter Tschentscher at the chancellery in Berlin on Wednesday. Photograph: Bernd von JutrczenkaReuters Germany has agreed a staggered reopening of shops and schools and recommended the use of face masks in public – while extending movement restrictions to contain the spread of coronavirus.After heated discussion with Germany’s 16 federal state leaders, chancellor Angela Merkel announced that shops with floor space up to 800sq m can open their doors next Monday.\u0026nbsp All retailers will be obliged to devise plans to avoid clusters of customers and long queues outside their doors.While kindergartens remain closed, some school classes will follow on May 4th, but only if distancing rules can be maintained in breaks and on school buses.Germany’s federal government and states have issued an “urgent recommendation” for citizens to wear simple face masks in public, without following Austria’s example to make them obligatory.Restaurants, bars, hotels, shopping centres and other places where larger groups congregate will remain shut. Large events remain banned until August 31st and citizens have been asked to avoid any unnecessary travel.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp‘Fragile success’In two weeks’ time German politicians will review the virus infection rate under the looser lockdown and, if necessary, tighten up again. “This is a fragile intermediate success,” said Dr Merkel. “We don’t have much wriggle room and have to proceed carefully, we’re living with the virus as long as there is no vaccine.”To date Germany has 130,618 recorded coronavirus cases, of which 72,600 are classified as recovered. Nearly 3,500 have died to date and rates of infection and spread have been slowed.But Dr Merkel warned that even a small upward tick could overwhelm the country’s intensive care system by late summer.Different infection rates combined with regional state competences for health and education have complicated Germany’s easing of restrictions. State leaders clashed in a video conference on Wednesday over the pace and ambition of new rules.Bavarian leader Markus Södersaid it was important than Germany maintain its strategy of caution. Bavaria has a higher infection rate of 35,000 cases and nearly 1,000 deaths.“We acted differently to other countries, we acted quickly and remained consequential,” he said. “We think the greatest danger is to see good figures and think normality can simply return.”Germany will maintain controls it imposed last month on its borders with Austria, France, Luxembourg, Denmark and Switzerland.After a blanket ban on religious services over Easter, Dr Merkel said she was anxious to allow a return to religious services and announced talks with faith leaders to reduce infection risks.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons april 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178 Coronavirus latest news: Matt Hancock announces social care plan as government tries to tackle care homes crisisAustralian hoarder unable to return £5,000 of sanitary goods after failing to sell them onlineShoppers treating trip to supermarket \u0026#39like a day out\u0026#39, says shop workerMatt Hancock grants close relatives of coronavirus victims chance to say goodbye Pregnant nurse who tested positive for Covid-19 dies after doctors manage to save her babyComment: Save the country from a deadly pandemic... and win tonight’s incredible star prizePrince Harry and Meghan £90,000 wedding profit donated to British coronavirus relief charityLen McCluskey condemns \u0026#39cruel and rancid\u0026#39 anti-Corbynite culture in Labour partyBoris Johnson recovering from coronavirus at Chequers – latest newsHow does a coronavirus antibody home test kit work, and how do I get one?Germany to open shops from next week but other restrictions remainWhat essential shops are open during the coronavirus lockdown?Can I drive during the lockdown?

The United States seems to have now fallen in behind much of the world in endorsing the universal adoption of some form of face covering in public places. Meanwhile, the UK Government is sticking to its guns and denying that masks are effective if used by the general public, while simultaneously desperately seeking to provide them for frontline health workers. It is a curiously contradictory approach how can a mask protect a doctor or a nurse but not a bus driver or a shopkeeper? While the detailed evidence may remain uncertain, citizen science, common experience and published research findings, including from the 1918 pandemic, lend support to mask wearing. In the vacuum of clear professional advice, Government has been deft in throwing the burden of proof onto those who wish to proceed with mask wearing, even when it comes to the harmless adoption of home-knitted facial protection as has now become commonplace in the USA.Perhaps fortunately, the highly respected WHO special envoy for coronavirus, David Nabarro, has this week entered the debate with a solid dose of common sense. According to Nabarro, people must get used to wearing masks to disrupt the transmission of the virus, a position apparently now supported by the former Chair of Public Health England, David Heymann, who qualifies his support by pointing out that masks are only for the protection of others, rather than oneself. What lies behind the UK intransigence remains guesswork. One element, I suspect, is a rigid approach to official advice that means new findings and developments struggle to overcome the rigid dogma of the past. The narrow range of intervention options offered by Cobra, which have been questioned by some frontline practitioners, is one example of this.Deaths per million, by culture of wearing face masksHowever, I also fear that the advice has as much to do with masking supply issues as it does with protecting public health. Given the high-profile difficulties the Government has faced in providing ventilators, tests and even enough oxygen to hospitals, could it be that ministers are attempting to avoid another high-profile procurement failure which would undoubtedly be brought about if they recommended the public all buy face masks, too? With many frontline healthcare workers already worried about the levels of personal protective equipment to which they have access, suggesting every member of the public go out and buy a mask may simply not be feasible if ministers are to maintain stocks within the NHS. But if this is the case then ministers must be honest. Is wearing a scarf over one’s face a helpful substitute? Or using one of the many online guides to fashion a makeshift mask out of a t-shirt or a tea towel? The evidence is certainly far from straightforward, but we need those in charge of our coronavirus response to offer an honest appraisal of such strategies that is based on public health – not on their fears of being embarrassed politically.Throughout this desperately sad and tragic emergency the failure of government to put up its hands and say sorry when it has got things wrong has only been equalled by its inability to admit ignorance in the face of uncertainty. It is not too late to take a better approach.Professor John Ashton was regional director of public health and regional medical officer for the North West of EnglandThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

We will do everything to meet this deadline. Yes, construction is at a halt for the moment due to the health crisis, but it will resume as soon as possible,.”He insisted that the landmark immortalised by Victor Hugo in Notre-Dame de Paris, remained in all French hearts even if our days, our thoughts, our lives are usurped by the coronavirus outbreak.If the restoration of Notre-Dame is important to us all, it is clearly also because it is a symbol of the resilience of our people, of their ability to overcome trials, and to recover.”More than €900 million (£785m) have been donated by some 340,000 companies and iniduals worldwide to restore the cathedral.The 13-tonne “Emmanuel” is its oldest bell, installed in 1686 at the behest of King Louis XIV.It has rung out on numerous crucial moments in French history but only once since the blaze last April 15 when the cathedral and its bell towers were only minutes away from total collapse - saved by the courage and tenacity of Paris’ firemen.Notre-Dame lost is roof and iconic spire in the fire, sparking fierce debate over whether it should be rebuilt exactly as it was using traditional materials and techniques or take a modern tack.Mr Macron has promised to do everything for the UNESCO heritage site restored in time for the Paris Olympics of 2024.But even before the coronavirus lockdown, work had been hampered by efforts to decontaminate lead particles from the site after more than 300 tonnes went up in smoke.Experts warn the structure will only be fully safe from collapse once mangled metal scaffolding on its roof that melted in the inferno is removed.Prosecutors suspect faulty electrical wiring or a poorly extinguished cigarette caused the blaze.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/tv/2020/04/10/TELEMMGLPICT000228880509_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450\" ","title":"online trivia renaissance no match real life pub quiz","story":"The release of ITV\u0026#39s new drama about the \u0026#39Who Wants to be a Millionaire?\u0026#39 cheating scandal, has coincided with a lockdown quizzing renaissanceA deadly respiratory panic might seem a weird time to launch a show whose plot hinges on public coughing. Luckily for audiences, however, Quiz – ITV’s dramatisation of the Who Wants to be a Millionaire? cheating scandal – is a triumph, featuring outstanding performances and pitch-perfect contemporary detail.I have long been fascinated by the characters in this iconic episode in TV history Charles Ingram, the outwardly-respectable army major belied by his shifty body language and bad acting. He oscillates wildly between answers: one moment not knowing who Craig David is, the next gambling thousands on it. His wife Diana looks on with contempt – a modern-day film noir femme fatale – as her stuffed shirt spouse gives the game away. Then the infamous coughing loud and unmistakable, triangulated between Diana and their co-conspirator Tecwen Whittock.Quiz vividly recalls my own memories of the nineties and early noughties, from Chris Tarrant’s plum-coloured shirts to the ubiquitous Ford Mondeos and middle-class trivia obsessives who would blow fortunes ringing the Who Wants to be a Millionaire? hotline. It also feels strangely topical, coinciding with a Covid-related quizzing renaissance.With the pubs closed, millions of Brits are flocking to apps like Zoom to conduct quizzes from home. According to Google Trends, the use of terms like “pub quiz” and “virtual quiz” is at an all-time high. As real-life relationships crumble under the strain of lockdown, it seems our national love affair with trivia is burning stronger than ever.It’s not hard to see why. Quizzes provide company and much-needed laughter at a fraught time. Friends’ team names have ranged from the facile (“Covidiots”, “Covid Nine-team”), to the lame (“Quarantina Turner”, “Wuhan Clan”) to the gloriously inappropriate (“Pangolin Buffet”). My brother’s response to the question “Which religious figure was known as the Mad Monk?” – “The Venerable Bede” – will continue to tickle me long after lockdown has ended.Yet coronavirus quizzing is no substitute for the real thing. Not being in the same venue destroys the tension you need to see the whites of your opponents’ eyes to relish fully your hard-fought victory. And though any quizzer worth their salt would sooner pilfer the poorbox than cheat at a quiz, there’s no doubt that virtual versions enable skullduggery Professor Google provides your own personal Tecwen Whittock, with considerably less risk of getting caught.Different internet speeds favour city-dwellers: so feeble is the connection at my parents’ rural home that Zoom produces sound but no video (Picture Round: nul points!). There are yawning time-lags, followed by everyone speaking at once. In short, virtual quizzes will always be pale imitations, just as a Zoom chat (part conference call, part hostage video) can never replace a trip to the pub.Coronavirus may have turned back the cultural clock, transforming Britain once again into a nation of hobbyists quizzers, airfix modellers, jigsaw and crossword enthusiasts, but I suspect these trends will prove fleeting. Rather than a life-or-death joust, to quizzing “civilians”, the online version is a mere stopgap in lieu of other activities. When lockdown ends, we trivia nerds will be left memorising world capitals, long after the others have returned to their five-a-side football match. The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

It was only on January 7 the new strain of coronavirus - Covid-19 - was identified.Less than three weeks later Hubei province was under lockdown and the government was busy shutting down neighbouring provinces.While many other countries employed a \u0027contain\u0027 strategy to keep the virus at bay, they did not enforce restrictions on travel or social distancing for more than a month.Spain and Belgium did not lock down for 43 days after their first case, while the UK, Germany and France did not impose quarantines for more than 53 days. Italy locked down faster than most in Europe- 39 days after the first case was identified.More than a month later, there are now signs of recovery in one of the worst-hit countries.The number of new cases in Italy peaked in late March at around 6,500 a day. Since then the number has been falling, and new cases are now closer to 3,000 a day.The numbers began to fall 13 days after the country went into national quarantine, with travel restricted to only essential journeys and people confined to their homes.Spain\u0027s lockdown came three days after Italy, on March 14. At the time the country had only seen 1,100 cases and 148 deaths.New cases in Spain peaked two weeks ago at more than 9,000 new cases a day, and the numbers have been falling since then - 19 days after lockdown.On March 12 - 21 days after lockdown - new cases in the UK hit more than 8,000 a day, but has since been falling.While the number of new cases observed relies on the number of tests conducted, the trajectory would be consistent with the experiences of other European countries.Those experiences appear to be linked to how early quarantines were imposed.Countries which locked down earlier appear to have successfully \u0027flattened the curve\u0027 before they were overwhelmed by the virus.Switzerland and Austria imposed travel restrictions within a month of identifying their first cases, and Denmark was one of the first countries in Europe to lockdown.None of those countries have seen more than 2,000 new cases a day, and are now beginning to eye early returns to normality.The death rates in Italy and Spain are also beginning to decline, but their trajectories surpassed that seen in China.In late March the daily death toll in Italy was nudging towards 1,000 a day, peaking 19 days after lockdown. Now it has fallen to almost half that number.Spain has followed a similar trajectory, although the country saw a more severe and rapid increase in the number of deaths early in the outbreak. Four days ago the number of new deaths was close to 1,000 a day - 961. That has now fallen to less than 700 a day.The death rate began to decline 20 days after the country went into lockdown - giving hope for those following in their wake.And there are now early signs of hope for the UK as the daily death toll begins to fall. Four days ago (20 days after lockdown) the number of deaths reported from hospitals in the UK hit 980, and has since fallen to 717.Modelling from the universities of Exeter, Bristol and Warwick suggested that without any measures at all, the epidemic would have peaked around 133 days after first person-to-person transmission in Britain, which happened around February 28. It is hoped, with current lockdown measures in place, the UK can begin to see the effects within two to three weeks - allowing time for the virus to incubate in those already infected.Prof Mark Woolhouse, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, University of Edinburgh, said: We now enter a phase of careful monitoring. We are looking for indicators first that the epidemic is slowing down and then for numbers of new cases to start to fall. After three weeks we will have to decide whether the restrictions need to be continued, can be relaxed, or can be relaxed temporarily with the expectation of imposing them again later. We must also monitor the damage being that the lockdown is doing damage to the economy, to education, to psychological well-being and to health and social care provision in the community.The impacts of this epidemic are too far reaching for policy decisions to be driven by epidemiology alone.The Department of Health has advised that the peak is likely in about three months when 95 per cent of the infections are expected to take place. It means that most people will contract the virus between late May and late June.The Prime Minister said last week that the most dangerous period is not now, but some weeks away, depending on how fast it spreads. Experts hope that the UK\u0027s response will push the peak beyond the normal end of the flu season in April and into the summer, when the NHS will be under less strain.Read more: How will the lockdown plans affect me?More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/04/13/12/bocelli.jpg","title":"andrea bocelli easter coronavirus milan concert duomo cathedral kim kardashian","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Kim Kardashian, Hugh Jackman and Kaley Cuoco are among the stars who have praised opera singer Andrea Bocelli’s moving Easter Sunday concert.The Italian tenor performed a show at\u0026nbspthe deserted Duomo cathedral in Milan on Sunday night (12 April).

If it seems familiar, it’s because the name first appeared on an iPhone four years ago, and the design is highly reminiscent of the iPhone 8. Here’s the skinny on the new phoneIt’s the iPhone SE. That’s the name first used in Spring 2016 when the chassis of an earlier iPhone, the iPhone 5s, was packed with the then-latest processor. It was also cheaper than any of the other phones in Apple’s range. Apple has followed the same route here.The new phone looks very similar to the iPhone 8, with a 4.7in display, Touch ID, glass back for wireless charging. The iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus will be retired, so this will become the most affordable iPhone in the range. There’s no Plus version of the iPhone SE, because the iPhone SE is deemed to be such a perfect size for the hand.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhere the iPhone 8 has the A11 Bionic chip, first seen in September 2017, this new phone has the very latest chip, A13 Bionic, which powers the latest flagship iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro handsets and which is up to 40 per cent faster than the iPhone 8. As such, it’s near-certain this is the most powerful small-screen phone you can buy.Like the iPhone 8 and iPhone XR, this is a single-camera iPhone. But advances made possible with the much more powerful A13 Bionic chip mean that this is the most advanced single-camera system on an iPhone yet.Apple releases maps data to track whether people are obeying lockdownThe advances include more accurate auto white balance than the original iPhone SE, much faster autofocus and zero shutter lag.Better even than the iPhone XR, then, which is a pricier phone. There are even improvements in the front-facing camera, again thanks to the significantly improved processing power, so that there are more advanced portrait mode features including all of Apple’s advanced lighting techniques for portrait mode.There have been a lot of advances since the original iPhone SE, or the iPhone 8 which this phone replaces, such as better HDR, more sophisticated computational photography and more.This is the first time in an iPhone with 4.7in display that there’s video stabilisation in the front-facing camera, too.This is expected to be the same as on the original iPhone 8. It has wireless charging, and can be fast-charged.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

But its internals are more in line with the latest iPhone 11, and it features Apple\u0027s latest processor and an upgraded camera.It includes the A13 Bionic chip from its top of the line iPhone 11 and 11 Pro. Though it includes just a single lens, unlike the higher-end models, it still gets the software features of those phones such as the Portrait mode and so Apple says the pictures should be even better than the iPhone XR, which is still on sale at a much higher price.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe new phone starts at $399 in the US, or £419 in the UK, the same price as the existing iPhone SE. That makes\u0026nbspit far cheaper than Apple\u0027s other, newer models, which start at £999.It is also now the smallest of Apple\u0027s iPhones, with a 4.7-inch display. But it is larger than the older iPhone SE it replaces, which had only a 4-inch display.Everything you need to know about the new iPhone SEIt will be available on 24 April in three colours:\u0026nbspblack, white and red.The phone will be available in Apple Stores, but almost all of them are still closed. Apple will also offer the phone online with a no-contact delivery option.The iPhone SE is an updated version of the existing model, which was first released in 2016. That phone was built on largely the same principles – packing newer components into an older body – and proved a runaway success, with demand appearing even to surprise Apple.That phone has gone without an update since then. Now Apple has brought it back, with the exact same name, updating the body so that it is exactly the same as the iPhone 8 and replacing that older handset in its line-up.The battery life is identical to the iPhone 8, and like that phone it has wireless- and fast-charging.As well as keeping the old home button design, the new iPhone uses the TouchID fingerprint sensor. The rest of Apple\u0027s line-up – including its iPad Pro – has now switched over to the FaceID facial recognition system.The first iPhone SE was a hit with many customers who loved its unique combination of small size, high-end performance and affordable price the new second-generation iPhone SE builds on that great idea and improves on it in every way — including our best-ever single-camera system for great photos and videos — while still being very affordable, Apple marketing head Phil Schiller said in a statement.iPhone SE features the industry-leading performance of A13 Bionic that enables great battery life, takes stunning Portrait mode and Smart HDR photos, shoots amazing videos with stereo audio, is great for games and super fast web surfing, and is built with the same industry-leading security features our customers expect. We can’t wait to get iPhone SE into customers’ hands.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That’s all I would say, as someone with an enquiring mind.”Versions of the 5G conspiracy theory have been spreading online for years, with some proponents claiming the coronavirus outbreak is just the latest in a string of pandemics induced by\u0026nbspelectromagnetic waves.Created with Sketch.High noon in a coronavirus-stricken world Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A man holds a pocket watch at noon, at an almost empty market near the Imam Ali shrineWat Phra Si Rattana Satsadaram (The Temple of the Emerald Buddha, also known as The Grand Palace)Empty streets at Old Town SquareA watch showing the time at noon, in front of Damascus GateA woman jogs past the Houses of Parliament on Westminster BridgeEmpty road with low trafficThe seafront Malecon next to an almost empty roadThe clock on Spasskaya tower showing the time at noon, next to Moscow\u0027s Kremlin, and St Basil\u0027s Cathedral on an empty squareAn empty road at RajpathThe clock strikes noon at the main concourse of the Grand Central Terminal in ManhattanAlmost empty streets at Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square)A man holds a pocket watch at noon, at an almost empty market near the Imam Ali shrineWat Phra Si Rattana Satsadaram (The Temple of the Emerald Buddha, also known as The Grand Palace)Empty streets at Old Town SquareA watch showing the time at noon, in front of Damascus GateA woman jogs past the Houses of Parliament on Westminster BridgeEmpty road with low trafficThe seafront Malecon next to an almost empty roadThe clock on Spasskaya tower showing the time at noon, next to Moscow\u0027s Kremlin, and St Basil\u0027s Cathedral on an empty squareAn empty road at RajpathThe clock strikes noon at the main concourse of the Grand Central Terminal in ManhattanAlmost empty streets at Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square)The theory has been disproved countless times by scientists, with one microbiology professor recently describing it as\u0026nbsp”both a physical and biological impossibility”.That has not stopped the baseless claims being shared by high-profile figures such as actor Woody Harrelson and TV presenter Amanda Holden.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Now, writes Mark Critchley,\u0026nbspthere are fears this gathering of more than 50,000 fans could prove to have been\u0026nbspa costly errorLittle more than a month ago, coronavirus was beginning to grip Britain. There were almost 600 cases, UK deaths were being counted and doctors in northern Italy were warning of the nightmare to come. But at Anfield on 11 March, more than 52,000 people made their way to Anfield to watch Liverpool’s\u0026nbspelimination from the Champions League at the hands of Atletico Madrid, sitting shoulder to shoulder in the stands.The crowd that night included 3,000 away supporters who had largely travelled from Madrid, despite the match coming a day after gatherings of more than 1,000 people had been banned in Spain.At that stage – before keeping two metres from the next person became a way of life – the UK government’s policy was that shutting down mass gatherings like the match at Anfield or the Cheltenham Festival, held the same week, would have only a minimal effect on limiting the spread of the coronavirus.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesEven in the days that followed, once the Premier League and Football League took matters into their own hands and suspended fixtures, chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance told journalists at No 10’s daily press briefing that banning mass gatherings was not a priority.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastIt took until the following Monday – 16 March, five days after the game at Anfield and the World Health Organisation’s\u0026nbspdeclaration that humanity was in the grip of a pandemic – for Boris Johnson to finally advise against large-scale events. There were 12 confirmed cases of coronavirus on Merseyside at the time. Now, there are nearly 3,000, with 448 deaths recorded in the region’s hospitals.In light of those numbers and the growing nationwide death toll, it is only natural to ask whether the match at Anfield that night – the last match to be held in Britain with such a high attendance – should have gone ahead at all.For Ian Byrne, the Labour MP for West Derby, there’s no need for hindsight to see the incorrect decision was made – he says the warning signs were there all along. Byrne is a lifelong Liverpool supporter who would have attended the match if he had not been working in parliament. Instead, he gave his ticket to his son and – alongside fellow Merseyside MPs Dan Carden and Maria Eagle – worked to raise the issue with health secretary Matt Hancock in the House of Commons.“It was a massive, massive concern,” Byrne says, finding the presence of fans from an emerging coronavirus hotspot particularly baffling. At the time, 782 of Spain’s 1,646 cases were contained in the capital. “If we were playing in Madrid, they wouldn’t be able to attend. Suddenly they can all get on planes, come here without any hindrance, attend the game in the city and act like you would act, doing what you want to do and enjoying the event.”There is a sense warnings from elsewhere were not heeded either. Three weeks earlier, a Champions League game between Atalanta – a team from Bergamo, the epicentre of Italy’s crisis – and Valencia was played in Milan. The match has been described by Bergamo’s mayor as a “biological bomb” which accelerated the spread of the virus in Lombardy. “It was out there, the evidence was out there but it wasn’t getting listened to. We weren’t listened to,” says Byrne. “I just found it utterly infuriating.”On the evening of the game, Hancock responded to questions in the Commons by claiming that it was too easy to draw a link between crowds and contagion. “Sometimes the things that we, as lay people, may feel intuitively will have the biggest impact do not in fact have the biggest impact,” he said. “There are some things that feel right but do not have an impact at all.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailBut Sridhar Venkatapuram, of the Global Health Institute at King’s College London, can only politely describe the relaxed attitude towards mass gatherings during the early days of the crisis as “very interesting”, with a clear note of scepticism. “If we care about iniduals going out of their house, then 50,000 people coming together should worry us even more,” he says. “Concerts, sports matches, political rallies, pilgrimages: all these kinds of things intensify the frequency at which people will come into contact with each other and the rate at which the virus is infecting other people.“If there are 54,000 fans at a football stadium, I cannot tell you exactly where the greatest infections happen. I would be able to tell you that if you put two people together, it’s more likely the second person is going to be infected as opposed to one person being on their own. If one person is infected and surrounded by 10 people, it’s more likely that more than one other person is going to be infected.”And of course, football matches not only mean tens of thousands of fans shouting and cheering in close proximity to each other. They also involve them eating, drinking and socialising together in public spaces, then travelling together on public transport. “There’s nothing better than going to a European away game,” Byrne says. “Obviously the Spanish fans would have taken full advantage of the hospitality that Liverpool would have given them.”Venkatapuram believes that, by 11 March, the unnecessary risk of holding large events should have been clear. “Seeing a variety of patterns, seeing France, Italy and all these countries taking drastic steps, the UK should have been much more concerned about the health and wellbeing of its citizens and should have started to work on the big issues: should international travel be stopped? Should large gatherings of 50,000 people be stopped?”Those are questions that Byrne hopes will be answered by a future inquiry into the handling of the coronavirus crisis. “Hopefully once we all get through this and we can have a look at how it was handled and how we learn from it,” he says. And if\u0026nbspevidence emerges that events of 11 March contributed to Merseyside’s developing crisis, he wants the Anfield decision to be revisited. “That should be an absolute key part of any report.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Some 1.5 million people reported not eating for a whole day during the first three weeks of\u0026nbsplockdown, according to a\u0026nbspYouGov\u0026nbsppoll for The Food Foundation.The Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign has been supporting\u0026nbspwork going on across the country to ensure that everyone has enough to eat during the outbreak and is backed by figures such as London mayor\u0026nbspSadiq Khan, Labour MP\u0026nbspJess Phillips\u0026nbspand TV cook\u0026nbspNigella Lawson.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhile several food banks have told us they have been forced to close their doors, many of them are attempting to switch gears and move into the home delivery of emergency food packages.Bassetlaw Food Bank in Nottinghamshire was forced to “temporarily suspend” normal\u0026nbspoperations at the beginning of April, after it lost more than two-thirds of its mainly older volunteers who are having to self-isolate or follow NHS shielding guidance.How to support our campaignAdministrator Mark\u0026nbspBagguley\u0026nbspis part of a skeleton team now working with\u0026nbspBassetlaw\u0026nbspCouncil Voluntary Service (BCVS) to make sure the most vulnerable people in the area get food parcels dropped at their door.“You just have to find a different way of doing things,” he said. “We’re trying to work others as best we can. It’s very difficult to say whether the local need is being met, now that everything has been thrown on its head. You just have to help as many people as you can.”Despite food donations left in supermarket collection points “dwindling significantly”, Mr Bagguley is making sure the produce gets taken to the BCVS’s central hub, where drivers deliver to people struggling with job losses, cuts in income or difficultly getting outside for health reasons.The Welcome Centre, an independent food bank in Huddersfield, has lost 50 per cent of its volunteers since the\u0026nbsplockdown\u0026nbspbegan. Yet demand for help has roughly doubled in the past few weeks.\u0026nbspKirklees\u0026nbspCouncil has sent two members of full-time staff to help the charity carry on by making home deliveries across the West Yorkshire town.“We normally help about 300 people in a month,” said Emma Greenough, one of The Welcome Centre’s managers. “It’s likely we’re helping around 600 people at the moment – although it’s guesswork at the moment because things are changing so fast.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If the government could suspend the five-week wait for universal credit, it would be a big help to people.”Both the Trussell Trust, Britain’s largest network of food banks, and the Independent Food Aid\u0026nbspNetwork (IFAN) are calling on the Department for Work and Pension to end the five week-wait on new claimants receiving their first universal credit payment.Ms\u0026nbspGoodwin said some of the independent food banks that closed a few weeks ago have already been able to re-emerge in a different form. “At the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak at least 12 of our member organisations closed. Since then, three of them have reopened because they have been able to adapt and put new processes in place.”The DENS Food Bank in Hemel Hempstead, part of the Trussell Trust network, is relying on extra help so it can continue to operate. Demand for food parcels has gone up 75 per cent in the past few weeks, at a time the food bank is struggling with a drop in volunteers. It has forged an alliance\u0026nbspwith another local charity called the South Hill Centre, allowing volunteer drivers to make home deliveries to people asking for help.“A lot of people have seen their income drop and they don’t have savings to cover them,” said Wendy Lewington, DENS Food Bank’s CEO. “For the self-employed, the government help that might be there in a couple of months isn’t there immediately so they’re struggling to afford the basics.”Both the Welcome Centre and DENS Decorum Food Bank are looking for financial donations and non-perishable items such as UHT milk, soups, tinned meat and fish – proving harder for many food banks to buy in bulk at the supermarkets.Despite the difficulties faced by small, local food banks, some of the larger food surplus charities – rescuing\u0026nbspunwanted or short-dated stock from restaurants, retailers and\u0026nbspmanufacturers\u0026nbsp– are stepping up to fill\u0026nbspsome of the gaps.The Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign is supporting the work of our key partner The Felix Project – which has teamed with two other large organisations\u0026nbspin London to forge the London Food Alliance.The London Food Alliance is now coordinating with all 32 London boroughs to make sure the new, council-run community hubs are well-stocked with supplies, and also providing meals for\u0026nbspNHS staff.The Independent\u0026nbspis also encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry across the country – find out how you can help\u0026nbsphere.

We have teamed up with The Felix Project – a start-up charity we helped launch in 2016 – to deliver produce to community hubs in London boroughs.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent is also asking food charities across Britain to contact helpthehungry@ to tell us about your project and help build a directory of ways that our readers can help the hungry in their area – through money, volunteering and food donations. Food banks, which were already struggling to meet the need for emergency food parcels, have seen a huge surge in demand in recent weeks, while at the same time coping with dwindling donations, supermarket rationing systems, and a loss of many volunteers to self-isolation – yet none of the government’s rescue money goes to them.British households have stored more than £1bn worth of goods in their homes in response to the pandemic, creating shortages for food banks as shoppers ignore assurances that supply chains are robust.How to support our campaignJess Phillips, the Labour MP who recently ran for party leader, has backed our campaign, saying: “Nobody should be in the position of not being able to get enough food. In my constituency, London and in places all around the UK the coronavirus pandemic is placing extra stress on a system that was already straining.“We should all do what we can to help food and other essentials get to those that need it. That is why I’m backing the Help the Hungry campaign – please give if you are able.”Pastor Obi Onyeabor, the manager at Barking Foodbank, part of The Trussell Trust’s national network, said his pool of around 50 volunteers has been reduced by a dozen or so people currently self-isolating at home. Yet he and his team have kept their two church hall food banks open, and are now making home deliveries on Tuesdays and Thursdays to make sure the most vulnerable get supplies.“We have been scrambling for the past couple of weeks, doing all that we can – but we’re appealing for more people to come and help,” he said. “Out of fear people have been buying for themselves and their families, but I’ve seen some real generosity too.“I hope that if we can get past the panic buying stage, more people will want to give money, food or some of their time too.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailIn London, charities like The Felix Project donate 10 tons of food – or 22,000 meals – to the needy every day. But funding has dropped since the outbreak of Covid-19, limiting their capacity to carry out vital work at a time when it is more important than ever. As part of the London Food Alliance, along with FareShare and City Harvest, The Felix Project will coordinate deliveries in London boroughs in order to distribute surplus food to the elderly, poor and vulnerable. The charities will deliver food to the hubs, where local volunteers will package up parcels and arrange “last-mile” deliveries to the homes of the vulnerable.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has backed our campaign to help in the capital in partnership with our sister title the Evening Standard. He said: “In a city as prosperous as London, everyone should have enough food to feed themselves and their families – but unfortunately the coronavirus outbreak means some Londoners are facing even greater difficulties. It’s commendable these organisations are joining forces to help ensure surplus food isn’t wasted and instead reaches those who need it most. I urge Londoners to support this crucial initiative.”Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, said: “Our role is to pick up large volumes of nutritious surplus food from the commercial sector and deliver it to community hubs to ensure there is enough food for vulnerable people for as long as this health crisis ensues. We will be working all hours doing our bit – and it would be wonderful if your readers can get behind us so we can do this job for London.”Emma Revie, chief executive of The Trussell Trust, which supports 1,200 food banks, appealed for help from the public to get vital food to people who cannot afford the basics, and to boost volunteer numbers in areas where they are needed.“Our main priority as coronavirus unfolds is ensuring the safety of everyone who comes to a food bank – whether it’s someone needing help, someone volunteering their time, or someone making a donation,” said Ms Revie. “Until we are confident that adequate government protection against poverty is in place, food banks provide an essential community service to people unable to afford food. But this should not fall to food banks.“Our benefits system could be the life raft people need now. That’s why it’s more important than ever that we end the five-week wait for universal credit. While incredible food bank volunteers continue to help people unable to afford the basics, we would ask our government to take this essential step and end the five-week wait now. It’s five weeks too long.”Sabine Goodwin, coordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network UK, which oversees 834 independent food banks, said the charitable services were “struggling to stay above water” in the current climate and accused the government of so far “failing to act” to prevent an ever-increasing number of people falling into poverty.“Food bank use was rising before the coronavirus outbreak and the impact of job losses can only make matters far worse. But this catastrophe in the making is avoidable,” she said. “We’re calling for an income-based solution to this crisis which would mean that the Herculean efforts by volunteers across the country wouldn’t be needed.“FareShare, the UK’s biggest food redistribution charity, is also calling for more volunteers to help with packing and making van deliveries. The organisation takes food from the food manufacturers that can’t be sold in shops, either because of packaging errors or overproduction, and gets it out to food banks, hospices, homeless hostels and other charities.Commercial director Alyson Walsh estimates around 1,200 people have got in touch over the past week. “We have quite a lot of older volunteers who have had to stay at home, but we are now seeing a wave of interest in new people willing to fill in.”Ms Walsh added: “We know we have the capacity to do more – we have the warehouse\u0026nbspspace and the chillers.

While the country’s focus is rightly on defeating Covid-19, the issuing of Notice to Proceed today ensures that our contractors and their supply chains have the confidence that they can commit to building HS2, generating thousands of skilled jobs across the country as we recover from the pandemic.”Preparatory work on the project had already long begun, including readying\u0026nbspthe ground and the demolition of buildings. However, the green light for the constructions of bridges, tunnels and earthworks had been on hold while the project’s future was in doubt.The Independent understands that most HS2 work sites closed down when the government introduced measures to combat Covid-19, but some have managed to reopen where it has been possible to take social distancing measures. Covid-19 lockdown measures do not include a blanket ban on construction work.Boris Johnson, a longtime sceptic of HS2, said the project would go ahead in February, after a review he commissioned found it was the best way to improve rail capacity on the UK’s busiest travel corridors.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Even the most demented sectarian on the left has not championed a Tory election victory to win an inner-party argument.Anti-Corbyn Labour staff worked to lose general election to oust himWriting for the LabourList website, he said officials who had been given honours for “for services to the Labour Party” should have them altered to reflect “services to the Tory Party”.Let us be clear what the officials whose cynical, abusive and factional conduct has now been exposed were actually doing, Unite\u0027s general secretary said.In working for a Labour defeat, they were working for a Tory victory – that is to say, empowering the party that stood for austerity and a \u0027hard Brexit\u0027.\u0026nbsp These politically-crooked officials were prepared to risk dramatic damage to the interests of the British economy and working people just in order to scratch their factional itch.Mr McCluskey said the episode was not about legitimate political disagreement and that those who opposed the leadership had a right to hold their views, but that they should do their jobs diligently, loyally and professionally.The 860-page report, drawn up in the last days of Mr Corbyn\u0027s leadership, is thought to have been produced as an annex to the party\u0027s submission to the Equality and Human Rights Commission. The EHRC is investigating Labour\u0027s handling of antisemitism complaints. The report focuses on the conduct of the party\u0027s governance and legal unit and argued that factional hostility inhibited the functioning of the Labour bureaucracy and made it harder to tackle antisemitism complaints.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mean Girls meets Mississippi Burning, Mr McCluskey wrote.They seem to regard the Labour Party as their private property and anyone a millimetre to the left of Tony Blair as a \u0027Trot\u0027.\u0026nbsp Andy Burnham has spoken out about how he feels the same apparatus undermined him on NHS policy.And we – the labour movement – were paying for all this. Indeed, it seems we were also handing over money that was, unbeknownst to the national executive committee, allegedly being squirrelled away into secret slush funds devoted to supporting those MPs who party officialdom favoured. At first glance there would appear to be a case to answer for breaches of electoral law as well as party governance procedures. Since Unite was by far the largest single donor to the 2017 election campaign, giving around 75 per ecent of total union donations, we have the right to expect an honest accounting for this.Speaking on Wednesday morning Sir Keir Starmer, the new leader of the Labour party, said he was shocked by the report. He has ordered an inquiry into its contents, as well as how it came to be drawn up and leaked.“This is a leaked report into what was apparently happening before I became leader. I was shocked by what I saw and the circumstance in which it all came about,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.“That’s why I have ordered an inquiry, which I want to be professionally done, independently done and quickly done, because our party needs to unite and face the future and get back to our historic purpose, which is getting a Labour government in so that we can actually change lives for millions of people for the better.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The new Nightingale Hospital in Washington, Tyne and Wear, being fitted outWalkers enjoy the bluebells in Wanstead Park in LondonA woman prays at the closed doors of Westminster Cathedral ahead of the Easter morning mass, London, as the UK continues in lockdown to help curb the spread of the coronavirus.

It advised that all black patrons “notify the local police” and seek “medical isolation”.McDonald’s has since removed the sign, closed the store and issued a statement saying the notice was not representative of the chain’s “inclusive values” – but black people living in Guangzhou have told The Independent it is just one example of the racist abuse they have faced during the coronavirus crisis.Max*, who is from Sierra Leone and has lived in the southwest port city\u0026nbspfor the last five years, says Chinese authorities forced him from his home and put him in quarantine –\u0026nbspdespite having tested negative for Covid-19. “I waited outside for 14 hours in the rain, and eventually, I had to go to look for other temporary places to stay,” he says.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThey told him he needed to go to the station to get an extension on his visa, but when he arrived, they refused to give him a stamp and said he wasn’t allowed to go back to the apartment.“The police asked me to pay for the hotel...\u0026nbspbut I had no money on me,” Max says.When Max tried to go back to his apartment later, he says he and two other friends were pushed to the ground by police and taken to a quarantine centre.He told authorities that he had been tested for coronavirus two days ago and the results came out as negative – but the police said the quarantine was “standard procedure” for Africans in the city.He was kept there for a few days and had to undergo several coronavirus tests.According to Max, dozens of his friends from African countries have all been forced into quarantine, yet none of them have left China since the start of the coronavirus outbreak.“To be honest, I feel really uncomfortable in China and I want to go home,” Max says.“Some of my friends were kicked out of their apartments and they have nowhere to stay. They were just students and they have test results to prove that they are healthy. But instead, the Chinese just decided to treat us like animals.”Like other local residents, Luke* says he has been stringently following protocols rolled out by the Chinese government since the coronavirus outbreak. Originally from Togo, he has been studying Chinese for more than three years.He says doctors and police showed up at his apartment unannounced and asked him to test for Covid-19 last week.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But two days later, they showed up at my apartment again, and this time, they told me and my roommates to undergo a two-week quarantine,” he says.He says some of his friends have been evicted and landlords have told them they no longer wanted to rent our their houses to Africans.“I feel rejected by the Chinese people, I am only here to study Chinese,” Luke tells\u0026nbspThe Independent.“When we see how people from Africa are being treated in Guangzhou, I don’t have hope of staying here. I also don’t feel like continuing my study here. It hurts me a lot.”There has been growing concern in China over the threat of imported coronavirus cases, which have been on the rise as the number of domestic cases levelled off. Africans living in China say this has led to more racial profiling and abuse against black people.On 28 March, the government imposed a ban on all foreigners entering the country, including those with visas and residence permits.The coronavirus outbreak only unleashed the underlying feelings that Chinese people have about Africans. We have never been welcomed hereFears were raised over the weekend amid a spike in imported cases. On Sunday, China’s national health commission reported 108 new infections – the highest number in more than five weeks – all but 10 of which were from abroad.Peter*, who has been living in Guangzhou for more than a decade, runs weekend football training with other foreigners living in the city, including a couple of members of Guangzhou’s African community.However, several weeks ago, he started receiving messages from the managers of the local football pitch, informing him that foreigners should not enter until after the Chinese players finished their practice.Then on 7 April, the manager told him that black people could no longer play at the pitch.“This is purely Chinese people’s fear about a second wave of coronavirus infection after the government repeatedly highlighted the danger of foreigners bringing the virus into China,” he adds.Two of Peter’s friends from Africa have also been put in enforced quarantine, he says, despite having not left China for more than a year and having been tested negative for coronavirus.To be honest, I feel really uncomfortable in China and I want to go homeAmbassadors from several African countries in China have written to China’s foreign minister, demanding Beijing addresses their concerns about their citizens in the country.Nigeria on Tuesday said the treatment of its citizens in China was “extremely distressing” and “unacceptable”.In a meeting with Chinese ambassador Zhou Pingjian in his office in Abuja on Tuesday, Nigeria’s foreign minister Geoffrey Onyeama said: “There were videos circulating on social media of very disturbing scenes and incidents involving Nigerians in the city of Guangzhou.“We saw images of Nigerians in the streets with their possessions and this was, of course, extremely distressing for us at home.”China’s Foreign Ministry has promised to roll out a non-differentiated health service for Africans.“All foreigners are treated equally. We reject differential treatment, and we have zero tolerance for discrimination,” it said in a statement.On Sunday, China’s state-run tabloid Global Times published a story to refute criticism of the country’s treatment of African nationals.Global Times said local authorities in Guangzhou claimed that equal policies were in place for both locals and foreigners, and earlier reports about African nationals being mistreated are “viral reports used by some western media to provoke the problems between China and African countries”.However, to Luke, Max and Peter, Guangzhou authorities’ xenophobic treatment of African nationals over the last week is merely a sign of Chinese people’s underlying feeling towards the local African community.“There has always been a general suspicion and fear towards Africans in Guangzhou,” Luke says.“The coronavirus outbreak only unleashed the underlying feelings that Chinese people have about Africans. We have never been welcomed here.”* Names have been changed to protect identitiesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The sign that adorned the entrance of the market, a landmark of Wuhan city, has also been removed.As residents prepare for a return to work this week, business owners at the market will have nowhere to go. “Since all businesses need to apply for permission from the government before they restart operation, it will be impossible for these businesses to gain the government’s approval,” said Michael, who used to own a fruit stand a few blocks away from the Huanan Seafood Market and refused to give his real name.Wildlife trade was once a lucrative and thriving industry in China, but the suspicion that the current coronavirus pandemic started in\u0026nbspexotic animals smuggled into the country has forced the government to crack down on the decades-old trade.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesLast month, Beijing rolled out a strict ban on the breeding and consumption of wild animals, as it tried to prevent another outbreak from happening. This was a general guidance issued from the central government, with the power to enforce the law ultimately lying with provincial or municipal officials.Several other provinces have followed suit, and the southern industrial hub Shenzhen announced a ban on the sale and consumption of dog and cat meat on Thursday, becoming the first Chinese city to do so.When can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastIn Wuhan, local officials have been increasingly strict in their crackdown on businesses engaged in wildlife trade or breeding. On 3 March, local authorities in Wuhan carried out a comprehensive disinfection campaign across the entire Huanan Seafood Market.However, recent reports suggest that despite the regional governments\u0027\u0026nbspefforts to put an end to wildlife trade, illicit commercial activities are still happening at public markets in certain parts of China. Earlier this week, the Mail on Sunday reported that thousands of customers flooded an indoor market in the southwestern city of Guilin in China, as living dogs and cats were crammed into cages while dead bats and scorpions were on display.Andrew Huang, a Chinese culinary expert, says one of the reasons why it’s hard for the Chinese government to completely end the consumption and trading of wildlife in China is because such behaviours have become part of decades-olds tradition in the country.“Different parts of China have their specific traditions of consuming wildlife for different purposes,” Mr Huang explains. “In the northeastern part of China, bears and deers are a big part of the local delicacies while in southwestern China, bats and pangolins are often used in traditional Chinese medicine. The steady demand for such wildlife has nurtured a lucrative supply chain, including some businesses that focus on breeding specific types of wild animals.”Mr Huang thinks that the current crackdown on wildlife trade and consumption might temporarily prevent relevant practices from happening in public markets, but it will be hard to completely eliminate it from the Chinese culture.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Even if the government has banned wildlife trade and consumption, the tradition won’t be so easily wiped out.”‘No need to close the entire market’In Wuhan, while the plan to shut down the Huanan Seafood Market is underway, local residents have different opinions about how to handle the market where the coronavirus pandemic began.“Honestly, wildlife trade isn’t the main commercial activity at the Hunan Seafood Market, as most of the sellers still focus on selling different kinds of seafood,” says Ms Xu, who was a frequent shopper at the market until it was shut down.Since the market is right next to one of the major train stations in the city, she says, it has become the regional hub for selling fruits and seafood, as well as wildlife. Due to the large number of visitors coming from different parts of Hubei province, it also became the ideal breeding ground for the coronavirus.“I think even if the government wants to ban wildlife trade, they don’t have to shut down the entire seafood market,” Ms Xu says. “This will have a huge impact on local restaurants and businesses that have long relied on the market for their seafood supplies.”Ms Xu says that instead of forcing dozens of business owners to lose their livelihoods, the Chinese government should focus more on tackling the ongoing pandemic itself. “I wish the government could conduct more coronavirus tests on citizens, because I suspect many of them could still be asymptomatic patients or patients with mild symptoms,” she said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It was a magnicent address, from a magnicent woman.Her experience and serenity did more to calm and inspire the nation than anything  I can think of as this crisis has unfolded.Best of all, she reminded us that there will be le beyond this lockdown — that we will meet again.If we just focus on the here and now, we won’t be able to prepare for the future beyond the virus.But it’s also true that none of us can think straight when we are in the eye of the storm.That is where good leadership comes in. It helps us all to hold strong, not to go to pieces and to stick to the guidance given to us.Everyone looks to the leader to make decisions, and it’s the decisions we make that will chart our way out of the crisis.Unfortunately, after the Queen’s address to the nation came the news that Prime Minister Boris Johnson had been admitted to hospital intensive care.At that point, anyone who was in any doubt this illness did not discriminate was forced to reconsider.At the time of writing, Boris was back on a regular hospital ward. But his illness has been a reminder that any of us are susceptible to Covid-.Most people are shocked he is in hospital and sympathise with his pregnant girlfriend Carrie Symonds.But of course it has raised the question: Who is really in chargehe is not  Without leadership, we all get distinctly uneasy.We all have leaders in our lives. We are all looking towards them to show us what to do and lead us through it.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealSome companies have stepped up to the plate and are doing good things — reassuring their staff, treating people well and doing their utmost to make sure people will be paid. Some aren’t, of course. But good bosses are taking pay cuts and doing everything they can to keep their businesses alive and look after their staff.At West Ham United we continue to pay all our full and part-time staff  per cent of their wages.My financial director, my manager and I have all taken a  per cent reduction to make sure this happens.It’s when there’s a crisis like this that we see who is made of what.Boris’s temporary stand-in, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, while talking about the PM’s hospital admission, referred to him as his boss, his colleague, but also his friend.Respect and friendship are the key words when it comes to good leadership.A good leader makes the tough decisions because they are right, but they are also governed by ethics. They want to do the right thing, for the right reasons. They are happy to make personal sacrices to ensure the majority are looked after.It is more important now, than ever, to put people before profits.After three weeks of lockdown, with no chance of a let-up, it’s all too easy to fall prey to catastrophic, even apocalyptic thinking.But we have to sht our thought process. We have to accept and understand that, at some point, this WILL be over.When things are calmer and clearer, we can ask what we can do to ensure we are still operating as the world gets back to normal — whatever the new normal is.The experience we are all living through really is like a storm, which continues to rage.There are so many unprecedented aspects to this situation and there is not one person in the world who will come out of it unchanged.So while there are so many challenging and dficult things going on, perhaps this lockdown is a chance for us all to learn more about ourselves.How are you responding  Have you thought about how you can help others  Have you thought about volunteering for the NHS As well as the importance of good leadership, we all have our inidual roles when it comes to showing autonomy and courage about our own decisions.I’m sorry to say, things are going to get a lot worse before they get better.So we all need to take responsibility — or we will never get out of lockdown.ANYONE who saw the social media video of Naomi Watts reaching breaking point after her printer, vacuum cleaner and dishwasher all broke down will surely have smiled in recognition.Naomi, who has been self-isolating in her Los Angeles home for three weeks, shared her very understandable anguish with a slow-motion video of herself screaming with the sound of a lion’s roar played in the background.I think we can all relate to her frustration.My lockdown revelation I am happy to report that I have given up ironing!WHEN it comes to illness, particularly cancer, I’ve long resisted all the talk of going into battle – mainly because of the unhelpful implication of weakness among those who “lose” that fight by dying.I feel the same way about descriptions of people “fighting” coronavirus.Illness is a fact of le. It is not a sign of weakness.The sad and terrible truth is that some people get this virus and others do not.Some have it very badly – a whole lot worse than others.We don’t yet know exactly why. We don’t even knowwe have the virus and may infect people.We don’t knowthere are antibodies that can protect us from getting it again, or how long that will take.We don’t knowthere will be a more deadly mutation of the same virus in the future.There is just too much we don’t know.But there are some practical things we can do.We need to help those who have it now, and the NHS and the Government are doing all they can in this regard.We also need to stop the spread of the virus, through testing. Hopefully that is going to happen soon.Meanwhile, scientists are also working around the clock to create a vaccine.Perhaps, most of all, we need to prepare for the possibility that this could all happen again.We need to learn lessons on food distribution, working from home, adapting our businesses – and having proper personal protection and hospital equipment ready and waiting.AS time ticks on, we are all realising what le is like without the things we used to consider necessities.Like our hairdressers.Claudia Winkleman’s Instagram post showing how unmanageable her fringe has become during lockdown made me laugh in recognition.My hair is grey, long and unkempt.On the one hand, it’s the least of my worries, which is quite liberating.Still, I did manage to get my hands on some hair dye for the roots.Do I care that it’s completely the wrong shade NO. I do not.So please, can we all just agree to turn a blind eye to the way we look when we finally emerge from lockdown HAPPY Easter Sunday, people. How will you be spending yours Personally, I have lost track of what day it is. The past few weeks have been a blur, with every day feeling like a cross between Sunday and Monday.It was my birthday last week and, without loved ones to hug, friends to see, drinks to be had, it was more or less just another day.Equally, this is the first time ever that Easter has felt like just another weekend.But I hope you can find ways to make it special. Just make sure you do so at home.THERE has been talk of schools possibly reopening after the Easter holidays – and who knows whether or not that is true But one thing I do know is that, whenever they do reopen, working parents will not only give the most massive sigh of relief, they will all be thanking their children’s teachers profusely for everything that they do.We will all also be thanking doctors, nurses, all NHS employees, as well as bin men, cleaners, shop assistants and all the other key workers we have under-paid and taken for granted.I really hope that is one thing which changes as a result of this pandemic.These people are the backbone of our country.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

One says that restrictions should be lted sooner rather than later to reboot our ecomony, while the other argues that the restrictions are working, so now is not the right time to lt them.When Chancellor Rishi Sunak first announced his bail-out plan last month, it was estimated that ten to  per cent of workers in the ­private sector would need Government support.Now economic forecasters believe it could be a third of the total private sector workforce. That will cost the British taxpayer between £billion and £billion every three months.To date, about a fth of small businesses have been pushed into bankruptcy. If the lockdown continues to July, that figure will rise to a third.The effect of this on the economy will be catastrophic. According to the ­Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, Britain’s GDP could contract by  per cent over the next two years. It shrank by six per cent during the global financial crisis of -.The Centre for Economics and Business Researchsays the lockdown is costing £.billion a day.Given we are now  days into the lockdown, this means we are already more than £billlion out of pocket.In short,we don’t ease off on the social distancing measures and re-boot the economy, we’re heading for the biggest economic downturn since the s.Against this, we are told thatwe end the lockdown more people will become infected, demand for critical hospital care will outstrip the NHS’s capacity and we’ll begin to see people dying in even greater numbers.I’m sceptical about that prognosis.It is based on the statistical modelling of Professor Neil Ferguson and his team at Imperial College, but there is mounting evidence that they under-estimated the percentage of the population already infected with coronavirus and over-estimated how deadly this disease is.According to Prof Ferguson’s model, fewer than five per cent of people have been infected. But according to another model, this one produced by Oxford University, it could be higher than  per cent, which would mean we are on our way to acquiring herd immunity.When Chris Whitty, England’s Chief Medical Officer, was asked at Thursday’s press conference what percentage of the world’s population has been infected, he put the figure at  per cent.If the true figure is between  and  per cent, the NHS can probably copewe ease off on some of the more extreme social distancing measures.Would ending the lockdown be ­gambling with people’s lives  Yes, but so will keeping it in place.Economic downturns cost lives, just as surely as viruses. During the global financial crisis of –, the suicide rate in Europe increased by . per cent. Economic recessions also cause a rise in poverty, domestic ­violence and murder.Philip Thomas, professor of risk ­management at Bristol University, has calculated thatour GDP falls by more than . per cent as a result of the lockdown, more years of le will be lost than saved.Politicians here and where have justied their cautious approach by ­saying they refuse to put a price on human le, as though the trade-off is between the lives of vulnerable people and economic growth.But the real trade-off is between the lives we might losewe end the ­lockdown tomorrow and the lives we know we will losewe keep it in place indefinitely.MPs aren’t being morally ­courageous. Rather, they’re just focusing on the next -hour news cycle, as they always do.What’s needed is a bold political leader who’s willing to risk some short-term pain to re-start the economy, thereby safeguarding all of our futures.I know of just such a person, but unfortunately he’s in hospital recovering from coronavirus.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealThe UK government’s measures to contain the coronavirus epidemic are just starting to make a ­dference.And with the three-week lockdown under review tomorrow, now is NOT the time to lt them.After a slow and indecisive start, the measures they now have put in place, including recommendations to stay at home, limiting travel, physical ­distancing, banning large gatherings and shutting shops and pubs, are just starting to show signs that they are slowing the spread of the virus.This means that there are fewer new cases, with fewer people becoming seriously sick and less demand on hospital beds, intensive care and articial ventilation.This means that the pressure on health services is reduced, which, in turn, will lead to fewer deaths from Covid- and other causes.Without the actions that have been taken and just letting the epidemic run its course, we would be likely to see more than half the population infected, and an overwhelmed health system with maybe five million hospital admissions and at least , deaths.The measures that have been taken in the UK have been of moderate strength compared to other countries.In France and Spain, the lockdown has been more severe, while in Sweden it has been less strict.The coronavirus epidemic can be thought of like a fire.If we starve a fire of oxygen, then the flames will stop and it will die down.So it is with the epidemic — reduce transmission from person to person and the number of cases will go down.Butyou let the oxygen come back too early, any embers in the fire will light up again and it will restart.So,we relax the lockdown too early, while there is still transmission of the virus going on, then the epidemic will restart.And that means that we would have wasted the efforts we have made so far.When transmission has stopped, or is at low enough levels that it can be monitored and each case and their contacts identied, isolated and treated, then the lockdown can be relaxed.We have not yet reached the peak of the epidemic, and we do not yet have the infrastructure in place for the systematic testing that will be needed to identy new cases, so now is not the time to relax the lockdown measures.Some people have talked about the serious damage done to the economy by measures the Government has put in place and the social disruption these have caused, in order to protect the public health of the nation.They have argued the lockdown will cause more harm than good in the long term. This is a  dilemma.Every le matters. Each person lost is a family member, a friend, a neighbour, a human being.They are not a number on a spreadsheet.This lockdown is the only way for us to get back on our feet.If left uncontrolled, the coronavirus by itself will cause social and economic disruption as well as damaging public health.It doesn’t need any help from politicians.It is up to us all, for the sake of ourselves, our families and our loved ones, to follow the rules, and our solidarity will allow the country totowards normal as soon as possible.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’ve never been so pleased to see my copy spiked.We now know from the PM himself just how close he came to death. But had things turned out dferently, my first sentence would still ring true.Boris would have paid the ultimate price for Covid-.The killer virus was spawned in China’s primitive “wet markets” and concealed by the country’s secretive communist regime and blamed by China on America and the West.Beijing’s claim of only , dead is a sick joke. The true figure could be ten times as high — or more.This, remember, is the regime that still lies about the thousands slaughtered in the  Tiananmen Square massacre.Yet China, having destroyed lives and livelihoods around the globe, is emerging as the big winner from its own pandemic.Like vultures hovering over roadkill, leaders of the world’s second-biggest economy are eyeing up the casualties of this made in-China calamity.Covid- risks opening the door to Beijing’s dominance over world trade and commerce, at unimaginable cost to our freedoms and democracy.Rattled world leaders, from Australia to Germany, are drafting emergency laws to prevent China mopping up crown jewels in pharmaceuticals, minerals, articial intelligence and robot technology.But it is probably too late. The West has turned a blind eye to China’s decades of industrial espionage and its cut-price grab for market share.Germany, Europe’s largest economy, is utterly dependent on cheap, heavily subsidised Chinese components and the VW and Mercedes car sales that account for a third of their profits.Suicidally, it will see Chinese cash as a passport out of the crisis.“We have grown too idle and too comfortable to want to do the things the Chinese do for us,” says a Cabinet insider.The world stood silent as China’s Belt And Road programme gobbled up key ports and industries, rare earth minerals and rich farmland across Africa and the Third World.Beijing is now rubbing its hands at the prospect of fresh bargains.Household-name firms here and in Europe are struggling to survive the lockdown. Some will never reopen their doors.The best might end up in Beijing at fire-sale prices.China has already seized a big stake in the UK with its richly subsidised £billion contract for the Hinkley Point nuclear power station in Somerset.Telecoms giant Huawei has its sticky fingers all over our sensitive G superhighway — a decision which must now surely be reversed.The image of communist China as a civilised equal partner is a dangerous fantasy.“China is not and never will be our friend,” a senior minister warns. “But it is the only one with ready cash and all our markets have collapsed because of something China started.“Our economy is being shattered and it is their fault. The idea of selling them some of our best companies is horrying.”China’s own economy has been hammered too. But it remains a ruthless totalitarian state which brooks no opposition.The brutal incarceration of a million Uighur Muslims in “re-education” camps is a blot on the civilised world. So is the trade in human organs from executed prisoners.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealWho will stop China becoming the world’s dominant power It will be hard for our liberal elite to swallow, but the only answer is Donald Trump.The American President has already cracked down on China’s trade and currency cheating. Democrat rival Joe Biden — backed by peace-at-any-price Barack Obama — would kowtow to Beijing.At this pivotal moment in world history, it is reassuring to know President Trump has a high regard for our Prime Minister.Once Boris is back on his feet and coronavirus begins to fade, he must join forces with the world’s greatest superpower and address the smiling menace of Chinese President Xi Jinping.As the saying goes, what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.Boris was hardest hit, followed by chief of staff Dominic Cummings, who is only now ing to work after a fortnight in bed.A dozen others, including Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty and No Press chief Lee Cain, went down like skittles.So who was the super-spreader The finger of suspicion is pointed at health supremo Matt Hancock, first in and energetically first out of self- isolation. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That sort of quintessentially British thing.There was also, you probably sensed, a collective feeling Britain’s Got Talent didn’t just have a responsibility to lt the nation’s collective mood, over the following  minutes, but a moral duty.An unfair burden to put on any show and a forlorn hope, I thought, given the production has, for many years, involved nothing more inspirational than mixing and matching acts from the worldwide “Talent” franchise with the sort of homegrown sob stories which, however worthy and sincere, can feel a bit beside-the-point compared to the nightmare that’s just engulfed the world.And so it mostly proved on Saturday’s episode.Opinions here will dfer, I realise. In the latter category, though, we had a choir and foster care dancer Yakub, who won me over instantly with his modesty and tact as he announced: “My dream is to dance on . . . I’ve forgotten what I was going to say.” In the former, there was the Belgian contortionist, Papi Flex, an Indian dance troupe and Russia’s Diana Vedyashinka, who has spent the past  years teaching five dachshunds to stand hind-legged on a podium.An admission that made me feel slightly better about spending a similar amount of time watching EastEnders, but not much.There were also, of course, acts that fitted neither category, like James Piper, who’s “a personal trainer by day, magician by night”, meaning he can probably make haemorrhoids appear from nowhere.There was only one person, though, who genuinely lted the gloom.That was the brilliant comedian Steve Royle, from Phoenix Nights and Car Share, whose riotous act, pretending to shove ping-pong balls up his fundament, was funny enough even without the earnest health and safety caption from ITV: “Do not try this at home.” For five glorious minutes I forgot lockdown and began wondering about Steve’s next routine. Then I had to check myself.Because that is the sad and unavoidable issue with these BGT auditions. Unless they’ve got about  weeks of material, coronavirus means it’s a series currently going nowhere.Attempt to press ITV on this matter and all it can tell you is: “We are working with our production colleagues to see how we can make the BGT live shows work in an ever-changing situation.”Mind you, attempt to read Simon Cowell’s mind at the moment and I’m sure you’ll get a far more succinct response.“A jetski.”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “Which month of the year was named after the Roman emperor Augustus Hardball, Ore Oduba: “Which animal has large breeds called Clydesdale and Shire ”Ben Shephard: “On a computer keyboard the abbreviation PGDN is short for page what ”And Ben Shephard: “Gerald Ford served as US President in which decade of the th century ”A BALLSY move, I thought, for ITV to screen a drama comedy about Who Wants To Be A Millionaire’s coughing cheats during the coronavirus outbreak.The dark irony is, though, it was the only show this past week that was good enough to make me forget the ongoing medical crisis for its duration.The second assumption was that Quiz would stand or fall on Michael Sheen’s impression of Tarrant.It doesn’t. And that’s probably just as well, as it’s a slightly hit-and-miss turn. One moment he’s Tarrant, the next he’s Tommy Cooper, but he always looks more like Les Dennis.Luckily for Quiz, however, it barely matters because James Graham’s script sings and Matthew Macfadyen delivers a performance that’s worthy of award nominations playing the thick-as-a-brick Major Charles Ingram. There are issues as well, obviously.Mark Bonnar’s accent sinks somewhere between Stranraer and Larne as Celador boss Paul Smith and there’s an air of ITV self congratulation in the opening hour about Millionaire’s ratings.A dangerous game to play when you’ve now got Secrets Of The Driving Test filling the show’s slot.All is forgiven and forgotten with tonight’s brilliant second instalmentthough, which concentrates on the coughing episode itself and the fallout, as ITV execs try to work out who they should call at Scotland Yard.“It’s the Celebrity Crime Squad.”“Really  It sounds like a s**t detective show.”“It sounds like something we’d make.”Quite.Manny Monthe: “- is a dangerous scoreline because the next goal wins.”Ian Wright: “Pep Guardiola came in and literally cut Joe Hart’s legs off.”Gary Lineker: “Rafa’s comeback in the Champions League final was his finest moment in the Premier League.”IN the continued absence of live sport, the contest of the week was The Great Celebrity Bake Off, on Channel , where two veteran camera-chasers battled it out for screen time and the winner’s apron.A Holly Willoughby on This Morning B Princess Fiona in Shrek The Musical ITV’s hugely entertaining drama Quiz. BBC’s nearly perfect World Cup Rewind series .The quietly brilliant BBC News health correspondent Fergus Walsh and his cameraman Adam Walker deserving awards for their coronavirus reports from UCL Hospital.And the bloke from pest control making a polite exit from Channel ’s The Mum Who Got Tourette’s: “Did Simon tell you I had Tourette’s ”“The thing that gave it away was when you opened the door and called me a c***.”Smug THIS week’s winner is Phillip Schofield and the Mekon from Eagle comic.Sent in by David Thompson, via email. Picture research Amy Reading.But that’s care homes for you, I suppose.Steph McGovern using the phrase “I love it” an average of . times every show.Psychopathic Mexican drug cartels failing to deal with Gordon, Gino and Fred, on their ITV road trip, while they had the chance.And Have I Got News For You ler Ian Hislop claiming: “The Prime Minister’s in hospital, not good for comedy, is it ” ’Cos it wouldn’t be an issuehe A ever bothered cultivating a wider range of targets than just Boris and Trump and B was actually funny.The Steph Show, Jason Manford: “I’ve been watching the show, Steph, and it’s great.”The Steph Show, Steph McGovern: “I set a challenge for Ruth Davidson and Sandi Toksvig to find something in their house that’s a waste of space.”Challenge  That’s no challenge.

It’s no wonder so many bosses and workers are confused – lawyers are too!Without statutes in place and with regulations changing, it can be hard to provide a definitive answer. The Government has announced the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, which means thatyou both agree, your employer can put you on temporary leave .This applies when they are unable to operate or have no work for you to do because of Covid-. If you are furloughed, you will be paid  per cent of your wages by the Government, up to a monthly cap of £,.It sounds straightforward, but your own unique circumstances can make things tricky.  I have been inundated with questions from people who have been furloughed, had their salary cut or lost their jobs.Here, I have provided my answers to some of your most common queries.Q I STARTED a new job shortly before the lock-down. My new company has advised me it cannot pay me the  per cent government pay because I didn’t start before February . What can I do A Annoyingly for you, your new company is almost certainly right. Unless you were on the payroll by February  they are not legally bound to extend the furlough scheme to you. There are talks about this being changed and lots of pressure on the Government because there are a lot of people in your position. In the meantime, you are entitled to Universal Credit — apply now.Q I WAS late getting to work at a food processing plant due to a change in bus timetables caused by the lockdown. My boss said this was a disciplinary offence and fired me. Is this legal A This is probably not legal. If you have been employed for two years or more this counts as unfair dismissal. If you took your employer to an employment tribunal you would have a good chance of winning.  If you haven’t been employed there for  months you would still be entitled to pay for your notice period.  It is possible you could bring a claim for breach of contract as your employer has almost certainly failed to uphold their own disciplinary procedures. You may also be entitled to a claim for discrimination.  Write to this firm making it clear the country is watching their behaviour — as am I.Q I AM on furlough but my employer is holding back a week’s wages I earned before I was furloughed, saying I will get them when my employment starts again. Can he do this  A Your employer cannot do this, unless it was agreed in a contract. You were promised this money and it has absolutely nothing to do with you being furloughed. I have had a number of messages about this unlawful practice and I understand employers are trying to protect cashflow. Butyou were promised this money your firm is not entitled to withhold it.  It may be that, like many others, you will have to work with your employerthey need that money to stay afloat and protect your job, but make sure they put in writing that the money will be forthcoming in due course. Waiting a while for the money may be better than your company going bust.Q AM I entitled to get another job – say, in a supermarket – while I am on furlough from my employer A I have been inundated with people asking this, but the law is not clear. My view is that unless the contract you have with your current employer specically states you cannot take another job , there is no reason why you cannot during this time. There is nothing as it stands in legislation that prevents you from doing this. The government regulationsare not clear and need clarication.  Importantly, disclosure to your current employer is critical. Do not accept another job without giving clear written notice to your current employer that you are taking up other employment while furloughed.Q MY employer wants me to accept a ten per cent pay cut. I checked my contract and I don’t believe they have the power to do this. Do I have a way of resisting this A Your employer cannot unilaterally decide to cut your wages. You have signed a contract and they have promised to pay you. But these are unprecedented times and there is legal provision which may, in certain circumstances, allow employers to sack you and then,necessary, re-employ you on a reduced salary. Multiple employers have asked staff to take a reduction in order for them to survive. The critical thing is thatyou accept such an offer it must have an end date, in writing. You can’t be forced to accept a contract change, including a salary cut. But be warned thatyou do not, your employer can put you on furlough, which will only cover  per cent of your salary.Q I RESIGNED from my job but my new one has fallen through due to the virus. Where can I get help  A I am afraid you will have to claim Universal Credit. It may be worth writing to your old employer to seethere is work still availble, but your legal remedies are limited. The Citizens Advice Bureau is updating its advice on this all the time.Q MY EMPLOYER has gone into administration. Can I still be furloughed A The law makes clear that administrators, independent professionals responsible for either salvaging a bankrupt company or ensuring creditors are paid, can apply to the government furlourgh scheme to ensure an income for staff. However, the administrator will probably focus on attempting to pay creditors and shareholders. Do not let them do this. Get together with co-employees and write to the administrator insisting you’ll not be forgotten and nor will their behaviour.Q I’VE HAD to cancel my holiday and my employer needs me to work during the time I had booked off. Usually we are not entitled to carry annual leave into the next year, butthey are requiring me to work, surely I must have the right to do so A Good news, the Government has amended regulations so workers can carry over up to four weeks holiday into the next two holiday years. This applies where it has not been possible for you to take some or all of your leave because of the virus. However, it has to be because you were required to work.Q I BECAME self-employed in February. Am I entitled to government grants A It looks like you are not, but this may change. You need to have accounts for   to be entitled to assistance. But this situation is moving, so don’t give up hope.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappeal Q I’M A zero-hours worker. Am I still entitled to be put on furlough  My employer is closed so I have no shts but nothing has been mentioned about furloughing. A The furlough scheme covers zero-hour contract workers so your employer should make an application on your behalf. Get in touch and ask them to explain their policy. It costs them nothing to offer you furlough so I do not understand why they have not.Q I WORK in a shop and my employer has made no effort to make the environment safe for the workers. In other shops I have seen screens at tills and employees issued with gloves and masks. We have none of that. I don’t feel safe. Am I entitled to stop working without risking my job A It is shocking that there are no specic health and safety regulations protecting workers like you which have the full force of law. I do not have a clear answer about whether you are entitled to refuse to go to workthe business is open and offering essential services. However, in due course your business failing to make the environment safe could be grounds for constructive dismissalyou were to make the decision to walk away. I urge you, in the strongest possible terms, to write to your line manager asking them to provide safety equipment, making it clear the environment is unsafe and explaining that you will be considering your optionsadequate safety measures are not introduced.Q I WANT to go on furlough, but my employer has cut my hours by half. How can I make them furlough me so I can get  per cent of my pay instead of  per cent A Your boss can’t just slash your hours by half, that is a straightforward breach of contract. If there is no work for you to do then furlough should be offered to you. Write to your employer at once asking for them to explain why they think this is lawful. I look forward to their answer.Q I CAN’T work because I have to shield myself due to health reasons. I asked my employer to furlough me and they said they couldn’t because I can’t work, so I am currently on unpaid leave. Is this fair A  This all depends on your circumstances. If you are able to work from home, and are healthy enough to do so, your employer should offer you this option. If your employer is unable to operate, or there is no work you could doyou did not have to shield yourself, then you should be offered furlough. Butthe business is an essential service that has remained open, and you have to attend work in person, the remedy is to apply for statutory sick pay .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They spent nine days building a backyard pub garden.Billy says: Mum was planning on having a patio built in the garden this summer.Obviously, due to lockdown, this could no longer happen as she couldn’t get workmen in. So we decided to improvise as best we could - and incorporated the pub garden theme as we were missing going to the pub!We started The Lock Inn on March  and finished it on April , just in time for the nice weather. Altogether, it cost less than £- including two benches that Mum had already sourced for her original patio plan.The barked seating area is  square metres.It features typical pub benches, a music system and a BBQ area. Theres also an ft swimming pool right next to it, as well as a trampoline and children’s games like Jumbo Jenga and Jumbo Dominoes.Unfortunately, we didnt build an actual bar, although drinks are still available!All the work was done by Charlie and me.I worked in retail and he was a gardener - but due to the current situation, we are out of work.The Lock Inn has been used most days since it was completed. We’ve had an Easter egg hunt and a BBQ - and will continue to enjoy it as long as the weather holds out.We’re very happy with how it turned out. Itll definitely be used throughout lockdown - and for years to come. Were already planning a big get-together for family and friends when this is all over.Richard Thrower, , operations manager at a security firm, is in lockdown with his girlfriend Kirsty, , stepdaughter Macie, nine, and toddler son Ollie in Crewe, Cheshire. The die-hard Peaky Blinders fan has created his very own The Garrison pub.Richard says: I dont actually know why I decided to build the bar - it just seemed like a good idea!We had a load of left-over decking from our old house - weve recently moved - so just made use of it really.I started the bar last Tuesday and by Friday, it was done. It cost around £ for everything. Ive never built anything in my entire le out of wood - so that just shows how easy it is to build one of these! We love it!In terms of decorating, we just went for a rustic look.But we are both die-hard Peaky Blinders fans so it had to be named The Garrison like the pub on the series.Over the past couple of days, Ive also built a sofa for the garden, using pallets a friend gave me. It only took an hour max to put together. It meant we didnt have to spend £ on a garden set - we just had to buy the screws.I cant seem to stop building!Although we havent actually used our own The Garrison yet as were not allowed to have anybody round, I can tell you now that once this lockdown is over, well be having some serious backyard parties!I dont actually drink much - only socially - but seem to make up for not drinking when I eventually do get out.Maybe well even build another bar for a DJ booth!Marketing employee Lauren Mullaney, , and her website trader husband Thomas, , are in lockdown in Nottinghamshire. Theyve turned their shed into an after-work booze haven. Lauren says: Wed been looking to build our own bar later in the summer, for parties and get-togethers with family and friends. But when lockdown happened, we decided to fast-track the project to keep us busy after work.The shed was already built, but we were just using it for storage. Now, its a bar called The Doghouse - we have given it a new lease of le by applying a fresh lick of paint and putting up lots of signs.Weve been collating stuff for it since Christmas.It now features a bar area with stools, a dartboard, a music system, a last orders bell, fairy lights and alcohol.Tom built the bar area within a week - he worked on it after work most nights - though it’s still a work in progress as were limited on what we can get our hands on at the moment.Still, were very happy with our creation.We’re both working from home at the moment so its really nice to have somewhere to go in the evening. Sometimes, well have a drink, play darts, Dominoes or cards, and listen to music.We use it at the weekends, too.Our family and friends now can’t wait for the post-lockdown grand opening! We look forward to spending summer days and evenings in the garden and bar with them.Self-employed cleaner Vicky Rowe, , is in lockdown with her HGV driver partner Ryan Matthews, , and their seven-year-old son Khalen Matthews in Cornwall. They built their own bar, named after their son, in a matter of hours.Vicky says: Wed seen a few pictures of makesht bars online and decided one would fit well in our garden. We live opposite our local pub so its not too far to travel - but this is even closer!We started making Malcs - a long story, but its a nickname our son was given by my brother-in-law a few years back - at around am on April  and it was finished by lunchtime.It didnt cost us anything - the pallets and wood were donated by family and friends. It’s . metres wide, . metres deep and quite basic - although we have put up a few lights around the bar.All alcohol is kept indoors in the fridge, but we bring some out when we spend a few hours in the garden. There are shelves for spirits and drinking glasses behind the bar.We’ve used Malcs a few times already. It fits in well and our son is delighted. Were looking forward to having friends and family over once we’re out of lockdown to really put it to the test!Carpenter Liam Clarke, , is in lockdown in Herefordshire. He recently made his friend, who lives locally, his own timber bar to help him cope with pub withdrawal. Liam says: I had some materials left over from a previous job, so decided to make a bar. I would love my own bar, but unfortunately my garden is tiny. So its at a friends who has the best garden!I made The Staying Inn a week or so after the pubs closed. I built it over a couple of days - I wasnt in a rush.My girlfriend Carly helped me out, sanding and using the chop saw.The Staying Inn has got the basics of a normal pub, including shelves for glasses and space for a barrel under the bar. Its big and sturdy enough to get pumps and a mini fridge underneath.Before lockdown, Id go to the pub a couple of times a week,  just for one after work and a few on Friday nights. I enjoy catching up with friends and usually get quite a bit of work from people at the pub.Unfortunately, Ive only used The Staying Inn once, as its at its new home.But Im sure when the lockdown is over, Ill be a regular!Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Half of those , deaths are blamed on coronavirus.We do not know how the other half died, although some will have missed le-saving healthcare because of the ­pandemic.What we do know is that this hideous virus is killing the economy.The Office for Budget Responsibilitywarns a three-month shutdown will slash growth by more than a third, push unemployment up by two million and raise borrowing by an eye-watering  per cent.Lockdown has destroyed Britain’s “jobs miracle”, put paid to a fragile “Brexit bounce” and triggered what could be the worst depression in living memory.“It is important people know there will be hardship ahead,” warned Chancellor Rishi Sunak, an under- statementever there was one.On your one-hour daily exercise break, you can see the tragedy unfolding.Once-thriving restaurants and bars, busy offices and shops and key construction sites are locked and bolted.Behind every door is a personal and economic tragedy.Despite a torrent of taxpayers’ cash unleashed by Mr Sunak, many will never reopen. Some are already bust. Le will never be quite the same again.The Treasury is stumping up billions to pay furloughed full-time workers, help the self-employed and offer Universal Credit to the very large number who slip between the cracks.We are piling shedloads on to our already massive national debt. For many firms and iniduals this is a devastating blow from which they may never recover, financially or mentally.Lives lost from delayed emergency care, alcoholism, drugs and domestic abuse have rocketed.Together with fatalities from other causes — mostly poverty and despair — they could dwarf the toll from the virus.Some children’s le chances will be wrecked by a long break from school or, worse, from being cooped up with violent family members.Those who keep their jobs may be forced into severe pay cuts. Costs will spill down through the generations.Not everyone is suffering.Public sector jobs and pensions are secure, for the time being.Some with savings, decent homes and jobs they can do from home might actually be enjoying Easter with their families at their side.Breadwinners forced to stay in instead of eating out or flying abroad will have spare cash in their pockets at the end of the month. And some will have grabbed Rishi Sunak’s offer of  per cent pay to put their feet up at the taxpayers’ expense.But it all adds up to a crimson bottom line that our children and grandchildren will have to meet over decades to come. Some of it will be paid for in blood.Without cash from tax revenues, how do we meet Sunak’s pledge to fund — “whatever it takes” — our wonderful NHS and its costly new le-saving treatments The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealCan we afford a generous cradle-to-grave welfare state, good schools or the promised infrastructure linking North and South with better roads and railways One day a vaccine will bring this miserable pandemic to an end. But what will remain — and at what cost Downing Street, without its most important figure at the helm, must find a way to save Britain from destitution without being blamed for “putting money before lives”.It is a challenge only a loony Corbynite leftie would wish on their worst enemy.But to govern is to choose.And despite having just escaped his own near-death experience, it is impossible to see it happening without Boris Johnson’s say-so.The PM knows there will be questions to answer once all this is over.They are already coming thick and fast — on testing, NHS capacity and protective equipment for NHS staff.These need to be settled fast — at literally any cost.We will then need an inquiry into the failure of so-called “experts” to see this coming.We will want a detailed explanation from the Public Health England quango which focused costly resources on obesity and ersity, rather than the pandemic they war-gamed four years ago.Why, for instance, were they so slow to allow non-NHS specialists into the fast-accelerating battle against Covid- A gargantuan rise in debt and unemployment. A terrying collapse in tax revenues. A vast Government bailout to save businesses and jobs.It should be a comfort that these same official forecasts also predict a rapid rebound, assuming the lockdown ends and the virus is largely conquered.But eventhat startling optimism — which we struggle to share — is borne out, immense and permanent damage will already have been done. Millions of jobs will have been destroyed, thriving firms bankrupted and a monstrous new debt pile amassed, taking years to pay off. The pain of the austerity era after  will have been a mere taster.It is good at least that Britain now knows this. We hope it sinks in. The public must consider it before it rails against any relaxing of the lockdown in case more Covid victims die.No one wants more lives lost. But the debate is not lives versus money and jobs. Many will also die from the hardships of poverty, unemployment, tax rises and spending cutsthe economy is kept paralysed much longer.The behavioural scientists advising the Government rightly fear that the public will doubt whether the lockdown’s success in protecting the NHS is still worth itthe recession it triggers kills thousands and destroys the health ­service’s funding anyway.We are not there yet. We do not yet knowUK deaths have peaked, though hospital admissions are flattening and the NHS does now look likely to cope.But the crunch point, where a date is set to slowly release Britain from house arrest, cannot wait much longer.Labour will blame the Tories, but all of these pandemic risks were pointed out as far back as  when Labour were in power.Boris, who became Prime Minister only nine months ago, was occupied with other matters until his December landslide.There are some “green shoots”, to quote one of our medical experts.The NHS now has spare capacity.

They tend to be popular with shoppers who believe the items on sale are cheaper and fresher than in supermarkets.But theyre poorly regulated.Its not known whether the suspected source of the killer bug, the Huanan Seafood Market, has also been reopened.Confusingly, despite WHO apparently giving the green light to Wuhan reopening its wet markets, one of its experts said the organisation wants them closed.In an interview with the BBC, Dr David Nabarro, a WHO special envoy on Covid-, said its advice is to actually shut wet markets.Although the group does not have the capacity to police the world and can only offer advice and guidance, there’s very clear advice from the Food and Agriculture Organisation and WHO.There are real dangers in these kinds of environments.“Seventy-five per cent of emerging infections come from the animal kingdom. It’s partly the markets, but it’s also other places where humans and animals are in close contact, he added.Hes urged people to make absolutely certain that you’re not creating opportunities for viral spread.China’s markets, where wild and often poached animals are packed together, have been described as a breeding ground for disease and an incubator for a multitude of viruses to evolve and jump the species barrier to humans.Nabarros advice comes as China is now facing a new coronavirus flare-up along its remote northern border with Russia, far from the original epicentre of Wuhan, where it has all but declared victory in the battle against the pandemic.The frontier has been sealed and emergency medical units rushed to the area to prevent visitors from bringing the virus back from overseas.According to Chinas official figures, its had more than , coronavirus cases, and , deaths.The city of Wuhan has been accused of playing down the outbreak with some saying the death toll could be ten times higher than claimed.Its been revealed weeks after it became clear the virus was a killer some districts held huge banquets attended by thousands of people.Whistleblowing medics in the city who tried to alert the world to the spiralling crisis were silenced and one doctor reportedly vanished.However, the deadliest consequence of the cover up was that it allowed the exodus of some m people in the weeks before the city was quarantined on January .This helped transport the virus across China and all over the world.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It will all work out well.In particular, on behalf of the American People, I want to thank President Xi!Professor Gostin said he was shocked the president had followed through on earlier threats to limit WHO funding, and that the decision could have a devastating impact globally.Its deeply concerning and dismaying that in the middle of a once-in-a-century pandemic, with tens of thousands of people dying across the world, to actually withdraw funding, or at least limit funding, to the World Health Organisation, he said.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Microsoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates responded to the move by tweeting: Halting funding for the World Health Organisation during a world health crisis is as dangerous as it sounds.Their work is slowing the spread of COVID- andthat work is stopped no other organisation can replace them.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappeal Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Re-opening primary schools is the key to unlocking labour.”Working with the Treasury, Downing Street is said to be planning for a gradual easing of the restrictions on a sector-by-sector basis.Other options on the cards for helping to lt the lockdown could be reopening other shops, sending some back to work, or allowing the young to go out first.Ex-Chancellor Sajid Javid said today: We should be trying to phase out this lockdown as soon as we possibly can, based on that scientic and medical advice.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealThis morning new Labour boss Sir Keir Starmer urged ministers to set out their plan for what happens next.The question for Thursday therefore is no longer about whether the lockdown should be extended, but about what the governments position is on how and when it can be eased in due course and on what criteria that decision will be taken, Sir Keir said in a letter to stand-in PM Dominic Raab.Overcoming this crisis requires taking the British public with you, he added.The government needs to be open and transparent... The silent pressures on communities across the country cannot be underestimated.And he added: I think that some of the decisions made in the last few weeks were too slow and didnt learn quickly enough from other countries, lets not repeat that.But a British government source said all decisions would be guided by scientic advice and data.Talk of an exit strategy before we have reached the peak risks confusing the critical message that people need to stay at home in order to protect our NHSand save lives, the source said.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But, future studies are needed to evaluate their potential for spillover to other species to better understand the risks to human health.The authors said their findings highlighted the importance of surveillance for zoonotic diseases - which can transfer from animals to people - as they occur in wildle.Its hoped the results will guide future surveillance of bat populations to better detect potential viral threats to public health, adds the Smithsonian’s Global Health Programme , which discovered the new coronaviruses in Myanmars bats.The programme investigates emerging infectious disease to combat threats to conservation and public health worldwide.GHPs director, Dr Suzan Murray, last month testied on zoonotic disease transmission before the US House Science, Space, and Technology Committee.She warned: The next global pandemic is not a matter of , but when and where. To quickly identy and contain such infections, health and disease must be evaluated across species on a global scale.Dr Murray said that over the last  years, working with partner agencies, we have identied more than , novel wildle-borne viruses,  of which belong to the same family as the Covid- virus.Scientists estimate there are . million unknown viruses, around half of which could infect people, and some lead to new pandemics. As of now, there are no co-ordinated programs to work in high risk regions to identy these unknown viruses, get their genetic sequences into our labs, and identy ways to reduce risk of them emerging.  Our best defence against spreading diseases that make their way into human populations is through research and education. While we cannot stop every disease outbreak, we can reduce their frequency and build the capacity for a rapid global response when they occur, she added.Army General Mark Milley was asked whether he had any evidence that the virus began in a Chinese laboratory and was perhaps released accidentally.Reuters reported on April  that Milley was non-committal at a Pentagon news briefing.China has already dismissed as a conspiracy theory that the virus emerged from a lab.Milley said: Theres a lot of rumour and speculation in a wide iety of media, the blog sites, etc. It should be no surprise to you that weve taken a keen interest in that and weve had a lot of intelligence take a hard look at that.And I would just say, at this point, its inconclusive although the weight of evidence seems to indicate natural. But we dont know for certain.In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian alleged on Twitter last month that the US Army might have brought the epidemic to Wuhan.The claim was denounced by the US government and angered President Donald Trump.Americas State Department said at the time that China was seeking to deflect criticism of its role in starting a global pandemic and not telling the world.As far back as February, the Chinese state-backed Wuhan Institute of Virology pushed back against rumours that the virus may have been articially synthesised at one of its laboratories or perhaps got out from there.A team of  scientists published a statement in the Lancet medical journal in February condemning the conspiracy theories.They said such theories do nothing but create fear, rumours and prejudice that jeopardise our global collaboration in the fight against this virus.Scientists from around the world overwhelmingly conclude that this coronavirus originated in wildle, they added.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The world will not be the same after the virus as it was before.Sir John added: Intelligence is about acquiring information which has been concealed from you by other states and other actors.There was a brief period in December and January when the Chinese were indeed concealing this from the West.He said China was increasingly becoming completely at odds with Western nations and US President Donald Trump should lay the blame at Chinas feet, not the World Health Organisations.It would be better to hold China responsible for those issues than the WHO... heads of UN agencies are wary of offending one of the major powersBut that doesnt excuse the head of the WHO for failing to stand up for the facts, the data, and making the right demands of China.I think the WHO has got serious questions to answer about its performance, but anger should be directed against China rather than the UN agencies.Mr Trump has revoked all US funding for the WHO as America plunges into one of the worst global outbreaks of coronavirus.He said the WHO had given America faulty advice on closing their borders to China.Mr Trump said the health body had blew it and failed to make China deal with the severity of the problem and truthfully report case loads.Chinas official death tolls have been criticised as massively underreported.Wuhan locals claim the real death toll in the city was actually , - ten times the number reported by authorities. One of the Wuhan doctors who first tried to warn the world of what would become a pandemic, was told by authorities he would be punished for telling the truth before he died of the virus.The number of cases of coronavirus in China have been steadily flattening after drastic measures were put in place, sentencing the entire country to their homes.China hadnt reported more than  new cases a day in weeks, but fears over a second wave of infections were sparked after a jump to  new cases in a day. In Wuhan, le has started toto normal, and the now infamous wet markets where the virus is thought to have originated have been given the green light by the WHO to reopen.Former Foreign Secretary Lord William Hague has also warned about becoming too reliant on China.He said at an event last night that the Wests policy towards China was incoherent and ineffective.This crisis reinforces the case for two major pillars to be established for Western policy towards China.The first arises from the fact that China isnt going to play by our rules, and that means we cannot be strategically dependent on China in many respects including technology.The other important pillar arises from the fact that we cant solve global problems without China.. the COVID- crisis is an example of such a dramatic world crisis.We cant be dependent on China, but we cant be without a framework of cooperation with China.Lord Hague said he doubted whether there would be an international inquiry into coronavirus, but that the world should learn to change its reliance on Chinese supply chains.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Most of them are exactly that – myths.There are clear ways you can protect yourself and they are the messages we are giving out constantly – thorough hand washing, using  per cent plus sanitiser gel when soap and water aren’t available and avoiding contact with others as much as possible.Please don’t listen to any other nonsense.The myth about coronavirus and breast milk emerged after people touted its benefits online as a superfood with immune-boosting properties.The Daily Beast reported that milk sellers have seen an increase in buyers looking for human milk to boost their immunity or speed up their recovery during the coronavirus pandemic.While breast milk is good for a babys developing immune system, Dr Hes warned that there is a lack of evidence to support the existence of coronavirus antibodies in breast milk.Theres no proof of that yet, this is all hypothetical, she said.[Breast milk] would be the lowest thing on my list. I think you can take some vitamin C and zincyou want to, but do not buy breast milk to prevent Covid. That is not going to help you.Despite this, there is some research being done on the subject with Dr Rebecca Powell, an infectious disease expert at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, putting out a call on social media for breast milk to test for antibodies and their potential ability to combat the disease.However, the research could take months or years, and Dr Powell explained to VICE thatany potential treatment could be derived, the antibodies would need to be puried and concentrated — not just drunk.The UK Government says there is no clinical evidence so far to indicate that the virus can be transmitted via breast milk - meaning there is no known risk of an infected mother passing it to her child through milk.Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, deputy chief medical officer for England, also said that women shouldnt stop breastfeedingthey show coronavirus symptoms.He said: The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologistshas looked at this for us and concluded that there is no obvious risk associated with breastfeeding.As you know breastfeeding is incredibly important for the baby, its incredibly important for mother and baby bonding.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealOur advice at the moment is that with respect thats an inidual womans choice as to whether she breastfeeds, but our advice is that this is the best thing to do.RCOG say the main risk of breastfeeding is close contact between you and your baby, asyou cough or sneeze, this could contain droplets which are infected with the virus, leading to infection of the baby after birth.They urge mothers to wash their hands before touching their baby, breast pump or bottles and to ry to avoid coughing or sneezing on their baby while feeding at the breast.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Some families report having to sign DNR agreements meaning thattheir relative became severely ill with coronavirus there would be no attempt to revive them from heart or respiratory failure. Mr Hancock is also announcing guidance giving relatives the chance to pay a final visit to to elderly family members who are terminally ill with covid- to give people the “right to say goodbye”. The government has also confirmed that care home residents and staff with symptoms of coronavirus are to be tested as the government faces a backlash over its handling of the growing crisis. Staff have complained about being short of personal protection equipment . Covid- has been identied in , care homes in England, forcing thousands of elderly residents to be kept in isolation in their rooms with no visits. Data from the Office for National Statistics showed  deaths linked to Covid- in care homes between January and April  — but unofficial estimates put the true figure far higher. The changes, which are expected to be announced at the daily press conference, are part of  a four-part strategy to boost confidence in the treatment of elderly people. Staff at homes have complained about being short of personal protection equipment , such as respirator grade masks and a lack of testing. Many families have been sent letters from GPs asking them to give consent to DNR agreements.  Some have been asked to agree in advance that elderly relatives would not be taken to hospital at all, but made as comfortable as possible at the home.  There have also been reports of elderly residents being asked to sign blanket DNR agreements in advance of any infection. Asked about the process the Prime Ministeraposs spokesman said: The healthcare professionals and medical teams, this is something they have been in the lead on rather than ourselves.

Coronavirus has made this much more dficult, and I’ve heard heart-breaking stories of people dying without a loved one nearby.

Downing Street today revealed that testing capacity now stands at , people a day, but only , tests were carried out in the  hours up to am on Tuesday. The current capacity falls short of the Governmentaposs target to reach , tests a day by Wednesday April . During todayaposs Downing Street press conference Mr Hancock denied that he had set the target, insisting it was originally set for the end of the month. But his own department published a press release on their website saying on  March saying The increased capacity is expected to be ready within  weeks, with highest-priority cases being tested first. It followed an announcement by Mr Hancock in Downing Street on  March. He told the Downing Street press conferencing there is spare capacity in the thousands which gives them the space to increase the number of people eligible. Some , social care staff have already been referred for tests, he said. He said: We committed to , tests by the end of March, which we hit, then we had previously committed to , by the end of April - I increased that goal to ,. We have hit each of the goals that we have set on testing and we have had the capacity continuing to ramp up this month, the demand has been lower over the Easter weekend as staff havenapost wanted to come forward for testing, which is understandable during a long weekend. But the goal is still to reach , by the end of this month.Meanwhile the Government has insisted it is on track to provide all symptomatic care home residents and social care staff with coronavirus testing - despite appearing to miss its own deadline for expansion.Health Secretary Matt Hancock said testing is available right across the NHS and social care for all those who need it as part of the Governmentaposs coronavirus battle plan. Previous guidance said only the first five symptomatic residents in a care home setting needed to be tested to provide confirmation of whether there is an outbreak. As well as current residents and staff who need it, testing will also be provided to all potential residents before they are discharged from hospital, Mr Hancock said. Earlier, experts said the Government must set out how it will rapidly ramp up testing, or risk its pledge being seen as a  promise. The NHS Confederation, which represents organisations across the healthcare sector, said the countryaposs testing capacity is far from where it needs to be. Dr Layla McCay, NHS Confederation director, said: Things are improving but the countryaposs testing capacity is far from where it needs to be to meet the ambition of , a day in just over two weeks. She added: We need absolute clarity from the Government on how this will be achieved in such a short space of time, otherwise it will be viewed as a  promise. The announcement of the rollout follows intense criticism of the Governmentaposs treatment of the social care sector, with claims it has been forgotten as the disease spread.  Increases in the laboratory capacity have opened up the chance for the Government to expand testing to include all care home residents who develop symptoms, the Department of Health and Social Care said. Testing is vital in calculating accurate infection and survival rates. All of the examinations will be PCRtests, which search for the presence of Covid- in a sample.

Among those applauding have been Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab and other senior Tory ministers. Because of this, thousands have shared a  story - including on the Mirror - that showed Tory MPs cheering as they blocked a full pay rise for nurses.The story isnapost fake news: Tory MPs did vote down a proper pay rise for nurses in  and they did cheer when the vote was announced. However, itaposs inevitable that some details are lost in translation or over the passage of time. So as a public service, hereaposs what you need to know about the vote. What happened on  June  Tory and DUP MPs defeated a Labour amendment to the  Queenaposs Speech in the House of Commons.Among other things, the amendment aimed to call on the Government to end the public sector pay cap and give the emergency and public services a fair pay rise. However, it was voted down by  votes to .  Tory MPs and  DUP MPs voted against the amendment.In favour were  Labour MPs,  SNP MPs,  Lib Dem MPs,  Plaid Cymru,  Green and  Independent.What was actually blocked     The amendment would not have given nurses and other NHS staff a legally binding pay rise. But it would have sent a powerful and, arguably, a morally binding signal that what they were getting wasnapost enough. At the time of the vote, annual pay rises for NHS staff were still capped at the % a year that theyaposd been since . The amendment also called for a number of other things - see below. So did the government refuse completely to give nurses a pay rise   No. Itaposs completely true that at the time of the vote, the government hadnapost confirmed any extra help for NHS staff other than a % rise every year. Thataposs why MPsapos decision angered many campaigners and NHS workers at the time. But the following year, in summer , the government did eventually confirm NHS staff would get a three-year deal worth between .% and %. Critics of the government would argue that it only changed its course because of years of pressure by Labour, including that vote on  June . Meanwhile, No officials had also made noises about changing policy on the day of the vote, only for their message to be mired in confusion.At pm, a Downing Street spokesman said then-PM Theresa May had heard the message of the election and would listen to pay reviews which have branded the cap unsustainable.But pressed for more detail at pm, the Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman in No then told journalists repeatedly: Our policy has not changed.    It depends who you ask. Labour would say itaposs because they didnapost have NHS staff high enough up their priority list - and werenapost prepared to help them after years of Tory austerity. Tories, on the other hand, accused Labour of using the issue as a political football by lumping in lots of other complaints into the amendment. The amendment couldnapost be split into dferent bits, so had to be either approved or rejected all in one go.Then-Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said just before the vote: The party of the NHS is not the party that uses it to milk votes it is the party that fights to make it better for patients.And so it was that Tory whips ordered their MPs to vote against the amendment - and it was defeated. Itaposs worth saying the resounding result came despite some Tory MPs wanting to see nurses get a pay rise. One of them, former nurse Maria Caulfield, said nursesapos pay cannot be right and urged a complete rethink. Why did MPs cheer     The simple answer is - because they won. As explained above, the vote came at the end of a torturous day in Westminster where the debate descended into angry party politics. The government, which had a tiny working majority, was relieved to have won by a comfortable margin. So Tory MPs who cheered were gripped by that party-political excitement rather than deliberately putting across a message to NHS workers. But in doing so they created a scene that, in retrospect, appeared insulting and disrespectful to many NHS workers. What was the full text of the amendment  But respectfully regret that the [Queenaposs] Speech fails to end cuts to the police and the fire service commend the response of the emergency services to the recent terrorist attacks and to the Grenfell Tower fire call on the Government to recruit more police officers and fire-fighters and further call on the Government to end the public sector pay cap and give the emergency and public services a fair pay rise."},{"url":null,"title":"bored mum finds 500 year","story":"NewsBored mum finds -year-old gold coin worth £, in garden with son’s metal detectorAmanda Johnston from Portsmouth dug up a Henry VII Fine Gold Angel coin, worth around £,, after she decided to alleviate her coronavirus lockdown boredom by taking her sons metal detector to the gardenShareCommentsByNatasha RiglerJoseph WilkesReporter:,  APR NewsAmanda Johnston and her spectacular find \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

Amanda, from Portsmouth, Hants, said: “I was using a little hand trowel and my son’s metal detector when I found the coin. “It’s amazing, I just can’t believe it. It’s quite thin but I realised straight away it could be something special. “I’d like to keep it, but then again,it’s worth £,, it’s tempting to sell it!” Mum-of-two Amanda bought George, , the metal detector for Christmas. But while he quickly lost interest, she found herself hooked on “looking for treasure” at the beach. She then decided to try it in her ft by ft garden, which is located in the ‘Moneyfields’ area of Portsmouth. In times gone by, the area was known for providing bricks to build local houses - not money - but she still gave it a go.  Amanda said: “I was bored and just wanted to seeI could find anything interesting. “To begin with, I just kept finding nails. “It was so annoying but then suddenly my detector started sounding really good.  “I’ve only just finished doing up my garden and am quite meticulous about my lawn, so I really didn’t want to dig it up. “But I went down about eight inches and suddenly saw a glimmer of gold. “I thought, ‘Oh my God…is it  I couldn’t believe what I was seeing’.” Amanda uploaded a photo of her find to Facebook and was soon inundated with comments.She said: “Some people didn’t believe I’d found it in my garden. “But I’m asthmatic and haven’t even stepped out onto the pavement for three weeks.  “It’s really got me wondering what  could be out there.” Amanda’s two sons George and Bradley, , are seriously impressed with their mum’s find.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor more information on how we use your data and your data protection rights.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA council chief has come under fire for suggesting a community sewing group could be prosecuted for making vital scrubs for NHS workers battling the coronavirus. With more and more doctors and nurses being called up in the fight against COVID-, hospitals are experiencing a shortage in scrubs - the clothing worn by NHS staff. An army of locked-down sewers across the country are taking to their sewing machines to create the garments - including hats and wash bags. Even the Queenaposs dressmaker - British fashion designer Stewart Parvin - is now producing scrubs for one of the hospitals in the country. But one local group who approached Runnymede Borough Council for help with the huge task were shocked when their request was described as weird by Assistant Chief Executive Peter McKenzie. Mr McKenzie also quoted Health and Safety Executive legislation at seamstress Shân Hughes in an email telling her: Home sewn items, while well intentioned are actually breaking regulation, enforcement could be taken against those knowingly promoting or circulating unregulated PPE. He asked: I am not surethe PPE you are producing is adequate, and who it is for  He ended his email telling Mrs Hughes: Technically all details of anyone producing non-regulated PPE should be reported to them . Mrs Hughes, from New Haw, Surrey, said: I cried when I got Mr McKenzieaposs response - the lack of empathy and threat of prosecution and the fact they didnapost want to seem to help. I felt scared. We want to do something to help all the amazing doctors and nurses and heaposs telling me I could end up in jail. I was disappointed and frustrated. His response still puzzles me. Perhaps Mr McKenzie wasnapost aware with the pleas on social media. Despite what he told us weaposre undeterred and back today carrying on with our work. The Health and Safety Executive told Mirror said that they are continuing to act proportionately to ensure relevant health and safety is balanced against the urgent measures to reduce the spread of COVID.  A HSE spokesperson said: “If this report of the council’s behavior is true it’s sadly way over the top. At this time of unprecedented national emergency, all bodies in a position of authority should be acting with a common sense approach. “Whilst we appreciate the goodwill of those making homemade personal protective equipment , manufacturers do need to meet standards and follow regulatory requirements for production.  “It is the responsibility of duty holdersto ensure PPE provided for workers meets the required standards.” Mrs Hughes asked Mr McKenzie to clary thatthey are asked by a hospital, GP, ambulance station or care home to make scrubs they would have to say no in case the council prosecute us, he replied: We are focusing all our attention on the services we provide to elderly and vulnerable residents. Talking about the great work the sewing community has been doing, Mrs Hughes added: Weaposve been making scrubs for the local hospice and hundreds of scrub wash bags for the local ambulance station, care homes and GP surgeries. For scrub bags and hats weaposre using pillow cases, and for scrub garments weaposre using curtains and duvet covers. Weaposre only using fabric which can be washed at C.  Weaposve been working   hours a day and using the local church as a base. Weaposre making sure weaposre all following the social distancing rules. One of the dficulties is cutting the fabric. It takes longer to cut the fabric than make sets of scrubs. We canapost cut quick enough to keep sewers busy. Ideally, weaposd like to find a laser cutter soanyone can help out then please get in touch. Sourcing the fabric is one one of our challenges.  Itaposs very expensive and in short supply. People are donating it and instead of buying Easter Eggs, people bought fabric which was lovely. A neighbouring council used the Mayoral fund to start fundraising - thataposs why I reached out to our council. I wouldnapost say our request was weird. My question was whether or not the council would be able to help get fundraising started. Having something set up by the council would give credence to the request to the public. Unfortunately there are too many people eager to take advantage of others so it is important that any request has credence and provenance. There are many excellent and willing sewers in the area who want to do something useful to help in this crisis, most have threads and notions but not large quantities of fabric and this is why funds are needed desperately.  A spokesman for Runnymede Borough Council said: “We apologise to Shânshe has been offended by anything that was said in these emails.  We fully understand she was trying to help hard-pressed medics, and we’re grateful to anyone who does so. When residents approach the council for help, they expect and should receive a thoughtful and professional response. An internal investigation led by the Chief Executive will be carried out into the issues she has raised.  “It goes without saying that we support all NHS workers at this incredibly dficult time, but as a responsible organisation we need to be sure any project we are involved in ultimately meets government regulations. However, in the heat of the moment the language may have been ill-advised. We have established procedures in place for investigations, andrequired after a review, we will offer a full written apology.” Mrs Hughes has since received another email telling her that a councilloraposs we has been working hard on this project . Mrs Hughes was told that her request had been highlighted to the Mayor and Runnymede COVID- response team to seewe can support you further. News of sewing community groups up and down the country helping NHS workers comes as the Daily Mirror revealed today that NHS staff have told of being forced to buy protective kit from DIY stores as the supply scandal shaming the Government deepens. Data from a tracker app developed to assess front line shortages in the war on Covid- showed only % of doctors doing high-risk procedures had the right long-sleeved gowns. And % of respondents to NHSppe App, set up by Doctors’ Association UK, had no eye protection at all.

False information can cause panic and stress, as well as potentially endangering peopleaposs health, so doctor Claudia Pastides has made a list of myths to set the record straight. Here are the six myths: Hand sanitizers donapost work to kill coronavirus Doctor Claudia Pastides says: Whilst this is true for a few strains of viruses, for example, the norovirus that causes stomach bugs, it’s not the case with coronaviruses.Using a hand sanitizer that contains at least  per cent alcohol will kill the coronavirus. Pets can transmit the virus too Dr Pastides: There is no evidence that the virus which causes COVID- can be transmitted by pets.That said, it’s still early days and scientists are keeping a close eye on things like this. So you should always wash your hands properly after touching any pets.  Hot baths and hot drinks can kill the virus Once the virus is in your body, itaposs down to your immune system to kill it off, Dr Pastides explains. Hot drinks and hot baths will not be able to reach or kill the virus as it lies within cells inside your body. She says: Your body regulates its temperature very carefully and won’t allow it to raise much, despite hot drinks and baths.The best way to kill the virus,you may have come into contact with it on your skin, is by washing with soap and water or using hand sanitizer. You can prevent the virus spreading by gargling bleach Gargling bleach can cause serious harm to your body and should never be done. Dr Pastides says: Gargling bleach can cause irritation of your mouth and food pipe, sometimes even leading to internal burns. There’s also no evidence that regularly gargling with anythingwill prevent you from being infected by the coronavirus. She adds that bleach can be helpful to stop the spread of coronavirus, but only when being used to disinfect surfaces.

Amy - who is also mum to -year-old Finley, eight-year-old Bean and seven-year-old twins Molly and Isla - said it brought a smile to everyoneaposs faces. The Emergency Medical Dispatcherfor the South West Ambulance Service joked that under normal circumstances, Taylor would have laughed at the idea but due to the pandemic, was happy to get involved. She said: If we were not in lockdown and I’d suggested party food and games to my -year-old she probably would have laughed in my face! We probably would have barely seen her on her birthday so maybe there is some good to come out of lockdown after all.The mum added: Since she grew out of parties, her birthday would usually consist of a family meal and possibly a shopping trip, then she would hang out with her mates and we would barely see her, last year we were all banished from the house! Amy admitted that although the party games and birthday extravaganza was nothing like Amy’s usual celebratory plans, she was thrilled the family spent the special day together. She also said it brought a glimpse of positivity to her day - despite the current global pandemic keeping households across the UK on lockdown.  Mrs Lovell added: Taylor is hating isolation. She has A-level work to contend with, she can’t see her grandparents who she spends a lot of time with usually and she’s missing her mates and strangely her job! She can’t go shopping or do anything she enjoys. She understands most of what’s going on but is struggling to process it. This party was a very welcome distraction for her, hence why the ‘birthday bonanza’ lasted all day. Amy admitted the transformation took a lot of creativity - and while the family spent some money, it was nowhere near how much they would usually spend on birthday celebrations.  She even used some things from her wedding day including sweet tubs and trawled the internet for party games and essentials. They also made homemade signs, played pin the tail on the ‘Taylor’, pass the parcel and tried to eat doughnuts from strings. She said: I was very conscious not to make any special trips so managed to get everything with my essential shopping.Over a few weeks, everything  was bought from eBay, it’s amazing what you can make do with when you have to! I’ve been far thrtier than ever before.Using her imagination and bouncing some ideas off friends and family members, Amy took a few small ideas and ran with them - admitting that her husband puts up with a lot!  She said her daughter’s reaction was unforgettable and the happiest she has seen her since lockdown started. She said: Taylor was probably the happiest I’ve seen her in weeks, she doesn’t very often ‘let go’ it was really nice to see her so relaxed with the others. In just  hours, the Facebook post has already reached nearly  likes and is growing by the minute. Speaking about going viral, Amy admitted she has been overwhelmed by the amazing response. She said: I can’t believe how much hype it has got. It was just a little party and anyone could have done it!

Brandon Fay, from Dublin, Ireland, has spoken about his terrying experience and says he didnapost think he would pull through. The -year-old went into Mater Hospital after contracting the killer bug and has now pleaded with other youngsters to take it seriously. The teen revealed the brutal symptoms which saw him rushed to hospital within  minutes after being tested during a routine check up. He told Dublin Live : I don’t know how I contracted it and don’t think half of the people who have it or had it will know where they have got it from. It’s a virus, you can’t see it. I got my first symptoms on Wednesday th March and went for a regular routine check-up in the hospital on the th. I had a cough and was very short of breath but I just thought it was my asthma acting up. I thought it was pollen in the air but my consultant heard me coughing and got me checked by a nurse. My blood pressure and O levels were high and within  minutes I was isolated on a ward. I couldn’t eat, I lost my appetite, I was finding it hard to breath and was very short of breath. I wasnapost in ICU though so I had no special machinery attached to me. I spent three days in isolation alone and another three days in a ward with two other men who also had COVID -. I was extremely nervous, I felt isolated from the world as nobody could come visit me or see me. Brandon said the staff at the Mater Hospital were phenomenal. He continued: The only people who could come in were nurses and doctors, it was a terrying experience. But the staff at the Mater Hospital treated me like one of their own children and comforted me when I needed them most. They are phenomenal and the work they are doing is just incredible. In my opinion in  drop the Grammy awards and IFTA awards and every award show you can think of and award every frontline staff out there. Within a couple of days, Brandon was released from hospital with healthcare staff able to check up on him while he continued to isolate at home. He added: After my few days in hospital I was released home as I had my own bedroom and bathroom to isolate in and was given a pulse oximeter which connected to my mobile through Bluetooth. This allowed me to check my heart rate and oxygen levels which would send the results directly to the hospital to keep an eye on me.  Dark thoughts continued to run through Brandonaposs head for the duration of his time in the hospital as he battled the terrying virus. He added: When I first went into hospital, all sorts was running through my head. I thought about death, I thought I’d die alone without anyone by my side. But, I was one of the lucky patients, I got through it. I thought because I’m a teenager that I was untouchable that I would never get the virus, I thought it would never hit my doorstep. To the teenagers out there having sleepovers, cycling in groups, going to beaches and hanging out together, ask yourselves, is it worth it  Is it worth spreading the virus  You may be able to fight it but the people you spread it to like your grandparents or parents, will they  "},{"url":null,"title":"voice mirror more austerity would","story":"NewsopinionVoice of the Mirror: More austerity would be a cruel slap in the faceThe tough times\" mentioned by Tory Chancellor Rishi Sunak must not prove to be tough for the key workers keeping the country running - nor for the poor, elderly or disabledShareCommentsByVoice of the Mirror:,  APR Updated:,  APR Newsopinionthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video rishi-sunak-says-economy-face-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news voice-mirror-more-austerity-would-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - politicsSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

Experts have warned lting restrictions too quickly could result in a deadly resurgence of the virus. The WHO wants communities to be made fully aware of the new norm and also wants the NHS to be able to treat every case and trace every contact, which is something it is not currently doing. The WHO criteria in full are: Transmission is controlled Health system capacities are in place to detect, test, isolate and treat every case and trace every contact Outbreak risks are minimised in special settings like health facilities and nursing homes Preventive measures are in place in workplaces, schools and other places where it’s essential for people to go Importation risks can be managed Communities are fully educated, engaged and empowered to adjust to the ‘new norm’ WHO chief Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus said: “While covid- accelerates very fast, it decelerates much more slowly. In other words, the way down is much slower than the way up.  “That means control measures must be lted slowly, and with control. It cannot happen all at once. He added: “Each government must assess their situation, while protecting all their citizens, and especially the most vulnerable. “Control measures can only be ltedthe right public health measures are in place.” Denmark is set to reopen its primary schools from today, while the Czech Republic has already opened some shops.

Landlords themselves were also protected, as they were given a three month mortgage payment holiday on buy to let mortgages.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor more information on how we use your data and your data protection rights.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA mum who didnapost know she was pregnant with twins was left speechless as the second baby was born. Ultrasounds had shown Lyndsey Altice, , was expecting just one child. But two minutes after the arrival of her first daughter, a surprise twin followed. Lyndsey and husband Wesley, , have now shared the remarkable pictures from the birth of their daughters. The mum from Wisconsin, US, can be seen sitting open-mouthed in a birthing pool as midwives handed her a second child that nobody knew was coming. When attending her ultrasound medics never realised she was actually carrying twins. But  minutes after getting in the tub for her water-birth Ada Maze and Billie June were born - with Lyndseyaposs only regret being that she didnapost have a picture of her husbandaposs face when he saw a second baby born. Lyndsey said: I was immediately suspicious when Ada came out so small, I had put on double the weight I did with my last birth so I didnapost understand how she could be so tiny. When I had my son Django a few years previous, he was lbs and I put on less weight with him so it was really odd. There are no words to describe what I was thinking when I realised I was about to have another baby right there and then. The next contraction was almost instant, i knew before the nurses started saying what they thought it was, I could feel the baby coming but could not communicate it through the contraction. The nurse thought it was the water sack which she hadnapost seen happen before so we were all a bit confused.  Then I felt it happening but I couldnapost get the words out, I knew a second baby was coming and then two minutes later there she was. The whole room went crazy, everyone was having conversations with each other, my husband was in shock, my sister was taking pictures and I donapost think any of us had a clue how to feel. I was in pure shock too, I had a million thoughts that I couldnapost process because I was completely overwhelmed so i just submitted to the moment, I think my face says it all. I must have set a world record for how many times someone can scream oh my god in  minutes. Now we have settled in we are so happy, I would not change a thing.  Lyndsey gave birth to her twins last July and her pregnancy showed no signs that she had a second baby growing inside her at any point. She said: I found a midwe when we knew I was pregnant and through the whole pregnancy everything was just like when I had my son, I measured my fundal height which always matched what it would be for having one baby for each week I measured. I wasnapost doing ultrasound because I wasnapost a high risk so unless I needed to,I felt something was wrong for example. When I did have an ultrasound with a sonographer, who did an extensive ultrasound of all four quadrants, it still didnapost show Billie-June.  She even got a recording of her ultrasound, and after having her babies she checked back and still couldnapost see a second baby when she knew both babies were there. Lyndsey said: I think because they were just checking fluid levels and not checking for a second baby, all they saw was that Ada had moved a little. Iaposm surethey were looking for two babies, they would have found two. I even got a recording of the ultrasound and you just canapost see a second baby at all, so even when I look, and know sheaposs there, I canapost see her. When I went into labour they hooked me up to the baby monitor and there was only a reading of one heartbeat.  Now, with the twins coming up to their first birthday, Lyndsey feels ready to share what happened and explains it was one of the biggest, and best surprises she has ever had. She said: When it first happened we were just having a total aposoh crapapos moment, but now that we have settled and we know how to look after twins we just love it. Itaposs a total blessing in disguise, and the kids themselves are great, my son Django adores them and they all get on so well.

As such there are strict rules about leaving the house. Many people are only allowed to go outside for daily exercise or to stock up on necessities such as food and medication. However there are even rules that should be followed when it comes to doing essential shopping, for instance only one person from each household is meant to go to the supermarket. In some cases shops have reportedly tried to clamp down on this, not allowing children into the stores, which can be a major problem for single parents. One single mum recently found herself being shamed for taking her five-year-old daughter to the supermarket with her, but she had no other choice. MaryAnn Fausey Resendez was fed up of peopleaposs reactions to her little girl being in the shop, so she decided to take matters into her own hands. The parent created a sign which she put on her daughteraposs back, informing strangers of their situation. It read: I am only five. I canapost stay home alone so I have to buy groceries with mommy. Before you start judging, stay back six feet. MaryAnn shared a photo of her daughter wearing the sign on Facebook. Alongside the snap she wrote: The sign I made her wear cuz I just know some dumb*** will take a picture and talk s**t on social media not knowing all the facts. Her post quickly went viral, garnering thousands of likes and shares.

The new phone will be the cheapest handset that Apple have released for several years, which even comes with a wireless charger. Apple confirmed the new device would be available from April . Unlike current Apple flagship phones, the new SE also features a Home button and Appleaposs Touch ID fingerprint sensor. The iPhone SE is also based on the same design as the iPhone . This means the new handset will have a .-inch screen, but it will run on the same bionic chip which the iPhone  Pro uses, so anyone who gets their hands on an SE can expect quick speeds. The top-of-the-range iPhone  Pro Max, introduced in September last year, started at £,. The iPhone SE can shoot K video, with a -megapixel wide-angle camera, and is water-resistant, and it has the traditional home button and Appleaposs Touch ID fingerprint-scanning tech. Fans will remember Apple first introduced an SE phone back in , but was discontinued two years ago, but the tech giant has described this new handset as iPhone SE second generation. Prices for the iPhone SE start at £ for a GB handset. It will be available in black, white, and red. The new iPhone SE will be the second cheapest Apple handset, only pricier than the iPhone GS, which was released in .  Speaking about the launch, Phil Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing, said: “The first iPhone SE was a hit with many customers who loved its unique combination of small size, high-end performance and affordable price the new second-generation iPhone SE builds on that great idea and improves on it in every way — including our best-ever single-camera system for great photos and videos — while still being very affordable. Ben Wood, smartphone expert and chief of research at analyst firm CCS Insight, suggested the price and specs of the new iPhone SE would make it an appealing proposition. He said: The new iPhone SE has the potential to drive the next wave of adoption of Appleaposs popular smartphone brand. Its aggressive pricing will challenge not only sales of new Android smartphones but is also likely to affect companies who refurbish and resell second-hand iPhones.  I think consumers will see this new version of the iPhone SE as more affordable than its predecessor. In , there was a  dollar dference between the iPhone SE and a GB iPhone s Plus. In , the new iPhone SE costs  dollars less than a GB iPhone  Pro Max.The announcement comes as the United States and much of the world is reeling from the novel coronavirus, although U.S. political leaders have begun to talk about ending stay-at-home orders and restarting the economy, hoping record deaths andfalling hospitalizations represent a peak.Every previous iPhone has been unveiled in a polished presentation in front of fans, but large events remain banned in Appleaposs home base of Santa Clara County, Calornia, where public officials ordered the first lockdowns in the United States to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.

Matthew Nagy has been living in China with we Serina Yang since before the Covid- outbreak began in Wuhan in mid-December. The couple live in Guangzhou -  miles south of the original epicentre of Wuhan, in the Hubei Province. But they still have had to contend with strict lockdown measures for weeks. And despite the country starting to open up it does not mean le is ing to normal. Speaking on YouTube channel Mr Nagy said: We were locked down for quite a long time, now a lot of the restaurants are open, the schools are going back, all the manufacturing [is starting again]... itaposs all going well. The expat said residents were required to wear masks, undergo temperature checks, provide their passport and details of where theyaposve visited in the last  days and have their mobile phone scanned before theyaposre allowed to enter buildings. You have to wear masks at all times when youaposre out and about of course, Mr Nagy, who works as a furniture company director, said. Except when youaposre eating and drinking - itaposs accepted that you can take them off then. On a visit to a high-end shopping centre they were stopped by a worker who checked their temperature using an infrared thermometer gun. Workers also check an app on their phone which showsthey had visited a Covid- hotspot in the previous two weeks - a similar app is under construction by the NHS although there are data protection fears. Dozens of face mask-clad shoppers were seen making their way around the mall with none coming close to one another. Faces of the NHS heroes who have died during the coronavirus pandemic Mr Nagy said: Everyone has to wear masks here. It sucks, it gets a bit annoying, but you get used to it I suppose. Mr Nagy and Mrs Yang then drove to a nearby restaurant, where they documented the stringent health checks. Two workers in gloves and face masks used thermometer guns to check the coupleaposs temperature again. Mrs Yang told viewers that diners are required to write down their phone numbers and the places they have visited in the past  days. Every second table at the outdoor cafe had signs prohibiting people from sitting there, in a bid to space out diners to stop the spread.  Mr Nagy and Mrs Yang then travelled to the Four Seasons Hotel for afternoon tea, where a worker passed a clipboard into their car to sign. Matt has to fill in this health report before we can go into the building, Mrs Yang told the camera. At the entrance to the hotel lobby, Mr Nagy was required to show his passport to a dferent employee to prove he hadnapost recently flown into China from overseas. Despite all the measures authorities in Guangzhou have started investigating a possible series of community transmission of coronavirus, with the city reporting  cases.

In a stunning YouTube video, the supermarket boss has vented his anger at those who have taken advantage of the desperate rush for basic household supplies amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Branding those who have been panic-buying supplies such as toilet paper absolutely ridiculous, he continued: That is the sort of person that is causing the problem in the whole country.

An email exchange that took place with one of the institution#s staff prior to our interview said that the -year-old embodied #everything that is good about the university#.That doesn#t even begin to cover it. Muriel, who has held numerous roles since first starting  years ago, is warm, friendly and funny. In fact, she#s the sort of person -year-oldme would have loved to have met on my first day at Edinburgh University eight years ago.Although she might not have been able to help me, she has given support to thousands of other students who have passed through the doors of Dundee University over the years.Excluding a -week period in  when Muriel retired # we#ll get to that in a bit # she has been a permanent fixture at the university. In October , she started as a clerical assistant at the faculty of science.At that time the department did #everything# as far as students were concerned, including dealing with inquiry and admissions letters. She stayed in the role until , before moving into a position working directly with postgraduate students.#I loved it,# she explains. #I really enjoyed all the work with overseas students.# Muriel witnessed plenty of changes in the years that followed postgraduate student numbers soared from around  in the early s to , at the turn of the century and new buildings sprung up around the campus.#We moved from Cross Row, onto the seventh floor of the Tower Building, before ending up at Airlie Place,# she says. The busiest time of the year was always that four-month period between June and October, as the team worked constantly to ensure the admissions process ran smoothly.#It was just mad during that time. I was working a lot of overtime, coming to work in the evenings and catching up but I thoroughly enjoyed it.#There were four of us working in the office at one point. We all worked brilliantly together and did each other favours. We still all keep in contact two of them are still at the university.#In  Muriel made the decision to retire, but only managed  weeks before ing to work # this time in a dferent role. She#d passed a remark to a colleague, around six months prior to her retirement, about an ambition to work on the university reception at one stage.#And then, after I was away for  weeks, I got a phone call one morning and he said to me #you once said that you would like to work in the reception. Well, we#re looking for someone now.# ##When can I start # I replied. He said to me, #I think you need to discuss that with your husband# and I said #oh there#ll be no discussion,# she tells me, laughing hysterically.I ask her why she retired in the first place. #I think I just needed a break,# she says.#They were wanting to expand things and change things and they probably felt #well that old soul won#t change.# I felt it was maybe time to hang up the reins and let someone  have an opportunity.# Now, Muriel works part-time from Monday to Friday and loves every second of it. #It#s good to meet people and I think that when you#re older, you need something like this,# she says.#This sitting around the house would drive me mad. We were off for two weeks over Christmas and on that weekend before ing to work, my husband asked me #what are you thinking about going back to work # I said #oh, I can#t wait.#"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.48239187-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.48239187-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.48239187-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.48239187-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"a job for life loyalty to boots has kept mo in her dream role for 40 years","story":"For Maureen McCabe, working as a pharmacy delivery driver is pretty much a dream job. The -year-old recently celebrated  years service at Boots and can#t quite put her finger on what it is that has kept her at the company for so long.She thinks it#s a combination of factors from her love of driving and passion for working with prescriptions, to her friendships with colleagues and relationships with staff working in the surgeries and shops across the city.I ask Maureenshe remembers the date of when she first started working at Boots. It#s clear it is etched in her memory as she tells me without faltering: #January st . I started as a sales assistant in Lochee before moving onto the chemist counter, approximately two years later.#After that, Maureen transferred to the site#s store on Reform Street where she worked on the photo-lab and in the children#s department.Finally, she found her calling and took on the #cushy# van driver role. She#s now been doing that job for  years, and hasn#t looked back once.#I love my job. For some reason, I#ve always loved working with prescriptions picking them up from doctor surgeries and delivering them to stores across the city,# she says.#The thing about this job is you maintain great relationships with the surgeries and shops and you feel really close to all their members of staff.#I#m very loyal to Boots because they#ve treated me so well over the years. Plus, we all work as a team I#m always having a gossip with my colleagues. Instead of getting called Maureen, they call me Mo. There are only two people amongst the shops and surgeries that call me by my actual name. When I come back after a week#s holiday a lot of them say, #oh we#re glad to see you back Mo.# I just love it.#The Monieth resident, who works Monday to Friday from around am to pm, has always gone above and beyond in her role.#The customers used to come in and say #I want Maureen to serve me. She knows what I#m wanting.# I was that good with them. I#ve always had a brilliant rapport with them.#There have been a lot of change over the years, including managers and other things that I think should have just been kept the way they were, but you#ve got to move with the times you have to adapt.#We#re doing things like e-learning now which we never used to have to do. We#ve not been affected by the internet yet, but seemingly it#s coming. Some of the stores, such as the one on Reform Street, send their scripts away and get them back a couple of days later all packed up. So there are changes coming.#I don#t think there is a #hardest# part of my job. I#ve no worries when it comes to doing this role. I think it#s great you#re out-and-about, you#re your own boss.#It#s been a really good time for me, these last  years. I didn#t think I would last it myself, but I have. I don#t know why it came to be that I ended up in this job, but it#s a dream job. I#ve got another two-and-a-half years till I retire andI keep going like this, I#ll be absolutely fine!#"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/04/Duntrune-fire-e1586973619891-1-140x84.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"dundee demand reconstruction talks after lifting lid on spfl stalemate","story":"Dundee have called for reconstruction talks to begin in earnest after lting the lid on their side of the SPFL voting stand-off # but haven#t revealed whether it will be a #yes# or #no# from Dens Park.The Dark Blues today released a y statement detailing their side of the ongoing story that has rocked Scottish football over the past week after days of near silence from managing director John Nelms.In it, the Dens club spoke of clubs being #negatively impacted in two substantial ways# through the SPFL#s resolution proposed last week for which Dundee#s vote is still to be submitted and took aim at the governing body.They called for concrete promises on league reconstruction infor vote in favour of the proposal saying #The centrewill have to accept and support the will of the members# after saying #appetite for reconstruction is there# among clubs across the country.The statement reads: #Good afternoon Dundee fans.  I hope this statement continues to find you safe and healthy as we continue to be quarantined in our fight against the Covid- virus.  The past week has been fraught with anxiety, vitriol, conspiracy theory, and of course a far ranging amount of media conjecture and commentary.  Below is a brief enlightenment of our thoughts and processes over the past week.#Impact of the SPFL resolution:  Relegated clubs were negatively impacted in two substantial ways: the lost opportunity to avoid relegation, and the lost opportunity for financial support.#As we previously stated, the end of the season due to the COVID- epidemic should not result in any club being worse off than they were prior to vote.#In our opinion the SPFL’s “solution” for the league was not a solution for all teams in the league.  Knowing that most teams desperately needed cash flow before the end of April, the quickest and easiest way for the SPFL to achieve that was this proposal however, the result was immediate inequity, and mid-to long-term instability.#Understandably, that was the driving factor for a ‘yes’ vote from many clubs.  Outside of clubs receiving an injection of immediate cash, this was unacceptable to us as we feel the actions of the league should be representative of all its members detrimental impact to one club is ultimately detrimental to all clubs.#Furthermore, the proposal left little prospect for league reconstruction, another signicant aspect of long-term sustainability for Scottish Football.#Whilst the lockdown has resulted in tremendous hardship for the country, one opportunity it has presented, in Dundee FC’s point of view, is the restructuring of the league.#Dundee FC’s vote:  Because of the situation detailed above, it was our intentionto vote ‘no’ on the proposed resolution.#Despite being electronically submitted, for whatever reason, our vote did not reach the centre #We were not aware of that, however, until the SPFL published the ‘results’ of an incomplete vote and it was shown that Dundee FC’s vote was not received.#This raised an immediate red flag for us not only was our vote missing, but we discovered that at least two Premiership clubs had modied their position from the understanding we had the day prior. It was then that we decided to put our foot on the ball and pause.#We conveyed that decision to the centre and ceased taking calls on the subject.  We needed time to develop a clearer DFC view on the situation.#Whilst it is not our responsibility to take the lead on solutions for the league , it is our duty to attempt to ensure that the future of Scottish Football remains promising for all the clubs.#To that end, we have we have worked tirelessly to achieve solutions to help those who were being disadvantaged and sought ways to help them.#We have discussed options with a iety of member clubs to show solidarity to the clubs most negatively impacted by the SPFL proposal.  Relegated clubs must have financial assistance to help soften the landing so they can begin the next season on more equitable footing.#Through our discussions it appears that there is an appetite to provide ious forms of support from other member clubsthese clubs are in fact relegated.  Further details of these acts of kindness and solidarity will be worked out amongst the member clubs.#Also, we are sorry to disappoint all of the conspiracy theorists by saying that we were never exposed to any ‘deals’ from either of the Glasgow giants.  They both acted, as we would expect, with complete professionalism.#Additionally and most importantly for Dundee FC, we spoke to other member clubs regarding their appetite for reconstruction, as the SPFL’s briefing notes does not give us much of a chance and this is the only aspect of any proposal that helps Dundee FC in any way.#There are several things that have to be in place in order to deliver a proper opportunity of achieving a better foundation for Scottish Football’s future.  First, a working group should be assembled and must have members from the highest levels of Scottish Football with long-term interest in the future success of the game.#We need to agree a set of goals that will be the basis of reconstruction which takes into account current and future wants and needs of media member clubs’ financial benefits and sporting integrity as a basis.#It is our belief that after speaking to numerous clubs that the appetite for reconstruction is there and the intention is to set up an immediate and focused working group to take on this task.  The centre will have to accept and support the will of the members.#We do believe the centre has made mistakes in this process, namely not taking into consideration any financial fallout to their member clubs and publishing of the incomplete ballot results, which has put Dundee FC in a position to receive criticism and undue torment.#If what we achieved in our pause was presented by the SPFL in the first instance we would have voted in favour of the proposal.#We would like to thank the fans for their patience, and most of the member clubs for their cooperation and support during this time.  Make no mistake, we continue to have a daunting task ahead of us, but we are encouraged by everyday acts of kindness, resolution, and humanity that we are all sharing as we get through this together.  Stay safe and hope we see you soon in a newly revamped league.#lthr  gtltstronggt🔵 In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to get out for their paper, we are pledging to help readers by providing a FREE digital edition of the Eveningfor three months.

This has been dficult to accept.“The SPFL board and executive freely admit that they focused on the sporting merit of the proposal and did not take into consideration any financial fall out to their member clubs.“Fundamentally, we believe that in these exceptional and uncertain times, no member club should be worse off as a result of this proposal than they are today.“The current proposal will see member clubs cumulatively have in the region of £.-£ million pounds of lost revenue.“Amongst the member clubs there have been numerous discussions of the SPFL’s offer as well as viable, equitable proposed alternatives that could see, potentially, a neutral outcome for all clubs involvedthe season cannot be finished.“In all cases, current placement monies could be distributed to the member clubs in very short order while maintaining all SPFL obligations.“Make no mistake we would have to work quickly and diligently to ensure that members’ current needs are met and that the democratic process is followed, but it is achievable.”An SPFL spokesperson added: “It is very important that clubs consider carefully the resolution and we are grateful to those clubs who have voted already.“With the Ladbrokes Premiership and Ladbrokes Leagues One and Two isions each having approved the resolution, we await the voting slip from the one Ladbrokes Championship club that has yet to vote.“We will provide an update as soon as we are in a position to do so.”The SPFL set an initial deadline of pm for clubs to vote.However it is understood league rules give members  days to vote on resolutions – and Dundee are keen to weigh up their options.It is believed Partick Thistle and Inverness Caley Thistle were the two Championship sides to vote against the plan.As a result, Dundee appear to be in a position to set whichever agenda they please in negotiations with the SPFL.🔵 In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to get out for their paper, we are pledging to help readers by providing a FREE digital edition of the Eveningfor three months.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg. After our meal the sky cleared and it became a beautul sunny day, and everything we had was up on deck drying off or airing. The owner of Rose came alongside and for a good time tried to get us to persuade him to go north against his better judgement, but when we heard he had the lady member of his crew of three sick in her bunk our advice was that he go south and that immediately and reluctantly he was forced to agree and half an hour later he sailed. Hervor also went out about the same time and she turned north and we were to meet her later in Iona."},{"url":null,"title":"worldwide ceilidh community sign up for tunes in the hoose","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCapercaillie founder Martin MacLeod, originally from Oban, and his son, also Martin, have came up with an innovative way to connect musicians from all over the world and allow them to play together for the enjoyment of others.#Tunes in the Hoose# was inspired by Scottish musician, and family friend of the MacLeods, Peter Wood, who was posting videos of himself playing tunes in his home during self-isolation.Having saw the footage Martin senior, called his filmmaker son to askhe had the technology and know-how to put a video together of him playing along to Peter’s video.#I run my own production company based out of Glasgow, so it’s relatively straight forward work for me ,# said Martin Junior.#From that first successful attempt, our new idea was to create an online community for all Scottish musicians to help them connect and continue to play together during these uncertain times.#Housed in Facebook, Tunes in the Hoose amassed over  followers last week with ,+ views worldwide.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

with food bags, recipe bags, and toiletries as well as hot meals and pre-cooked meals.They received donations from local restaurants and food outlets who closed following the lockdown however stocks are diminishing and restrictions on shopping have not helped.Lorna said: ldquoWe are currently using donated foods to give out that we get through Fareshare, from the local store surplus, community donations and we also got a lot of donations from restaurants and food outlets that were closed after government advice which was hugely helpful.ldquoOur food donations are really kind however with shop restrictions in place and stores not having a lot of surplus - our stocks are diminishingquickly.ldquoWe are working closely with thelocal community councils, housing associations, GPs, day centres and health visitors to gain more referrals and reach out to those in need.Ruth Davie, Pennypit Trust manager, who is overseeing the Tranent pantry operations at the moment, has issued an

There are obviously many reasons why you may be thinking about acquiring a new dog.Our receptionist Lesley Baillie ndash who works in both Dunedin Vets branches in North Berwick and Prestonpans ndash recently had to bid farewell to her elderly dog Millie, her companion and friend for many years.Lesley was devastated but knew she needed a companion to fill the void. She began to consider which breed or type of dog would be best for her.The arrival of a new pet is a very exciting time, but careful consideration should be made regarding the type and breed of dog you choose.Many problems we encounter in the practice are a result of purchasing a pet not suited to lestyle and family environment.There are, however, many benefits of owning a pet. Companionship is the most obvious.Having a pet to talk to and interact with can take away many of the stresses of daily le.Taking a dog for a walk provides exercise and helps in creating a healthy lestyle. Having a pet is known to assist in the recovery from illness. In fact, PATdogs are encouraged in some hospital wards to help patients on the road to recovery.Dogs come in a huge iety of breeds, shapes and sizes, so choosing a dog to fit your lestyle can be extremely dficult. It is best to do lots of research before contemplating buying a dog.Many dogs have natural instincts such as herding and guarding, and these should be considered prior to choosing a dog.Also consider how the pup was raised. Were they house or kennel reared There are seven main classes of dogs, each with their own characteristics:l Toy dogs: as the name suggests, they are small dogs but are generally high maintenance and require a lot of grooming. They are, however, dogs and not toys or accessories. Examples: Bichon Frise and Chihuahua.l Utility breeds: there are a iety of breeds in this class but most tend to be courageous extroverts so need good control. Examples: bulldog and Dalmatian.l Terriers: they hunt by instinct and are brave and tough. They may be generally small but require lots of exercise and play. Examples: Border terrier and Airedale.l Hounds: these hunt and can be quite aloof they are quite independent and often like to be with one owner. Examples: bloodhound and basset hound.l Working dogs: as the name suggests, they have specic jobs. They are intelligent and may be quite large and guard dogs. Examples: St Bernard and Samoyed.l Pastoral dogs: these are bred to work with livestock and are very intelligent. They require mental and physical stimulation and tend to be tough and need a role. Examples: Border collie and Belgian shepherd dog.l Gundogs: they find and retrieve game. They have amenable temperaments and are active and affectionate. Examples: springer spaniel and retriever.We cannot, however, forget the crossbreed dogs, which are by far the most popular dogs around. Their nature will depend on their breeding and obviously they come in a huge range of sizes.Nowadays, there a large number of crossbreeds which are designated lsquodesigner breedsrsquo. Breeders will tell all the advantages of these lsquobreedsrsquo, but be aware not only are there advantages attributed to the parents, genetic traits from both breeds may also be present and in veterinary practice, we do see a disproportionately high number of problems with these dogs.There are many questions you should ask yourself before considering buying a dog.l Are there young children in the family  A utility dog, such as a miniature Schnauzer, or gundog e.g. Labrador may be breeds to consider.l Is everyone in the family out of the house during the day  Are you really able to look after a dog  An independent cat may be the best option.l Do you live in a flat  Consider a toy dog, e.g. Chihuahua.l Are you fit and able to go for long walks  Then the working or pastoral dogs should be considered e.g. Border collie or Doberman.l Do you have any fur allergies  Consider some the soft-coated dogs such as poodles.l Do you have a large garden  The terriers enjoy running around in enclosed spaces, e.g. Border or Patterdale terriers.Lesley considered very carefully what breed she should choose.She knew she wanted a fairly active dog who would enjoy long walks and travelling in her campervan with her.She also knew she did not want an overly large breed. She works part-time so wanted a breed which could be trusted to be left for short periods but was also friendly and enjoyed loving, human contact.After much deliberation, Lesley settled on a Tibetan terrier.These are a medium-sized breed originating in Tibet.Despite the name, they are not terriers but actually working dogs.They are therefore very loyal and affectionate but also energetic and sensitive.Tibetan terriers have a mid- coat which is very soft and hypoallergenic so excellent for anyone with animal hair allergies, but does require a good deal of grooming.After searching far and wide, Lesley found a breeder who had just had a litter of puppies.So, after a few weeks and a long journey, wee Hetty arrived home with Lesley.She really is a cutie and was so well behaved when Lesley brought her to the surgery.She is settling in well at home and hopefully she and Lesley will have many happy years and enjoyable adventures together.The rewards of owning a pet are immense.With careful consideration prior to purchasing a pet, you can have a cherished companion for many years to come.Caring for them can sometimes be a challenge but should give great pleasure to owner and pet alike."},{"url":null,"title":"couple-toast-diamond-wedding-anniversary","story":"The message came as a very pleasant surprise for Lyn and Alan Vaughan, who are living in self-isolation on the townrsquos Williamstone Court.Lyn said that, unknown to her, her daughter Julie had made contact with the relevant officials.ldquoThe letter from Her Majesty was as a huge surprise when it arrived, said a delighted Lyn.It was also thanks to Julie ndash though inadvertently ndash that the couple were able to celebrate with  members of their family and friends at a pre-anniversary dinner in La Potiniere restaurant in Gullane a few days before the coronavirus lockdown was imposed.ldquoJulie was going on be on a ski holiday on the actual date of our anniversary, so we had a family lunch at La Potiniere, said Lyn.ldquoDue to the lockdown we canrsquot see them now, so it was very fortunate that we got together that day.On the evening of their anniversary, they joined the applause for the NHS in their road.Lyn, , and Alan, , were both born and brought up in Birmingham.The couple met at a ballroom dancing class and got married three years later on March , .The couple moved to Scotland in the s when Alan was working as a chartered surveyor on the St James Centre in Edinburgh.They moved to Gullane in  and lived there for  years before moving to North Berwick so they could be closer to the railway station as Alan had become partially sighted.As well as Julie and Andrew, the couple had another son Chris, who sadly died in  from a brain tumour.

She dipped her bushy tail into the water then ran back.She stood a safe distance from the flames and then shook her bushy tail, sprinkling the flames with droplets of water. The flames fizzed for a few moments, but it didnrsquot make any dference.So the squirrel ran back to the river and once again dipped her bushy tail into the water and ran back to the fire.Once again she stood a safe distance but shook her tail, and once again sprinkled the fire with small droplets of water.

He didnrsquot live in the forest like the squirrel, but it was important for him as he would use the forest often to eat bark and twigs when there was no grass to eat.ldquoI wouldI could, said the hare, ldquobut the thing is I donrsquot have a bushy tail like you.ldquoHmm thatrsquos true said the squirrel, ldquobut you do have long ears. You could use them.The hare stroked his ears.ldquoSo I do he said, ldquovery well I will do what I can do.And so the squirrel and hare ran to the river.The squirrel dipped her bushy tail into the river, and the hare dipped his ears, collecting as much water as possible.They both ed to the fire, and stood a safe distance away.

What I want to show you is a way we can take advantage of these current habits, to make new habits. So, letrsquos take my example of drinking tea.While Irsquom waiting for my tea to brew, I can practice doing push ups. Over time doing push-ups will become a new habit attached on to my old habit of making tea.PracticeThe next point is, I would like you to think of these exercises as practice not training. In training itrsquos easy to get bogged down by sets and reps but these are not important for practice. In practice, we arenrsquot concentrating on how many reps we can do but rather on the movement itself.Practice is as much about increasing our own body awareness as it is about performing the exercise. Try and do these exercises slowly and with focus. Ask yourself questions like, where am I generating tension in my body now If yoursquore struggling to focus as the exercise is too easy or too hard, each video will show you some iations that you may find easier or harder.FormThe last point I want to talk about is Form.No-onersquos form is perfect when theyrsquore starting out with a new exercise. We all find it dficult doing something new, so donrsquot beat yourself up about it and more importantly donrsquot give up in frustration.Dficulty gives an opportunity to improve.In each of the videorsquos wersquoll give you some pointers to help improve your form. We need feedback in order to make adjustments to improve this form.

The internet means access to sophisticated online archives is only a mouse click away and there are scores of websites offering advice to those hoping to discover their inner Sherlock Holmes.It all makes genealogy ndash and historical research more generally ndash ideal for locked-down Scots seeking mental stimulation at home.The premises of institutions such as the National Library and National Records of Scotland might be shut but thatrsquos no barrier when information can be obtained instantly and from anywhere. Even more importantly, much of it is free.Researching your family treeThere has over the last two decades been an explosion in the range and richness of online content available to those looking to find out more about their ancestors. Public interest in family history has grown just as rapidly.The ScotlandsPeople Centre in Edinburgh , part of the National Records of Scotland, provides online access to births, marriages and deaths, as well as wills, census documents, Coats of Arms and valuation rolls.Fees are charged for viewing some items but, explains Iain Ferguson, Centre Manager, the entire operation has been designed to maximise speed and ease of use.ldquoInstead of the olden days when you had to come in, we now have digitised museum records, he says. ldquoYou just type in a name and year, and the system can search for it in an instant. And you have the opportunity to look up images of records.Of course, the online quest to trace a family tree doesnrsquot have to be limited to big national organisations.Independent websites can also offer a vital helping hand. FindMyPast , one of the largest and best known, gives armchair genealogists access to billions of records and its archive is expanding all the time. Late last year, it announced a new online collection spanning nearly five centuries of Dundee and Angus history. The materials provide names, dates, residences and occupations, as well as photographic documents of streets and people. Many are full colour scans from paper originals.Technology and a certain BBC TV show, says Mr Ferguson, have combined to turbo-charge the popularity of genealogy as a hobby ndash and therersquos no sign of a slowdown.ldquoI would say there has been growth in the number of people being interested in family history, certainly, particularly around ten years ago, when Who Do You Think You Are was on television, he adds.ldquoAnd, as time has progressed, more and more records have been put up by family history societies and so on. People are far more keen. They have a thirst for knowledge.Itrsquos good to talkWhile technology undoubtedly supports the task of discovering an ancestor or their involvement in a major historical event, theres no substitute for conversation with family when it comes to unearthing the most exciting clues.Grandparents, aunts, uncles and, of course, mum and dad should all be among the first ports of call. Even older siblings and cousins can helpelderly relatives have passed away. And video chat apps mean the coronavirus lockdown is no obstacle to enjoying quality, face-to-face contact.ldquoTalking to your family is hugely important, says Tahitia McCabe, Genealogical Studies Postgraduate Programme Course Director at the University of Strathclyde.ldquoItrsquos the way you get the juicy bits - the stories and all the interesting stuff. Genealogy is about bringing history, people and places to le.ldquoThe official records donrsquot tell you the lsquowhyrsquo. They can only really capture the interface with governments and organisations, all the formal things that happen in your le. But there are lots of things that happen that donrsquot get captured in a formal way.Moving the focus of genealogy beyond official records and on to real human relationships is crucial to its wider appeal, says Ms McCabe, adding that the number of people under  attending her courses is definitely ldquocreeping up.The broader pictureAn accurate record of inidual events is vital but so is context - and few institutions are better equipped to provide this than the National Library of Scotland .Its huge multi-media archiveis a gold mine for digital genealogists and historians of all ages, particularly those seeking information about ancestors caught up in the two world wars.Lists of officers enrolled in the army, navy and air force, and an extensive collection of black-and-white photographs from the Western Front, are available free of charge. Also on offer are clan histories, maps and a moving image archive containing footage from communities across the country. Lucy Church, NLS reference services assistant, says such resources are vital for adding a social dimension to the raw information set out in documents such as birth, marriage and death certicates.ldquoPeople use [our collection] to find out about specic iniduals but what itrsquos best for is the bigger picture ndash social and local history, for example, she adds.ldquoWhat we have available has vastly increased in recent years. Since the internet has been available, the archiving world has really engaged with it - and how we can provide a service through it.Stressing that staff are always on hand to assist home users in dficulty, she says: ldquoIf you think of institutions like ourselves, the National Museum of Scotland, National Records ndash they all have really excellent websites. The best way [for people] to familiarise themselves with the collection is to have a look and just be guided by what their particular interest is.Parents in particular will find Scotlandrsquos major cultural institutions invaluable when theyre trying to keep children busy. The NLS website features a wide-ranging learning zone with materials about topics such as the womenrsquos suffrage movement.The Battle of Prestonpans Heritage Trust, meanwhile, has created dedicated online resourceswhich its leaders hope will inspire youngsters to create prose, poetry and art about Bonnie Prince Charliersquos famous victory in  over a government army led by Sir John Cope. Entries will be published online and organisers hope to include as many as possible in a special commemorative book to mark the battlersquos th anniversary.Also offering online home schooling assistance is the National Wallace Monument, which has launched a video series to help young people learn about William Wallace and the Wars of Scottish Independence. Available at www.nationalwallacemonument, it is aimed at children aged between  and  who are encouraged to watch the videos and answer questions based on the content.Catherine Morrison, Learning and Volunteer Co-ordinator at Stirling District Tourism, says: ldquoUsually, Irsquom hosting trips for school children at the Monument, or visiting schools to teach them all about William Wallace. These are things wersquore not currently able to do, but we wanted to do something to support parents and keep their children learning about history.Sidebar ndash top tips for the budding genealogist Start with what you know. Begin by writing down everything you know about your family ndash names, dates of birth, places of residence. Evenall you have are rough dates and more questions than answers, itrsquos a place to launch your project. Talk to your family ndash do this sooner rather than later. If elderly relatives have all passed away, try older siblings or cousins. Search official records. Generally, yoursquoll want to try and obtain birth, marriage and death information for your ancestors and anyone  on your tree that is of interest. Plus, finding them on available census records is of primary importance. Itrsquos best to start as close to the present as possible and work your way back. That way you can usually very facts with your memories and records, or by checking with other family members. Once you have built up your skills, keep going! You could get involved in new projects such as a transcription or indexing project in your spare time. This is a great way to expand skills in deciphering old handwriting. It also supports the genealogy community as a whole."},{"url":null,"title":"Marianne Taylor  Patel and Hancock should stop their insults and tell us the truth","story":"Clarity and tone are important too, of course,the human brain is to start processing dficult, often overwhelming information. Simple language, delivered calmly and directly, has the best chance of sinking in.Honesty, clarity, calmness and directness have never been more vital than now, as we try to take in the enormity of the coronavirus crisis and its consequences. And yet many of our leaders are showing themselves to be woefully, shamefully, sometimes even deliberately incapable of giving straight answers to some of the most fundamental questions.The public accepts that scientists and medics do not yet understand every facet and quirk of this virus. But there is simply no excuse for the disgraceful lack of honestly and clarity around many issues that politicians can control.If ever there was a time for politicians be direct with people, this is it. We do not want obsequiousness, we do not need the pill to be sugar-coated. Donrsquot patronise or insult us. Just tell it like it is, even when itrsquos bad. Especially when itsbad. Be honest when ministers get stuff wrong, or when they donrsquot know the answer to something. Be up front when the system is struggling to cope tell us what work is being done to remedy failures and give us a realistic assessment of whether the action will be successful.:Home Secretary lsquosorrypeople feel there have been failings over PPE supplyrsquoWe badly need a new, more direct approach, particularly from the UK Government, one that is better able to encompass the eye-popping statistics and harsh truths created by coronavirus.The current information vacuum grows more worrying by the day. After all, there is still no reliable death toll, no UK or Scottish stats that include care home and community deaths as well as those that took place in hospital. Grieving relatives are left to tell their stories on social media, devastated that their loved-onersquos death doesnrsquot seem to count, distressed at the lack of knowledge or discussion around care home guidelines.There is still no honest or plausible explanation for why so few coronavirus tests are taking place, or why tracing ndash which has helped Germany and South Korea keep deaths down ndash was abandoned so early on. It cannot be unrelated that no minister or official dares to explain why the death toll in the UK is on course to surpass that of Italy and Spain, despite having had more time to prepare. People in England are dying of Covid- at . times the rate of Ireland, which has a comparable number of ICU beds per head of population.Theses and explanations already exist, of course, but are not judged by politicians to be politically expedient or comfortable. And thatrsquos how you end up with the likes of Home Secretary Priti Patel, the coldest fish this side of Greenland, issuing a textbook  apology ndash ldquoIrsquom sorryYOU feel there are failings ndash at a recent daily briefing. This chastising tone is an insult to us all, not least the dead and bereaved.Indeed, the defensive insults are starting to stack up. Over the weekend Ms Patelrsquos cabinet colleague Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, made the contemptuous suggestion that the continuing shortage of personal protective equipment at the frontline could be down to doctors and nurses over-using it.And while some sections of the media choose to focus unhealthy amounts of attention on one particularly well-known Covid- patient, offering a running commentary on his recovery complete with sudoku, texts from his girlfriend and the films he is watching from his hospital bed, it is left to others to highlight the far bigger tragedies already emerging from this crisis.As Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis pointed out in a blistering attack on the patronising and ldquomisleading language being used by some ministers during the crisis, we are not all in this together.

The Nobel Prize-winning scientist, Sir Paul Nurse, currently director of the Francis Crick Institute, criticised the policy of carrying out all the tests centrally in public health labs.

About the same time as we started our lockdown it was enforcing a -day isolation for anyone coming in and then moved to virtually stopping flights. Did we stop flights or enforce any restrictions on entry  Not that I am aware of. New Zealand at the time of writing has had only four deaths.Why do we seem to be unable, many weeks into a crisis we knew was coming, to get front line staff the PPE they need, yet industries which could adapt and supply it are apparently not being contacted by Westminster Why have several European countries been able to test people at substantially higher rates than us when our frontline staff are crying out for tests Hopefully when the crisis is over some sort of independent inquest into handling of crisis will take place to see where we went wrong, why we went wrong and put processes in place to ensure we are ready when perish the thought it happens again.Douglas Jardine, Bishopbriggs.IN response to Marianne Taylorrsquos diatribe against the UK Health and Home Secretaries , may I suggest she considers these points Anent the UK-wide shortages and or uneven distribution of test kits, ventilators, masks, and other personal protective clothing or equipment, it is not ldquothe Government, whether Scottish or UK, that should be the prime target of blame.Surely within days of Chinarsquos admission of the facts  weeks ago on January it was up to the top management in the NHS and public health authorities throughout the UK to instruct their procurement departments to order up these items immediately in anticipation of a near-worst case scenario Did they do so, andnot, why not  Our health services are not run directly by the Departments of Health and reports say that Public Health England employs more than  staff on more than pound, per annum.Sir Simon Steven, CEO of NHS England, has been almost invisible since the outbreak, appearing only once at No. rsquos afternoon press conferences, but was not even asked that question.We have confusing messages from the scientists and medicson the effects of flights still arriving into the UK with no controls or quarantine requirements, and even on the efficacy of testing at all and only now do we seem to be issuing instructions on the correct use of PPE.The NHS and Public Health England wanted to restrict testing to their own facilities, rather than as in Germany to include academic and private laboratories.

And we are reminded that Covid- was spread internationally by the easy-travelling, ski-resort wealthy, in Europe and the US. Whatrsquos become obvious in the past two weeks is that our opinions of others, particularly the rich, famous and powerful, will be framed by their behaviour in this new war against a pandemic.Whatrsquos clear is thatthose with cash continue to behave in a crass, disconnected manner, they will become history.Ricky Gervais reflected public opinion yesterday when he complained of the celebrities who live in large mansions and whine about isolation.Gervais believes healthcare workers, such as nurses and porters, should be given more recognition then added: ldquoI see someone complaining about being in a mansion with a swimming pool. And, you know, honestly, I just donrsquot want to hear it.Nor do most of us. The father in the Great War poster is being depicted as a man of shame because he decided not to enlist and fight for his country.The likes of singer Sam Smith who whine about being stuck in a multi-roomed mansion are examples of those who have yet to enlist with reality.The crassness of the utterly disconnected Madonna news reports of dying doctors and nurses and bus drivers ndash and still remain entirely self-absorbed Our top footballers, too, are facing a kicking. We have , people in Britain dead and it beggars belief that those who are being paid poundk a week refuse to take a pay cut.Yes, pundit Gary Lineker is right when he says: \"Why not call on all the wealthy to try and helpthey possibly can rather than just pick on footballers \"But why not have footballers lead by example, Gary  And how much of your poundm a year ndash plus crisp earnings ndash are you offering up to food banks Not all footballers face opprobrium, however. Heroes have emerged such as Newcastle United youngster Matty Longstaff who has given  per cent of his pound a week salary to the NHS.And Rangersrsquo so-called bad boy Alfredo Morelos, who is now working in Columbia delivering food parcels to the poor and giving up a sizeable amount of his earnings.But in the future, it will be hard not to see celebrities through their corona response. It will be hard not to think of the Beckhams ndash happy to post social media pics from their beautul Cotswold home ndash without thinking: \"What I really want to know is how much you are kicking in the direction of vaccine initiatives or PPE \"If itrsquos nothing, I will be angry for ever.The War Office was morally wrong in many ways: it demanded men be led to slaughter by those who placed a low value on human le. And fathers being dead means quizzical daughters have an altogether dferent set of questions to ask.But the poster was successful in asking broader questions, about togetherness, about shared responsibility.And the coronavirus is certainly making us ask who our heroes are right now, people we can look up to. There are some obvious ones: the health and care workers, those who work in the trenches of public service. At a political level therersquos the commanding, compassionate Jacinda Ardern in New Zealand and Andrew Cuomo in New York.Letrsquos hope the likes of Sam Smith and Gary Lineker and his mates will be able to hold their heads up when the kids start asking the questions.Shops across Scotland are closing.

However, it is understood that around , businesses have made inquiries regarding the loan scheme.The banking body stressed that other applications were still being processed and were \"expected to be approved over the coming days\".It explained lower staffing levels at banks and other lenders meant they had come under signicant pressure from increased demand for support from business customers.Stephen Jones, UK Finance Chief Executive, said: \"Frontline staff in local branches and call centres are working incredibly hard to help firms access finance as quickly as possible amid unprecedented demand.\"Like all businesses they are working at reduced capacity as many staff are self-isolating or looking after family.\"Rishi Sunak commented: \"Getting finance to businesses is a key part of our plan to support jobs and the economy during this crisis and were working with lenders to ensure support reaches those in need as soon as physically possible.\"Loan approvals have doubled in a week with more than , businesses benefiting from over pound.bn of loans and its vital we continue this upward trajectory,\" added the Chancellor.But Labourrsquos Ed Miliband insisted the Government loan scheme was ldquosimply not working well enough, pointing out how more than , Swiss businesses received poundbn in loans in just one week.ldquoWe need change now, declared the Shadow Business Secretary. ldquoThe Chancellor must move to a  per cent guarantee of loans for smaller businesses as other countries have done. In this economic emergency, it is the right thing to do.He went on: ldquoIn the coming days, businesses are facing critical decisions about their future.\"Ministers must also accelerate the approval of new financial providers, do more to simply the application process and provide support for good, future growth businesses not currently in profit. There also needs to be a loans scheme for larger businesses with turnover over poundm.\"The OBRs grim scenario for our economy shows why we must do everything we possibly can now to protect jobs and businesses,\" he added.Drew Hendry for the SNP said: \"The UK Government needs to provide the urgent support that businesses need during the coronavirus crisis. The roll-out of the emergency loan scheme is far too slow and too many businesses are not getting the cash they require to stay afloat.\"In other European countries support for business has been rolled out far quicker. After weeks of waiting, it is time for the Chancellor to step up and provide more direct support, speeding up the process and providing more grants not just loans.The partyrsquos business spokesman said it had welcomed the announcement of the emergency loan scheme as an important first step back in March but it was now clear it was not working in practice and the urgent cash injection that the business community had called for had still not been delivered.\"The , businesses that have received support are a tiny fraction of the millions of small and medium businesses in the UK, declared Mr Hendry. ldquoMany businesses arent getting the urgent cash they need to pay the bills and could go to the wall unless support comes quickly.He added: \"The SNP will continue to press the UK Government to ensure businesses to get the support they need during this unprecedented emergency - but it is clear that we need to see much more support delivered without further delay.\""},{"url":null,"title":"keir-starmer-calls-end-labour-factionalism-leaked-document-laid-bare-party-splits","story":"Sir Keir said the party must unite and concentrate on getting Labour into a position to form the next government.The leak of the document reignited Labours bitter civil war between left-wing supporters of Mr Corbyn and the partys centrists.The -page leaked document found \"no evidence\" of anti-Semitism complaints being handled dferently from other forms of complaint or of current or former staff being \"motivated by anti-Semitic intent\".However, it found that \"factional opposition\" in the upper echelons of the party towards Mr Corbyn contributed to \"a litany of mistakes,\" which hindered the effective handling of the issue.Sir Keir said: \"This is a leaked report into what was apparently happening before I became leader. I was shocked by what I saw and the circumstance in which it all came about.\"Thats why I have ordered an inquiry, which I want to be professionally done, independently done and quickly done, because our party needs to unite and face the future and get back to our historic purpose, which is getting a Labour government in so that we can actually change lives for millions of people for the better.\"He told BBC Radio rsquos Today programme: \"We absolutely have to turn our back on factionalism and that was the whole basis of my leadership campaign.\"Allies of Mr Corbyn claimed the document showed that elements within the party hierarchy undermined efforts to win the  General Election.The Socialist Campaign Group of Labour MPs - including former Shadow Cabinet Ministers Diane Abbott, John McDonnell and Richard Burgon - has called for the document to be officially published with an emergency meeting of Labours ruling National Executive Committee to consider its findings.It said: \"It contains revelations of senior officials undermining the  General Election campaign and suggests there are cases to answer on bullying, harassment, sexism and racism.\"Mr Corbyns constituency partys Twitter account said the NEC should \"recommend urgent changes of party structure and staffing practices to guarantee our HQ campaigns on Labours socialist policies\".Len McCluskey, General Secretary of the Unite union and a close ally of Mr Corbyn, said the whole Labour movement would be \"shocked\" by the revelations contained in the leaked report.Writing for the LabourList website, he said: \"Even those of us well aware of the dislike many officials held for Jeremy Corbyns leadership did not imagine that their bile would go so far as actively wishing for - even working for - Labours defeat in elections, including the  General Election.\"Every activist will remember how agonisingly close we came to defeating Theresa May then. I have no doubt that had the party leadership enjoyed the full-on support of all Labour MPs and of Party HQ, both of which it had the right to expect, the result would have been closer still.\"Let us be clear what the officials whose cynical, abusive and factional conduct has now been exposed were actually doing. In working for a Labour defeat, they were working for a Tory victory that is to say, empowering the party that stood for austerity and a hard Brexit.\"These politically-crooked officials were prepared to risk dramatic damage to the interests of the British economy and working people just in order to scratch their factional itch, declared Mr McCluskey.He went on to say some of these officials had secured peerages or been dubbed this-or-that of the British Empire for services to the Labour Party.ldquoIf they are to keep these distinctions at the very least the citations should be changed to services to the Tory Party.He added: \"I know there are tens of thousands of Labour Party members, many of them also in my union, whose dismay at these revelations may lead them to wonder why they should stay in a party where such things can happen. Let me urge them to remain with the party and get behind our newly-elected leadership as they handle this crisis.\"The GMB union branch representing Labour Party staff welcomed the inquiry ordered by the new leadership into the report, saying in a statement: \"We are deeply concerned with the report and the means by which it was commissioned, created, and made public.\"It is also disappointing that much of the report erts from the scope of its declared intention, which was to look into the Labour Partys response to anti-Semitism.\"It is also extremely worrying that the report contains transcripts of private conversations between staff on private accounts, using personal equipment.\"We agree some of the selected comments attributed to senior staff are absolutely indefensible it is worth noting that they are not being seen within context and some comments attributed are being flatly denied.The union said it was also unacceptable that staff members across all levels had had their private communication accessed and their names leaked publicly.\"The Labour Party would rightly not accept this level of surveillance and intrusion into private conversations of staff in any other workplace and we believe it, therefore, should never countenance such practices in the party, let alone authorise them.\"This is causing immense stress for those workers as well as colleagues, who are not named but now feel a deep sense of mistrust toward their employer,\" it added."},{"url":null,"title":"number-people-worldwide-infected-coronavirus-tops-2m","story":"It is less than two weeks since the global number of cases reached one million.The latest figure from John Hopkins University in Baltimore, which has been tracking the global pandemic, came as the number of UK hospital deaths was announced as having risen by  to ,.While the estimated number of infected people worldwide has reached ,, with just under , deaths, the true numbers are almost certain to be much higher given the levels of testing y from country to country.Records suggest the US has the highest number of cases and deaths at , and , respectively.

However, it is important that the Scottish Government explains what consideration has been given to these proposals and the rationale for adopting a dferent approach.“I have therefore written to the Health Secretary, Jeane Freeman and First Minister asking for that clarication. I have also sought confirmation as to whether the Scientic Advisory Committee has been asked for its comments on Dr Pollock’s proposals. If not, I certainly hope that this will now happen.“As soon as I have received a response from Ms Freeman, I will share this widely with constituents.

If someone is threatened by cattle, they are encouraged to release your dog and take the shortest route out of the field. As always pick up and remove all waste. A government spokesman said: #This is a temporary situation and it is more important now than ever to maintain good relationships between neighbours and within communities. This is not about restricting the general right of responsible non-motorised access to land but it is part of the wider approach to prevent COVID- deaths and preserving the nation’s food supplies.#Exercising access rights responsibly means respecting the needs of other people, and you will need to adapt your behaviour accordingly in the national effort to contain the spread of COVID-. Land managers should respect access rights, which are particularly important at this dficult time.

Considering his past record as a caring inidual, including his efforts to help the homeless, that was not really surprising.But apart from manager Daniel Stendl, who waived his salary, others at the Edinburgh club appeared reluctant to follow Naismith’s example. Reports later suggested that no other Hearts player would be asked to take more than a  per cent reduction.Also last week it was claimed that Scotland manager Steve Clarke had accepted a  per cent cut, simply meaning his salary would go down from £, to £,.In England the men’s and women’s international bosses Gareth Southgate and Phil Neville apparently agreed to take  per cent less. In the former’s case he would still be pocketing £. million while Neville would get £,.At club level south of the border the situation is very inconsistent. Some managers, such as David Moyes, Eddie Howe and Graham Potter have volunteered to take a cut while Pep Guardiola donated a million euros to help fight the outbreak in Spain. There was a terrible poignancy to Guardiola’s generosity a few days later when it was reported that his -year-old mother had died as a result of the virus in Barcelona.But while most Premiership clubs have placed most non-playing staff on some kind of temporary leave, some receiving  per cent of their salary through the government’s job retention scheme, the situation with the majority of players is still unclear.This is a dficult situation and UK health minister Matt Hancock ruffled some feathers when he suggested that well-off footballers should consider doing more to help.Some journalists have even criticised Hancock, saying he was completely out of touch with what was actually happening. That was unfair. The minister was not speaking about the game in general, where players at lower-level clubs are paid a pittance compared with those at the top. He was merely highlighting the fact that many could easily survive with no pay at all for the foreseeable future.To put this in perspective, most players at Premiership level are earning several million a year, an increase of roughly two and a half times what they took home six years ago. A high proportion are on more than £, a week.At the top of the tree are Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea and Man City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, who are on over £ million and £ million respectively.Even a player I confess to never having heard of, Tanguy Ndombele of Tottenham Hotspur, is reportedly bagging £. million a year.In the Championship the average annual pay is considerably less, around £, a year or £, a week. And in the lower League Two it drops to £ or £ weekly, not all that much above the national average.During the current situation all these figures need to be taken into consideration. We should have no issue with lower-paid players still getting  per cent of their wages for doing nothing. They, like everyone , still have bills to pay.But for the multi-millionaires to grumble about being hit is about as hard to take as the coronavirus pandemic itself.: : : : : : : :No decision has yet been made about whether the football leagues in the UK will be completed, whenever the action begins again.In Scotland it has been proposed in some quarters that the title should just be handed to Celtic, as the Glasgow side had an almost unassailable lead when play stopped.Now a director of the other half of the Old Firm has suggested thatthat happened, their rivals would only be able to claim “eight and a half” in a rowthey were crowned champions.Personally I feel that this season’s scheduled fixtures should be played out, however long it takes.

The shot was clearly going just wide of the upright before Fraser MacDonald inadvertently erted it into his own net for a bizarre opener.”Under the canny guidance of manager Angie Murchison, Skye’s useful blend of youth and experience continued to revel on the big stage. Youngsters like Somhairle Macdonald, Ewen MacSween, John MacLean and Allan MacLeod had established themselves along with several survivors of the  team – Cowie, Willie MacRae, Peter Gordon, John ‘Bodach’ Mackenzie, Ally MacDonald and Ewen MacKinnon.With  minutes played the islanders doubled their advantage.McCormack takes up the action: “John MacLean delivered a corner into the danger area, and with keeper Kenny MacDonald under pressure Cowie took two attempts before slipping the ball over the line as he tumbled face-forward onto the pitch”.Skye’s fans were in dreamland but, as the reporter had noted: “Kyles are famous for their battling qualities”.By half time the match was level.From a powerful hit in from the right the ball broke to veteran Dan MacRae “who had time and space to place the shot beyond the reach of keeper MacKenzie.”Then, calamity struck Skye in the closing moments of the half.“Another massive hit in by Tom White caused panic in the Skye defence, and as MacKenzie lashed out in an attempted clearance the ball appeared to come back past him off team captain MacSween”.Seconds later it took an outstanding save from MacKenzie to deny Dallas Turner and prevent Kyles from turning around in the lead.Murchison’s men regrouped.“The second half had been underway less than  seconds before Skye retook the initiative thanks to a corner which was turned in by Cowie, with Peter Gordon hovering to pick up on any mistake.”For much of the second half Kyles were kept well away from the Skye danger area, but a fourth goal proved elusive – thanks in large part to legendary goalkeeper Kenny MacDonald.And with Skye just eight minutes away from sealing a place in the final the men in blue hauled themselves back from the brink.Our reporter said that Dallas Turner “had looked the likeliest threat” and it was the youngster who “saw a glimmer of an opening and fired in a shot which took a deflection and flew past Bodach MacKenzie and into the net”.“That was the signal for the islanders to lay siege to the Kyles goal and for the Tighnabruaich keeper to dig dep with a string of exceptional saves.”MacLean, Somhairle MacDonald , Gordon and Cowie were all denied before the whistle sounded to herald extra time.In “energy-sapping heat” it was hardly surprising that the added half hour was more low-key, but five minutes into the second period came a “glorious chance” for Skye.Referee Donne Fraser spotted an infringement in the area, and the islanders were awarded a penalty.Rankin stepped up, but was unable to make clean contact and the “scuffed spot hit was easily turned away by MacDonald”.And so to a penalty shoot-out. Both goalkeepers excelled themselves, MacDonald saving two, and MacKenzie doing likewise. With Kyles - ahead, Rankin had to score to force sudden death, but his shot sailed wide and it was Kyles who went through to the final.Ian McCormack concluded: “Rankin was hero as well as villain. Once he got the measure of Ronnie MacVicar he dictated play from the centre, giving a hundred per cent in effort and running himself into the ground in the process. Up front Willie Cowie was immense – especially for a player just back from injury.“And while the defence as a whole were tight, Willie MacRae at buckshee back gave another award-winning performance.“If there was a man of the match award it would undoubtedly have gone to Kyles keeper Kenny MacDonald, who had excellent cover from full back Fraser MacDonald.“Their most dangerous forward was Dallas Turner, while that veteran Dan MacRae showed he still has a few seasons left in him at the top level.”In the final Kingussie, in the middle of a run of seven-successive Camanachd Cup triumphs, proved too strong, though Kyles gave a good account of themselves and had taken the lead before succumbing to a - defeat.The redoubtable Kenny MacDonald was the final’s man of the match, but his remarkable career had still some way to run. Both he and namesake Fraser # the full back in the epic tussle of  – would again pick up winners’ medals in , by which time Kenny’s son Roddy had also emerged as a star of the sport.For Skye the wait for another shot at the big one goes on – with the club also missing out in semi finals in  and .Allan MacLeod, the current Skye co-manager, reflected on that game at Ballachulish – recalling that he played much of the first half without a contact lens.“I remember marking Dan MacRae – a fantastic player. But it was great chance for us.“We were the better side for much of it, but not for the first time Kenny MacDonald was the saviour for Kyles.“At the time Kingussie were virtually unstoppable and we’d have met them in their prime. Our chance of winning the cup may have been slim, but it would have been nice to have made the final.“A lot of that Skye team would have deserved a shot on that stage.”The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Covid-19.jpg","title":"details of covid 19 case on skye leaked to the free","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineAs of Friday th April, there were a total of  confirmed cases in the NHS Highland area, but the health board have not released any further details on where the cases originate.Amid fears that some people might still consider rural areas to be isolated and virus free, there have been calls for greater clarity on where cases are.

It was a Saturday afternoon and the game was a supposed friendly against Rothienorman.“Back then I was a hard man, or so I thought! I was up against a burly young farmer-type at centre-half. I had a couple of robust challenges with the lad and he warned me that next time he was having me! Two minutes later he came in from behind and elbowed me in the head, I shrugged it off and instead of walking away I turned around and said: #You ain’t big enough to put me down, kid.# The next thing I knew, the birds were tweeting around my head and my front teeth were missing!“The game was abandoned and I had to go to the emergency dentist that afternoon and had months of repair work afterward. He had to pay my dental bill and a £ fine. Torquil Mackenzie # a name I will take to my grave!” “I can#t remember how far back it was but it was a while ago — it was a cup final up in Uig against Portree. The game went to extra-time # we had Bruce Neil and Paul Flynn sent off but ended up winning something like -.“I remember John ‘Spod# Macleod scoring a goal and running up the touchline with his hands cupped over his ears to the once noisy Portree support who had given him dogs# abuse during the game. That lives long in the memory!” “It won#t come as a surprise to learn the best match was the title-winning game on th August , for many emotional reasons. We had a great campaign that year and had won  out of  games with only three matches remaining. We had to go to Kyleakin away on this date and they were the only team who could catch us in the title challenge.“It was a really nice summer evening and we had a strong team out, although leading striker John Murphy was unavailable through injury which meant young James Pringle played upfront with Craig Brown.“Kyleakin got out of the blocks quickly and we found ourselves - down early on in the match in front of a big crowd. We settled after that and played some decent stuff but Kyleakin, as usual, were well marshalled by Michael Taylor and we had dficulty in creating clear-cut opportunities. However, with  minutes to go, coach Ian MacLeod and I decided to put youngsters Ian Morrison and Angie MacPherson on each touchline to give us pace and width. The freshness seemed to galvanise us and with  minutes to go, we pulled a goal back through Craig Brown. It seemed the whole match swung on that goal, we picked up some real momentum and Brown scored again to equalise. Then with five minutes to go, we were awarded a penalty with two Kyleakin defenders tackling Brown as he broke into the box. Craig dusted himself down and scored the penalty in off the post # we were delirious on the sidelines. We saw out the game for our first-ever title and then won the remaining two games to make it  wins from  matches # it was a campaign never to be forgotten!” “It was my first game in charge, and funnily enough, it was also against Kyleakin. In those campaigns it was always the case that the first game of the season in the Bagshaw League pitted the reigning champions against the team which finished bottom the season before. The bottom club then had to play the runners-up from the previous season and so on, so it was very dficult for the clubs at the bottom to gain any early momentum.“We went down to Kyleakin with a whole bunch of youngsters against the likes of Scott Graham, the Nisbett clan, Darren Wainwright # who were all top players in the league at that time. We lost - and I swearit wasn#t for our young goalie Calum Montgomery making one save it could have been . But in essence, that is where I started from in management.

The places where one would most clearly feel the presence of spiritual community are cut off – never mind that a pandemic might tempt one to question faith in any deity. Here in the Highlands many still can access the temple of nature, but for some even that temple is essentially out of bounds. We are exiled in our own homes.The theme of exile for some wrong-doing – not necessarily a penance but for something perceived as wrong by others – is, of course, international, never more so than right now.In the Gàidhealtachd, however, with a history of mass emigration, exile retained a particular relevance well into modern times. So I have gone to Tobar an Dualchais and to Dugald Buchanan, forthere was anyone who understood the agony of spiritual exile and the loneliness of doubt and fear and who grappled with them with profound courage, it was him.Buchanan lived from -, part of the time among the broken men of Rannoch, amongst whom he taught and preached. He was sent by the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge in . He was to be a teacher and a catechist: the catechism was a sort of question and answer method of teaching religion, and its spiritual values.The place Buchanan was sent to was Kinloch Rannoch, and it was in dire need of religion and spiritual values. It was on the edge of Rannoch Moor and was so remote that all the rejects of society – outlaws, dispossessed and banished, had gathered there, as far from the law as possible.The broken men of Rannoch were a people destitute and desperate. In ministering to these last vestiges of society, Buchanan was working at its roots, not certainthey were strong or rotten, not certainhis own motives were good or bad.In Buchanan’s imagery, we engage powerfully with a Dante-esque poetic imagery:Each limb, each member – foot and hand, that ever buried were in land or sea or battle-field, shall come together. Loud is the noise among the bones, each coming to its place..In the five verses Robertson has chosen out of one hundred and twenty-one, the last trumpet is heard and the mountains pour out lava.“Quench your thirst with it, you horders of gold”. The sun is in mourning, the moon steeped in blood, the stars are shaken.The poem is terrying, and the hope of salvation depends not upon anything one does oneself, other than placing one’s trust entirely in God’s mercy. This is not something you earn: it is something you have to be given. And yet this solemn song, with its simple pentatonic melody, verse after verse, has a beautul and hypnotic power.I am no believer, but this is powerful stuff and not to be lightly dismissed.Confronting the great dilemmas of self-consciousness in his confessional diary and his poetry, Buchanan emerges triumphant and yet sober, thoughtful and grateful. # The Skull # came to Buchanan when, following a young woman’s burial, he picked up a skull left exposed in Lassintulloch graveyard near Loch Rannoch.Today, the graveyard is as neglected as were the people living there in Buchanan’s day. Picture him then among the tombstones, looking out northward and the thoughts racing through his mind like the wind through the branches of the surrounding trees as he addresses the skull in his hands.He asks the skullit belonged to a preacher and did the preacher care for his flock or leave them to the care of the fox  Buchanan ends assured that there is hope even in the grave, that the eyes that were once in the skull may shine again as brilliantly as the stars, and that the soul may fly to Christ with the speed of the eagle # to be greeted with love.., back in . I hope that recording will make its way into Tobar an Dualchais one day.I met Willie Matheson just the once long ago – Allan insisted I come with him to the hospital where Willie was in a wheelchair, frail but with bright eyes and a welcome smile. I was just at the very beginning of coming to an understanding of Gaelic culture, but there, with my hazy stumbling knowledge, I felt included.Such brief encounters can mean so much. – The Sufferings of Christ.

Other countries, including the UK, opted for a containment approach.A strict lockdown is in place, which prevents citizens from swimming in the ocean or hunting in bushland.Dr McElnay told thethat she attributed the country#s low case and death rates to its swt response.We haven#t seen the rapid escalation of cases seen in so many other countries because we went into lockdown earlier, before we had signicant numbers of cases, she said.Efforts have been helped by its remote location as well as air travel restrictions.

The Health ProtectionRegulations introduced by the Northern Ireland Assembly states that no person may leave the place where they are living without reasonable excuse.One of the reasonable excuses listed in the legislation is to take exercise either alone or with other members of their household. The legislation makes no reference to where exactly the exercise should be carried out. PSNI advice states that people can leave home to exercise, for example, a run, walk or cycle - alone or with members of your household.

So we don#t think a reduction in remuneration right now is feasible, but this should nevertheless be the ambition for all councils in the future.The group#s chief executive John O#Connell added: There are plenty of talented people in local authorities who are focused on delivering more for less, but that is needed across the board. The country needs every council to cut out waste and prioritise key services without resorting to punishing tax hikes on their residents.These figures should shine a light on the town hall bosses who#ve got it right, but also allow taxpayers to hold to account those who aren#t delivering value for money at this critical time. A Belfast City Council spokesperson said salaries for chief executives in Northern Ireland#s  councils were set independently as part of a robust and independent job evaluation exercise.They added Ms Wylie#s salary took account that Belfast is the largest local council, and was benchmarked against comparable posts in the public sector.Other considerations included an independent evaluation of job roles of directors in Belfast City Council, and attracting the necessary calibre of senior staff to City Hall.Pension contributions are set by the Northern Ireland Local Government Officers# Superannuation Committee.Remuneration levels for all senior staff in Belfast City Council are published annually. The spokesperson added that the council and senior management team was focused on delivering essential public services and supporting residents during the coronavirus pandemic.This includes a new virtual community hub, including a dedicated helplineto help coordinate delivery of food parcels, provide advice on jobs and benefits, practical assistance such as collecting prescriptions, and offering emotional supportneeded.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus: Confusion over PSNI advice on travelling for exerciseRevealed:  top officials in Northern Ireland councils earn more than £k a yearTrio bailed after stolen farm machinery found buried near BelfastTwo women fined by PSNI after failing to stop at cross-border checkpointCoronavirus: Number of Northern Ireland care home deaths will be declared from end of the week,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In Northern Ireland testing is currently limited to patients who are being admitted to hospital and some health care workers as well as symptomatic nursing home residents. At the time of writing, April , just over , people have been tested for the virus in the North with under , confirmed cases. Whereas more than , tests for Covid- have now been completed in the Republic of Ireland – one of the highest testing rates in Europe - resulting in over , confirmed cases. googletag.cmd.push In the south you can phone your GP to be assessed for a testyou are in a priority group and have symptoms. Andyou are in a priority group and have been in contact with someone you think or know has coronavirus and you have any of those common symptoms. Dr Paul Molloy said limited testing means it is dficult to tell how many people have COVID- and therefore how many have actually died of COVID-. He added that % of cases are mild and don’t make it as far as GPs or the hospital and % probably do with % severely affected. googletag.cmd.push Out of the % that make it to the COVID Centre probably  % of them are at present sent home again without being tested as only those admitted are tested, he said. That means that doctors are potentially only testing a very small proportion of those actually affected. He did caveat the statement by saying he is a GP and not a statistician or an epidemiologist. “The dficulty is that many people in the community have other illnesses like COPD, heart disease etc,” he explained. “It is very possible thatthese people acquired COVID- it would be too much for them to cope with and they’d die at home. This would be similar to people dying of influenza. “It’ll not be recorded on their death certicate but it may have been the final illness that just was too much to cope with and been the precipitating factor for death. If these people die at home from COVID- it will be unknown as at present we are only testing those who are admitted to hospital. “All the people who are in the community with a flu do not knowit is coronavirus or another virus. “We have no idea therefore of the real numbers of patients affected or even the real number of deaths.” UNDER-REPORTING While this isn’t important in managing the illness, he says, it does become important when a discussion takes place about moving out of the current lockdown. “We know that about % of the population have to be infected before we develop herd immunity. “This was the original path the government set out on. “It’s also important that when restrictions are lted we can employ similar means to the countries who have been most successful in controlling this. “That is quickly identying pockets of virus in the community, isolating those pockets, tracing and testing any contacts and avoiding indiscriminate spread. “There are many, many people, % of those with COVID  out there who will only get mild symptoms. We are not testing them so we are only finding out whether people have COVID  or not, in a small group of people.” He added: “There is potentially as much as % under identication of actual cases then approximately and under-reported death rates for the same reason.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The cross-border , spearheaded by InterTradeIreland and TechIreland will allow companies to see who they can work with locally and beyond their region. More than  businesses and supports are already on the interactive map, which will initially focus on healthcare innovation supports. It highlights more than  key categories including PPE, contact tracing and ventilators but will soon expand to include broader economic and societal responses to Covid-. Designated Officer of InterTradeIreland, Aidan Gough, said the ability to access information quickly is hugely important. googletag.cmd.push “Time is of the essence in the response to Covid-, which is why we have worked swtly with our partners TechIreland to develop this one-stop-shop for buyers and sellers,” he said. “It gives firms involved in developing healthcare responses the ability, at a glance, to find other companies they can work with in terms of securing expertise or supply chain input.” It is hoped that highlighting the companies and groups will enable them to collaborate faster, learn from each other and avail of support from economic and industrial development agencies. John O’Dea, Chief Executive of TechIreland, said the business community had a vital role to play. googletag.cmd.push He said: “One of the positive responses which will help see us through this crisis will be the solutions that come from products and innovations that are being developed by the business community. “As a result of the avalanche of information around Covid-, and because of social distancing, it’s dficult for firms to know what other companies are doing, how they are innovating andthere are opportunities to co-operate. “In a fast-moving crisis, finding a potential partner or a customer, or identying grants and funds can be time-consuming – but critical. This  has been developed to address those challenges.” To be featured on the Covid- Innovation Responses Map, oryou are aware of projects that should be included, email john@techireland.org.

Deaglaacuten McCallion, from Bellaghy, decided against giving up anything for Lent his year and instead opted to donate the pocket money he would normally receive to a good cause. Last week the -year-old presented Hope Magherafelt Food Bank with a donation of pound, and his mum Louise explained why he chose the charity. “He wanted to give it to them because it was close and he wanted it to go to people in the community,” she told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “With everything going on with the coronavirus, he said he wanted to give it to the food bank, because there would be children and families with no food.” The St John Bosco PS pupil received some of the money as pocket money for doing bits and pieces around the house, but he also donated some money gted to him for Easter. Louise said: “He gathered up pound himself and then my friend had given him pound for Easter. His granny and grandad gave him a tenner and then we added the extra fiver to bring it up to pound. “He’s very thoughtful and wants to help people, seeing things in that way. It’s lovely to see that because he is an only child and he’s always wanting to help people.” googletag.cmd.push Deaglaacuten’s parents are understandably proud of their son and are hoping that this small act of kindness can make a big dference to the local community. “We are so proud of him,” said Louise. “He just wants to help and put money towards things. He’s always talked about how he would love to give homes to the homeless and things like that. He’s a very happy-go-lucky child. He takes everything in his stride, just like his daddy! We’re glad that he sees things in le this way and hope he keeps going with that.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Ballinascreen, one of the countys biggest clubs, were set to replace their long-serving  Club fundraiser with a lotto later this year. Following deliberation, via conference calls and messaging, the club executive made the decision to bring the launch forward and the first draw took place on Tuesday night. For the next eight weeks, all profit will go to a newly setup community group, which also includes Draperstown Celtic, Draperstown Surgery, An Rath Dubh and Sixtowns community groups, the Scouts, Glasgowbury, St Vincent de Paul, local mental health charity STEPS, as well as local political parties and businesses. googletag.cmd.push “The club executive realised it was a chance for the club to contribute to the community during these dficult times, because over the years the community has played a massive role in the running of Ballinascreen GAC,” Chairman Mickey Boyle told the County Derry Post. Like all other club lottos, there will also be a smaller prize fund every week which is paid out,the main jackpot isnt won. For now, Ballinascreen wont be doing that to ensure that all money raised is put back into the community. “For an initial eight week period, the club have decided to donate all profits to the Ballinascreen community support group. Its a good opportunity to give something back.” googletag.cmd.push In the interests of safety and due to social distancing, the lotto can only be played online via Klubfunder, a local Maghera based company specialising in fundraising for clubs. The appropriate link is available via Ballinascreens social media channels. Boyle also took the opportunity to pay tribute to all the coaches and senior players, in all four codes. He praised them for their efforts at engaging with the younger players via videos to keep them engaged, motivated and help them practice their skills in the absence of group training. He praised the GAA as an organisation for their swt action within hours of Taoiseach Leo Varadkars decision to begin the lock-down on Thursday, March . “I just think, at times, the GAA hasnt got the credit it deserves,” he concluded. “This time their decision to close down was the correct one and they deserve recognition for it.” - RELATED Claudy teachers lead by example during sporting lock-down.

Kieran Stevenson was man of the match in their win over Antrim and Michael McMullan spoke with the Derry keeper, as he rekindled the memories of their golden era.  For  years, Derry had wandered around in Ulsters hurling wilderness. Until that moment. The  Ulster final was ticking towards a conclusion. Mickey Collins won a free which his brother Ollie drove between the posts at the Andersonstown Road end. Derry fans among the , strong Casement Park attendance exploded into another frenzy, as their caman-wielding heroes hit the front again. googletag.cmd.push Was this eventually going to be their day  Not just yet. There was time for Antrim to cast the dice one last time. Gary OKane composed himself over a stoppage time sideline cut. The wind carried the sliotar into the danger-zone, where vigilant Derry goalkeeper Kieran Stevenson deflected it wide. It was the last action and the final whistle kick-started an outpouring of emotion for the new Ulster champions. Bullfrog was the keeper in Banaghers three-in-a-row winning minor team, before moving into the county scene. An -year career began in , as understudy to Laveys Fergal Shorty McNally. The following year, he was second choice behind Padraig Oacute Mianaacutein when Derry won the All-Ireland B championship. googletag.cmd.push In , the Us lost to Antrimin the Ulster final. From that team, captain Colin McEldowney, Benny Ward, Mickey Conway, Gary Biggs and Geoffrey McGonigle would help spearhead Derry seniors towards Division One. The minors lost in the final that year, to the Saffrons, by an almost identical margin and Stevenson was the keeper on both teams. In , the Us took Antrim to a replay and  frees from the unerring Dermot Doherty, on his own Emmet Park turf, finished the job as Derry took the title in mid-week extra-time thriller. “That was a good win,” Stevenson recalls. “Antrim were always the team to beat, in terms of the county.” Things began to change. They ran Antrim to three points in the  senior final, but lost convincingly the following year. It was a spell in hurlings top tier that made the wheels of change turn that bit quicker. Promotion at the end of  began a four-year stint in the top flight. They ran Waterford to seven points at Ballinascreen in their first outing, before facing Cork and Kilkenny. The cream of hurling was lting Derrys standards. A -point slump to Tipperary, in Thurles, was their toughest afternoon. A one-point defeat in Laois was the one that got away, leaving Derry needing to beat Kerry in a relegation play-off to stay afloat before dropping down at end of the  campaign. “I think it as the Division One hurling that stuck to us and we were on an upward curve,” Stevenson feels. “There were more players added to the . “Derry hurlingwas about filling up the numbers and going out to play the matches. Then it changed and everybody was taking it serious. The club scene was improving and you could see the skill level going up from  to .” HARMONY In an interview three years ago, Conor Murray painted the Derry hurling scene he played on at the start of the noughties as a family. A unique one, with club rivalry left at the gates of Owenbeg and picked up on the way home. Stevenson agrees. “No club stuck to themselves, everybody got on well with everybody,” he said. Other managers werent chirping in players ears, telling them not to commit to the small ball game. In the  season, Kieran McKeever threw his lot in with the hurlers, while also playing in an Ulster football final weeks later. “Players were not restricted in playing for the county, in terms of hurling and everybody gelled,” Stevenson added A mountain of upside-down kit bags would be erected in the aisle of the team bus, with a coat thrown over it. Hey presto, they had a card table, around which they laughed on their journey to whatever battle they would later brace themselves for. It got more advanced when Stevenson, a kitchen manufacturer by trade, patented a custom-made card table. “When we were coming home, we were arm-wrestling on it and it was all a bit of craic,” he joked.  Emmett McKeever, Kieran McKeever and Geoffrey McGonigle celebrate Derrys  Ulster title. Steering the ship was Cushendall man Kevin McNaughton. After spending time helping foster Swatraghs structures and leading them to back to back intermediate championships, he came on board with Derry at the start of the  season. His trusted lieutenant, from the Swa, Roger Anthony Quinn, Laveys hurling godfather Tom Magill, Banaghers Gerard McCloskey and athletics coach Malcolm McCausland made up the management team. Heading up the M for the  final, Derry were in a decent place, following a - to - win over a Down team who had beaten New York in the quarter-final. Antrim were -point winners over London in their semi-final, but Derry blitzed them in the first half of the decider. Rookie defenders Emmett OHara and Declan McKillop were led a merry dance by the Derry attack. Ace attacker Geoffrey McGonigle and Emmett McKeever were missing through suspension. That told enough of the depth in Derrys squad. “We were getting better with playing all the better teams. There was plenty of skill, speed and fitness in the team. It was about trying to put it all together...it was a good ,” Stevenson explained. McKeever had been suspended after being sent off with Downs Noel Sands in the semi-final, on the advice of a linesman. With high-ranking officials on their July holidays, the appeal – lodged before the end of June – wasnt heard and McKeever would miss the final. “Beefywas our best player in defence...he was lethal,” Stevenson said of his captain. “We wanted to try and win it for him because he was hard done by. He was well-liked and in every match, hed have put his head in front of the hurl to stop the ball. “Antrim had Alistair Elliott, Gregory OKane was full-forward and Gary OKane started at centre half-forward, before going back .” DREAM START Kieran McKeever, Gary Biggs and Ollie Collins hit first half goals to leave Antrims foundations rocking. The Saffrons didnt score from play for  minutes. “We shouldve been further ahead,” said Stevenson of their - to - interval lead. “We had missed a pile of scoring opportunities and we were against the breeze in the second half. “We knewthe forwards were getting on the ball, they could score goals because they were skilful and quick.” Derrys backs were to the wall as Antrim notched  unanswered points and, with  minutes gone, went four points ahead. Derry replied with points to take the wind out of Antrims sails. Their case was helped further when John ODywer finished to the net for the crucial fourth Oakleafers goal. “It was the goals that won us the match,” Stevenson said. “I still have a hurling ball in the house, with the scorewritten on it.” All the press cuttings and programmes were kept too. A raft of memories from the glory years. But the hurl that deflected Gary OKanes last minute sideline cut to safety is long gone. “Some wee Belfast boy stole it,” Stevenson reckons. The Derry squad threw their history-making hurls on the turf to celebrate and within minutes they had vanished. “When the final was blown, it was more thepressure, you were always checking the time to see what was left. If the game had went onthere was less likelihood that we couldve won the game.” Conor Murray accepted the cup in the stand, before taking it down to the pitch for the suspended Emmett McKeever to again hoist it skywards to salute the magical moment. “We were there on merit,” was Stevensons assessment of their win. “We had a good defence and a good forward line. When you take the likes of John ODwyer, Geoffrey and Mickey Collins as your front three – you have a good side. “Conor Murray at full-back was safe, you had Collieand Niall Mullan in the corners.” Stevenson picked up the man of the match award and added to it with the Ulster hurler of the year accolade the following season when Derry retained their title. Later that night, the team partied into the wee small hours in Dungiven club. You could barely turn a sweet in your mouth. It was jam packed. Before that, on the joyous journey home, there was a poignant moment when the players got off the bus to carry the cup over the River Bann in Toome. “We had talked about it in previous years – the days when we were beaten,” Stevenson remembers. “It was a short walk, the boys were more interested in getting on the bus and heading on home.” Derrys fallow  years was over.

As one might expect there’s a strong representation from multiple John McLaughlin winners Ballinderry, Slaughtneil and Coleraine but I can’t believe some of the players that I have left out. However, I’m pretty sure thatan imaginary club was able to field this line-out in their prime, they’d not be far off lting the Andy Merrigan Cup. googletag.cmd.push  - MichaelConlan - Ballinderry A fixture between the sticks for Ballinderry for almost two decades, Mickey C was a good goalkeeper at the start of his career when winning an All-Ireland club medal in . By the s he seemed even better, maintaining a physical condition that would have been the envy of men  years his junior and adjusting to a massive transformation in what was expected from a modern goalkeeper. He just edges out Slaughtneil’s Antoin McMullan for the number one jersey.  - Karl McKaigue – Slaughtneil Karl might not be as well know as his elder brother, but he has been just as vital in Slaughtneil’s success. The archetype of the modern defender, who must meld man-marking skills with ability on the ball, McKaigue is often the initiation point for the Emmett’s attack. Has held some of the finest forwards in club football scoreless during Slaughtneil’s rise to national prominence including Conleith Gilligan, Ryan McHugh and Seanie Johnston. googletag.cmd.push  - Brendan Rogers Slaughtneil Another Emmets dual star Rogers, has been the defensive rock on which Slaughtneil’s success has been built. Named Ulster Club footballer of the year for , as a youngster Rogers initially chose to focus on hurling but has established himself as one of the football’s best defenders in not just Derry but Ulster, an automatic pick for this selection.  - Ciaran Mullan - Coleraine A superb athlete whose ball-carrying ability and pace have made him a nightmare for opposing forwards who end up spending much of their time tracking back into their own half. A key man as Coleraine claimed the John McLaughlin Cup for the first time in  and was still a fixture when they claimed their second title in .  - Kevin McGuckin - Ballinderry Another Ballinderry man with an All-Ireland medal in his pocket, the fact he was still making the starting  for the Shamrocks in  is testament to his qualities. A Rolls Royce of a footballer the former Derry captain’s experience was crucial as the Loughshore completed a hat-trick of victories between  and .  - Oisin Duffy - Foreglen It’s a measure of Oisin Duffy’s consistent excellence that he makes this selection based on performances in the Intermediate Championship. Could play any position in the backline, his strength and pace made him an effective man marker but equally comfortable in possession. Still as effective as ever as Foreglen claimed the Intermediate crown last October.  - Chrissy McKaigue - Slaughtneil First rose to prominence on the Derry minor side that reached the All-Ireland final in  the current Derry Captain has been a fixture for club and county for a decade. In addition to his evident abilities as a player, McKaigue provides the intangible qualities of leadership that every successful team needs. On the rare occasions that Slaughtneil find themselves floundering McKaigue is the man to whom his team-mates look to steady the ship.  - Patsy Bradley - Slaughtneil Another who’s career has spanned the ages, Patsy Bradley is an icon of Derry football. The quintessential quiet, hard man, Bradley’s aerial prowess rarely fails to catch the eye and his work-rate is immense. Has overcome injuries that might have restricted the career of lesser players Patsy’s toughness is the stuff of legend.  - Niall Holly - Coleraine Strong in the air and extremely mobile. Holly’s ball carrying skills have the been the starting point for countless Eoghan Rua attacks, with his languid style belying and athleticism allows him to glide past opponents. A perfect foil for the combative Bradley.  - Enda Muldoon - Ballinderry One of the most gted footballers ever to apply a boot to a size five, the Shamrocks man’s gts appeared to immune to the passing of the years as Ballinderry emulated their s antecedents in winning three in a row from  to . His ball to Raymond Wilkinson for the decisive goal in the  semi-final win over Banagher may be the best pass I have ever seen in club football.  - Benny Heron- Ballinascreen The only man in my team who doesn’t have some form of Championship winners medal to show for his efforts. Heron has been a prolic scorer for a Ballinascreen team that has regularly been in the mix for the John McLaughlin Cup without quite sealing the deal. With his phenomenal work rate and ability to score from both play and placed balls, Heron was a key factor in the St Colm’s club’s run to the  and  county finals.  - Sean Leo McGoldrick - Coleraine The oil that has kept the Coleraine engine running smoothly for a decade. Adaptable players can sometimes be the victims of their own versatility but Sean Leo McGoldrick’s quality is such that every manager in Derry would love to have him in their squad. One Coleraine mentor once told me that the one time in any game when he could relax was when Sean Leo had the ball because he knew it was secure. An incisive runner and an accurate passer the Eoghan Rua man can also chip in with a vital score when the occasion requires.  - Coilin Devlin - Ballinderry The flame-haired front man maybe didn’t have the profile of the other Ballinderry forward in this line-up but his impact for the Shamrocks in the early part of the decade was undeniable, bagged the decisive goal in the  final against Slaughtneil, and scored five points from play to earn man of the match honours in . Dooks pace and direct running made him a handful for opposing corner-backs.  - Colm McGoldrick - Coleraine The second member of the McGoldrick clan to make my team and you could make case for the inclusion of any of the brothers, but Colm is well worth his place. He was the fulcrum of the Eoghan Rua attack as they claimed their first county crown in . The intelligence of his movement is something that can’t be taught. As captain he scored four points in the  final as Coleraine doubled their tally of John McLaughlin Cups.  - Shane McGuigan - Slaughtneil The sharpest shooter in Derry club football in recent year. McGuigan’s scoring tallies speak for themselves scored - in the  Derry Championship and better that tally with - in . Performs well on the big stage top scored in the  Ulster final with - against Kilcoo and bagged - in ’s provincial triumph over Cavan Gaels. Every successful team needs a marquee man in their full-forward line, McGuigan is Slaughtneil’s. RELATED - Michael McMullans team of the decade- Click here...

Twenty years ago this year, Derry pushed Offaly every step of the way and won the respect of a nation. The former Oak Leaf defender spoke to Michael McMullan….  Its your job to enhance the legacy so when you finish playing you have tothe jersey to a better place than what you got it in. - Dan Carter Dan Carters words are both romantic and sincere, painting a picture of a career that ended with the Webb Ellis Cup in his clutches. googletag.cmd.push Not everybody gets the perfect send off. Some stay too long and others dont achieve, both leaving a sense of regret. Niall Mullan is one of the lucky ones. The Kevin Lynchs man, from a family steeped in hurling, saw his -year senior career with Derry come to a conclusion under the spine-tingling, rapturous applause of a standing ovation at Croke Park. The Oakleafers, after winning Ulster for the first time in  years, pushed Offaly to the brink. The electrying realisation that – barring Offalys fans – the entire stadium was willing them on, allowed Derry to play with real purpose. googletag.cmd.push But it was Offaly who found enough to win the game. Boy did they earn it. They did benefit from Ollie Collins Achilles injury after  minutes. It was a huge loss to Derry who, in the final analysis, had no answer to Johnny Dooley. The Seir Kieran man had his snipers vision finely tuned and contributed  points. It was enough for the  champions. Niall Mullans final chapter in the red and white of Derry came in the most gallant of defeats. The rest of Ireland were forced to stand up and take notice. One of his opponents that day certainly did. Joe Dooley entered the fray after  minutes. Seconds later a sliotar flashed across his path. Goalkeeper Kieran Stevenson was always grateful for the positional sense of his defence. “They always seemed to know where the ball would land,” he said of Mullan, Collie McGurk and Conor Murray in front of him. For once, Mullan admits to having lost his bearings and Joe Dooley got a right introduction. “I took a wild swing rather than trying to catch it,” Mullan recalls. Without taking control of the ball he, lashed on it and his hurl broke across Dooley. It was all part of the battle for supremacy. No quarter was asked and none was given, with the duo swapping jerseys at the final whistle. The competitive respect we all drool over. As Mullan said farewell to inter-county hurling, he walked down the dressing room tunnel with Dooleys jersey in his grasp. “Its still my pride and joy,” he said. *** Sport was never going to be far away from Niall Mullans le. His father John, better known as Ginge, played both football and hurling. He gave plenty back in . He was Chairman of the football club and, until the recent lock-down, has been taking Irish language classes at Kevin Lynch Park. Sadly, his mother Anne passed away in recent years. Niall has two sisters, Anne and Maria and has three brothers John A, Hugh Pearse and Eoin, who have all been involved in the GAA. After his underage club career, he continued to represent St Canices and Kevin Lynchs with distinction. Its thought he has two senior football medals and won five titles with the hurlers. At the time of our interview, Mullan is unsure. For someone who has achieved so much, the silverware is over-rated. “I dont know, I am not joking,” came Mullans response to how many county titles he had amassed. “I got a thing for my thbirthday from one of my brothers. My medals are up on the wall, but I wouldnt even count them.” Mullan holds the memories closer to his heart. “The people who were foes then, that are good friends now. The likes of Declan Cassidy and Collie McGurk. There was Conor Murray too, who was playing on the Derry hurling team from the start.” Thats what he takes from it. Since making his debut when he was  or , Mullan was pretty much an ever-present in Derrys defence until calling it a day at the age of . “I think there was one of the years, I didnt go to the hurling as I was in the football . Hinpheystropped speaking to me because of it,” he laughs. Hinphey arrived in Dungiven from Kilkenny, along with the input of Laveys Tom Magill, left an unquantiable imprint on the hurling landscape of the county. With the big ball, Mullan won two MacRory Cups with St Patricks Maghera and was on Derrys All-Ireland minor winning team of . He played U football for the county and was on the  for the  senior final defeat by Monaghan, but missed out on the Ulster title in . In hurling, under the guidance of Joe McGurk, he was midfield on the first team from the school to land the Mageean Cup, .  Niall Mullan in action against St Louis Ballymena in the  Mageean Cup final “An experienced hurler, Nialls calmness and nerve rubbed off on the other players of lesser experience,” read an extract from the  school magazine, the Patrician. “His long-range pointing was an invaluable asset to the team.” The team was captained by McGurks brother Johnny and included future All-Ireland senior football winners Henry and Seamus Downey, who was the teams goalkeeper. Enda Gormley and Damian Cassidy, not from hurling clubs were on the team. Cassidy was the competitions top scorer and bagged - in the final against St Louis Ballymena at Bellaghy. For Mullan, the experienced hurler, he was only starting. *** It all began miles away from  and what it represented. Derry hurling had made a habit of languishing in Division Three, when Mullan joined during the mid-s. He is the only player to have played in all four isions of the league. He recalls how they would always lose as many games as they won. But it began to gradually change. Block by block, the building process began. In , after winning the All-Ireland B championship, Derry went to play New York in Gaelic Park. It was the era of Hugo McOscar and Pat Joe McKennas management. After arriving a day late and having to play in a searing  degrees heat in a dust bowl, they got slaughtered in the game, Mullan remembers. “After that, we had four or five days as a get together, as a team, and we enjoyed ourselves. On the flight home, I remember Declan Cassidy and a few of us talking,” he added. “We had grown close as a group, we knew the hurlers were there. We were talking that we could do a wee bit with this group.” The following year, Derry won promotion to Division Two and went on to contest the  and  Ulster senior finals. Mullan remembers ex-Down manager Sean McGuinness telling them how close they were getting. To make the final push they would need to be playing top level hurling in the league. A win over Wicklow, in Portlaoise, saw Derry promoted to Division One as champions. “Before we went into theUlster championship, we played Kerry in a play-off match in Parnell Park and we beat them well to stay up,” Mullan recalls of their first season dining with the big boys. “It gave us a lot of confidence. We played well that day andwe had played like that in some of the other games, we couldve beaten one of the bigger teams. “I remember playing Wexford, up in Slaughtneil, and it was a dirty, wet day. We held them for a long time and they pulled away in the second half with the wind.” A lot had a changed since theirfrom New York. Collie McGurk had committed solely to hurling and Kieran McKeeversto the hurling  in , rubber-stamped its attraction. Before that, players just came and went. There was no continuity. Now it was dferent. “You ask the likes of Co McEldowney, or anyone playing at that time, it was really enjoyable to play and we had plenty of craic on the way home on the bus. You could just see everybody that was there...wanted to be there.” Away from the fun, there was also an appetite for work. Manager Kevin McNaughton had enlisted fitness coach Malcolm McCausland. No longer was it running laps til you boked. “He would take us up to do sprints and he gave us a programme of what to do ourselves,” Mullan points out. Going into the Ulster final, Derry were perfectly poised. They had ran Antrim to three points two years previously, had a strong league campaign under their belt and were convincing semi-final winners over Down. Their win over Antrim in the final was all the more notable, with the absence of Geoffrey McGonigle and Emmett McKeever due to suspension. “Emmett was captain and he never missed a night of training right through and he never got his suspension lted...he just drove the thing on another notch. “Kevin was the manager, but Tomdid a lot of the training,” Mullan reveals. With an Ulster title in the bag, the duo ramped up the preparations even more. “Training wouldve involved a lot of shorter games...they had everything speeded up and closed in. The training matches were faster, there was no time - you just got the ball and got it away. “I remember that everybodys hurling was good at that time and you got used to the speed the big boys played at, thats what they concentrated on.” It was time to take their hurling to the biggest stage of all. *** Adrian Logan was deployed to Derry to get a taste of the new hurling revolution and arrived at Younger Homes in Maghera. It was the week of the new Ulster champions baptism against All-Ireland contenders Offaly in the Croker cauldron and Niall Mullan was the interviewee. “I remember telling him that theyknew absolutely nothing about us and we knew who they were. I thought that was an advantage and we were going to throw the kitchen sink at them.” Derry travelled south the day before the game and stayed out of Dublin. Everything was relaxed. During the week, the squad were flying at training. The scene was set. Sitting in the dressing room, Niall Mullan was conscious it could be his last game with the famous Oakleaf badge on his chest. “Collie McGurk was , Conor Murray was  and I was ,” Mullan now jokes. “So thats over  combined years, so there were no speed merchants.” As the team togged out, Mullan noticed the usual nerves werent present. He was taking it all in his stride. “I was walking about...thinking Ill beoff after  minutes or I will play well. Thats just how I felt.” “Collie would always talk in the changing room and he was telling us lets get wired into these b******s, there would always be some of the players chipping in.” From the win over Antrim, the management had some reshuffling to do. Declan Cassidy was on his honeymoon and missed the game. Mickey Conway dropped back from midfield to plug the vacancy at wing back. Ronan McCloskey reverted to midfield and Geoffrey McGonigle ed to the attack after his suspension. Derry took to Offaly with every sinew they could offer. “Ten minutes into the first half, your lungs were bursting because Offaly were going at a pace we werent used to, but they never pulled away from us,” said Mullan of his memory from the game. By half-time, some of Offalys key players hadnt scored. John Troy got little change out of Colin McEldowney before being replaced by Joe Errity and the towering Gary Hannfy was brought closer to midfield. “Cowas brilliant and then they brought out a big boyon to him and Co was only up to his waist, just swinging away...he had a brilliant game that day.” Derry lost Ollie Collins to injury and Johnny Dooley began to exert an interference on the game. And still Derry kept coming back. A second McGonigle goal was followed by a Mickey Collins point to level matters, - to -. “I remember the hairs standing on the back of my neck. Everybody in Croke Park was roaring for us. You could hear the atmosphere building because we were so close to them. You were going on adrenaline and we did think we could beat them.” The story didnt have a total fairytale ending. A second Brendan Murphy goal helped Offaly crawl past Derrys tectonic efforts. But after  years of hurling, Niall Mullan bowed out at the top. Like Dan Carter, Nelly left a legacy and Derry hurling was in a much better place.

Derry are due to play Offaly in the opening game of the Christy Ring Cup on the weekend of May  .The GAA are currently keeping an eye on government on both sides of the border before any decision is made.“When we get an indication from them of when things are likely toto some kind of normality, well then be able to make decisions both on the structure of an inter-county championship and when that would start,” McGill added.It is likely the Super s wont be played and the hurling championship will revert to knock-out.In terms of club activity, McGill said there was no truth in the speculation that club championships are being planned for the months of June and July.“If there is going to be a period when there is going to be a restriction on attendances, then perhaps we may look at a period of club activitybefore the inter-county championships start. But we are staring into the unknown,” concluded McGill, who is part of the senior football management team of his native Bornacoola in Leitrim.On March , Derry CCC informed clubs they would get two or three weeks to prepare for any resumption of activity.“From talking to Stephenand people in other counties, they are all keen to allow a lead-in until any seriousgames,” McGill added.The GAA have a desire to complete rounds six and seven of the inter-county football leagues and the ision two and three finals in hurling to enable the association to get off on a good footing next season.“The bottom line is, no decisions have been taken yet” he concluded. googletag.cmd.push RELATED - Conlan calls for GAA to take a lead.

Maggie McCann from Limavady was issued with a Notice of Intended Civil Recovery, despite ing to the store to settle a pound. bill she had absent-mindedly forgotten to pay. She also received a letter demanding payment of pound., including a demand for the pound. she had already paid in store.

I went off to my daughter’s school and got everything sorted out and then came out home. “I thought we’d all go to the beach a run and walk the dogs to get away from the chaos for an hour, but I wasn’t in the house ten minutes until the police landed.” Maggie immediately realised her mistake when the police officers appeared, and they accompanied her back to Tesco so she could pay her bill. googletag.cmd.push However, once she had paid the outstanding amount at the Customer Service Desk, she was waved over by the store’s security guard. She said: “The security man was talking to what turned out to be a manager and he waved me over. I went over and told him I was sorry and that I had made a mistake. “The first thing he did was flip a notepad open and start tapping with a pen. He said he would need my name, address and date of birth. I said I’d already given that to the police. “I explained that I wanted to come in and recty it and that the police were sitting outsideneeded, but he handed me a Notice of Intended Civil Recovery.” The notice explained that Tesco’s solicitors could write to Maggie to recover the costs of investigating the incident, and there was further punishment in store. “They said I was barred for a year. I asked how I was meant to get my pound-a-week shop and he said I’d have to get somebody  to do it for me. “They would only say that it was Tesco’s policy. I was gobsmacked. It was pound.. The day before I’d spent pound and the day before that I’d spent pound. “It was all kept in the public eye, they didn’t take me into a room or anything. I didn’t care though, because I was doing the right thing. “Where is their compassion, their humanity  Especially at a time like this. I came back to fix this, and they treated me like a criminal.” The County Derry Post contacted Tesco for a response, but none was available at the time of going to print.

No matter where you go or who you are talking to up and down the country, they always ask about Roly. There is always someone who knows him or has played with or against him.The above paragraph was taken word for word from Drumaness Millsrsquos th anniversary booklet in . It captures brilliantly the essence of Roly lsquoThe Manrsquo.Roly died on Wednesday, March , sparking a deluge of tributes on social media. True gentleman, one in a million, what a lovely man, one and only Roly, top man, a legend mdash these tributes, among many others, appeared again and again.Roly was an integral part of village le in Drumaness, dandering to the bookies or the shop. He would make multiple stops to say hello to everyone he met, discussing the issues of the day.I have known him for a!most  years. He worked in Sam Bellrsquos egg factory across the road from St Josephrsquos Primary School in Crossgar. The workers would kick a ball about the road during their break and even to my untrained eye he was dferent class. It was my introduction to Roly lsquoThe Footballerrsquo.Some years later Roly and his brother, John, knocked on our door in Crossgar. They wanted me to play for the Mills in the Newcastle Summer League and I was more than happy to do so.Playing with Roly was a great education for a young player. He made football look easy, was stylish and talented, possessing the rare gt of keeping the game simple.Small wonder then that when talk comes around to the Millsrsquo greatest ever player, Roly is always in the conversation, despite competition from the likes of Robbie Strain, Osie Gelston, Conor Walsh and Davy Mills.Legend has it that in those days boys were born with boots on in Drumaness because this was a village where sport was king. So it was that Roly also excelled at billiards and cricket, reaching a very high standard in both.But football and the Mills were Rolyrsquos first loves and he rarely missed training or matches. Inevitably his talent came to the notice of Irish League managers and he enjoyed spells with Portadown and Cltonville in the early seventies. Nevertheless, Roly was a home bird and sooner or later he would pull on the Mills shirt again.By now I was playing for the all conquering Downpatrick Rec team of that era and we pitched up to a Border Cup final early in  to play the Mills. We had just won the Steel and Sons Cup and had our eyes firmly on the double, but Roly and Osie Gelston had other plans and proceeded to inspire the Mills to a famous - win.Roly had reached the twilight years of a glorious footballing career, but there was still time to lead the Mills reserves to another giant-killing act, beating Castlewellan in the Bobby Dalzell Cup final in .After such a stellar playing career, Roly was expected to become a manager. He did dip his toes in the managerial waters once or twice, but with no offence intended to the managerial fraternity mdash myself included mdash Roly was probably too nice to be a manager. In all the years I have known him I canrsquot remember him raising his voice. He was just so easy going, decent and level-headed.As a result people liked Roly and this popularity unsurprisingly proved to be an asset in his working le. After Sam Bells he spent a number of years working in the Co-Op shop in Drumaness before taking up employment with well-known butcher Vincy Doran.He was a familiar sight in Vincyrsquos van, delivering to hotels and restaurants, but it was his weekend door-to-door run which played to his strengths and further cemented his popularity.He became known as Butch or Butcher mdash a nickname he loved mdash and Vincy to this day has nothing but good things to say about Rolyrsquos eight-year stint with him.Rolyrsquos next stop was with Jimmy Quinn, who owned a bakery in Downpatrick. Jimmy shrewdly ed Roly to the door-to-door market and with people still finding it dficult to say no to the personable Roly, their successful liaison continued for  years.Jimmy likes nothing better than relating Roly stories,none of which can be repeated here, and like the rest of us he will remember Roly with the utmost fondness.Unfortunately Roly wasnrsquot immune to the ups and downs of le and deteriorating health curtailed his working le. He managed to fight and beat prostrate cancer a number of years ago, but this time around the lsquoBig Crsquo has claimed this lovely man.Ironically it was during these latter years that he seemed to be ever present on the streets of Drumaness, allowing him to befriend a generation entirely unaware of his past sporting prowess.Roly married Betty Rice on October , , and together they brought Noel, Pauline, Betty, Carol and Christine into the world. After almost  years together as a couple they remained best friends, as well as husband and we.Apart from my football connection to Roly, I have been his neighbour for  years and since his passing I have heard him described as lsquoMr Drumaness Millsrsquo, but for me he was Mr Drumaness full stop. This village will never be the same without him.Rolyrsquos family should be immensely proud of his impact on those who knew him and how sad it was to see coronavirus rob them and Roly of the fitting send-off he deserved.However, the good news is that I know there are plans afoot to have a celebration of his le when normality s. Nobody deserves it more. RIP Roly.Roly Hanna -.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Cormac.jpg","title":"Ardglass golfer on teeing up with the best in the world  ","story":"ARDGLASS golfer Cormac Sharvin could be forgiven for feeling understandably frustrated right now.The richly talented  year-old should be locking horns with some of the worldrsquos best players on the European tour.But instead of prowling the fairways hersquos holed up in his apartment in Dublin mdash like many others undergoing coronavirus lockdown.Itrsquos not how Sharvin, currently th in golfrsquos world rankings, thought his first season on the European Tour would go.Having secured his card for the  season by finishing th on the  Challenge Tour rankings, he was gearing up for a potential breakthrough campaign on the top circuit.However, after just four events, he is unsure of what the future holds as the sporting world goes into shutdown due to the coronavirus outbreak.He clearly appreciated that golf, and sport in general, is of minor importance when compared with the COVID pandemic.Of the decision to close all golf courses north and south of the border, he told the BBC recently: ldquoItrsquos a precaution that needs to be in place.I donrsquot know enough about the virus, but theyrsquore obviously trying to slow things down. Hopefully wersquoll be back playing as soon as possible, I think thatrsquos the goal.ldquoI think we just have to accept it and sit tight and when it does pass, we can get things moving a bit quicker.Certainly things have happened fairly quickly for Sharvin in his career to date. He only took up golf seriously relatively late in his teenage years, but went on to have glittering amateur career.In  he was a member of the Great Britain and Ireland Walker Cup team, contributing three points and remaining unbeaten in a .-. thumping of the United States.Sharvin turned  the following year and joined the ranks of the European Challenge Tour.Having missed his European Tour card by a single shot in , Sharvin relocated to Dublin and It proved to be the right move.He amassed eight top ten finishes in  starts to earn a rookie season on the European Tour thanks in large part to his six top fives.Sharvin only missed four cuts, two of which came in the first two events of the season, before he kickstarted his campaign with back-to-back top ten finishes.However, his best performance came at the Irish Open at Lahinch where he finished tied for th and was also the leading Irish golfer.He showed impressive consistency during the  season and proved his elite-level credentials with a tie for th finish at the Irish Open, ending the week as the leading home competitor.He says: I had a really good year, I put myself into contention a lot which was great. I think I was ready to take that step and I think the way I played, I deserved to get my card in the end with a few good results.ldquoI also managed to play well in a couple of European Tour events as well which showed me that I was ready to take that step. Therersquos a relief that I have my card now but itrsquos only the start of it mdash I know I have to keep improving and moving up the rankings.At the Irish Open he finished ahead of future Open champion Shane Lowry, Ryder Cup star Tommy Fleetwood former world number one Lee Westwood and Ryder Cup captain Padraig Harrington.ldquoIt was disappointing to shoot level-par on Sunday, but I feel like I didnrsquot do much wrong, he said.ldquoIt was really nice to have that pressure of going into the final round of a big European Tour event with a chance to win. It showed me where I was mentally and physically, that I was able to come from the Challenge Tour and compete in a top-level European Tour event.ldquoThat was an unbelievable week. The crowds were incredible and I attracted a big following being the leading Irishman, and that was a great feeling.ldquoItrsquos a nice feeling when hundreds of people are following you and everyone is willing your ball into the hole. I think that really geared me up quite a lot. It was a class buzz.ldquoIt was dficult going back to playing the Challenge Tour in the middle of nowhere in France the week after, but that week gave me the confidence to string together more good results to get off the Challenge Tour.Sharvin admits itrsquos been a slow start on the European Tour, with a tie for th in the Oman Open his bestin four starts this year, but his belief in being able to compete at the higher end of leaderboards remains undimmed.ldquoI feel like my game is good, but I havenrsquot really put all the facets together. ldquoI think in Oman I was second in strokes, gained tee-to-green and just putted really poorly. I played quite nicely in Qatar and just didnrsquot get it going.ldquoItrsquos obviously such a short period of time so itrsquos hard to assess in four events, but I feel like Irsquom close. This break may help me improve other things and hopefully Irsquom a better player when we start again.Given his Walker Cup experience, Sharvin would dearly love to play in the Ryder Cup in the years ahead.ldquoThe Ryder Cup would definitely be up there for me.

It is certainly a strange experience for me.I was ordained in  in Downpatrick. New technologies and new means of communication came after that, and Irsquove struggled ever since. So the recent experience of having to install web-cams at short notice into the three churches in my two parishes of Portaferry and Ballygalget, has been somewhat traumatic.This week is the holiest of weeks for Christians. The passion and death of Jesus is commemorated, in preparation for the resurrection on Easter Sunday. We celebrate this in ious ways. We might well ask ourselves what happened to Lent and how on earth do we celebrate what will seem like a lsquovirtualrsquo Easter Coronavirus suddenly intruded into our Lent, at close quarters, and changed everything.My mother still remembers the glow in the sky over Belfast, when from her home in Ballykinlar, she heard the planes over South Down on their way to blitz Belfast. No doubt her grandmother would have told stories of the terrible pandemic of Spanish Influenza just over a century ago.But my generation and that of my nieces and nephews have known little of such things and we experience this pandemic a grave threat.At the moment of writing, the streets of Portaferry and Downpatrick are entirely empty, as are the great cities of Rome, London and New York.The unexpected severity of lockdown leaves us feeling bewildered, disorientated, shell-shocked. We are acutely aware of the suffering around us mdash illness, hospitalisation, loneliness in sudden isolation. As schools close we are anxious about increased tension in family le. The loss of our work and leisure patterns, financial and employment worries.In the Old Testament Jobloses so much of what he had mdash health, family, possessions and friends mdash yet he refuses to rebel against God in his suffering. This is incredibly dficult for most of us. His attitude of acceptance of his suffering can be of help to us. He says: ldquoShall we receive the good at the hand of God, and not take the bad Jobrsquos story can be useful to us at present. If you can get a chance, read it.Lent mdash an old English word for spring mdash is more challenging this year than we ever expected. As we celebrate Holy Week here are two words that figure in the writings of Henri Nouwen, a Dutch spiritual writer, that I find useful.The first word is security. Where do we look in our lives for security. A basic human need  In success, popularity, money, friends, family, insurance and so on  We mightnrsquot think we do. We will always be influenced by them, but deep down they will never provide us with security.Many of those things are good in themselves, but spiritually, the only true security will be found in the everlasting love of the One who loved us first and who wishes to love us into and for all eternity. Job understood that mdash security.The second word is patience. Patience means a kind of ldquosuffering through the present. Itrsquos from the Latin, patior, which means to suffer. But being patient does not mean sitting back and doing nothing. It is not being passive. Having patience is not easy for us. How do we wait patiently for God this Holy Week, Easter and beyond during this world pandemic Being patient is an active waiting mdash it means a certain experience of suffering through the present moment. To let the seeds of our suffering be sown in the ground so as to grow later into healthy, strong plants.It means avoiding the dead-end of what could have been for the ability to pay attention to what is happening before our very eyes, paying attention to the people and world around us. By that patience, we can begin to catch a glimpse of the first rays of Godrsquos glorious coming.Last week, I personally saw those first rays when I witnessed the staff in a residential nursing home in Portaferry decide to live-in with the residents for as long as this emergency would last.This week I witnessed those first rays when a cousin, a retired doctor, rang me to tell me he was volunteering toto work to bolster the Health Service.In one way or another have we not all been privileged to witness the generosity of spirit, despite danger, of those carers, nurses, doctors, medics, ancillary staff and many others Might this not be for us another glimpse that helps us experience in our present circumstances that Christ is indeed risen and lives now among us  It certainly is a glimpse for me.The Old Testament reading for many of us on Sunday last was from Ezekiel. ldquoThe Lord says this: I am going to open your graves. I mean to raise you from your graves and lead you back to the soil of Israel. I shall put my spirit in you, and you will live, and will know that I, the Lord, have said and done this it is the Lord who speaks.The people of Ezekielrsquos time knew their frailty and experienced uncertainty as we do today. Their faith in God had been severely shaken. Could they start again Security, patience, maybe these two words might stay with us over the next while as the reason for the hope that we have I leave you with the words of a psalm, which St Patrick himself echoed in his own writings, his lsquoConfessionrsquo.The words encourage us to place our hope in the Son of God who will sustain and strengthen us in our days, the Son of God, Jesus, who knew what it was like to stumble and fall beneath the weight of the Cross. With these words I ask God to bless us and keep us safe:ldquoI waited, I waited for the Lord and He stooped down to me, He heard my cry. He drew me from the deadly pit, from the miry clay. He set my foot upon a rock, and made my footsteps firm.With security and patience we can put our trust in the fallen saviour..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Huge.jpg","title":"Huge boost for foodbanks  ","story":"THE districtrsquos foodbanks have been provided with a pound, boost by Newry, Mourne and Down Council to help them respond to increasing need during the coronavirus pandemic.The funding has been provided via the local authorityrsquos community network and is one of a series of initiatives the local authority is spearheading to continue providing a range of frontline services and responding to the needs of the vulnerable and elderly in particular.This week, residents across the district have been thanked for adhering to advice to help stop the spread of coronavirus by staying indoors and keeping safe.And, as the Easter weekend approaches, council chief executive Marie Ward has appealed to people to continue to listen to the advice to stay at home and save lives.

The concepts were subsequently amended in November.The prime focus is on deepening the harbour and moving forward, a cost effective approach may be to zone dredge levels in particular areas.The report suggests deepening the outer harbour by nine metres and the area adjacent to Cochranersquos building at the inner harbour by two metres to facilitate crab vessels.In addition, consideration is being given to creating a pontoon with so-called finger berths adjacent to the quay wall in front of Cochranersquos with gangway access for crab vessels. No leisure craft would be permitted at this part of the harbour.Removal of the existing slipway at the southern end of the harbour adjacent to the beach is suggested as it is not generally used and considered too deep for access, with potential issues in relation to the removal of an area know as Church Rock to be investigated.Quay reclamation work is suggested between the north west corner of the existing finger pier at the ice plant and north western tip of the fish market quay.This would feature a new piled quay, backfilled and surfaced with a heavy duty concrete. Extending theof the quay wall by  metres is also suggested.The estimated cost of the harbour dredging is in the region of pound, with piling work and the new quay line and reclamation work estimated at poundm and poundm respectively.The breakwater extension is estimated at pound.m with the new pontoon facility estimated at pound,.The consultantsrsquo report makes it clear that the costings include primary construction elements but does not include licensing fees, site investigation, engineering design and tendering costs.Before anything happens, a marine licence is required for specic site investigation work, rock quality design and testing, sediment sampling of overburden, contamination testing and an environmental impact assessment.The regeneration jigsaw also requires detailed design work and planning approval ahead of tendering and construction.An economic appraisal may also be required.News of the proposed investment at Ardglass harbour comes after the portrsquos importance to the Ardglass fishing industry to the district and wider South Down economy was highlighted during a recent meeting with Stormont fisheries minister Edwin Poots.He met with South Down MLA Colin McGrath and local councillor Dermot Curran to discuss planned improvement work at the harbour, with the politicians also highlighting the need for additional investment in the harbour and its infrastructure.They described Ardglass harbour as ldquostrategically important for the Co Down fishing fleet, highlighting its crucial role in driving the South Down economy and its location as a central hub for processing fish landed at the port.Mr McGrath and Cllr Curran say further investment is ldquocritical to allow Ardglass harbour to expand to provide an economic boost, not only for the village but the wider area, and create new jobs..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Mourning.jpg","title":"Please stay in  ","story":"ldquoHE was my superman ndash the moving words from Loughinisland woman Maria Farrell whose father sadly lost his battle with COVID-.As her sister also lies in hospital fighting the virus, the mother-of-two has bravely spoken out to warn others not to be complacent about the deadly disease.Maria, who buried her father on Sunday, warned: ldquoIf you think you are exempt from this or you are immune to COVID-, you are barking up the wrong tree.ldquoMy dad went really quickly, hersquos tackled prostate cancer, heart attacks, falls, you name ithellip and hersquos bounced back. But this took him. I was so proud to call him my daddy, he was my Superman.ldquoI just want you all to know that this is real, so look after yourselves, look after one another and together we will fight it.ldquoHonour those around you, keep your distance, wash your hands, and remember you are not stuck at home, you are safe at home.Her father,  year-old retired bus driver Jackie Farrell, died at Altnagelvin Hospital, Londonderry, last Thursday ndash just a day after he was admitted.He had been cared for at home by Mariarsquos family with the help of two social care assistants.The youngest of seven brothers and sisters, Maria is originally from Strabane, but has been living locally with her partner, Jim, and their two daughters - Beth , who attends St Colmanrsquos High and Sixth Form College in Ballynahinch, and  year-old Taylor, who is currently a student at Manchester University ndash for nearly  years.Maria, whose mother Mary died some years ago, said her family did everything in their power to ensure that Mr Farrell, who had  grandchildren and  great-grandchildren, was kept as safe as possible in the previous weeks.ldquoWe had to all come together to do this and hence social distancing was impossible for some of us as two people were sometimes needed for care, explained Maria.ldquoWe did take precautions with gloves, sterilising as much as we could, washing our hands constantly, plus sanitising door handles and gates, etc.She said it was a ldquonightmare when her family discovered her father was sick at the same time as her sister, Ursula.ldquoThe very day our daddy was brought into hospital, Ursula was also taken in with suspected COVID- which has now been confirmed. She continues to battle in Altnagelvin Hospital, said Maria.ldquoItrsquos like a nightmare. As daddy passed over, our sister lay in another ward in the same hospital fighting for her le. Although when daddy did go, he must have used some of his magic as our sister started showing small signs of recovering which is slowly continuing, thank God.Maria said that her family wanted to keep him at home for as long as possible, knowing that when he was admitted to hospital with suspected COVID-, they would not be able to visit him.ldquoWe had to let him go and were heartbroken. But we were reassured by the amazing nurses at Altnagelvin providing regular updates and reading out our text messages for him to hear, said Maria.ldquoHe went downhill very quickly, but remained alert enough to know his time was up and made a remark when looking at a photo of himself and mummy saying that lsquoIt wouldnrsquot be long now Maryrsquo.Mariarsquos family do not know how their father contracted the virus and he only showed slight symptoms of the virus at the end of his le.She thanked people from her home town for showing their respects ndash as best they could ndash as his funeral cortege passed by on Sunday.Maria sadly added: ldquoJackie Farrell was a very special man. He was one quite like no other. I and the rest of my family spent our lives adoring, admiring and idolising him.ldquoHe was our hero.

He also highlighted the need for financial support for the southern relief road scheme in Newry.ldquoI fully understand that the roads minister has a lot on her plate and recognise that she is not responsible for the failure of her department to invest in any major road scheme in the local area over the past number of decades, he continued. ldquoThe bypass should be in place by now. Itrsquos potential for Ballynahinch and the wider South Down economy is immense.ldquoThe multi-million pound road scheme can rid Ballynahinch of its traffic nightmare, help rejuvenate the town and encourage more visitors into the district and wider Mournes area.South Down MP Chris Hazzard signed off the eagerly-awaited bypass in December  when hewas roads minister in a previous Executive.The by-pass, which would be the single biggest road scheme ever constructed in the district, is expected to take in excess of  months to build, with roads officials insisting that it will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety.Major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road, with a new bridge constructed over the Moss Road.It is also proposed that a section of the by-pass will pass under part of the Crossgar Road with a  metre long bridge constructed to take traffic over Ballynahinch River.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the by-pass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Recognition.jpg","title":"Recognition for poet Stephen  ","story":"A BALLYGOWAN poet is celebrating after his debut anthology was recognised by two major awarding bodies.Stephen Sextonrsquos If All the World and Love Were Young was awarded the highly acclaimed American E M Forester Award which was previously won by Seamus Heaney in .His anthology, published by Penguin Books, was also shortlisted for this yearrsquos Shine Strong Award ndash an award presented annually to the author of the best first collection of poems published by an Irish poet.Stephen says his work centres on coming to terms with the death of his mother, Elizabeth, who passed away in .He said: ldquoI started writing a book of poems that initially were meant to be frivolous and entertaining.ldquoHowever, as I began writing, the intense grief I was battling at the time came to the fore.Critics say what developed was a touching tribute to his mother which they described as a moving narrative exploring bereavement, family le, memories and loss.The judging  consisted of poets Colum McCann, Jhumpa Lahiri and Paul Muldoon.As part of his prize fund for winning the highly acclaimed award, Stephen received , to travel and stay in the United States.Downpatrick poet Damian Smyth, head of literature at the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, congratulated Stephen on his award.He said: ldquoThe sense is quickly growing on both sides of the Atlantic that Stephen Sexton is already one of those rare poets whose obvious and prodigious lyrical gts are matched both by accessibility and universality.He added: ldquoIt is poignant that the person for whom the whole book is an elegy ndash his late mother mdashnever lived to see the acclaim lavished on her son.ldquoHowever, there are few contemporary works which describe the human processes of grief, loss, hurt and how love survives and endures as memorably and as movingly as this one, with virtuoso technique and profound wisdom, which I have to say is already a classic.

I have been transported to a time that has changed my perception of le forever.People with CF have a faulty gene which means the mucus in their bodies is much thicker and stickier than in other people.They donrsquot catch viruses more easily than other people but when they do, it affects their lungs by causing inflammation and increasing the amount of the sticky mucus. This makes bacterial chest infections more likely, some of which are resistant to antibiotics, leading to a decline in lungwhich is the leading cause of death in people with CF.As parents, for the first sixth months of Lorcaacutenrsquos le we were consumed with the fear. We were advised not to visit baby groups, not to let people with colds into the house, not to take him to the supermarket on a weekend when it was busy, not to let him play in soil, wet sand, or day-old playdough as well as taking many, many more precautions to keep him safe.We also discovered that my mother-in-lawrsquos COPD and my fatherrsquos bronchiectasis meant that Lorcaacuten would always have to be careful around his beloved Nana and Grandad in case he caught an infection from them. For the same reason, he could never be within six feet of someone  with CF because of the risk of cross infection. My world would never mdash could never mdash be the same.We rarely left the house. I gave up my job in the RSPB and postponed my studies. Much of our time was taken up with the heavy burden of treatment for CF, including daily physiotherapy and antibiotics. I spent a lot of time campaigning for a cystic fibrosis drug, Orkambi, to be made available on the NHS.And I cried a lot.Over the last three years, le has become more lsquonormalrsquo but beneath the joy of every milestone has been the fear of taking risks that could shorten Lorcaacutenrsquos le at any time.During this time we have learnt that there are some risks you need to take in order to be happy. Lorcaacuten began pre-school as well as swimming, gymnastics, and football classes and I resumed my studies and began working a few hours a week.There has been a lot of stress and sleepless nights, a lot of handwashing, and a lot of happiness. With the support of the public we won the campaign for Orkambi, a drug which can slow the decline in lungby up to % and can be taken by around half of people with CF. Lorcaacuten started taking it at the end of last December mdash the champagne was popped and finally we thought we could start to relax a little.Sadly it wasnrsquot for long. During the wait for Orkambi, Lorcaacutenrsquos lungs had become damaged, after catching a couple of colds in March, he ended up in the wonderful Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children for  days of IV antibiotics to treat a long standing chest infection.During those  days I watched the horrying news that COVID- was spreading. I grew ever more disturbed at the lack of action by the UK Government. How could our amazing health service, stripped bare by  years of austerity and cuts, possibly hold up under the strain of COVID- Lorcaacuten was moved to a room further away from other patients, masks appeared and I watched the eyes of the incredible staff in the hospital become more and more tense.With nearly every death I read that the patient was either elderly or had an underlying health condition. But why did that make it OK: Surely that made it worse  The message seemed to be that lsquoonlyrsquo the vulnerable were at risk but other peoplersquos lsquoonlyrsquo is my everything.As the days in hospital passed, I learned that the lung conditions of my son, mother-in-law, and father put them among the , in NI on the extremely vulnerable list. They would need to lsquoshieldrsquo for the next  weeks. Shielding means not leaving the house at all and having to rely on the government and the goodness of others to deliver medication and food to your door.When Lorcaacuten was able to leave the hospital, we arrived home mdash with great relief mdash to a lockdown. Once again, with no job to go to and my studies on hold, I am transported to those months of isolation three years ago.This time, however, it is dferent, because this time I have hope. For us, this too shall pass. We willto the normality so hard won in our lives. We, unlike so many others who will lose their lives, will have this as a memory to pass on. I let so much of Lorcaacutenrsquos infancy be marred by fear that I just canrsquot let it happen now. Every day I am thankful for my good fortune in a desperately unfair world. I am thankful for all the frontline workers and volunteers, for the Executive finally working together for the common good to sustain us and to protect the most vulnerable in society, for the kindness of people delivering food and medication to those most at risk.I am grateful to the other souls sitting in their homes feeling helpless and feeling like le is passing them by. But by feeling helpless we are helping more people have a le toto after this all ends.It will end but the world will never mdash can never mdash be the same and none of us will look at it in the same way either.Maybe it will be a world in which those who need support will begin to get it, a world in which our NHS will finally be built up rather than worn down, a world we protect rather than profit from. As I watch Lorcaacuten run happily and healthily around our safe home with his little sister, Saorla, I donrsquot feel fear for him. I feel fear for those putting their lives at risk for all of us, for those who will lose their lives and loved ones, and for those who are sitting in their homes feeling afraid.I often think that doing nothing is the hardest thing to do, but for the moment doing otherwise is a risk too great to take, for us all.

We are also telling them to exercise social distancing and not let anyone into their homes, he said.ldquoWe are also telling those whom we contact not even to let one of their neighbours over the door as it is simply too risky. The people whom we contact are very concerned about what is going on but they are made of stern stuff.Aidan added: ldquoAll the volunteers are working hard to make sure we maintain contact with our clients, more regularly than in the past by increasing the number of calls we make to them.ldquoThe reward is how grateful they are for the service we provide and our main goal is do all we can to let them know that we are here for them and want them to keep safe..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11257396.jpg","title":"hairdressers beauticians raise funds ppe","story":"It is a tough time for our entire community and especially the business community.

Performance of the Oberammergau Passion Play : Freelance“The nd Oberammergau Passion Play will be postponed due to the current situation caused by the corona pandemic.”In the Baian district of Germany, beside the Ammer River and framed by the Ammergau Alps, Oberammergau is a small town known for its woodcarvings, its NATO School and its internationally renowned -yearly Passion Play.The organisers of the Passion Play summarised the historical signicance of the postponement, explaining that the event “goes back to a vow made in . At that time, the people of Oberammergau vowed to perform the suffering, death and resurrection of Christ,no one died of the plague anymore.Engraving depicting the Passion Play in  : Freelance \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Therefore the plans to perform the Passion Play in  are currently beginning.”Held in the ‘decimal year’I attended a performance in , one of the most vivid and moving experiences of my letime, and indeed, I had toyed with the thought of ing this year.There would have been  performancesstarting in mid-May with an expected , visitors from around the globe paying between € to € for a ticket.The enormous production has been running since  except for two cancellations and a postponement.Crucixion scene in the Passion Play in  : FreelanceNearly half of the , residents of today’s Oberammergau are involved with the show - actors, musicians, front of house, backstage and looking after the horses, sheep, goats, cows and doves that add to the often intensely dramatic scenes.The other half of the townsfolk run the restaurants, shops, hotels, BBs and farmsteads where many of the visitors stay,they’re lucky.The nearest accommodation I could get in  was St. Anton am Arlberg in the Austrian Tirol.Participants in the production must have been born in Oberammergau or have lived there for  years.Oberammergau on the River Ammer in  : FreelanceIt’s not unusual for up to four generations of the same family to be taking part in the same run of plays, which can involve around  children on stage at the same time.In the th century, passion plays were held in many parts of Europe, often performed on carts in the street.They re-enacted Christ’s last days, from his entry into Jerusalem to his trial, crucixion, resurrection and ascension.In the bigger and more elaborate productions, when scene one ended the cart trundled off to another part of the town or city and scene two arrived, and so on!They were the ‘poor man’s Bible’ enabling even the most illiterate become familiar with Bible stories.But Oberammergau’s is the only play with its origins in a collective vow to God which has run, almost without a break, for approaching four centuries. This unique double-accolade brought the town a UNESCO World Heritage award.It’s quite likely that passion plays were already common events but a document in Oberammergau’s archives records “the first decades of the th century went by in peaceful calm…but then followed the Thirty Years’ War with all its hardships from  until . As early as , infectious diseases spread in Baia. This village was spared by dutul vigilance until the church festival in , when a man brought the plague into the village.”More than  local folk died and almost every family lost loved ones.“Faced with the great distress that the terrible illness inflicted upon the population,” the archive continues, “the leaders of the community came together and pledged to hold a passion tragedy once every ten years. From this day forward, not a single person perished, even though a great number of them still showed signs of the plague”.They made the pledge in  and the Passion Play was first performed at Pentecost in , on a wooden stage that some say was built on plague-victims’ graves near the church.Surviving documentation from the  production shows that the play ran ‘completed smoothly’ with seating provided ‘for spectators standing close by.’From  the date of the performance was changed to the beginning of each decade, by which time folk were coming from all over Germany to see substantial productions.Paint and painters for the  show’s scenery cost  guilders, ‘the gentlemen trumpeters’ got two guilders and  guilders went ‘to the actors for drink’!There was no performance in  when Maximilian III’s Clerical Council banned all passion plays and when another threat loomed in the s the so-called ‘mad’ King Ludwig II of Baia protected it from those who wanted to close down the ‘harmful’ passion plays. Following WWI the play was postponed until , and there was a special th anniversary show in  attended by Adolf Hitler.There were no performances in  during WWII, just the second cancellation…until now.Plans to perform the Passion Play in  are already under way, for over  five-hour shows, several thousand participants, a -strong orchestra and a -strong choir.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Dismissing republican claims that soldiers coming into Northern Ireland could carry more of the virus from GB, he said that there are , military personnel here, half of whom are reservists, and they would overwhelmingly be those involved, with the exception of perhaps “one or two specialists” coming in from GB.He said that the military support would be “discrete” and pointed out that in recent weeks themilitary had worked with the Department of Justice to create a temporary morgue at Kinnegar.There are specialist medical regiments in Northern Ireland and in Scotland military medics have been involved in testing for the virus.Mr Beattie said: “The regulars and the reserves are now ready to go. They’re sitting there waiting for tasks to be filtered down the tunnel to them.”He said there was “enthusiasm” to help and “the clamour from people wanting to mobilise was enormous. Morale is high.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

Amazing people.Alongside their charitable work, Matthew and Charlotte have adapted to the challenging economic climate by introducing a delivery service for their customers.The pair have been working without the support of their staff who they had to furlough after the government closed all non-essential shops.ldquoWersquove started doing take-out because we canrsquot afford to do nothing for three months. Wersquoll lose the shop, said Matthew.ldquoWersquoll continue to do these drop offs for the hospital as long as people fund it, and wersquoll continue to do our take-out service.ldquoBecause for shops and restaurants I think its going to be long term.ldquoWe might be in this for six months before we can open to the public.ldquoAs long as we get the support and people keep shopping locally, then yes we can get through it.ldquoRunning a business is a constant challenge and you donrsquot ever stop having to adapt. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We must protect personal data in accordance with GDPR and for that reason personal devices cannot be used.”The DUP representative also said that while she will be doing everything in her power to support her constituents, she would be using a “minimal” amount of the allowance.“I and my staff will not be found wanting when my constituents need me the most,” she said.“In the past month we have worked tirelessly to assist many people and answer literally thousands of queries. It is vital that we have equipment that is secure and usablein a home setting.“I will be using my normal office running cost budget andrequired, a minimal amount of the £, to equip my staff for the coming months.“Their safety and ability to work at maximum capacity is of utmost importance to me. I depend on them day and daily to assist me in the many queries that come across my desk.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

In , the then Northern Ireland AgricultureMinister, Michelle O’Neill MLA of Sinn Fein called in the military to assist with the delivery of animal feed to stranded animals during the vicious winter period.“On the reverseside of the argument, the IrishDefence Force helicopters from the Irish Republic were used in Northern Ireland to fight bush fires.“Any MACA in Northern Ireland will be skills based, engineers, drivers, medics, planners and workforce on mass with a command and control element already built in.“The Health Minister made it clear some weeks ago that he would,needed, call for military assistance.“The Sinn Fein Finance Minister, Conor Murphy MLA, made it clear he would not object to such a move and the Justice Minister, NaomiLong MLA, has clearly liaised with the military to create a resting facility within Kinnegar Barracks.”He went on: “Nobody in Northern Ireland will askPersonal Protective Equipmentor ventilatorswere provided by a military driver or civilian driver when they are gasping for breath ora doctor treating them is military or not. They will just want to live.”The SDLP’s Upper Bann MLA, Dolores Kelly said: “There would be no role for military personnel in security matters but in the middle of a public health emergency, political leaders must be prepared to do the uncomfortable thing to save lives.“It would be wrong to pick partisan fights over emergency measures necessary to save lives and protect the health service staff. We must all be prepared to do what it takes to save lives.”The DUP councillor Darryn Caubsy warmly welcomed the Army’s involvement: “The British Armed forces are the best in the world and their skills and experience will indeed be a welcome boost to those fighting this pandemic on the front line.“These are unprecedented times and we must work collectively to defeat this virus. I appeal to everyone to Stay home, Stay Safe, Save lives.”The Alliance Party’s Eoin Tennyson said his party also “welcome any and all support” at this time: “Ultimately, families with a loved one in hospital will be more concerned about their prognosis than who delivered the equipment.“The Minister has the Alliance Party’s full support in taking these extraordinary steps to try and save lives. That must be the number one priority for us all.”When asked for comment, a Sinn Fein spokesperson referred to the statement released by Michelle O’Neill on April .“I have been informed that the Minister for Health has unilaterally and without consultation with Executive colleagues requested limited assistance from the British Army,” said the deputy First Minister.“Sinn Féin has made it clear we will not rule out any measure necessary to save lives, protect the public and tackle the spread of coronavirus.“However, no proposal to use British military personnel in the north for roles normally performed by civilians has come before the Executive.”She continued: “The Health Minister has a responsibility to exhaust all options, including the use of other blue light public services and civilian contractors, to ensure that ventilators and le saving equipment are moved swtly to where they are needed most.“The Department for Health has already contracted a local civilian contractor to scope out building a HSC-led civilian ‘field hospital’.“It remains Sinn Féin’s position that any proposed new Nightingale hospital should remain under the care and control of the HSC.She said Sinn Féin is seeking an urgent meeting with the health minister and will also be “seeking meetings with the Secretary of State, the Tanáiste and the PSNI.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
