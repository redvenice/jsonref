It was also reported that Diana picked out the jewel herself, while others claim that she chose it because it was the biggest and reminded her of her mother’s engagement ring.Princess Diana loved her engagement ring so much that she continued to wear it after her orce from Prince Charles in 1996 and it was made into a bracelet. She then started wearing an emerald-cut aquamarine ring in its place, the same one that Meghan Markle wore with her second wedding dress.          Princess Diana loved her engagement ring and continued to wear it after her orcePrincess Diana’s jewellery collectionGrant Mobley, a gemologist and Director at Pluczenik and one of the world’s leading diamantaires, said: ‘A beautiful ring that Princess Diana was seen wearing on her ring finger after her orce from Prince Charles was an emerald cut, aquamarine and diamond ring.He continued: ‘The Princess was very fond of a pearl and diamond bracelet featuring a large emerald cut aquamarine that she was given in her early years as a princess and, after her orce, she commissioned this matching ring to be made.‘Diana’s taste in jewellery was impeccable and the fact that she commissioned this ring to be made is a clear testament to her taste.           Meghan Markle seen here wearing Princess Diana\u0027s aquamarine ring to her wedding reception\u0027She always chose diamond jewellery that was meaningful to her - she was very intentional with her jewellery choices and made sure they were the best representation of those meaningful moments,’ he said, as reported in The Express.The aquamarine ring is thought to be around £75,000 because of the size, colour and quality of the centre diamond and a diamond from one of her rings was also used to make Meghan Markle’s engagement ring.Meghan Markle’s engagement ringDespite including a stone from Botswana and two diamonds from Princess Diana’s personal collection, Meghan Markle’s engagement ring was compared to one available from Argos for just £33.

Meghan Markle\u0027s ring includes a stone from Botswana and two from Princess Diana’s collectionKate Middleton’s engagement ringWhen Diana passed away in 1997, Prince William and Prince Harry inherited her jewellery collection, which included her engagement ring, according to Good Housekeeping. The late Princess wrote: ‘I would like you to allocate all my jewellery to the share to be held by my sons, so that their wives may, in due course, have it or use it.

MAN1 is a few hundred yards from Manchester Airport.General manager Neil Travis, 51, says being near the M56 and M6 means they are close to a large percentage of customers and allows them \u0027to do same day, next-day delivery\u0027.The warehouse is 780ft long, has nearly a million square feet of floor space arranged across four floors and holds \u0027many millions\u0027 of products.Neil says it is \u0027a matter of seconds\u0027 between Anne clicking and MAN1 receiving the order. \u0027When you click \u0027buy it now\u0027, the system will see which of the 17 buildings in the UK has that item in stock,\u0027 he adds. \u0027And it works out where the customer is located.\u0027The system then determines the quickest route to get the product out to the customer.\u0027The computer that controls the \u0027system\u0027 is \u0027in a cloud\u0027,\u0027 he says, referring to the nickname for where data is stored on remote servers.Explaining how products get from the warehouse to our door, he adds: \u0027Everything works backwards from the customer\u0027s home.\u0027It must leave MAN1 by 2pm, be packed by 1pm and selected for the start of this process by 12pm. \u0027It calculates it all the way backwards.\u00278.50am, MAN1The camera is located in the middle of the warehouse on the second floor — in a \u0027pod\u0027, Amazon\u0027s word for a four-sided fabric storage unit. There are more than 10,000 pods closely packed together.Each is 8ft tall and 2ft 6in wide. They have cubby holes on each side — storing, for instance, a Beast Gear self-moulding mouthguard, a Will Smith CD, two Katy Perry CDs and a plug-in pest repellent. \u0027Everything is randomly stored across all the floors,\u0027 says Neil. This allows staff to access separate pods if there is a sudden rush of orders for one product rather than all having to queue by one pod.10.29am          Ann Doughty\u0027s order is received at the Amazon Fulfilment centre in Manchester where a robot locates her camera  in a yellow \u0027pod\u0027 and bring to \u0027picker\u0027 staffA robot called No. 53721, one of 2,000 in MAN1, collects the pod containing the camera. The robots outnumber the human staff by 800 they are about the size of a large electric lawnmower and cost more than £10,000 each.They move like rooks on a chess board — going east to west or north to south. They can\u0027t go diagonally, but can spin around to move direction by 90 degrees.The robot whizzes under the pods until it finds the right one. A hydraulic lift in the top of the robot is released, which raises the pod an inch. It then carries the pod towards the edge of the floor.The robots are continually lifting up pods and putting them down. \u0027It\u0027s quite therapeutic just watching them move about,\u0027 says Neil.10.31am          Orders are scanned and labelled with the delivery address at this machineFurther down the conveyor, the parcel moves under another barcode scanner. The conveyor belt briefly pauses while a sticky address label for \u0027Mrs Anne Doughty\u0027 is printed and stuck onto the parcel.It flies down a chute to the floor below, then the ground floor.10.44amIt\u0027s still less than two hours since Anne clicked \u0027buy\u0027. The camera, having travelled along a fair chunk of the eight miles of conveyor belts, is (after another barcode scan) sent down a side-chute into a huge open-topped, 6ft-high cardboard box, called a \u0027gaylord\u0027. (They were first created by the Gaylord Container Corporation in the U.S.)Underneath the conveyor belt side-chutes, about 90 different gaylords are lined up, each one designated to a particular area of the country.Anne\u0027s camera is sent into a gaylord destined for DLS2, an Amazon \u0027delivery station\u0027 in Leeds, along with 181 other items.2.17pmThe camera has been sitting in the DLS2 gaylord for a short time. But at every stage, its barcode has been scanned to ensure it\u0027s on time and going to the right place.It is now loaded onto the back of an HGV lorry with other gaylords and leaves MAN1.The business rates bill Amazon had to pay last year for this vast warehouse outside Manchester was £919,370, according to the real estate adviser, Altus Group. This is less than £1.42 million that the financially troubled House of Fraser paid on its department store in the centre of the city.\u0027Is Amazon a good corporate citizen?\u0027 I ask general manager Neil. He replies: \u0027In an area that had reasonably high unemployment, we\u0027ve offered over 1,000 permanent positions to people in the local community, offering a lot of economic prosperity as a result of that.\u00273.52pmThe lorry arrives at DLS2, the Amazon delivery station near junction 45 of the M1, on the outskirts of Leeds. A far smaller building than the Manchester fulfilment centre, it is one storey high and about 240ft long. The gaylord is unloaded from the HGV.4.07pm          Operations associate Hassan Khan sorts parcels into delivery districts for delivery drivers at the Leeds based delivery station, West YorkshireAmazon has 38 different UK delivery stations, which act as sorting offices. Until 2012, products were collected by firms such as Hermes, Yodel and DHL, which sorted and delivered them.However, Amazon took greater control of this process after it started offering same-day and Sunday deliveries.The Leeds base opened in 2016 and employs 40 full-time employees. They sort the parcels into postcodes for areas from Huddersfield to Scarborough.Because Anne\u0027s camera is a same-day delivery, operations associate Hassan Khan sorts it into a yellow cage full of parcels being delivered this evening.4.58pmMornings tend to be busiest at Leeds. That\u0027s when one-day deliveries get sent out. Same-day deliveries — a far smaller proportion of Amazon orders — are picked up at about 5pm. Outside the delivery station, a trickle of cars and white vans arrive for the evening pick-ups.Amazon uses a network of courier companies, as well as a newer service called Flex, which is similar to online taxi service Uber.Anyone with a car and a smartphone can sign up to be an Amazon Flex driver, earning £12 to £15 an hour — though they pay for their own car, petrol and insurance.Cars — I can see a Seat Leon, a Vauxhall Astra, a Mercedes C2, a Nissan Note and a Citroen C4 — line up in rows.The Flex drivers, men aged 20 to 45, most speaking broken English, arrive in the warehouse and use their phone to scan a quick response code on a warehouse computer terminal. They are given a cage, with about 25 to 30 parcels, to wheel out to their cars.5.07pm          Alex Rabone,28, delivers Mrs Doughtys order to her home in Garforth, West YorkshireAnne\u0027s cul-de-sac is Alex\u0027s first stop. \u0027I like delivering around here,\u0027 he says. \u0027The best areas are high-density, suburban — all the front doors on the ground floor. Lovely.\u0027He rings Anne\u0027s doorbell. She answers and is handed her parcel — less than nine hours after she first pressed \u0027Buy Now\u0027.5.41pmAnne opens the package in her kitchen and is impressed at how lightweight and \u0027dinky\u0027 the camera is. \u0027I do worry about the High Street, but Amazon is so useful,\u0027 she says. And cheap.Her nearest electronics store is Currys PC World in Pontefract, 20 minutes away. Its cheapest digital camera is £69, compared with her £38 model from Amazon.One thing is certain, however. With robots helping Amazon to ship parcels within nine hours of them being ordered, the millions that we spend online every week are only going to increase. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/10/07/4EFB16CA00000578-0-image-a-70_1533883783858.jpg","title":"State Isa payouts slashed just weeks Bank England hiked rates","story":"    Phillip Hammond (right) was last night accused of abandoning savers as the Government\u0027s savings arm prepares to slash the pay out on its best IsaA decade ago its top Isa paid 5.8 per cent – £696.

At banks, only £85,000 is guaranteed under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme if a firm fails.Each year the Government sets NS\u0026ampI a fundraising target, which it must not exceed. For this tax year – between April 1 and March 31 – the target is just £6billion (plus or minus £3billion each side). This is its lowest limit for five years, down from £8billion in the previous tax year. When the target is low NS\u0026ampI must avoid attracting too much cash so it does not overshoot it. This typically means offering lower rates or introducing stricter limits on how much people can invest.In June, NS\u0026ampI came under fire for slashing the amount new savers can invest in its Guaranteed Growth or Guaranteed Income Bonds from £1 million to just £10,000. Experts said if the Government increases NS\u0026ampI\u0027s target to nearer £20billion it would be forced to boost its rates to attract more savers\u0027 money.     The Bank of England (pictured) hiked rates, but the National Savings \u0026amp Investment (NS\u0026ampI) is poised to cut its easy-access Direct Isa rate from 1 per cent to 0.75 per cent on September 24 anywayAnd when NS\u0026ampI increases its rates, other banks and building societies often follow with more competitive deals of their own.Ros Altmann, former pensions minister and campaigner for older people, said: \u0027It seems unfair on savers that the safest savings accounts, backed by the Treasury, are cutting interest rates at the time the Bank of England has increased base rate.\u0027An NS\u0026ampI spokesman said: \u0027NS\u0026ampI sets its interest rates to balance the interests of its savers, taxpayers and the stability of the broader financial services sector.\u0027 A Treasury spokesman said: \u0027When setting the rates of NS\u0026ampI products, it\u0027s important we get the best possible value for taxpayers, while still offering a competitive rate for savers.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/17/10/4F28632B00000578-0-image-a-4_1534497533835.jpg","title":"The tough new GCSE needs just 17 score C","story":"    The new GCSEs were pioneered by former education secretary Michael Gove in an effort to drive up standards. Pictured: GCSE students from last year celebrate their resultsThere were fears students would perform badly because of the harder content, but the exams regulator Ofqual has now said it will make sure ‘no student is disadvantaged’.It means grade boundaries will be set low to ensure the same proportions get good and bad grades as last year. Similar measures were imposed on the new A-levels.But the move prompted critics to question what the point was of making the exams more difficult.It came as a row was brewing over whether private school pupils are being given an easier ride to university by boycotting the new qualifications in favour of IGCSEs, which are designed to prepare students to sit the International Baccelaureate in sixth form.Alan Smithers, professor of education at the University of Buckingham, said setting low grade boundaries risked undermining the reforms.Libyan refugee, 22, who earned rocket science degree from...Every welfare recipient under the age of 35 could be forced...Share this article‘Some people thought that the whole point in recalibrating the qualifications and creating a different grading scale was to free things up, and create a fresh start,’ he said. ‘But Ofqual is trying to square the circle. The exams are tougher but it wants to keep the outcomes the same.‘The only way to do this is to lower the grade thresholds.’The new GCSEs are graded 1-9, with the bottom of the 4 grade being aligned with the old C, and the bottom of 7 being aligned with the old A.Ofqual have said the proportion of entries who previously scored a C or above – two-thirds – will get a 4 or above this year.Meanwhile, 20 per cent should achieve a 7 or above, and within this group around 20 per cent will get the top grade of 9.Analysis shows that last year, when reformed exams were sat only in maths, English language and English Literature, grade boundaries were set lower by exam board Edexcel than for the old exams in 2016.For example, in the new higher tier maths paper, the grade boundary for a C was 17 per cent – down from 35 per cent the year before.In English literature, the grade boundary was 43 per cent, in comparison with 60 per cent he previous year. And in English language it was 46 per cent, down from 60.          The new GCSEs are graded 1-9, with the bottom of the 4 grade being aligned with the old C, and the bottom of 7 being aligned with the old A (stock image)This year, a further 20 subjects follow the new GCSE format.The reforms followed years of grade inflation under New Labour. It led universities to complain they were no longer able to pick out the truly exceptional pupils.The new exams will have more challenging content, in an effort to bring up standards.However, yesterday there were concerns over some private schools’ failure to adopt the new qualifications. Some private schools are doing IGCSEs, an alternative which critics say is easier and gives them an unfair advantage in university admissions.An investigation by the Times Educational Supplement has also found that some universities are asking for lower equivalent grades for IGCSEs than they are for reformed GCSEs. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/15/16/4F1CA28E00000578-0-image-a-94_1534348447139.jpg","title":"Diners ate table cloths feel satisfied food research reveals","story":"    Casual diners may find it hard to digest, but a crisp linen tablecloth really does make food taste betterResearchers found that customers who ate off linen were almost 10 per cent more likely to give their seal of approval to the meal.

I hope to God they are providing comfort and reassurance — and avoiding therapeutic intervention.It may sound strange, but that’s the last thing traumatised people need. The belief that it’s helpful for people to share the horrific experiences they’ve just endured is a myth. Indeed, it could be disastrous for them. Sometimes, it really isn’t good to talk.What we have learned from studies of military personnel in recent years is that the brain is actually rather good at processing terrible events — but quietly and at its own pace.Problems develop when, in the hours after the event, people are encouraged to recount what happened to them and what they saw. It’s no protection at all against related mental health issues in the future. Indeed, it actually raises the risk of mental illness such as PTSD.We know, for example, that soldiers who attend de-briefing sessions after witnessing traumatic incidents actually do worse in the longer term than those who missed the session.Going over the experience so soon after it has occurred links it with the powerful, still-raw emotions felt at the time — fear, revulsion, anger, helplessness, despair etc. The survivor’s memories are consolidated and a pathway is created in the brain that allows the mind to run through them again and again, as though it is stuck in a groove.Of course, I’m not saying that people might not need therapy down the line. But that is very different to giving therapy prophylactically before symptoms have developed.On July 7, 2005, I was working at a London hospital that had taken in survivors from the terrorist bombings in the capital.

She also claimed that the 47-year-old had taken acid before he sent that tweet           Musk described the past year as \u0027excruciating\u0027 and the \u0027most difficult and most painful year of his career\u0027. The interview also raises concerned about Musk\u0027s drug use.

But I was not on weed, to be clear.\u0027 The newspaper reported that Musk had \u0027alternated between laughter and tears\u0027 in the interview and said he had not taken more than a week off work since 2001.He admitted he relied on medication to help him sleep, saying: \u0027It is often a choice of no sleep or Ambien.\u0027According to the New York Times article, board members have noticed that Ambien \u0027contributes\u0027 to his late-night Twitter posts. It says they are also \u0027aware\u0027 that he has occasionally used recreational drugs.

She says the internet is invaluable for household items, books and presents. \u0027Everything is there in one place. However, I\u0027d never buy clothes online — you can\u0027t try them on.\u00278.49amAnne identifies on Amazon an Aberg Best 21 megapixels camera, which can be delivered the same day. She\u0027s impressed by the price — £38 — and as a Prime customer there\u0027s no delivery fee. She clicks and buys.8.49am, MAN1, Altrincham, Gtr ManchesterSixty-five miles away from Anne\u0027s home in Garforth is MAN1, one of Amazon\u0027s 17 giant UK warehouses, or \u0027fulfilment centres\u0027 as the company calls them. Each is named after the nearest airport. MAN1 is a few hundred yards from Manchester Airport.General manager Neil Travis, 51, says being near the M56 and M6 means they are close to a large percentage of customers and allows them \u0027to do same day, next-day delivery\u0027.The warehouse is 780ft long, has nearly a million square feet of floor space arranged across four floors and holds \u0027many millions\u0027 of products.Neil says it is \u0027a matter of seconds\u0027 between Anne clicking and MAN1 receiving the order. \u0027When you click \u0027buy it now\u0027, the system will see which of the 17 buildings in the UK has that item in stock,\u0027 he adds. \u0027And it works out where the customer is located.\u0027The system then determines the quickest route to get the product out to the customer.\u0027The computer that controls the \u0027system\u0027 is \u0027in a cloud\u0027,\u0027 he says, referring to the nickname for where data is stored on remote servers.Explaining how products get from the warehouse to our door, he adds: \u0027Everything works backwards from the customer\u0027s home.\u0027It must leave MAN1 by 2pm, be packed by 1pm and selected for the start of this process by 12pm. \u0027It calculates it all the way backwards.\u00278.50am, MAN1The camera is located in the middle of the warehouse on the second floor — in a \u0027pod\u0027, Amazon\u0027s word for a four-sided fabric storage unit. There are more than 10,000 pods closely packed together.Each is 8ft tall and 2ft 6in wide. They have cubby holes on each side — storing, for instance, a Beast Gear self-moulding mouthguard, a Will Smith CD, two Katy Perry CDs and a plug-in pest repellent. \u0027Everything is randomly stored across all the floors,\u0027 says Neil. This allows staff to access separate pods if there is a sudden rush of orders for one product rather than all having to queue by one pod.10.29am          Ann Doughty\u0027s order is received at the Amazon Fulfilment centre in Manchester where a robot locates her camera  in a yellow \u0027pod\u0027 and bring to \u0027picker\u0027 staffA robot called No. 53721, one of 2,000 in MAN1, collects the pod containing the camera. The robots outnumber the human staff by 800 they are about the size of a large electric lawnmower and cost more than £10,000 each.They move like rooks on a chess board — going east to west or north to south. They can\u0027t go diagonally, but can spin around to move direction by 90 degrees.The robot whizzes under the pods until it finds the right one. A hydraulic lift in the top of the robot is released, which raises the pod an inch. It then carries the pod towards the edge of the floor.The robots are continually lifting up pods and putting them down. \u0027It\u0027s quite therapeutic just watching them move about,\u0027 says Neil.10.31am          Orders are scanned and labelled with the delivery address at this machineFurther down the conveyor, the parcel moves under another barcode scanner. The conveyor belt briefly pauses while a sticky address label for \u0027Mrs Anne Doughty\u0027 is printed and stuck onto the parcel.It flies down a chute to the floor below, then the ground floor.10.44amIt\u0027s still less than two hours since Anne clicked \u0027buy\u0027. The camera, having travelled along a fair chunk of the eight miles of conveyor belts, is (after another barcode scan) sent down a side-chute into a huge open-topped, 6ft-high cardboard box, called a \u0027gaylord\u0027. (They were first created by the Gaylord Container Corporation in the U.S.)Underneath the conveyor belt side-chutes, about 90 different gaylords are lined up, each one designated to a particular area of the country.Anne\u0027s camera is sent into a gaylord destined for DLS2, an Amazon \u0027delivery station\u0027 in Leeds, along with 181 other items.2.17pmThe camera has been sitting in the DLS2 gaylord for a short time. But at every stage, its barcode has been scanned to ensure it\u0027s on time and going to the right place.It is now loaded onto the back of an HGV lorry with other gaylords and leaves MAN1.The business rates bill Amazon had to pay last year for this vast warehouse outside Manchester was £919,370, according to the real estate adviser, Altus Group. This is less than £1.42 million that the financially troubled House of Fraser paid on its department store in the centre of the city.\u0027Is Amazon a good corporate citizen?\u0027 I ask general manager Neil. He replies: \u0027In an area that had reasonably high unemployment, we\u0027ve offered over 1,000 permanent positions to people in the local community, offering a lot of economic prosperity as a result of that.\u00273.52pmThe lorry arrives at DLS2, the Amazon delivery station near junction 45 of the M1, on the outskirts of Leeds. A far smaller building than the Manchester fulfilment centre, it is one storey high and about 240ft long. The gaylord is unloaded from the HGV.4.07pm          Operations associate Hassan Khan sorts parcels into delivery districts for delivery drivers at the Leeds based delivery station, West YorkshireAmazon has 38 different UK delivery stations, which act as sorting offices. Until 2012, products were collected by firms such as Hermes, Yodel and DHL, which sorted and delivered them.However, Amazon took greater control of this process after it started offering same-day and Sunday deliveries.The Leeds base opened in 2016 and employs 40 full-time employees. They sort the parcels into postcodes for areas from Huddersfield to Scarborough.Because Anne\u0027s camera is a same-day delivery, operations associate Hassan Khan sorts it into a yellow cage full of parcels being delivered this evening.4.58pmMornings tend to be busiest at Leeds. That\u0027s when one-day deliveries get sent out. Same-day deliveries — a far smaller proportion of Amazon orders — are picked up at about 5pm. Outside the delivery station, a trickle of cars and white vans arrive for the evening pick-ups.Amazon uses a network of courier companies, as well as a newer service called Flex, which is similar to online taxi service Uber.Anyone with a car and a smartphone can sign up to be an Amazon Flex driver, earning £12 to £15 an hour — though they pay for their own car, petrol and insurance.Cars — I can see a Seat Leon, a Vauxhall Astra, a Mercedes C2, a Nissan Note and a Citroen C4 — line up in rows.The Flex drivers, men aged 20 to 45, most speaking broken English, arrive in the warehouse and use their phone to scan a quick response code on a warehouse computer terminal. They are given a cage, with about 25 to 30 parcels, to wheel out to their cars.5.07pm          Alex Rabone,28, delivers Mrs Doughtys order to her home in Garforth, West YorkshireAnne\u0027s cul-de-sac is Alex\u0027s first stop. \u0027I like delivering around here,\u0027 he says. \u0027The best areas are high-density, suburban — all the front doors on the ground floor. Lovely.\u0027He rings Anne\u0027s doorbell. She answers and is handed her parcel — less than nine hours after she first pressed \u0027Buy Now\u0027.5.41pmAnne opens the package in her kitchen and is impressed at how lightweight and \u0027dinky\u0027 the camera is. \u0027I do worry about the High Street, but Amazon is so useful,\u0027 she says. And cheap.Her nearest electronics store is Currys PC World in Pontefract, 20 minutes away. Its cheapest digital camera is £69, compared with her £38 model from Amazon.One thing is certain, however. With robots helping Amazon to ship parcels within nine hours of them being ordered, the millions that we spend online every week are only going to increase. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/17/10/4F28632B00000578-0-image-a-4_1534497533835.jpg","title":"The tough new GCSE needs just 17 score C","story":"    The new GCSEs were pioneered by former education secretary Michael Gove in an effort to drive up standards. Pictured: GCSE students from last year celebrate their resultsThere were fears students would perform badly because of the harder content, but the exams regulator Ofqual has now said it will make sure ‘no student is disadvantaged’.It means grade boundaries will be set low to ensure the same proportions get good and bad grades as last year. Similar measures were imposed on the new A-levels.But the move prompted critics to question what the point was of making the exams more difficult.It came as a row was brewing over whether private school pupils are being given an easier ride to university by boycotting the new qualifications in favour of IGCSEs, which are designed to prepare students to sit the International Baccelaureate in sixth form.Alan Smithers, professor of education at the University of Buckingham, said setting low grade boundaries risked undermining the reforms.Libyan refugee, 22, who earned rocket science degree from...Every welfare recipient under the age of 35 could be forced...Share this article‘Some people thought that the whole point in recalibrating the qualifications and creating a different grading scale was to free things up, and create a fresh start,’ he said. ‘But Ofqual is trying to square the circle. The exams are tougher but it wants to keep the outcomes the same.‘The only way to do this is to lower the grade thresholds.’The new GCSEs are graded 1-9, with the bottom of the 4 grade being aligned with the old C, and the bottom of 7 being aligned with the old A.Ofqual have said the proportion of entries who previously scored a C or above – two-thirds – will get a 4 or above this year.Meanwhile, 20 per cent should achieve a 7 or above, and within this group around 20 per cent will get the top grade of 9.Analysis shows that last year, when reformed exams were sat only in maths, English language and English Literature, grade boundaries were set lower by exam board Edexcel than for the old exams in 2016.For example, in the new higher tier maths paper, the grade boundary for a C was 17 per cent – down from 35 per cent the year before.In English literature, the grade boundary was 43 per cent, in comparison with 60 per cent he previous year. And in English language it was 46 per cent, down from 60.          The new GCSEs are graded 1-9, with the bottom of the 4 grade being aligned with the old C, and the bottom of 7 being aligned with the old A (stock image)This year, a further 20 subjects follow the new GCSE format.The reforms followed years of grade inflation under New Labour. It led universities to complain they were no longer able to pick out the truly exceptional pupils.The new exams will have more challenging content, in an effort to bring up standards.However, yesterday there were concerns over some private schools’ failure to adopt the new qualifications.

In new novel Women Talking, the ex-Mennonite tells their storyMiriam Toews describes her latest book as an “imagined response” to crimes perpetrated against Mennonite women in Bolivia. Toews (pronounced “Taves”) grew up in a small Mennonite town called Steinbach in the prairie province of Manitoba, Canada, somewhere that wasn’t as closed to the world as the Bolivian colony but was still rigid and righteous – a place for an aspiring writer to flee, as Toews did, at 18.She was living in Toronto, in 2011, when a trial revealed the horrific extent of these crimes: between 2005 and 2009, more than 130 women had been repeatedly anaesthetised with a sedative spray meant for animals and raped in their homes at the ultraconservative Bolivian Manitoba Colony. The women would wake bloodied and aching, but when they spoke up, they were told that perhaps the devil had attacked. Or maybe nothing had happened, and these tales were merely an invention of “wild female imagination”.“I felt an obligation, a need, to write about these women,” says Toews who, like the Mennonites in Bolivia, is descended from the Molotschna colony in what is now Ukraine. “I’m related to them. I could easily have been one of them.”Toews’s eighth book, Women Talking, is a fictional account of eight women gathering in the wake of the men’s arrests to decide a course of action. It’s a dense, eerie, darkly funny novel that reads like a tightly constructed short story. The slim book drops into the cultural conversation around sexual assault like an exclamation mark: “#MennoniteMeToo” remarked one reader. Comparisons to the newly hot The Handmaid’s Tale were already likely (not just bonnets but the patriarchy) and became inevitable when Margaret Atwood tweeted: “Don’t miss this one! ...Could be right out of The Handmaid’s Tale.”But the timing of the release is coincidence, not prescience, because the novel was a long time coming. As Women Talking sat nascent in Toews’s mind, her sister Marjorie killed herself on the railway tracks in Steinbach where her father, Melvin, had done the same 12 years earlier. The Bolivia story was set aside as Toews answered an urgent need to write All My Puny Sorrows, a tragicomic story of one sister’s life and death, told by the one left behind.That book became a bestseller in 2013, nominated for the Folio prize and the Wellcome prize. But Toews never stopped thinking about the women of Manitoba Colony. She kept wondering: “Then what?” What do the women do after they learn the truth of these violations, this attack of body and faith? In her version, they meet secretively in a hayloft, perched on milk buckets, and talk – and talk, and talk. In a place where, as one of them puts it, “women live out their days as mute, submissive, and obedient servants. Animals”, simply gathering without permission is an act of subversion. Engaging in a two-day long Socratic dialogue on forgiveness, innocence and love is flat-out transgressive.“I’ve always been trying to challenge the patriarchy, specifically of my Mennonite community, but I’m concerned with the suppression of girls and women especially, and any place in the world that falls under fundamentalist, authoritarian thinking,” says Toews. “I think in my work, and in my life, I’ve always been attempting to, as they used to say, stick it to the man.”Toews is barefoot in her Victorian home in downtown Toronto, a fact born of a hot day, but which somehow feels like a reference to her book’s opening, where the women wash one another’s feet in a ritual cleansing before the debate commences.The decision to start with this healing gesture rather than depicting the rapes was in part an effort to avoid salaciousness. “I don’t like the media phrase ‘ghost rapes’,” says Toews. “It’s not accurate, obviously, and it perpetuates the ignorance around the attacks. It echoes what the elders were saying to the women. Some of the women had begun to think that way themselves: ‘Could it be demons? Satan? Punishment? Ghosts?’ Using the term makes the whole thing sound like a cartoon.”When she heard about the attacks, Toews says: “I was horrified but not surprised. The details were shocking but these types of crimes have always occurred in places like this. Extremist, closed communities are ripe for violence.”The women in her novel talk of a three-year-old with a sexually transmitted infection who is denied medical treatment. They talk also of her mother, who retaliates with a scythe (and then must ask the men for forgiveness). One woman defends these conversations: “There’s no plot, we’re only women talking.” It’s a brilliant meta-line that functions as a pre-emptive strike against critics. And the “only” is sharply ironic: in this place – as has often been the case throughout history – women talking is not a small thing, but is in itself action and hence plot. “I’ve spent a lot of time with Mennonite women, and there’s a certain kind of natural, inherent, storytelling capacity,” says Toews. “Not to the point where they’re being disobedient. They know their roles and they play them. But when they get together, there’s a lot of laughter and their own kind of coded, rebellious exchange. I wanted to get that into the book.”She does. Funny tangents include one about how to get a cherry stone out of a child’s nose (suck it out). But mostly the women debate their options: do nothing, stay and fight or leave. Their choices are tragically curtailed by illiteracy and limited understanding of the larger world – they literally don’t know where they are in it. None of them can read a map, leading to a radical idea: “Perhaps the women can create their own map as they go.”This optimism comes from Ona, the book’s axis, a middle-aged woman with a poet-philosopher’s mind, unmarried and impregnated by a rapist. She is also the object of infatuation for the narrator, a teacher named August Epp, appointed by the women to take minutes. August is their sole male ally, profoundly respectful and locked in a lasting, hopeless love for Ona. When her skirt grazes his leg, he’s sent into rapture. August has lived, briefly and disastrously, outside the colony. Because of this, and his erudition, he is barely tolerated, set apart from the men. The impossible love story between these two misfits is the tiny fire that warms the novel.Growing up in Steinbach, Toews recalls, one of the worst things a young woman could be was “wild” – a word used for the kind of girl who dared to buy a Led Zeppelin record or wear short shorts. In Women Talking, and in news reports of the trial, the phrase “wild female imagination” is deployed to erase the rapes, reminiscent of other he-said-she-said dismissals of female experience, such as “hysteria”. “Wild is a word used to discount and discredit what women do and say,” Toews says. “But the wild female imagination is also the stuff of art.”Toews never thought of herself as wild: “I was just feisty.” Her parents were both well educated and unusually progressive. Her mother, Elvira, once decided to run for mayor (her father begged her not to, and she didn’t), and later in life became a family therapist. At 18, Toews skipped her high school graduation and left on a train for Montreal.In her 20s, she had a son and a daughter and worked in journalism, publishing her first novel in 1996. With Summer of My Amazing Luck, a gambolling story of a single teen mom in a Winnipeg housing project, Toews debuted a career-defining light touch with the darkest of subjects. Her breakthrough novel was 2004’s A Complicated Kindness, where she cast her gaze on the repression that props up a world of buggies and butter churning any romantic notions of ye olde ways are undercut with a machete. In the novel, another teen girl protagonist, 16-year-old Nomi Nickel, roils with hormonal fury at a dangerously finger-wagging town that looks a lot like Steinbach. Familial death – characters grapple with ghosts of mothers, sisters, fathers – hangs over Toews’s books but she can be laugh-out-loud funny, too.The early novels were composed mostly in Winnipeg. Toews’s husband was a street performer, and the family often followed him in a 1969 VW van across Canada while he ate fire in front of crowds. They split up a few years ago, and Toews, at 54, has an eight-month-old granddaughter, another grandchild on the way and lives with her partner, the writer Erik Rutherford.This expansion of Toews’s family brings palpable joy – “I love being a grandmother,” she beams – but it brings other absences into relief, too. After her sister killed herself, she says, “I didn’t think I’d ever write anything again. I didn’t even know how I was going to get out of bed in the morning.”Eventually, All My Puny Sorrows emerged from the grief, but Women Talking was written in a different kind of anguish. The weight of responsibility to get it right, combined with the book’s unusual structure and chorus of voices (“Oh God, all those names!”) made it one of the most difficult works she’s written. “I don’t know if a brain can explode in one’s head but I really thought it was going to happen. I had to finish it just so it wouldn’t kill me.”She is aware that Women Talking has landed in a politically charged climate. “I know the book could be viewed as me making a political statement through a fictional narrative, which wasn’t really my intent. My goal is always to tell a story and to create characters that will move the reader. But I’m of course a feminist. I have a need to challenge that status quo that I’ve experienced,” says Toews.The men who were charged were convicted, but there have been reports of other alleged assaults in the colony. “I’ve seen the warmth and love the Mennonite community can provide,” she says, “but there are deep problems. I feel that I can be, I have to be, self-critical.” In her 2000 memoir, Swing Low, Toews writes her father’s story in his voice, a poignant interior exploration of an honourable man’s struggle with manic depression in a community at once absurdly restrictive and demonstrably kind. Over two decades, she has been fiction’s most renowned gatekeeper of a world that remains, to most readers, mysteriously curtained. Her young female characters are our guides therein, such as Irma Voth, the eponymous 19-year-old heroine of Toews’s 2011 novel who is expelled from a Mexican colony. “I thought I could get the Mennonite thing out of my system earlier on, but now I feel like, ‘Oh no. I was wrong. It’s even more in my system than ever.’ I don’t really know how to stop”• Women Talking is published by Faber.

He reveals what they meant to himIt was October 2016. Hurricane Matthew had just rolled out to sea, Samsung phones were catching fire, Hillary Clinton was up by double digits in the national polls and the unthinkable was still unthinkable. Shailagh Murray had spent two terms in the White House helping to lead the administration’s communications strategy and it appeared to have taken its toll. With Obama just a few months away from leaving office, journalists wanted exit interviews they wanted to be first, biggest, loudest. She was sick of the egos, the same old questions.The letters, she said, served as a respite from all that, and she offered to show some to me. She chose a navy blue binder, pulled it off the shelf, and opened it, fanning through page after page of letters, some handwritten in cursive on personal letterheads, others block printed on notebook paper and decorated with stickers there were business letters, emails, faxes and random photographs of families, soldiers and pets. “You know, it’s this dialogue he’s been having with the country that people aren’t even aware of,” she said, referring to Obama’s eight-year habit of cor­responding with the American public. “Collectively, you get this kind of American tableau.”Obama had committed to reading 10 letters a day when he first took office, becoming the first president to put such a deliberate focus on constituent correspon­dence. Late each afternoon, around five o’clock, a selection would be sent up from the post room to the Oval Office. The “10 LADs”, as they came to be known – for “10 letters a day” – would circulate among senior staff and the stack would be added to the back of the briefing book the president took with him to the resi­dence each night. He answered some by hand and wrote notes on others for the writing team to answer, and on some he scribbled “save”.Starting in 2010, all physical mail was scanned and preserved. From 2011, every word of every email fac­tored into the creation of a daily word cloud, dis­tri­buted around the White House so policy makers and staff members alike could get a glimpse of the issues and ideas constituents had on their minds.In 2009, Natoma Canfield, a cancer survivor from Medina, Ohio, wrote in, detailing her staggering health insurance premiums in a letter Obama framed and had hung in a corridor between his private study and the Oval Office: “I need your health reform bill to help me!!! I simply can no longer afford to pay for my health care costs!!” It stood in for the tens of thousands of similar letters he got on the healthcare issue alone. They saw spikes in volume after major events such as the mass shootings in Newtown, Connecticut, and Charleston, South Carolina the Paris terrorist attacks the government shutdown Benghazi. You could see these spikes in the word clouds. “Jobs” might grow for a time, or “Syria”, or “Trayvon”, or a cluster such as “family-children-fear” or “work-loans-student” or “Isis-money-war” surrounding a giant “help” – the most common word of all.“You should go to the mailroom if you want the full effect,” she said. “Just sit there and read. You’ll see what I’m talking about.”“We will begin with a tour,” said Fiona Reeves on welcoming me at the White House security gate. In emails she had said I would have to agree to certain terms before I would be allowed into the post room. These mostly had to do with privacy concerns – I couldn’t disclose the contents of any letter I read unless it was cleared with its author – but the forti­tude with which she announced the rules made the larger point: Reeves cared deeply about people who wrote letters to the president.“Why don’t you sit down and read?” she said. Ten interns were crowded around two long tables, but there was an extra seat.A girl doesn’t want her mum to be deported, and can the president please help? A guy finally admits to his wife that he’s gay, and now he would like to tell the president. A car dealer writes to say his bank is shut­ting him down, and thanks for nothing, Mr President. A vet who can’t stop seeing what he saw in Iraq writes a barely intelligible rant that makes his point all the more intelligible: “Help.” An inmate admits to selling crack, but he wants the president to know he is not a lost cause: “I have dreams Mr President, big dreams.” A man can’t find a job. A woman can’t find a job. A teacher with advanced certification can’t find a damn job. A lesbian couple just got married thank you, Mr President. A man sends his medical bills a woman sends her student loan statements a child sends her drawing of a cat a mother sends her teen­ager’s report card – straight As, isn’t that awesome, Mr President?This pile, that pile, another pile over there pull from the middle if you want. The narrative was sloppy and urgent, America talking all at once. No filter. The hand­writing, the ink, the choice of letter­head – every letter was a real object from a real person, and now you were holding it, and so now you were responsible for it.In total, the Office of Presidential Correspondence required the orchestration of 50 staff members, 36 interns and a rotating roster of 300 volunteers to keep up with about 10,000 letters and mes­sages every day. As the director of the entire operation, Reeves was the one who kept it all humming along.¶Reeves and I met again in March 2018. It was a windy day, and we were about to head over to meet with Obama in the post-presidency office he maintains in Washington. I had spent months tracking down the people who had written letters, following up on their stories, finding out how hearing from the president had changed their lives.Since leaving the White House Reeves had become a mother. She told me about a meeting she’d had, before she left, with the White House staff secre­tary for President-elect Donald Trump. He asked about the post room, how it worked, and Reeves told him about the transition materials, the binders, and she did her best to summarise. “Ten letters a day,” she said, as if that would simply be the normal order of business. The president would be expected to read his mail and answer it. The meeting was maybe 20 minutes. The staff secretary said some­one would be getting back to her for more information. No one did.Obama had been largely absent from public life since he left office, working on his foundation and his book, offering no comment on the cascading tumult that characterised the US’s new political landscape. At that point, he had done just three interviews: one about his early days as a community organiser, another that brought David Letterman out of retire­ment, and a third with Prince Harry. And now he would do one more: a conversation about the post room.His suite was bright, airy and colourful. Large images of the Pacific Ocean adorned the waiting area, along with a set of Muhammad Ali’s boxing gloves that had been on display in the Oval Office dining room. Head­­ing down the wide centre hall toward Obama’s office brought you stead­ily closer to a photograph of Martin Luther King Jr. The image was of King’s back as he stood before a crowd – the point of view of the speaker, not the listener.Many of the staffers, about 12 in all, had worked for Obama in the White House, and most of them knew Reeves people stepped out of their offices to greet her. Obama app­eared just like the rest of them, smiling widely. You don’t realise just how lanky he is until you see him in person, a long, flat physique he looked fit, even youthful, his hair cut short so that all the grey he’d famously acquired during his presi­dency was less pronounced. He walked up to Reeves with his arms outstretched and asked about her family, and she sheepishly stepped in for a hug.“I’m great. She’s great. We’re just great … ”“Well, we’ve got babies popping out,” Obama said. “It’s the best thing. I’ve got all these staff who started with me when they were like 20. And now suddenly it’s like they’ve got kids everywhere. It’s sweet. And a bunch of them, you know, a number of them met on the campaign or at the White House. But nobody yet has named a child Barack.”“A lot of letter writers did,” Reeves offered, perhaps too quietly for him to hear.“I’m a little frustrated about that,” Obama continued with a laugh. “I’m like, ‘Come on, people!’”We followed him into his office. He offered us a seat on the couch, and he sank into the chair at the end. He was in jeans and a light blue shirt unbuttoned at the top. He put his feet up, crossed his legs at the ankles. Pete Souza’s book of photographs was on the coffee table family pictures were everywhere, on end tables, on the walls and Obama’s expansive desk on the other side of the room was covered in paper and books. He mentioned the book he’s been working on, said it was difficult. “Writing is just so hard. Painful. It’s – everybody thinks it’s, you know. But it’s work. It’s like having homework all the time. Yeah, it’s hard.“I should mention to you, by the way, Fiona,” he said, as we were getting settled, “we’re still getting like 250,000 letters a year. It’s a lot.”I noticed that over by his desk, on a wall, he had hung the framed letter from Natoma Canfield Obama had said she reminded him of his mum, who died at 52 of a similar cancer. The letter had stood as a reminder to him of his commitment to healthcare reform.“The only instruction I gave was that I wanted every packet to be representative,” he continued. “And understanding that it wouldn’t be perfect. It didn’t mean that, you know, out of every 10 letters, there had to be two positive and two negative and three neutral and one funny. It wasn’t formulaic like that. But that was the one thing I insisted on – that this is not useful to me if all I’m getting are, you know, ‘happy birthday’ wishes. And I think they did a won­derful job of channelling the American people in that way.”“It wasn’t just me,” Reeves said. “It was this big group. And folks in the office came from different backgrounds. We had our volunteer workforce. And there were some old people in the mix, too. So we had a lot of people putting stuff forward for you, a lot of people interpreting what ‘representative’ meant.”“I will say this does also have to do with a culture that we tried to develop early on in the campaign,” Obama said. “Which was putting a lot of confidence in a bunch of young people to fairly, meaningfully, and passionately reflect the people they were inter­act­ing with. Whether that was on a campaign or in the office.”I asked if he had any sense of the power of his response to the people who wrote to him. “I think I understood that if somebody writes a letter and they get any kind of response, that there’s a sense of ... being heard,” he said. “And so often, espe­ci­ally back in 2009, 2010, 2011, a lot of people were going through a lot of hardship. And a lot of them felt alone in that hardship. They were losing their homes, or they’re dealing with somebody at the bank and the bank say­ing: ‘There’s nothing we can do. You’re going to lose your house.’ Or they’ve got a pink slip, and they’ve lost their job, and they’re going to interview after interview after interview. Over time, I think it’s easy for folks to feel a little invisible, as if nobody’s paying attention. And so I did, I think, understand that if I could at least let them know that I saw them and I heard them, maybe they’d feel a little bit less lonely in those struggles.“Certainly what I learned during the presidency was that the office of the president itself carries enormous weight,” Obama went on. “And, sadly, probably where I learned that best was in moments of tragedy where you’d visit with grieving families. Sometimes they were in places where – I think it’s fair to say – I didn’t get a whole lot of votes. You know, after a tornado or a flood or a shooting. And what was clear was that my presence there signified to those families that they were important. Their loved ones were important. The grief they were feeling was important. That it had been seen and acknowledged.”“That notion of being heard,” I said. “It seemed to be embedded throughout all of this.”“I still believe it,” he said. “I think this whole letter-writing process and its importance reflected a more fundamental vision of what we were trying to do in the campaign and what I was trying to do with the presi­dency and my political philosophy. The foun­dational theory, it probably connects to my early days organising. Just going around and listening to people. Asking them about their lives, and what was import­ant to them. And how did they come to believe what they believe? And what are they trying to pass on to their children?”He looked straight ahead, at a spot somewhere near his feet propped up on the coffee table.“I learned in that process that if you listen hard enough, everybody’s got a sacred story,” he said. “An organising story, of who they are and what their place in the world is. And they’re willing to share it with you if they feel as if you actually care about it. And that ends up being the glue around which relation­ships are formed, and trust is formed, and commu­nities are formed. And ultimately – my theory was, at least – that’s the glue around which democracies work.”“Listening,” I said.“Yeah,” he said. “I don’t want to suggest that I would have necessarily described it in a sort of a straight line from when I started running. But I do think that that was pretty embedded in our campaign philosophy. I think that’s how we won Iowa, by having a bunch of young kids form those relationships because they were listening to people. It wasn’t us selling a policy mani­festo, and it wasn’t even because we were selling me. It was because some young person in a town they’d never been to went around and talked to people, and listened to them, and saw them. And created the kinds of bonds that made people want to then try to work together.”He was talking about Reeves and all the people like her who knocked on doors.“It’s the power of empathy not as an end-all, be-all,” he said. “Because even after you’ve listened to some­body or seen them, they still have a concrete problem. They’ve lost their house. They’ve lost their job. They disagree with you on abortion. They think that you’re pulling troops out of Afghanistan too soon and, you know, potentially betraying the sacrifices that have been made by the fallen. There are all these concrete issues that are real. And there are real conflicts and real choices.“But what this form of story sharing and empathy and listening does is it creates the conditions around which we can then have a meaningful conversation and sort through our differences and our challenges, and arrive at better decisions because we’ve been able to hear everybody. Everybody feels heard so that even if a decision’s made that they don’t completely agree with, then at least they feel like: ‘OK, I was part of this. This wasn’t just dumped on me.’“It goes both ways, right?” Obama said. “I want to emphasise the degree to which this was important and useful to me doing my job.“There was a sizable percentage of the letters where, if they were critical, I’d read them and say: ‘Well, that’s not fair. I don’t think that’s true. They obviously don’t know this.’ But there were times where somebody would write a letter, and I’d say: ‘I can see their point.’ And I’d circle it, and I’d write it on the margins: ‘Is this true?’ or ‘Can you explain why this is?’ or ‘Why don’t we fix this?’”The last time we had talked he was still in the White House and we’d discussed some of the mail he got in the wake of the 2016 election. “There was a lot of anxiety and sadness I had to respond to,” he said then. “I remember one that said: ‘Pack up your bags because, thank goodness, we’re about to undo everything you’ve done it couldn’t have come a moment too soon,’ some­thing along those lines. I don’t think I responded to that one ... ”I had asked him how he might advise President-elect Trump on what to do with the mail.He had laughed. I think it was more out of awk­war­d­ness than because of any sort of image the question may have conjured.“But, um, it, ah,” he said about the idea of Trump reading the mail. “You know what, this is a great habit. I think it worked for me because it wasn’t something I did for anyone else. I did it because, as you said, it sustained me. So maybe it will sustain others in the future. OK?”OK. But I never used the word “sustained”. I remember wondering how that word had popped up.“I can tick off the bills and the policies and the accomplishments. But I tell you one of the things I’m proud of about having been in this office is that I don’t feel like I’ve ... lost myself.” Like everything else, that thought came out slowly. “I feel as if – even if my skin is thicker from, you know, public criticism, and I’m wiser about the workings of government, I haven’t become ... cynical, and I haven’t become callous, and I would like to think that these letters have something to do with that.”The letters as sustenance came up again during our second meeting. “I will say, selfishly, that the number of people who would write letters acknow­ledging the meaningful difference that a policy had made in their lives – making it real as opposed to abstract – was sustaining.We talked about another letter writer, Marjorie, who wrote about trying to expel the racism she believed was lodged like poison in her heart. She had discovered it and wanted to get rid of it.“She was writing to tell you that she was listening to you.”“She went for it. She wanted to tell you that.”“It makes me proud,” he said. “My grandmother, who loved me more than anyone, had an initial reaction like Marg to young black men approaching.”Obama had told the story about his grandmother back in the earliest days of the presidential cam­paign, in a speech during the 2008 primaries against Hillary Clinton. He had been criticised for his can­dour about a topic as sensitive as unconscious bias. In a radio inter­view later, he tried to explain what he had meant, which only made it more contro­versial. “The point I was making,” he said to the host, “was not that Grand­mother harbours any racial animo­s­ity. She doesn’t. But she is a typical white person, who, if she sees somebody on the street that she doesn’t know, you know, there’s a reac­tion that’s been bred in our experi­ences that doesn’t go away and that sometimes comes out in the wrong way, and that’s just the nature of race in our society.”“Typical white person.” You’re not supposed to say stuff like that, especially not as the first black candi­date ever to run for the office as a major party’s candidate. The Clinton campaign pounced. Obama was clearly new at this game.Now all that listening he’d been talking about – eight years of it – was just history. All those letters he’d rece­ived during his presidency had been shipped off to the National Archives. They’ll live on, artefacts for a mus­eum exhibit someday. Here are the voices of America, from 2009 to 2017. But the letters offer more. They remind you that government can work and that people committed to public service really do exist. We had this, which means we can have it again.“And, you know, right now,” Obama said, “a lot of people who have worked with me in the past or supported me or voted for me, you know, can get discouraged by the news day to day. And that’s understandable. I always have to be careful in not sounding as if I am Pollyannaish about the future.”The future. America was not, as of late, ageing gracefully. Did he feel responsible?“A better future is earned,” he said. “It’s hard work. And democracy in a country this big, with such a erse population, is especially hard. And compli­cated. And there are times in our history where we’ve had bad, ugly stretches. And so it’s important not to ever forget and to recognise that the ideals and the best version of America isn’t preordained.“But I do think that when you hear someone like Marjorie, at her age, just take a leap of faith like that, then you can’t help but feel as if it is worth the effort.“If we duplicate enough of those moments, enough of those interactions, enough of those shared stories, over time we get better at this thing called democracy. And that is something that all of us have the capacity to do. That’s not the job of the president. That’s not the job of a bunch of professional policy makers. It’s the job of citizens.”• This is an edited extract from To Obama: With Love, Joy, Hate and Despair by Jeanne Marie Laskas, published by Bloomsbury on 18 September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d35d766311b162b7f10fa6bb726aba9d4e07b1fa/0_0_3500_2264/master/3500.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=71e4c2d9030076296337962fbcf5a4b9 1400w","title":"noel edmonds reality tv democracy truth lie","story":"In 1991 the French sociologist Jean Baudrillard argued that the Gulf war did not take place. Now,\u0026nbspin 2018, Noel Edmonds is arguing something similar. The TV presenter takes part in Eight Go Rallying: The Road to Saigon, featuring teams of celebrities racing across 2,500 miles through Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam. But the looming BBC2 reality show is,\u0026nbspEdmonds claims, a deceptive fiction.Viewers, he suspects, will not see the grubby truth – that some of his fellow celebrities couldn’t drive so didn’t really race against each other, others travelled in air-conditioned minibuses and stayed in five-star hotels, and shooting ended with a wrap party in a brothel.Is it usual for a wrap party to take place in a brothel? I don’t know, though if it turns out I bankrolled it through the BBC licence fee, allow me to adopt a concerned expression.If Edmonds is right about Eight Go Rallying’s fictional basis (and the BBC has contested his claims) then it exemplifies how fakery is corrupting us. If we become habituated to accepting that what we see is on TV is not quite real, one possible corollary is that we become less critical of politicians who baldly lie. We risk becoming temperamentally incapable of resisting the deceit and manipulation that increasingly dominate political life.Baudrillard’s point, for which he was lambasted at the time, was that the first Gulf war we saw unfold on our TV screens was a sanitised simulacrum of the real thing. What we watched was more akin to a video game in which, apparently, no one got hurt. Embedded journalists, missile video footage and the rest of the paraphernalia of the broadcast media were deployed, he suggested, to throw sand in our eyes and veil the real suffering of war. If the first casualty of war had long been the truth, never had it been so comprehensively airbrushed.What has happened since Baudrillard’s Gulf war intervention is that the simulacrum has replaced the real, the faked has replaced the truth, Orwellian Newspeak has some new terms. Reality, for instance, now means its opposite. Reality TV, from Big Brother to Love Island, presents us with unreal relationships unfolding in cunningly edited simulations of real time. The best video games depict a simulation of reality that makes the real thing seem pallid and uninteresting by comparison. There is an oxymoron called virtual reality. Baudrillard called this the perfect crime, since the murder of reality has been covered up with decoys like\u0026nbspvirtual reality and reality TV.Even David Attenborough is party to this crime, if crime it be. In 2011 a Frozen Planet programme, which he narrated, combined wild polar bear footage with film of cubs in an ice den taken in a Dutch zoo, a conjunction that only emerged after the show had been broadcast. Last year, he narrated Blue Planet 2, which included filming the re-creation of the burrow of a zebra mantis shrimp to enable close-up shots, while the fearsome-looking fangtooth fish, which has the largest teeth relative to its body size for any fish, was filmed in a special chamber aboard a ship. The executive producer James Honeyborne defended these constructed shots, arguing both that such “film craft techniques” were important to showing the truth of ocean life and that, in any case, “you can’t just break the spell”. That last remark is telling: as if, when we watch documentaries like Blue Planet\u0026nbsp2 and reality shows like Love Island, we now suspend our disbelief in the same way we’ve long done when watching drama, so used are we to the techniques of presenting us with simulated reality. No wonder so few viewers complained about the constructed reality in Attenborough’s nature documentaries: the pleasure of following a narrative is of greater value to us than knowing the truth about the shortcuts taken to make that narrative plausible. Similarly, if there is a grubby reality of manipulation and distortion behind Eight Go Rallying, we won’t care for such considerations to spoil our viewing pleasure. Or if we are bothered about such considerations, we’ll savour them if we watch the making-of documentary.But here’s my worry. In 1984, O’Brien tortured Winston Smith with rats to induce him to believe 2+25\u0026nbspin 2018, TV viewers willingly accept fakery uncoerced. In our casual acceptance of fakery in what we\u0026nbspwatch on television, our critical faculties become dulled. We get used to the unreal masquerading as the real, fiction trumping truth in terms of verisimilitude. We\u0026nbspget less skilled as a result at detecting political lies. TV’s savage parade of unreality conspires with other forces in our culture to make us politically illiterate and incapable of doing what we ought as democratic citizens,\u0026nbspnamely checking the powers that be.What are those other forces? Think social media. Among the 50 top performing fake news stories of 2016 on Facebook was not only the lie that President Obama had banned reciting the pledge of allegiance in US schools, but also the story headlined: “Pro-lifers declare: ejaculation is murder, every sperm cell is a life.” Stories like these get believed because the online world has an aura of verisimilitude (“The problem with the internet is that everything is true,” John Diamond once wrote) while spreading falsehoods, and because of the tendency of social media sites to trap participants in echo chambers where their views are reinforced rather than challenged.Or consider the Brexit campaign that told us the lie that Britain sent £350m in membership fees to the EU each week and if the UK left the EU that money could swell NHS coffers. Or consider Donald Trump, who once claimed that on 11 September 2001, he had witnessed Muslims cheering as the twin towers fell after the terror attacks. Though, in fact, he did not. Lies like these gain currency through the conviction with which they are told. They also gain power in an age where there is so much information that we’re tempted to distrust experts and seduced by deceptively simple lies rather than honestly complicated truths.In Trump’s autobiogaphy, The Art of the Deal, his ghostwriter, Tony Schwartz, came up with a superbly Orwellian term for such Trumpian falsehoods – “truthful\u0026nbsphyperbole”. “It’s a way of saying, ‘It’s a lie, but who cares’,” explained Schwartz. “Who cares” is right. It’s our disengagement from valuing the truth that Trump relies on for his success – as well as our inability to tell truth from truthful hyperbole. Sorry, I mean lies."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc6de17b6345878b0648c7616bc8ab9aba3280f2/0_348_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96d241b455bd864644e50f7b5f2f9918","title":"how to cope with disappointing a level results exams","story":"Pictures of elated teenagers jumping with joy and stories about high-achieving students gaining places at Oxbridge were all over the news last week. But not everyone has been celebrating A-level success and the publication of the results of new, tougher GCSEs on Thursday will undoubtedly see more pupils unhappy with their grades.For some of the 129,700 A-level students who last Thursday woke to find they did not have a place at university because they did not achieve the grades needed, the future may have looked bleak – or at least a bit cloudy. But you never know where you may find a silver lining. We asked five people with experience of exam disappointment for their strategies and coping mechanisms.“At school you have such myopic focus, and you have to specialise so early,” says Fred Weller, 22. “I hadn’t thought about an alternative plan if I didn’t achieve the A-level grades I needed to study medicine.“Comparing myself to my peers only made it worse. I felt so alone that day. I remember apologising to my mum for letting her down, and her turning round and telling me I was being an idiot. But in my mind, I was an abject failure.”His mother Sarah, 55, says: “I remember Fred was gutted about his results but, personally, I wasn’t disappointed. My priority has always been his happiness. He had decided at 14 he wanted to study medicine, which is very young. At the back of my mind, I had always been concerned he was veering away from his natural interest in the humanities. In my opinion, you should study something that makes your heart sing.”She encouraged him to look for another course through clearing. “When he saw a classics course he could apply for, I reminded him about how much, as a small boy, he had enjoyed learning about the Greek and Roman myths. We stressed that, if he gave it a go but hated it, he could come home at Christmas and we would come up with another plan together.”“That really helped,” says Fred. “I felt massively supported.” He got in and “never looked back,” Sarah says. After winning an award for his high marks in his BA, he is now studying for an MA in classics.“My experience taught me why hard work is necessary but also that I should do what I want to do, rather than what I think I should be\u0026nbspdoing,” Fred says. “Now I look back and am proud of how I handled the situation. My results drove me to succeed.”“I opened my A-level grades and they were even lower than I’d thought they would be,” says Steven Bartlett, 25, co-founder of the Social Chain Group, a social media marketing company. He received B, C and D, lower than had been predicted.“I was disappointed. I knew I wouldn’t be able to go to Newcastle University as I’d planned. But I just reminded myself I was going to be successful regardless. I knew I was good at influencing other people and I’d already started my own business. I said to myself: you’ve messed up your grades, now you better hope they don’t matter as much as everyone says they do. I suspected they were lying, that I didn’t need an A* to succeed in life – and I was right.”The global company Bartlett founded now turns over tens of millions of pounds a year and he is a multimillionaire. “I grew up very poor,” he says. “My mum can’t read or write. She left school in Africa at the age of seven. She was very upset when she heard about my grades and later, when I dropped out of the university I got into through clearing, she stopped speaking to me.“Both times, I tried to rationalise why she felt that way. I knew it wasn’t because I was a failure or had hurt anyone. It was because she had a very narrow view of what success was. In her opinion, as long as I succeeded in education I would be OK. She loves me and was trying to protect me.” It all comes down to perspective. I think the only real danger of getting a bad grade is letting a bad grade get to you.”“Students should look at these results as just a stepping stone,” says Primrose Kitten, 35, a London secondary school teacher and vlogger who creates GCSE and A-level revision videos. “If you’ve got the results you need to move on to university, college or a job you want, in the end, your grades won’t matter. If you didn’t get what you need, you still have lots of other options. Maybe you’ll find something even better to study or do.“Try to put your current circumstances into perspective. Your results might feel like a big deal right now, but they are just letters and numbers. They are not representative of your character or worth. Don’t fall into the trap of comparing yourself to others who may have different resources. Your results do not dictate how successful you are going to be in the future.“From now on, you get to make your own choices about what you are going to do with the rest of your life. Whatever you do, don’t allow your grades to limit you. Take what you’ve got and do what you want. There are so many fantastic and exciting things out there waiting for you. The world is your oyster.”“Exam results can be a devastating, traumatic experience,” says psychologist Stephen Joseph, 54, author of Authentic: How to be Yourself and Why it Matters. “Your sense of yourself and your place in the world may come crashing down. But remember the education system has a very narrow interpretation of what skills matter. You may have skills and abilities, all yet to flourish, which have been untapped by examiners.“If you know yourself well enough, you may already be aware of the tension between you and the education system. You may have studied subjects which wouldn’t really have been your first choice and be on a path in life which isn’t really your own, when you hit a crunch point like exam results day. It’s actually an opportunity to redirect your life and follow your passions – but that can be very hard, because until that point, your life hasn’t been your own.“To own yourself, you must be able to stand your ground, to say: this is me, this is what I want, this is the direction I want to go in, and resist the pressures of other people. It won’t happen overnight. People will need to give you freedom to find your own path and strengths.“Let your goals be your own – the things you really want to pursue in life. Find out what is meaningful to you and which activities put you in a state of flow, where time just slips by. That should give you a clue about what you should be doing in your life.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64f11a824d27657d1ecd2b3631c65f8de539cbe3/0_273_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae55d928d6b29da86d1568dd856c97e9","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"An anaesthetised polar bear, a surprising pine marten and a potty-mouthed parrot are among this week’s images "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff54d0adaa39d0bcce773ffe74befe3cf8f9cd5a/652_277_4972_2984/master/4972.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4de61614e383333a47b4fc73e92d19d","title":"kingdom of the sapeurs inside congo fashion week","story":"The Democratic Republic of the Congo’s misfortunes have often eclipsed its good news, with ongoing armed conflicts and most recently an Ebola outbreak.

And a lot has changed since 2015.The BlacKkKlansman draft that Lee was given, by screenwriters David Rabinowitz and Charlie Wachtel, was a more straightforward adaptation of Stallworth’s book. Lee’s film has fun with 1970s nostalgia and still tells Stallworth’s story but, thematically, it has startling contemporary currency. “Spike didn’t want it to be a period piece,” says Kevin Willmott, who co-authored the rewrite with Lee. “He wanted it to really resonate with what was happening today. Philosophically, he believes that period pieces give people a pass that permits them to look away. Trump had just come into office and had said all the racist things he had said in the campaign, so that was very much on our minds.” BlacKkKlansman draws direct lines from David Duke to Trump, certainly when Duke’s acolytes chant “America First!”, the isolationist KKK slogan Duke regularly deployed.“This felt like the first film grown out of the soil of the Trump administration,” says Grace. “You could feel it when you were reading it. It was woven into its DNA.”Do the Right Thing (1989), a funny yet blistering drama set in a heatwave, was a microcosm of racial tension, culminating in the ghetto blaster-wielding Radio Raheem being choked to death by a truncheon-happy white cop, and a subsequent riot that leaves Italian-American Sal’s pizzeria burned to the ground. Lee was in part inspired by the 1986 incident involving black 23-year-old Michael Griffith, whose car broke down outside a pizzeria in Queens. Police were summoned to investigate “three suspicious black males” before Griffith and his friends were attacked by white youths with baseball bats, resulting in a severely beaten Griffith being hit and killed by a car. Other events also inspired the film, including the fatal choking by police of black graffiti artist Michael Stewart in 1983, but Lee drew from the broader climate in New York at the time: a racial polarisation that was “escalated,” he felt, by mayor Ed Koch.Lee has said he hopes BlacKkKlansman, which ends furiously with footage of Charlottesville and Trump’s comments, motivates viewers to register to vote. He had similar hopes for Do the Right Thing. In one of the latter’s scenes, “Dump Koch” is spray-painted on a wall, while Samuel L Jackson’s DJ ends the film telling listeners to “register to vote – the election is coming up”. Koch was up against the city’s potential first black mayor David Dinkins, and Lee hoped the film’s June 1989 release would play a part in encouraging the city to elect him.BlacKkKlansman is an example of how even when inheriting pre-existing work, Lee retools it to fit his own perspective, then further still to reflect current concerns. For 2002’s 25th Hour, adapted by David Benioff from his own novel, the drama about drug dealer Monty Brogan’s last stretch of freedom was written before 911, but Brooklyn-bred Lee, who lived in Manhattan at the time, reworked it to reflect the mood of a dramatically altered city. Filmed after the attacks, Ground Zero features throughout Lee makes Brogan’s father a firefighter who runs a bar adorned with tributes to dead colleagues and the characters feel upended.“Are you going to move?” Philip Seymour Hoffman’s Jacob asks Barry Pepper’s Frank.“Fuck that. Bin Laden can drop another one,” replies Frank.“That’s not really Frank talking,” Hoffman told Aftab. “That is 8 million New Yorkers saying: ‘We’re staying here.’”The same urgency fuels BlacKkKlansman. Promotion has been Trump-heavy, beginning with Lee’s seething six-minute opening monologue about Charlottesville at its Cannes premiere in May. Three decades ago, Lee was just as angry about the same person, and the same issues. On 19 April 1989, a few weeks before Do the Right Thing’s release, white 28-year-old investment banker Trisha Meili was raped in Central Park, leaving her in a coma for 12 days, the trauma erasing all memory of the attack. Five male teenagers were apprehended – four of them African-American, one Hiic – and on 1 May, in response, Trump (whose office overlooked the park) bought full-page ads in New York’s four major newspapers, railing against muggers and murderers and calling for the death penalty.As Lee told Film Comment at the time, the rape of a black woman in Central Park days after garnered no such coverage. “Didn’t see no outcry,” he said. “I didn’t see Donald Trump taking any fucking ads out behind that shit.” The media had “whipped white New York into a frenzy”, he said, “and Donald Trump wasn’t helping”. Despite DNA from the scene not matching the suspects, who said their confessions were obtained under coercion, in May 1990 they were convicted and jailed. Their lawyers said Trump’s ads had inflamed public opinion. In 2002, a convicted serial rapist told the police he was solely responsible, and DNA confirmed it the Central Park Five sued the city for emotional distress, winning $41m. Still, Trump refused to apologise, insisting the men were guilty, a claim he repeated while campaigning in 2016, saying their convictions should not have been overturned. John McCain called his comments “outrageous”.“It comes from what Spike believes in, what he cares about,” says Willmott of these bookend parallels. “That’s the guiding force in all of this. When he was doing Do the Right Thing there was a certain kind of racial, political reality going on. With BlacKkKlansman there’s a different reality, but the same issues. You’re still fighting that same fight.” Charlottesville, he says, was “unfortunately, like a confirmation” of what their script was already warning of. As soon as he saw events there unfold, Lee wanted the footage to end the film.“It’s a case where Spike Lee is going back to the incident in question and recasting it,” says Mask, “replaying it from a black community’s perspective, because our narratives are so rarely given exposure in the mainstream news.”Lee presents genuine documentation elsewhere in BlacKkKlansman: a chilling sequence features Harry Belafonte detailing the real-life case of the 1916 mutilation, burning and lynching of mentally impaired black farmhand Jesse Washington, convicted of raping and murdering a white woman in Waco, Texas. It is Lee’s most powerful scene in years, made even more so by Belafonte and others displaying actual photographs of the aftermath. It echoes the climax of 2015’s gun-violence drama Chi-Raq, also written by Willmott and Lee, in which real members of Chicago’s parent advocacy group Purpose Over Pain hold up photos of their dead children, victims of gang warfare.The Charlottesville footage is a horrific kicker at the end of BlacKkKlansman, the fourth wall destroyed, the story given context. Lee has never dilly-dallied with his messages. There is little subtext, and less subtlety, especially when he is fired up. “Yeah, we don’t try to be that subtle!” he laughed when an interviewer questioned his films’ directness in 2015. “Why pussyfoot around? Let’s get to the point!” But Jordan Peele’s instinct was right: it’s hard to think of anyone else who would be as brazenly head-on with this material.BlacKkKlansman ends, as so many of Lee’s films do, with a howl. Sometimes they are figurative sometimes literal, like Wesley Snipes’s scream, cradling a crack-ravaged prostitute at the end of Jungle Fever, or Jennifer Hudson’s collapse, confronted with her child’s killer, at the end of Chi-Raq. Almost his entire body of work is a howl. Today, it is louder than ever.BlacKkKlansman is out on 24 August This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

But my favourite tape was The 65th Anniversary Of The Academy Awards: Oscars Greatest Hits! I was not so much obsessed with this video as possessed by it, and to this day my go-to karaoke song is Billy Crystal’s opening number from the 1991 Oscars: “Ghost! Can it win this lottery? Ghost! Made me take up pottery.” Do you want to know when Cher took Val Kilmer to the Oscars as her date? How pissed off Barbra Streisand looked in 1992, not to be up for best director for The Prince Of Tides? Then you, my friend, have come to the right columnist.I still love the Oscars, in all their ludicrous, self-regarding glory. But in recent years they have somehow become elevated from that show where Rob Lowe once sang a duet with Snow White to being a statement about Where America Is Now. On the left, the Oscars have been hammered for being so old, white and male on the right, they have been criticised for becoming too worthy. An awards ceremony turning itself into a culture war is a makeover to rival Julia Roberts swapping thigh-high boots for twin sets in Pretty Woman (a performance which itself was nominated for an Oscar as I said, I know all the important stuff).Last week it looked like the Oscars had capitulated to the right, by announcing there will be a new category called outstanding achievement in popular film, AKA the We Know You Care More About Black Panther Than Whatever Won Best Picture Last Year award (it was The Shape Of Water, a title you will have forgotten again by the end of this sentence). This category will presumably favour movies that have made over $100m, and celebrities – heretofore not known for an aversion to money – were uniformly horrified. “The film business passed away today with the announcement of the ‘popular’ film Oscar,” Rob Lowe tweeted, having apparently forgotten he – and I might have mentioned this before – literally sang with Snow White at the 1989 Oscars. Film critics were even more disgusted, with one arguing that the Oscars are about “staying alive to excellence”.Um, are they? Because ever since Harvey Weinstein bullied the Academy in the 1990s into refashioning the awards criteria to fit his then company Miramax’s image, the Oscars have been about celebrating the indie-ish, the artsy-ish and the thuddingly middlebrow – and for every Moonlight, there are about 17 The King’s Speeches. Action movies never get nominated any more, and nor do comedies instead we have near self-parodic Oscars Movies – Dramatic Films full of Actors doing Serious Acting. Meanwhile, many of the most enduring films of the past few decades remain ungarlanded by what is allegedly the most significant film award in the world. Take the 1986 Oscars, where the big winners were Out Of Africa, Kiss Of The Spider Woman, Prizzi’s Honor. All solid movies, no question, none of which you’ve seen since 1986. And what little film was fobbed off with best sound effects editing? Back To The Future. Now, I’m not saying Out Of Africa shouldn’t have won. But I am saying Back To The Future should definitely have also won. And so should The Dark Knight, Batman, Alien, Dirty Dancing, Bridesmaids and Terminator 2, none of which even got a best film nomination.Judging from the anger over the new category, you’d think the Oscars had ruled that only films earning more than $100m qualify for best film. In fact, the popular Oscar will ensure that more smaller films qualify for an Oscar, as the bigger ones get siphoned off to their own new category. Some have argued that popular is a phoney award, and this year, a way of fobbing off Black Panther. Only film obsessives know (and care) that Toy Story 3 won for best animated film (a then relatively new category), and not best film. To everyone else, it’s a big Oscar winner. This anger is not really about the Oscars, but an anxiety about how the movie business is changing. Studios no longer really make adult dramas like Out Of Africa, but instead rely on big-budget franchise movies. These have become, largely, junk, relying on CGI instead of quality scripts and direction. But that is also changing: Black Panther would clearly be a worthy winner, as Wonder Woman would have been – and with the new category these mega movies won’t hog the awards away from smaller films, as Titanic did in 1997.The idea that the Oscars were ever about pure cinematic excellence could only be entertained by someone never blessed with an Oscars Greatest Hits! video. They are about the TV ratings, and if no one watches the show, then no one will get an award – not Black Panther, nor any future Moonlights. Whether making the Oscars more inclusive or more populist will stop the show’s plummeting ratings remains to be seen. Honestly, some of us would be happy just to hear another “pottery”“lottery” rhyming couplet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12e4936da779df23f4311a0526191686e88b75b8/0_1663_4912_2947/master/4912.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ff34d00b31c27500f1a7a01b474f1b9","title":"chicken is where its at the unstoppable rise of kfc","story":"KFC has survived health scandals, veganism and a major delivery fail: can the fast food behemoth stay on top?Before Donald Trump entered the White House, there was probably no other American businessman as instantly recognisable as “Colonel” Harland Sanders. True, Henry Ford and John D Rockefeller made far larger fortunes, but most people couldn’t pick them out of a line up. Sanders, the founder of Kentucky Fried Chicken, however, enjoys a strange celebrity, even 40 years after his death. His face, with the distinctive goatee and browline glasses, is plastered across 22,000 KFC outlets around the world – including a branch called Sanders Cafe, a diner on Highway 25, just outside Corbin, Kentucky. It doesn’t look much, and is situated next to a rundown tanning salon (“new bulbs, new owner”) but for some this is a place of pilgrimage. In 1932, it became the Colonel’s first restaurant and remains open to this day.At lunchtime, customers are queueing to place their orders and eat in the original chestnut-panelled dining room. On the way to the restrooms, a few display cabinets feature one of Sanders’ trademark white suits and string ties, alongside old menus and memorabilia. At one table, Leslie Shriner, 52, a fifth-grade teacher from Florida, sits with Jeff Metcalf, 52, who grew up and lives in Corbin. “He’s taken me here on a date. I think he’s trying to impress me,” she laughs. She’s only half joking. She and Jeff have been going out for six months she’s paying him a visit and he wants to show her the sights. She hasn’t eaten a KFC meal since she was in high school. “I usually try to eat clean meats and organic vegetables and healthy food.” But he insisted they lunch at Kentucky’s most famous restaurant.Jeff explains: “For someone who grew up in Corbin, it’s a source of pride that KFC is now all over the world.” He travels quite a bit for work. “Wherever I go, even in China, when they find out I am from Kentucky they always ask if I knew Colonel Sanders. That is the first association they make.”The unofficial curator of the Sanders Cafe is Steve Dearing, 69, who has spent most of his career at KFC, having joined in 1969 to work alongside the Colonel, helping design the restaurants. “I have given tours to two groups from Japan, and I am not being facetious, it is almost a religious experience for them,” he tells me in his light Kentucky drawl. “They smell the walls. It is a truly deep emotional experience.”How did covering some chicken meat in seasoned flour and milk and then deep frying it become so popular? And can this boom survive not just huge competition in the dining-out market, but the increasing number of vegans and meat-eaters who want to adopt a more healthy diet? How long can a KFC Mighty Bucket For One meal, packing a gut-busting 1,275 calories, survive when politicians, particularly in the UK, talk about restricting fried-chicken shops in a bid to halt an obesity epidemic?In the UK, it’s possible that you might have missed the fried-chicken craze. But something strange happened in February this year, when KFC was involved in what appeared to be one of the biggest corporate cock-ups of all time: it ran out of chicken. In a bid to cut costs, the company had changed distributors to DHL, the German logistics company, and moved from three distribution centres to one. A mixture of the software not being tested properly, a failure to hire and train enough staff, and a crash on the M6, meant the new warehouse was unable to supply restaurants with fresh chicken. At one point, 646 of the UK’s 900 KFCs were forced to close for days on end.But while this was terrible for the company’s short-term sales, it revealed an unlikely wave of affection for the chain, and for fried chicken in general. Helped by a swift and irreverent mea culpa from the company (the adverts were headlined “FCK – we’re sorry”), people flooded social media to joke that KFC running out of chicken was worse than Trump or an early warning of the apocalypse. In London, the politan police issued a statement imploring people not to contact the emergency services.It’s also in London, chiefly, that chicken has gained a hip, urban following, as evidenced by YouTube’s Chicken Connoisseur, Elijah Quashie, whose shakily recorded reviews of takeaway outlets frequently gain more than 2m views (Quashie now has his own Channel 4 show, Peng Life). Meanwhile, a number of higher-end diners such as Chick ’n’ Sours and Shake Shack sell fried chicken to a mostly young crowd, alongside music and cocktails. “In the last few years, chicken – unless you are a vegan or a veggie – has become the go-to food for millennials,” says Paul Hemings, who with his wife opened Bird, a small chain of fried-chicken restaurants in London, four years ago. “Chicken is having a moment, not just in the US and the UK but around the world. Chicken is where it’s at.”And yet KFC has ridden this wave, opening new stores at the rate of one every seven hours. In the last two years, the chain has launched in Macedonia, Uzbekistan, Albania, Guyana, taking the number of KFC countries up to 131 – more than McDonald’s.To understand the rise of fried chicken, you must first understand the rise of chicken itself, an ascent that has been dramatic since 1948. This was when the final of the Chicken of Tomorrow contest was organised by the US Department of Agriculture, in an attempt to breed a bird that could – on an ounce-per-dollar basis – compete with pork and beef.Previously, chickens had been farmed primarily to lay eggs. Most people thought chicken meat neither tasty nor good value. The Chicken of Tomorrow contest encouraged farmers to cross breeds in an attempt to create, in the breathless words of one newspaper report at the time, “breast meat so thick you can carve it into steaks”. Breeds that had a propensity to overeat and thus grow quickly were favoured. The contest had a profound effect on the poultry industry – creating a bigger, cheaper, more profitable bird with larger breasts, and one that could be slaughtered after six weeks rather than 12. Nearly all birds we eat today, whether in America or Europe, are descendants of the winning Cornish-New Hampshire crossbreed.People fell in love with the taste of chicken. As the price of chicken tumbled compared with beef and pork, it became ever more popular, helped by the fact it is acceptable to many major religions.Britain, for instance, slaughtered a mere 1 million chickens in 1950. By 1965, this number had leapt to 150 million birds. The official figures for last year show we slaughtered more than 1 billion. In 2016, global production of poultry meat hit 119m tonnes, overtaking pork for the first time, according to the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation. Chicken is now the world’s No 1 meat.Harland Sanders’ cafe played a crucial role in all this. It sold various items, including ham, biscuits (a Kentucky speciality, similar to a savoury scone) and fried chicken. He, of course, did not invent the dish it had been a staple of southern cooking, especially for African Americans, for decades.But his was different, thanks to a “secret” blend of 11 herbs and spices and his method of cooking. “The Colonel perfected his recipe with the pressure cooker,” explains his former colleague Dearing, pointing to a bulky old appliance at the Sanders Cafe. “The pressure fryer not only makes it cook quicker, it pushes the moisture and flavour into the meat.”Fried chicken can only become fast food once it is fast. Where it once took 30 minutes to cook, Sanders’ pressure cooker reduced that time to nine minutes. But, in 1954, they built Interstate 75, which bypassed Corbin. Business dried up overnight.So at the age of 64, Sanders took to the road, with a pressure cooker and a bag of seasoning. He visited restaurants and demonstrated his recipe, asking them to put it on their menus, in return for four cents for every chicken they sold cooked his way. It was the start of a nationwide franchise that allowed him to sell up in 1964 for $2m (£1.5m), staying on as a $75,000-a-year ambassador until he died in 1980. It became a suitably rousing American Dream story for the marketing men to exploit.Now Sanders is being resurrected by a new generation of executives. Fried chicken may be thriving nearly everywhere on the planet, but in America, its birthplace, KFC has had a serious wobble as slicker rivals do a better job at winning over fickle millennials.KFC’s global headquarters is in Dallas, Texas, a modern glass-and-brick building on a business park with its own staff basketball court and test kitchens. Here I meet Roger Eaton, the chief executive. A 6ft 3in South African, dressed in jeans, he has a swaggering bonhomieand is keen on high-fiving and talking about football.One of his tactics in reviving KFC’s flagging fortunes in the US has been advertising – hiring a number of high-profile comedians and actors, including Rob Lowe, George Hamilton and Billy Zane, to dress up as Harland Sanders. “The adverts in the US are very distinct,” Eaton says. “The minute you see the Colonel on the television you say” – he snaps his fingers – “‘That’s a KFC advert.’ That’s the challenge: getting that distinctiveness when young people have an attention  of a goldfish, eight or nine seconds.”His innovation team has used social media astutely, launching a number of hyperbolic products that hit the menu for just a few weeks in order to generate a frenzy of Instagram posts and retweets. There’s been the chizza, developed by KFC in the Philippines – a pineapple and ham pizza where instead of a dough base, there is a piece of deep-fried chicken. In France, KFC is launching a croque monsieur, with slabs of deep-fried chicken replacing the slices of white toast.For now, this tactic is working: sales in the US have recovered and the UK, after the DHL fiasco, is back on track. But long-term, KFC needs to address a slow but inescapable shift in eating habits. Young people are becoming more interested in their food and the impact their consumption is having on the planet. In the UK, the number of vegans has tripled in the last 10 years, to 540,000 – or many more. Experts believe this figure (from the Vegan Society) underestimates the number of people who may not be fully vegan, but are “flexitarians”, actively seeking to cut back on meat for health, environmental or ethical reasons. The ethics of eating barn-reared chickens, who rarely if ever see daylight and are slaughtered after 32 to 45 days, is very much up for debate.KFC was described by the author Jonathan Safran Foer in his book Eating Animals as “arguably the company that has increased the sum total of suffering in the world more than any other in history”. He pointed out that, in 2004, workers at one of the company’s main suppliers were filmed jumping up and down on live chickens and kicking them like footballs. KFC vowed at the time to deal only with suppliers that promised a commitment to animal welfare.Eaton, who has been chief executive since 2015, insists KFC has had a good record in recent years. “I cannot tell you how seriously we take animal welfare. I take it personally. I visited numerous chicken plants in my life and I am very comfortable about what we do.” It’s true that the company has been free of the animal-cruelty scandals that dogged it a decade ago. And in the UK, all KFC chicken is Red Tractor, an assurance scheme that guarantees the chickens are British-farmed and stocked slightly less densely than EU minimum standards. Under EU legislation, broiler chickens (those grown for meat) can be kept in sheds with up to about 21 adult birds per square metre Red Tractor’s scheme allows up to about 19 birds – though a requirement for its sheds to have windows is only being introduced from 2020. Last month, Red Tractor came under fire after it emerged that just one in 1,000 farm inspections were made unannounced (the percentage should be much higher).But even if its customers are comfortable with KFC’s animal welfare standards, its health credentials are hardly golden. Chicken is lower in fat and higher in protein than beef, but the moment you deep fry it, you are transforming it into something pretty calorific. A three-piece original recipe meal, not the largest thing on the menu, contains 1,035 calories, way more than a Big Mac meal at McDonald’s (845 calories).Eaton is aware how KFC, along with other fried-chicken outlets, has become the whipping boy in the public obesity debate – certainly in the UK. When he was campaigning for the mayoralty, Sadiq Khan said that, “London has too many chicken shops”, lumping them together with pawnbrokers as a blight on the capital’s high streets.Since Khan came into office, he has put his London Plan out to consultation, which includes a proposal to ban hot food takeaways from opening within 400 metres of a school. One council has already acted, with Redbridge in east London implementing the ban earlier this year.Regulators also appear more willing to act against fast food companies that target children. Earlier this month, the Advertising Standards Authority ruled KFC had broken guidelines by placing a billboard for a KFC Mars Krushems drink too close to a primary school. KFC said it was an error and took the advert down the moment it was alerted.Eaton takes the line, one that fast-food executives have adopted for some time, that they are not really the problem. “We could go into a KFC store and we could comfortably have a meal for anywhere between 500 and 800 calories. If you apply common sense, KFC fits incredibly comfortably into a balanced diet. Hey, I’m living it.” That’s all right for him to say. He’s a tall man, and at 90kg (14st 3lb) would be classed as healthy on the Body Mass Index scale. But when pushed, he acknowledges that – even if most customers eat a KFC only once a month – the company needs to do a better job of engaging in the obesity debate. After talking to Eaton, I visit a branch of KFC’s main rival in the US, Chick-fil-A. It has half the number of US restaurants as KFC (about 2,200 US branches) but is growing far faster. In a downtown Dallas branch I meet Nikki Webb, 50, an office clerk, who says, “I would chose Chick-fil-A over Kentucky Fried. I prefer the taste – it’s more natural.” Chick-fil-A, as well as frying, grills a lot of its chicken. “Years ago, yeah, I had fried chicken the whole time. But I do worry about how unhealthy it is,” Webb says. “The health movement in the US is so big now. I think fast food is one of the worst things you can do to harm your body. So, I try to stay away from it.” She has ordered a yoghurt.Sarah Jacob, 39, who works in finance, echoes her views. “Where will fried chicken be in 10 years’ time? I think all these chains will be making adjustments, just as Chick-fil-A has. It has a kale salad on its menu, which is so good.” There is no kale on a KFC menu. In fact, in the US restaurants, it is hard to find any greenery apart from some cabbage in the coleslaw.Still, each country is allowed to develop its own dishes, so long as they don’t mess with the 11 herbs and spices. Jack Hinchliffe, 35, is the head of innovation for KFC in the UK, in charge of coming up with new menu items, from its British HQ in Woking, Surrey. He’s been with KFC for three years and has been closely watching the rise of healthy eating and veganism. “The data suggests this is more than a passing fad. Young customers are more engaged than they’ve ever been about the provenance of their food, the story of their food. Meat-free, flexitarian lifestyles will continue to grow. That’s something we’re aware of and seek to respond to.”To this end, Hinchliffe developed the rice box for KFC in the UK: a carton of Tex-Mex steamed rice, a green salad and tomatoes, with slices of fried chicken on top. “We developed the rice box to have a great, permissible way to enjoy KFC. It’s 500 calories. It’s a much lighter, healthier product. It is hitting a critical calorie count.” Using grilled chicken would seem the obvious way to cut calories, as Chick-fil-A has done, but Hinchliffe does not think this is the answer. “Our fans and guests don’t want a grilled product or an oven-baked product. We have tried those. They come to KFC for our fried chicken.” And fried chicken is what KFC will give them, even if it is alongside a salad rather than a portion of fries.It will become an increasingly difficult circle to square. KFC needs to offer healthier dishes, to keep abreast of social change, and keep politicians off its back. But any success and social media hype it enjoys tends to stem from the fact fried chicken remains, at its heart, comfort food: greasy, crispy, salty and, for many customers, very tasty.Back in Corbin, I ask Leslie Shriner how her meal was – her first KFC since she was a teenager. “You know what? It tastes good. Just how I remember. It’s juicy, tender and crunchy.” Even though she would usually order an organic salad for lunch? “Hey, there’s a nostalgia thing going on, for sure. There’s comfort. It’s like eating Mom’s cake.”Her new partner, Jeff, pipes up: “Will you come and eat fried chicken again with me?”“It’s the most famous recipe in the world,” says KFC chief executive Roger Eaton. Developed by Harland Sanders in the 1930s and 40s, the spice blend is still used, and a big part of the company’s marketing. KFC uses two separate flavour suppliers, with one mixing up half the blend before shipping it to the second, to reduce the risk of the exact 11 being leaked. It arrives in all restaurants pre-mixed, and is then added to flour, dried egg and milk powder to coat chicken before cooking.Eaton, mostly very chatty, says: “I won’t answer any questions about the secret recipe.

The midfielder remains out on his own in terms of quality and creativity, rivalled only by the slightly more fitful Eden Hazard at Chelsea. Yet what looked like a shoo-in for player of the season was derailed by Mo Salah’s insanely compelling contribution to Liverpool’s run to the Champions League final Belgium lived to regret the win over England in the World Cup that set them on a course to meet France in the semis and now injury has sidelined the player for at least a couple of months at the start of a new campaign.It is a measure of De Bruyne’s importance to City’s expensively assembled squad that a two‑to‑three-month absence is being greeted as good news. Pep Guardiola and the City supporters would have been dismayed, equally, had they been told a week ago that De Bruyne might not start his season until October but, set against the possibility of missing the whole season with ligament damage, the prognosis seems almost worth\u0026nbspcelebrating.If anyone has the squad depth to cover for a key player for a few months it is City and, if any coach has the ability to think quickly on his feet and reorganise playing patterns, it is Guardiola. Yet for all that, there is a sense that fate has struck a blow where the champions are most vulnerable.No one ought to be irreplaceable, though De Bruyne at City comes close. While the other players work to make space on the pitch, he exploits it with the precision and timing of his passing, not to mention weighing in with a few goals from shots outside the penalty area and set pieces.City have other creative midfielders, of course, and the task of pulling the attacking strings will probably now fall to Ilkay Gündogan or David Silva. But, while both have some similarities of style, no one in the country is actually that similar to De Bruyne.Silva specialises in short passing and close control, trying and often succeeding to thread the eye of a needle. Gündogan’s game is more expansive but he lacks De Bruyne’s devastating accuracy, in terms of both passing and shooting.Time and again last season De Bruyne would whip in low crosses from the flanks that seemed laser‑guided, uncanny in their ability to elude the first defender – just – then spin back slightly to leave an inviting opportunity in the penalty area for Sergio Agüero or Gabriel Jesus. Not every player can do that, just as not every player can engage defenders by moving one way while awaiting the perfect opportunity to play a pass into space in the other direction for speedsters such as Raheem Sterling or Kyle Walker to run on to.While City cannot be accused of being a one-man team, in other words, they have developed a style whereby one player’s vision and sureness of touch showcases the various talents around him. This is why talk of City being even stronger this season than last – based on their opening results against Chelsea and Arsenal – has suddenly been replaced with something approaching relief among rival fans that a chink in their armour may have been exposed.City will quite clearly not be the same team without De Bruyne. They were not the same team without him at Arsenal last Sunday. Granted they were in the lead when Guardiola brought the Belgian on after an hour, though they were not in control of the game. Some of their play was ragged and sloppy and Arsenal were threatening an equaliser. While Guardiola may have preferred to let De Bruyne sit out the whole match, he knew when a calming influence was needed.Now Guardiola must work out, beginning with Sunday’s game against Huddersfield, whether to ask someone else to replicate De Bruyne’s role or abandon the idea until he is fit again and find instead a simpler way of playing that will prove effective in the meantime. At least Silva is approaching full fitness again, City have Phil Foden ready and waiting, and Riyad Mahrez no longer seems quite the luxury purchase he appeared a few weeks ago."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d05a3121742bc796cf987a14ea107c0c06e2ca4a/0_323_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=121aef6fb35505e8ef91cd2630c4eaa4","title":"manchester united alex greenwood casey stoney","story":"England’s Alex Greenwood left Liverpool and stepped down a ision to join Manchester United and manager Casey Stoney“I think originally – it sounds really bad – I was telling myself: ‘It’s not going to happen,’” says the England left-back Alex Greenwood on Casey Stoney’s first contact with her as the Manchester United manager.It did happen and, sitting in the dugout at the Leigh Sports Village in front of a pristine pitch, where Manchester United Women will play their home games, Greenwood looks relaxed in United training gear.Stoney was keen to make Greenwood a figurehead of her team after the full-back had decided to leave Liverpool. At the start of last season expectations on Merseyside were high but the team failed to mount a title challenge. “I couldn’t tell you why,” she says. “We were very inconsistent, we leaked one too many goals in the bigger games. I think we massively underachieved for the quality we had in that squad and we all knew that.”But with plenty of options for the dynamic full-back, dropping into the Women’s Championship with the relaunched United was not high on the wishlist until Stoney sat her down.“I had some fantastic options, Casey being one of them, and I came here thinking I probably wouldn’t sign,” the 24-year-old says. “But I sat down with Casey and my decision was made literally within 30 minutes. Everything else was irrelevant.”What did her former teammate say? “She just hit the nail on the head with everything. Casey knows me, on and off the pitch, and she knows how to get the best out of me. She made it quite clear that she will take me to another level. She’s delivered on everything she’s said up to now and it’s been unbelievable.”Greenwood is one of seven former Liverpool players recruited by Stoney, and they used to play together.“I had so much respect for Casey as a player and that doesn’t change as a manager. She’s someone I always looked up to. I always knew in games I’d play with her she’d improve me,” she says. “She’s just gone from standing on the right side of me to standing on the left side of me.“Casey hasn’t changed, Casey will always expect high standards whether she’s on the pitch with you or managing the team. She’s a fantastic role model.”Stoney has handed Greenwood the captaincy. “I’m ready,” says the left-back. “I think I’ve been through enough experiences to lead this team. It’s an honour.“Exciting”, “unbelievable” and “crazy” crop up in almost every sentence from every player involved in the project and Greenwood says that while pre-season is intense, bonding has come surprisingly naturally. She says: “I feel like I’ve known this team for years. We’ve worked hard at that, though, we’ve had to do a lot of stuff away from the pitch. I feel like Casey and the staff have picked a fantastic bunch of players and we’ve all knitted really well.”For a player who doesn’t switch off from football – the closest she comes to escaping the game is “maybe going for a coffee”, where “I’ll just end up talking football” – there is passion about the type of football the team wants to play.“I think it’s going to be exciting. We want to play the right way and do things properly, the Manchester United way, we’ll go out to win games and with the ball on the floor. We’ve got a talented bunch.”Up first is the Continental Cup (League Cup) and a tasty opener away to Liverpool on Sunday at 2pm. They kick off in the league on 9 September at Aston Villa."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0e0271d57ae9456dc90b056a259c91cc7e8ec94/0_301_5352_3211/master/5352.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=485c7a6439221cb639cf647d021d7a0e","title":"super cup reaction and celtics champions league exit football weekly extra","story":"Max Rushden and co on Atlético’s win over Madrid, European woe for Celtic and Bristol Rovers’ dubious half-time entertainmentRate, review, share on Apple Podcasts, Soundcloud, Audioboom, Mixcloud, Acast and Stitcher, and join the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

Cardiff get the party restarted. Newcastle have made a change: the hapless Manquillo, who had been given the runaround by Murphy, could easily have picked up a second yellow card for pulling his tormentor back, and was eventually clattered by the same man, makes way for Hayden.Half-time reading  Know Your Enemy dept. As Cardiff won promotion to the Premier League, Swansea were heading the other way. Here’s what the Swans were up to last night.Dummett heads the corner over his own bar. Manquillo trots back on. And the second Cardiff corner comes to nothing. The players make for the changing rooms at the end of a half that started well but fizzled out a little. It’s fiercely competitive, though here’s to a sharper second half!45 min +2: Manquillo is up, but limping off the pitch. Hopefully that’s just a sore one, and the interval has come at the right time for him. But first Newcastle have a corner to defend.45 min +1: Murphy slides in on Manquillo. That looked like a foul, but the referee’s giving nothing. Cardiff go upfield and win a corner on the right. But before that can be taken, Manquillo needs some treatment. He looks in some pain, clutching his left leg.45 min: Shelvey gets a dipping free kick on target, but it’s all too measured and careful, and an easy one for Etheridge to gather. The Cardiff fans holler accordingly.44 min: Kenedy drops a shoulder with a view to advancing down the inside-left channel. He’s cynically tripped by the outstretched leg of Bamba. A free kick, to the left of the D but a few yards back. Shelvey is behind it, his eyes lit up.42 min: Manquillo has been caught again with a good portion of Murphy’s shirt in his desperate mitt. He’s already been booked, so really is chancing his arm with that tug. But he gets away with it.40 min: And this is better from Newcastle! Shelvey, deep on the right, curls long for Perez, racing into the Cardiff box from the left. Perez sidefoots a shot goalwards, first time, but Etheridge is out quickly to narrow the angle and deny him. Lovely football all round.38 min: But this is better from Cardiff! Bennett chases after a fine right-to-left diagonal ball from Ralls. Near the corner flag, he loops a cross into the mixer. Zohore, six yards out, heads down but wide right. Newcastle were opened up by an incisive Cardiff move there.37 min: Ralls sends a gentle long ball into the Newcastle box. Morrison rises and heads weakly wide of the target. Both teams are beginning to lose their way.35 min: More space for Murphy down the left. Time to shape a cross into the area. But it curls into the arms of an unchallenged Dubravka.33 min: Kenedy has a wild kick at Camarasa’s standing leg as the pair tussle in the middle of the park. The referee sees nothing. But if he’d clocked that, Kenedy would be walking. The red mist inexplicably came down there.32 min: Manquillo slips a ball down the right for Kenedy, who twists, turns and earns a corner off Arter. Kenedy might have had the last touch, though. Controversy ahoy if anything comes of this. But nothing comes of this.30 min: Murphy tries the spectacular from the free kick out on the left. It’s spectacularly bad. Goal kick.29 min: Ritchie picks the ball up deep, and dribbles with extreme prejudice at the Cardiff back line. His attempt to release Kenedy through the middle with a sliderule pass nearly comes off ... but not quite. Murphy goes up the other end, down the left, and is dragged back by Manquillo, who goes in the book for his sauce. Free kick!27 min: Rafa is on the touchline, steam coming out of his lugs. It’s all over a disputed throw. Not a proportionate response, but he’s perhaps mainly irritated by Cardiff’s increasing dominance, and his team’s inability to get up the pitch.25 min: Zohore wins a header on the edge of the Newcastle box. The ball drops to Camarasa, whose shot is dragged wide left. It wouldn’t have counted anyway, as Zohore was penalised, somewhat harshly, because Lascelles jumped clean over him and landed on his back. Not sure Zohore - who is proving a real handful - did much wrong there. But the pressure on Newcastle is released.24 min: Ritchie bursts down the right and earns a corner off Bennett. Shelvey goes over to take, receiving a hot reception from the Cardiff faithful as he does so. His delivery is cleared by the first man, much to the amusement of the crowd.23 min: Camarasa, making his Cardiff debut on loan from Real Betis, sprays a simple pass into the stand. It takes time to get used to new surroundings.21 min: Cardiff are beginning to press Newcastle back. Arter is seeing a lot of the ball Zohore continues to cause the Newcastle defenders much stress and heartache. A good spell for the home team.19 min: Zohore makes an almighty nuisance of himself down the right. He combines with Arter, a couple of one-twos that have Newcastle backtracking in panic. Then Murphy springs him into the area with a clever pass rolled down the channel. Zohore’s bursting into the box, but upon reaching the byline can’t find Hoilett in the middle. That was a fine, flowing move, though.17 min: It’s gone a bit scrappy, after those early flourishes. The game’s settled.15 min: The first lull of the game, as Cardiff stroke the ball around awhile. They don’t go anywhere in particular, but a controlled period of possession is never to be sniffed at in this ision.13 min: Zohore is shoved to the floor by Lascelles, out on the Cardiff right. Yet another chance to cause Newcastle strife at a set piece. The box is loaded. Murphy curls the free kick in from deep Diame once again clears with a powerful header.11 min: Ritchie bustles down the inside-right channel, his hard work eventually releasing Perez into the area. Perez shoots from a tight angle. It’s a fierce low drive, but parried well by Etheridge. This is a lot of end-to-end fun.10 min: Diame concedes a needless corner down the right. It’s met by Bamba, six yards out. He heads down, but not particularly powerfully, allowing Perez to stick out a leg to block. Not sure Dubravka would have saved otherwise. Newcastle hack clear.8 min: Kenedy drops a shoulder and cuts in from the right. He slaps a shot goalwards, but it’s claimed easily enough by Etheridge. An open feel to this game, albeit a hectic one: players are snapping into tackles with great purpose.7 min: Dubravka takes his own sweet time to kick clear. He’s half charged down by Zohore. On another day, that’s pinging into the net. As it is, the ball deflects away to the Cardiff left, where Shelvey is forced to concede a free kick. Bennett takes it, and sends it straight down Dubravka’s throat.6 min: It’s a dreary day in Cardiff, drizzle in the air. That heatwave seems a long time ago now, doesn’t it.4 min: ... and he’s a little unlucky, because replays suggest it was Bennett who took his own man out, as three players came together for a loose ball. Happily, Hoilett is fine to continue.3 min: Bennett’s gentle curler is headed clear easily by Diame. Shelvey, formerly of Swansea City, is getting pantomime pelters every time he touches the ball. Ritchie also attracts the crowd’s ire as he clatters into Hoillet. He’s booked ...2 min: Zohore chases after a long Arter pass down the right. He’s clumsily bundled over by Lascelles. A free kick, and an early chance for Cardiff to load the box.And we’re off! Newcastle get the party started. There was a perfectly polite handshake between Warnock and Benitez before kick-off, incidentally. I wouldn’t describe it as warm, exactly, but there’s nothing wrong with that.The teams are out! Cardiff are in their famous blue, thank goodness, while Newcastle sport those storied black-and-white stripes. It’s a gorgeous sight, a real old-school feel. This would have been one hell of a showdown in the 1920s. The home choir giving it plenty. “Deeply conflicted on this one,” admits Alun Pugh. “Grew up watching Cardiff from the Grange End. Had I not worked on the Scotswood Road in the 1990s, the double relegation of Sunderland FC would have been met with a shrug rather than unalloyed glee. Anyone else here see my first game at Ninian Park? Cardiff v Torpedo Moscow, Cup Winners Cup quarter final in 1968: 5p for a programme, GBH tackling and somebody pissing on your shoes in the crush.” I suppose on balance things have changed for the better ... but even so, that sounds marvellous. What happened in the match? Cardiff made it to the semis that year, I see.Rafa talks! “These players were working in pre-season with us, and against Tottenham they did well, especially in the second half. And our new players need time to settle down. I am confident in them. I hope for the same reaction, work and team-spirit from last week because we created chances, that is how to win games. Playing away in the Premier League is always a tough test.”Neil Warnock speaks to Sky. “Our home form is going to be crucial, as it was last year. Our fans have been fantastic and we will need them more than ever. We’re quite pleased with what we’ve done this week and we’re looking forward to it. Last week, if we took our chances, we’d have been in it. If we stay in the game today, we will have a chance.”Newcastle’s No 9. Salomón Rondón is the latest man to wear one of the most famous shirts in football. It’s been pulled on by the likes of Hughie Gallagher, Jackie Milburn, Malcolm Macdonald, Les Ferdinand, Andy Cole and Alan Shearer. No pressure, then. He’s been talking to Louise Taylor.Cardiff are back in the big time. It’s only their second season in the top flight in the last 56 years. But the club have quite a history nonetheless. You don’t have to look very far.Cardiff make four changes to the team named at Bournemouth last weekend. Victor Camarasa, Josh Murphy, Kenneth Zohore and Harry Arter, making his debut for the Bluebirds after being ineligible for the trip to Dean Court, are in. Lee Peltier, Callum Paterson, Nathaniel Mendez-Laing and £10m striker Bobby Reid make way.Newcastle make just one change to their opening-day teamsheet. Javier Manquillo comes in for the injured DeAndre Yedlin.Reina, Arbeloa, Insua, Paletta, Hyypia, Pennant, Alonso, Gonzalez, Sissoko, Fowler, Bellamy. Neil Warnock wasn’t happy with Rafa Benitez’s selection for a game at Fulham back in May 2007. Liverpool had the Champions League final on their mind, Fulham won the match, and Warnock’s Sheffield United eventually went down instead. Cue recriminations, threats of legal action, etc. But the hatchet has since been buried. “Everything has been said about that,” smiles Warnock. “We’ve met a few times since. Life is too short.”In fact, we’ve got to the stage where Warnock is heaping praise on Benitez. “The one person Newcastle can’t afford to lose is Rafa,” says the Cardiff City manager ahead of today’s love-in. It is going to be a love-in, right?Well, not necessarily: both teams are desperate for something this lunchtime after opening-day defeats. Newcastle were unlucky to lose at home to Tottenham last weekend, while Cardiff gave a good account of themselves at Bournemouth, for no reward. History is on Newcastle’s side: they’ve won their last ten league games against Cardiff! The Bluebirds haven’t beaten the Toon in the top flight since 1961, but they will gain succour from an FA Cup win at St James Park just four years ago.As for the managerial head-to-head? Benitez has that one locked down: he’s undefeated against Warnock in five games, and has won the last four. This love-in might be built on shaky foundations, you know. We kick off at 12.30pm BST. It’s on!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38f5fc71d4d0582c8920aaf2b0061cda439e4920/2_0_4011_2409/master/4011.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43a529a2e8c518a618df47ed854584d2","title":"a letter to my midlife lover","story":"‘I knew right away that we’d hit it off: we talked nonstop and I felt at ease.

You had also been widowed within the past year, and although your marriage was blissfully happy, whereas mine was more complicated, we talked openly about the searing pain of bereavement. We laughed and smiled a lot, too. As your mad puppy jumped around, causing me to repeatedly move to the other side of you, I found that I kept touching your arm.We went to a nearby pub and continued to talk without pause. It was obvious that we shared a great deal in terms of values, beliefs and sense of humour. I told you I was having a lovely time, and you smiled the smile that I have since come to love and told me that you were, too. After four hours, which barely felt like one, I had to go. We walked to my car and you kissed me. I was astonished, enthralled, charmed. It was clear that this was not going to end here.We spoke that evening and agreed to meet again a week later. We spoke several times every day in the interim. I astounded myself by suggesting we spend a weekend near that same beach a few weeks later. On our second meeting, there were instant fireworks: an explosive combination of emotional connection, physical attraction and a huge liking for each other. We continued to spend as much time together as we could and, 17 days after meeting, we rather crazily booked a holiday abroad.Three months on, I am happier than I thought possible – I did not expect, in my late 50s, to feel like this. You have turned my life around. We make each other laugh all the time and your capacity for physical affection is unending. You tell me I am gorgeous and are unfailingly kind. You talk about what you see as my talents and encourage me to develop them (even at this late stage). There have been many magical moments: dancing round my kitchen in each other’s arms walking, crying and laughing on that beach where we first met sitting in a cafe and grinning broadly at each other at the sheer, wonderful craziness of it all.This feels like something that could last for ever. Whatever happens, you have shown me that, even after the very worst has occurred, unbelievable happiness can make a new appearance.

There was no emergency – I was simply so overwhelmed at being left alone to look after her, and she looked so fragile that I didn’t want to hurt her by bending her delicate little arms. So I resorted to scissors.I am sure most new fathers feel helpless, and even after nine months’ preparation, terrified of doing the wrong thing. But I didn’t even have the luxury of those nine months of pregnancy to get ready – I had just three hours’ notice. At 11.45pm on 11 May 2015, I was 29, carefree and child-free. By 12 May 2015 at 3am, I was a dad.It began with my girlfriend’s “appendicitis”, as diagnosed by the 999 operator. Except it wasn’t: she was in labour. Until then, Lyndsay, whom I had been with for three years, had no symptoms of pregnancy: she had been taking the pill and had even been losing weight. Neither of us even remotely considered she might be pregnant. That day, I hadn’t heard from Lyndsay since lunchtime, so I was blissfully unaware until her mother called me at 11.50pm. I knew something was seriously wrong, because she refused to say anything until I was sitting down. When she said Lyndsay was in labour and I was going to be a father, I couldn’t speak. The baby was coming, imminently.When I put the phone down I stood there, stunned, my mind in overdrive. I wasn’t ready to accept the responsibility everything was happening in the wrong order.I had always said that I didn’t want children, but if ever I chose to, it would be after marriage. The very idea of fatherhood made me shiver in fear I had never even held a baby. I had to get to that hospital, but I couldn’t think straight, so I phoned my best friend. She was equally confused and surprised, but stayed with me on the phone for the entire journey. She told me to think about Lyndsay, who would be terrified, and to keep her posted. Just sharing the news helped calm me down.When I made it to the hospital, Lyndsay’s mother was waiting for me. As she led me down the corridor to the maternity ward I felt as if I was walking the Green Mile. At the same time, I was desperate to get to her. As I entered the delivery room, Lyndsay was still insisting to the midwife that she wasn’t pregnant and, in between words of denial and inhaling gas, rolled around in pain on the bed. When she spotted me she burst into tears and blurted out how sorry she was – she knew I didn’t want children. I did all I could to reassure her it was going to be OK, but the truth wasI didn’t have a clue what was going to happen.The midwife showed us our baby on a monitor, but it was too late to determine the sex or health Lyndsay just had to go for it. She was already 8cm dilated and told that she couldn’t have an epidural. I held her hand tightly as she cried out.It was approaching 3am when our daughter was born, and I was the first to hold her. She was wrapped in a towel and had an angry, confused cry and yet, as I took her from the midwife, I felt nothing but unconditional love. I had convinced myself fatherhood would be my own personal version of hell, but at that moment I understood how wrong I’d been.It wasn’t until later that morning, alone with our daughter for the first time, that it dawned on us: she had no name. We chose Bella – the first I suggested. We discussed how Lyndsay andBella would move in with me and that I would be there, despite the challenges.But that was the easy part. Apart from a 10-minute conversation I had with a nurse, who told me to “support the head and you can’t go wrong”, I didn’t know what I was doing. I was sleep-deprived, scared and clueless. Then social services unexpectedly turned up to talk to Lyndsay in hospital. They explained they had to look into all cases of “concealed” births, just in case of familial abuse. Lyndsay described how she had recently been feeling extra tired but had assumed that it was down to a new job, not a baby. (The midwife explained that Bella had been hiding in her back, hence no bump.) I was also visited at home to ensure that it was a suitable environment to bring up a child. We reflected on the places we’d been and the mad things we had done while Lyndsay was pregnant. We certainly wouldn’t have gone ziplining the weekend before Lyndsay gave birth, had we known. Four days later, Bella and Lyndsay came home. By then I wasmentally much more prepared. As soon as the front door closed and I placed Bella into her moses basket, everything felt calmer. My perspective on the world had totally changed in the space of those three hours, between finding out she was on her way and her birth. I had grown up overnight.

Then the novichok poisonings changed the moodA few months into making my show Sam Delaney’s News Thing, which I hosted for two-and-a-half years on RT UK (the channel formerly known as Russia Today), we made a sketch called Diana in Heaven. It featured the writer and broadcaster Andy Dawson dressed in a blond wig and pearls, giving celebrity gossip reports from the afterlife. Dawson is a middle-aged, overweight man from Sunderland. He delivered his (awful) impression of Diana in front of a shabby celestial backdrop, while swigging from a can of lager. The production team and I thought it was hilarious, but when the channel boss saw it he was unimpressed. “You cannot broadcast this sketch!” he told us in his firm Russian accent. “There are some thingsthe British public just won’t accept.”So we removed it. I mean, we liked it, but not enough to make a stand and fall out with the channel. We were surprised they took the memory of the Princess of Wales so seriously. After all, it was the first – and almost the last – time RThad interfered in any of our output. But in many ways, the incident embodied our relationship: fun, yes, but also a bit stressful and confusing.I first entered RT’s London studios in 2015, when I was promoting a book I had written about political advertising, Mad Men \u0026amp Bad Men. I had never heard of RT, but my publisher told me it was a good place to sell books such as mine because it had a politically engaged audience.I was interviewed by Afhsin Rattansi, the British journalist who now hosts RT’s news show, Going Underground. Charming but provocative, Rattansi had previously worked on Radio 4’s Today programme and CNN. The interview was surprisingly robust but I enjoyed myself.On my way out, a producer told me he was in the market for a topical comedy show. At the time, I was still editor-in-chief at Comedy Central UK, and he thought I might have some ideas. I did. I had been developing a format with the producer Ben Rigden, who once ran The Big Breakfast and Richard \u0026amp Judy, as well as devising Fighting Talk for BBC Radio 5 Live. Together, we came up with a show that featured me as host, plus a panel of guest comics and journalists, and a big political interview. It was anarchic and irreverent and frequently stupid. It was probably too daft to be described as proper satire mostly, we were inspired by the spirit of Viz magazine.But the channel seemed to like it. I was introduced to the boss, Nikolay Bogachihin (who remains the only Russian person I ever met there). He is a quietly spoken man in his late 30s whose deadpan persona, I learned, hid a very good sense of humour. I liked him a lot. He commissioned a pilot. The guests on our first, unaired episode were the comedians Sara Pascoe, Richard Herring and Des Clarke, alongside an interview with the former SNP leader Alex Salmond (this was years before RT gave him his own show). It went well enough for the channel to commission six months’ worth of episodes.I was, by then, aware of RT’s reputation. The channel is part-funded by the Russian state and some of its coverage of the conflict with Ukraine had been criticised for extreme pro-Russian bias. Ofcom, the body that regulates every broadcast news outlet in the UK, had censured RT for its lack of impartiality, as well as for presenting misleading information over the BBC’s coverage of a chemical weapons attack in Syria (RT claimed the BBC had staged the attack). Its discussion shows were frequently accused of giving platforms to screwballs and conspiracy theorists.My own concerns were obvious: would the channel try to bend our daft entertainment to some sinister political agenda? My gut said it was unlikely. They already had enough angry content. I was confident they wanted an outsider who could lighten the mood a bit. Nevertheless, we decided to proceed with extreme caution.I told Bogachihin that my production company would make the show independently and sell it to RT. We wanted to maintain stringent control – over everything from the guests we booked to the scripts we wrote. At the time, Going Underground and the channel’s local news coverage were all produced by an in-house team we were RT’s first independent commission. Since then, there have been several more, including Alex Salmond’s political discussion show.During the week, we produced the show from our offices in Southwark, south London. On Fridays we went to RT’s studios on the 16th floor of Millbank Tower in Westminster to record the show. From the offices, there are sweeping views across the river to the MI6 building and out to the Houses of Parliament. Our guests loved that.In one of our first episodes to air, in November 2015, we covered the Russian Olympic doping scandal, and delivered what we thought was a provocative depiction ofRussia as a nation of cheats. It was our way of testing the water. The channel checked it before it went out (a standard procedure for any broadcaster) and made no changes. We started to feel reassured.As time went by, we were astounded by the freedom we were given. Some of the stuff we broadcast on News Thing was so juvenile, offensive and, sometimes, terrible that we expected to be kicked out at any moment. But we rarely saw the boss we rarely had any interaction with the channel at all. That was almost suspicious in itself. Everyone on News Thing had worked for terrestrial channels for years none of us had ever experienced such laissez-faire management.For its first 18 months, the channel seemed to fly under the radar. Not many people paid attention, and the audience for News Thing was under 40,000 a week. But we attracted a big social media following, and made it our business to generate as much noise as we could. We booked high-profile political guests such as John Prescott, Alastair Campbell, Neil Kinnock and Vince Cable. Rising stars of the Tory party, including MPs James Cleverley, Johnny Mercer and Kwasi Kwarteng, also appeared. We booked columnists from all the main papers: Giles Coren, Andrew Pierce and Michael White, the ’s former political editor, were regulars on our panel.We teased our guests, made them play silly games and encouraged them to muck about. Ken Livingstone sang a duet of the Phil Collins track Easy Lover with me to close an episode. Former Ukip leader Paul Nuttall was subjected to a phoney psychometric test while wearing a colander on his head covered with wires. Prescott ate a platterof oranges sprinkled with Oxo cubes, a tribute to Cilla Black. Everyone seemed to enjoy themselves and most returned for more.Our most famous prank was getting a little girl to dress up as the Queen and pretend to knight Nigel Farage. We had primed her to say: “My mummy says you hate foreigners.” The clip went viral, with 4m views and made headlines around the world. George Osborne was one of the first to retweet it, along with the comment: “This deserves a wider audience.” The comic Sarah Silverman shared it with her 10 million followers alongside the comment: “THIS IS THE GREATEST THING EVER!” For a while, the show felt like it was flying.Then, in the autumn of 2017, things started to get difficult. Some of our political guests were criticised for receiving payments to appear. They weren’t breaking any parliamentary rules we were an independent show paying our guests pretty standard appearance fees of £500 – much less than a BBC panel show like Have I Got News For You. The most we ever paid was £2,000. But some of our regulars started to feel nervous about being associated with RT.Conspiracy theorists – and even some mainstream journalists – began to accuse us of being part of what they called Putin’s propaganda machine. This seemed laughable to us. For a start, we had complete editorial independence. Plus, everyone involved in making the show was essentially left of centre, your typical metropolitan liberal dickhead types (including me). Our output was often dumb and sweary, but usually balanced and pretty moderate in its views. We criticised Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn equally. The show was consistently pro-remain. The channel’s marketing slogan was: “Question more”. It was true that programmes such as Going Underground or George Galloway’s weekly discussion show liked to challenge what they saw as the lazy bias of western neoliberals by comparison, News Thing was positively wishy-washy and mainstream.But RT didn’t seem to care much about us. Even when our Farage stunt went global, Bogachihin just smirked and said: “Just the sort of thing that you liberals find funny, I suppose.” I started to question what my role really was. “Useful idiot” is a term I learned from watching Homeland on Channel 4, a phrase used by Russian intelligence operatives to describe a seemingly benign court jester who provides handy distraction from the more sinister stuff. Was I RT’s useful idiot?Interestingly, the RT social media team would seem particularly supportive of this sort of output, heavily retweeting the show – perhaps because these speeches were critical of the government and scornful of the state of British society. They paid far less attention when we were just being silly, or more mainstream in our views.We spent just a few hours in the RT studio each week, and had little interaction with the channel’s staff. But when the Daily Mail published an “inside report” of the newsroom in November last year, I had seen enough to know it was widely exaggerated. The article portrayed a sinister propaganda machine, with rows of journalists hunched over computers producing fake news. The truth, as far as I could see, was rather more mundane. Almost everyone who worked on RT’s news team was British. They were mostly young journalists, many in their first jobs, gaining what looked like valuable experience in news reporting and television production. Most of them seemed bemused by the perception that they were employed as propagandists. I remember the day Theresa May got up in the Commons to give her statement following the novichok poisoning of Sergei and Julia Skripal in Salisbury in March. I was told that, at Millbank, young RT journalists gathered around the TV nervously waiting to see if she would (as some MPs proposed) shut the channel down. They all had rent to pay and were scared about the fallout of being caught up in a geopolitical scandal.The scene was very similar in our production offices. We knew the writing was on the wall. Overnight, the negativity surrounding the channel increased hugely, largely fed by RT’s questioning of Russia’s culpability in the poisoning. The show and everyone who worked on it was at risk of being stigmatised by association.Our contract would come to an end in June, and we decided we would not renew. It was becoming harder and harder to book guests. The MPs who had become friends of the show told us, off the record, that they couldn’t come on any more their party chiefs had forbidden them from appearing.In the end, the channel got there first. They told us that they expected to be shut down by Ofcom sooner or later, and had been ordered by Moscow to cut their independently made shows. I was called into Bogachihin’s office as we prepared to record a show in late April. He was honest and frank about the decision, even joking that “now at least you won’t have to listen to people saying you work for Putin”. I got the sense that, if it had been down to him, Bogachihin would have kept the show going: the positive news we generated was a respite from all the criticism. But my overriding feeling was one of relief. I had enjoyed making News Thing, but the association with RT had become toxic, however sure I was of our own independence.Oddly, other independent shows – Alex Salmond’s, for one – have continued. Perhaps they were deemed more reliably anti-establishment. Hiring an extremely high-profile politician such as Salmond had been a real coup for RT, and certainly his chatshow was a better fit than my weekly output of profanity and pranks. Ultimately, News Thing didn’t have enough impact on the channel’s reputation one way or the other. In that sense, I was more of a useless idiot.Were we naive in going to work for RT? I don’t think so. In 2015, it was not particularly controversial. Yes, we knew there were Kremlin links but we were satisfied by the channel’s Ofcom-regulated status, as well as its pledge to allow us complete editorial independence.We were also attracted by their risk-taking mentality. We had more creative freedom than any of us had had elsewhere, from the BBC, ITV, Sky, the  and pretty much every other mainstream media outlet you might care to mention. And despite this, we were (slightly disappointingly) never once sanctioned by Ofcom ourselves.The truth is, RT was the only channel that wanted us in 2015. Had the BBC or Channel 4 or anyone even a bit less controversial wanted to broadcast the show, we would have bitten their arm off. But I’m not sure we would have been afforded the same freedom.In a news story about our 2017 Farage stunt, Buzzfeed’s then political editor Jim Waterson (now the ’s media editor) wrote of News Thing: “Although RT has been repeatedly accused of being a propaganda front for the Kremlin’s interests in the West, it is unclear how this show fits into that pattern.” And he was right. We never knew how we fitted in, either.Commenting on this piece?

But a new breed of car clubs is going one step further – by only renting out electric cars powered by a rechargeable battery.Clubs, such as Zipcar, have been around since 2000, and the concept is relatively simple. Members pay an annual or monthly fee and hire cars by the hour. In return, they avoid the costs associated with buying and running a car such as tax, insurance and maintenance. You can book online or via a smartphone app, pick up and return to various street locations, and access via the app or membership card.But nearly two decades after car clubs first arrived, all-electric ones are joining the fray. Drivers who join can hit the road safe in the knowledge they are driving emissions-free. Electric cars are also quiet, offer smooth driving, accelerate quickly and are exempt from the London congestion charge.Comparing car club costs can be tricky with different schemes charging various one-off, annual, or monthly membership fees, plus hourly or daily charges, or per mile or per minute. Some also have a minimum monthly spend.Obviously there’s no fuel to worry about – but you will have to plug the car into a Source London charge point at the end of the rental. These can be reserved up to 90 minutes in advance.Pricing is pretty straightforward. It’s £5 a month and then 17p a minute, with a minimum journey time of 20 minutes (£3.40), so an hour would cost £10.20. Hires are intended to be short point-to-point (like a car version of Santander Cycles) so there’s not an option to hire for a day.Zipcar is arguably the biggest car club in the UK with a wide variety of vehicles. Its “Zipcar Flex” works in a similar way to Bluecity – it is for driving from A to B with no need to return the car to its original spot. It is in the process of adding 325 Volkswagen e-Golfs to its fleet – but these are more expensive than Bluecity, at 31p a minute (capped at £14 an hour). Its petrol cars are more expensive, too, with VW Polos at 29p a minute (capped at £12 an hour).One feature that will appeal to Londoners is Bluecity’s 10-bay station at Gatwick. It reckons members can drive there from London in an hour, so if you had four passengers, it would cost about £2.50 each. The service is likely to appeal to families who like to drive to and from the airport but wince at the cost of airport parking.Rival E-Car, part of Europcar, offers both electric and hybrid cars and has about 145 vehicles across the UK. It is targeting people doing round trips rather than A to B. All cars must be returned and placed on charge at their original “hub”.E-Car has two membership options: pay-as-you-go and a subscription. Pay-as-you-go costs a one-off £50 fee. Hourly charges start from £5.50 for a small hatchback (a Renault Zoe) or £6.50 for a larger hatchback (a Nissan Leaf). Daily rates are £45 and £50 respectively.It costs £50 to join, and then £15 a month. Hourly rates are £1 cheaper than pay-as-you-go. Daily rates are £35 and £45 for small and large models respectively. All prices include unlimited mileage, insurance and charging.E-Car’s day rates are competitive compared with Zipcar. Zipcar prices depend on the membership type and the car, but the cheapest daily rates start at £50 during the week and £60 at weekends.However, Zipcar has one major advantage over renting electric vehicles: its cars can fill up with petrol at any service station, while electric car drivers have to make sure they have enough power to reach their destination or charging point.And it is charging points that are the big stumbling block. Renters get “range anxiety” – the fear the battery will run flat – when embarking on longer trips. You need to plan your journey around charging points and be aware it will take longer than normal, as even a “fast” charge takes about half an hour.However, the E-Car marketing manager, Gaurav Ahluwalia, is confident that charging isn’t a major issue. “Our fleet mostly consists of the Renault Zoe, BMW i3 and Nissan Leaf. All of these come with an average range of 70 to 90 miles per charge, which is more than sufficient for the majority of journeys on a day-to-day basis,” he says.A couple of other car clubs offer electric cars as part of their fleet alongside petrol cars. These include Enterprise Car Club and Co-wheels.Co-wheels membership is a one-off fee of £25, and there is a minimum monthly spend of £5. Whether its electric cars are more expensive to hire than its petrol or hybrid cars depends on how many miles you do. All electric cars (except the snazzy Renault Twizy) cost £5.50 an hour or £38.50 a day. Small petrol cars can be hired from £4.75 an hour plus 18 to 20p a mile.“The advantage of electric cars is obvious: they are always zero emission, so you get the maximum environmental benefits and no harmful emissions which pollute built up areas, and there is no additional mileage charge,” says the Co-wheels managing director, Richard Falconer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e7207f82f0e23bcb2b4f846edfb6520e1a459ec/0_0_5079_3047/master/5079.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa8e29e33a2cbe87bd6c156ca4ec6a69","title":"turkey lira buy property","story":"This week’s currency crisis has prompted a flood of overseas buyers seeking bargainsProperty investors have been flocking to Turkey this week in a bid to grab houses and apartments that have in some cases dropped from £55,000 a month ago to below £37,000 now.The highly-publicised collapse in the Turkish lira may have been a disaster for the country – and any British expat who bought there in the last two years – but it has been described as a bonanza for those holding US dollars, pounds or euros.In August 2017, a pound bought 4.5 lira, before it started a steady decline over the year, slumping to 6.3 lira by mid-June. But at the height of the currency’s troubles last week, it was trading at just under 9 lira to the pound, meaning property had effectively almost halved in price in hard currency terms compared with a year ago.The move immediately prompted something of a gold rush, according to Turkish property experts. This week, direct flights from the Middle East to Istanbul were fully booked as high-end investors flocked to the Turkish capital to grab bargains. Expat Turks living in Germany and elsewhere have also been trying to use the crisis to bag properties.Agents selling property in the southern Turkish resorts of Bodrum and Marmaris are reporting a huge upsurge in interest. Apartments with pools that were selling for £500,000 a year ago were down to £350,000 and less at one point this week. Two-bed apartments were being offered for under £40,000 to those able to act immediately.As the currency fluctuated, some apartment prices in Marmaris went from £26,200 down to £18,500 and then back to £22,400 by Thursday for those holding pounds.“It’s a buyer’s market right now, and buyers are rushing in as if properties are going out of fashion,” says Cameron Deggin, who runs PropertyTurkey. “We generally receive 50 inquiries per day, and get about 2,500 views of our website, but in the past few days both have been running at double normal levels. Buyers are clearly looking for opportunities before the drop in lira is compensated – at least partially – by increases in asking prices.”Can Emlak Properties in Bodrum told  Money this week that\u0026nbspthe phones were running hot with inquiries from Brits in the area, but also from Turks living in Germany who were looking to grab a bargain.“I have a two-bed detached villa that last month would have cost you about £55,000. Today it is yours for £37,000. It’s crazy busy,” said a spokesman.The price “correction”, as it has been termed, follows a boom. Between 2010 and 2017, house prices in the country rose continuously, largely due to the rising middle class gaining access to mortgage finance for the first time - growing on average by 2.5 times nationally, or three times in Istanbul."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/089c7260109ceb1b59a57f2458754ef6dfe00327/0_364_2765_1659/master/2765.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a9d425629d65979f0ab8bdf1a2c44b3","title":"the queen of soul aretha franklin a life in pictures","story":"The queen of soul for six decades, Aretha Franklin, has died aged 76.

This week, he decided to confront most of the British newspaper industry head on, formally complaining to the press regulator Ipso about how six national outlets had covered his decision to take part in a wreath-laying ceremony at a Tunisian cemetery where Palestinian activists are buried.He has generally had a better relationship with broadcasters than newspapers. During the 2017 general election campaign, Corbyn’s team focused on using TV news channels to get their message across to the public, in the belief that the heavily regulated world of broadcasting meant he would be guaranteed to receive more coverage.Despite Corbyn’s frequent battles with the media, the Labour party remains vague on what it would do to reform the industry.

Almost half of the 715 young people were black or Asian. “Much more needs to be done to reach out to black and ethnic minority groups over the disease,” said the LGA, which represents 370 councils across England and Wales. The figures come soon after it emerged that 22,000 children aged 10 and 11 in England are severely obese because their body mass index (BMI) is at least 40. For adults, a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 means someone has a healthy weight 25 to 29.9 denotes they are overweight 30 to 39.9 means someone is obese and 40 or above signifies severe obesity. “The rise in type 2 diabetes in young children highlights why bold measures are needed to tackle childhood obesity – and change won’t happen overnight”, said Eustace de Sousa of Public Health England (PHE).Ministers recently announced measures intended to halve childhood obesity by 2030, including:But much firmer action is needed, said MacGregor. “Appeals to people to eat more healthily won’t be enough. We need to ban the marketing and advertising of unhealthy foods altogether, not just limit it, as ministers are considering.Seccombe, a Conservative member of Warwickshire county council, criticised government cuts to councils’ public health budgets as “short-sighted” given the scale of the obesity epidemic. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: “We know the damage obesity causes and are determined to halve childhood obesity by 2030. “We’ve invested billions in public health services and have already removed the equivalent of 45m kilograms of sugar from soft drinks every year. “Our new childhood obesity plan will now get children exercising more in schools and reduce their exposure to sugary and fatty foods.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2d2dc1559e0f45c323a0cbdb818b3a82b7bd1f0/0_306_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f5103d00cbeb7fe2144fdd4e187160d7","title":"it looks like youre a lazy idiot hoarders welcome medical classification","story":"People say WHO decision to class hoarding as a disorder may improve public understandingDavid Woods was a university student when he formed an insatiable appetite to find out more. He bought books – lots of them. Thirty years on, the 50-year-old council worker is surrounded on all sides by his ever-growing collection: 15,000 books and DVDs fill his small bungalow on the outskirts of Edinburgh. “It’s quite tricky to let go of some stuff,” he admits.Woods is a hoarder, as is his housemate Lynda. They’re midway through an anxiety-ridden declutter, which has already resulted in one transit van full of “stuff” being taken away, with about six more left to fill. By the end, they hope, there may even be room to sit down.“If I was living in a big, posh house and had this amount of books on the shelves, they would call it a library,” he said. “Nobody would go ‘Oh, Lord Toffington is a hoarder!’ But because I’m living in a bungalow and I’m the underclass, I’m a hoarder.”The World Health Organisation this week classified hoarding as a medical disorder, in a move described by hoarders and psychiatrists as “extremely significant”. According to the WHO, the disorder is characterised by an “accumulation of possessions due to excessive acquisition of – or difficulty discarding – possessions, regardless of their actual value”.The issue is far more complex: hoarding is often linked to other serious mental health issues, such as childhood trauma or clinical depression. Not all hoarders live in unhygienic homes, nor are they all fiercely opposed to letting go of possessions.“The television programmes add to the shame and embarrassment because if you say you have hoarding issues people immediately relate that to the TV and think they’re dirty. They call it entertainment but it’s just reinforcing stereotypes,” said Linda Fay, the founder of the hoarding support company Life-Pod.Woods said he did not realise he had a problem until a mental health support worker visited his home three years ago. “I just thought it was normal to buy a lot of books you don’t necessarily read.”His eclectic collection includes tomes on microbiology, magic and tarot cards, but his “latest splurge” has been on books about inequality and politics. It stems from “a feeling of not knowing enough”, he said. “I panic and go, ‘Oh my God! I need to understand.’”Woods has received help from Life-Pod for three years. It takes time and patience, he says, but “there is hope to deal with it”. Treatments such as cognitive behavioural therapy are often prescribed by the NHS but rarely work, campaigners say, while forcing someone to simply clear out their possessions – as espoused by some local authorities and private landlords – often has disastrous consequences. Fay said she has known hoarders to kill themselves after being forced to get rid of their belongings.The embarrassment often felt by hoarders means many suffer in silence, according to Jo Cooke, a director of Hoarding Disorders UK. Just this week, Cooke said, police had to force entry to an elderly man’s house after neighbours found him collapsed in his garden. When officers arrived, they found a house filled to the ceiling with tools. He had five woodchippers, countless lathes, and a cement-mixer in his dining room alone.A former engineer, the man lived alone in the house where he was born. He had never sought help for hoarding. “We don’t know how long he had been living like that,” said Cooke. “His house was a toy room for a grown-up. When I spoke to him about what he could keep and what he could lose, recognising he would have anxiety, he said: ‘I want all my tools – everything else can go.’”The WHO classification was a “watershed moment” for hoarding disorder, said Paul Bertuello, a 59-year-old antiques buyer who lives with a blind three-legged cat named Minkyand a lifetime’s worth of valuables in a small cottage near Bath.Sitting on the corner of his bed, Bertuello stares at a 1.5-metre tower of what, he says, can “only be described as rubbish”. His home is named Boot Cottage as everything he owns and wears was bought at a car boot sale.His past employment as an antiques buyer has morphed into an almost uncontrollable desire to track down historical objects at bargain prices. Bertuello wears a 2,000-year-old Roman ring, and a silver piece of eight dangles from his left ear. Somewhere in his bedroom is a 200-year-old solid silver catheter and a pair of second world war fighter goggles.While his collection might sound eccentric, Bertuello says his hoarding is a byproduct of clinical depression, which he has had since his twenties.He said he hoped the WHO decision would lead to a greater public understanding of the condition: “It’s often quite a secret illness. It’s very, very difficult for people to empathise with you because it looks very silly.“It looks like you’re a lazy idiot and ‘get off your backside’ but I’ve suffered depression all of my life. I say to people: ‘I would love to invite you round for coffee but I’m afraid I can’t – you couldn’t get through my front room.’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/438abb42a93a325f0006b5cbe582a0105fd1a237/0_16_2139_1284/master/2139.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8aebb1f2847393106da518a47398c42","title":"england v india third test day one live","story":"Mid-27th over: India 82-3 (Kohli 4) And that’s lunch, with England winning the second hour even more convincingly than India won the first. Woakes has three for 18, to make seven for 61 in 22.4 overs in this series. Those figures aren’t good, they’re ridiculous. He’s done exactly what Curran did in the first Test, conjuring a collapse from a solid opening partnership. Once again, Kohli will have to play a lone hand – though Pant could be an exciting partner for him. I’m taking a break, and Simon Burnton will be with you shortly.Woakes has the golden touch this week. He tries a short ball, and Pujara hooks it to Rashid, who takes a crisp catch. RASHID! On the scorecard. Plus, the not-very-fine leg turns out to be a masterstroke.26th over: India 82-2 (Pujara 14, Kohli 4) Kohli, tied down, swats at a wide one from Broad, which, two minutes before lunch, looks like risk without reward – he only just reaches it and it goes to point.“Stokes will beis trying too hard,” says Ant White. “S. Curran would simply be enjoying the challenge.Are C.W. and S.C. the J.A.S.B. replacements? If so, who will play the bad cop? I’ll go for Sam!”Good ball, bad review – Kohli was outside the line and playing a shot.Not given. It’s Broad, so probably not out...25th over: India 82-2 (Pujara 14, Kohli 4) Kohli plays his first attacking shot, a wristy clip for three off Woakes.“Had I known about Kim Thonger’s ECB game,” says Paul Calling, “my sojourn in Vienna airport late last night, at the mercy of my endearingly badly-behaved children, would have been slightly more bearable. How about Embarrassingly Cack-handed Blunderers (or Bell-ends, if this wasn’t a family newspaper).” “So following Kim’s rules,” says Peter Rowntree, “you could have things like Extremely Cunning Beggars. You do have to choose your words carefully though, or you might get banned for contravening community rules.” Indeed. But I think we can run to bell-ends. It’s a liberal newspaper, after all.24th over: India 79-2 (Pujara 14, Kohli 1) So it’s Broad to Kohli, and Root brings in a short leg for the first time today, to remind the great man how he got out at Lord’s. Kohli, standing outside his ground as usual, plays and misses at his first ball, but gets a single with an angled prod to short leg’s right. Broad then beats Pujara with a ball that’s far too good to take a wicket – a super-inswinger that eludes the inside edge and whistles over middle.23rd over: India 76-2 (Pujara 12, Kohli 0) Woakes keeps probing, but Pujara can take it – another cover push, for four this time. Broad is coming on.“At the risk of betraying my age,” says Brian Withington, I still rather like the Thursday starts of yore (but without the horrendously stultifying Sunday rest day). Opening exchanges on days 1 and 2, with the Saturday, in golfing parlance, moving day, providing the transformative action before a satisfying denouement on Sunday afternoon. Stands the clock at ten to three, and is there honey still for tea?”22nd over: India 72-2 (Pujara 8, Kohli 0) Stokes concedes four byes and three off the bat from Pujara, who pushes purposefully into the covers. Is he protecting Kohli from the strike? The lunchwatchman.Rashid’s over before lunch is now under threat, as Root must be tempted to give Anderson or Broad a go at Kohli. 21st over: India 65-2 (Pujara 5, Kohli 0) Woakes has changed the game here. In home Tests, he’s world-class.Yes, smacking into leg stump. Woakes went wide on the crease and angled it in. A shame for Rahul, who, like Dhawan, played with some steel.20th over: India 65-1 (Rahul 23, Pujara 5) Stokes thinks he’s got Pujara lbw, but a late inside edge brings him four. Again the not-very-fine leg costs a few runs – hard to fathom the thinking there. Stokes has bowled better than his figures (6-0-26-0), and he fancies his chances against Pujara.19th over: India 61-1 (Rahul 23, Pujara 1) Pujara is off the mark with a push on the off side. Dhawan was squared up by Woakes, who now has five for 54 in this series, and a wicket every 23 balls.The breakthrough! Perfect line and length from Woakes, wobble seam, outside edge, and Buttler, unlike at Lord’s, holds the first chance that comes his way.18th over: India 60-0 (Dhawan 35, Rahul 23) Rahul forgets everything he’s learnt this morning and plays a right old waft at Stokes, which flies over the slips. Stokes finds a good retort, bowling a booming inswinger, which nonetheless beats the outside edge.Gary Naylor has a bone to pick with Gary Foskett (12th over). “Jos Buttler, though his red-ball record isn’t good, is there for the one or two Gilchristian innings that change a series. So you have to suffer the 20s in exchange for the odd 90 off 65 balls. Whether to pick him at all is a question, but he can’t be dropped just now.” Agreed. 17th over: India 56-0 (Dhawan 35, Rahul 19) Woakes overpitches and Rahul plays a textbook cover-drive. Then he gets a bit lucky, edging for four, though he played it late, as ever, and got his head over it. And that’s the 50 partnership, India’s first since their first of the series, way back on August 2, when they were still on top of the world. At this rate, Adil Rashid is not going to be the invisible man again. He may even get more than the token over before lunch.16th over: India 47-0 (Dhawan 35, Rahul 10) Stokes finds the shoulder of Shawn’s bat, but the edge dies before it reaches third slip. This could turn out to be a very slow pitch. When Stokes got short and wide again, Dhawan cuts him for four. His 35 has come off only 59 balls.“Morning Tim.” Morning, Kim Thonger. “We’ve invented a new airport departure lounge game, but think it’s also suitable for lunch and tea intervals. We call it the ECB game. “The rules. E must be an adverb, such as excruciatingly . C must be an adjective, for example complacent. B must be a noun, like buffoons. Got it? Best and funniest one wins. Loser buys drinksfoodetc.” Ha.15th over: India 43-0 (Dhawan 31, Rahul 10) Woakes duly appears and beats both batsmen – a beauty to Dhawan, holding its line, and a ball that keeps low to Rahul, going under his attempted cut. And that’s drinks, with India on top, which is just what the neutral ordered. The openers have been calm, purposeful and positive.14th over: India 42-0 (Dhawan 30, Rahul 10) Stokes is getting some swing, but it’s not late, and both batsmen have their eye in.“On the topic of leg-byes,” says Tapan Pandya. “During college heydays – 2003 World Cup, I guess – Sachin glanced a spinner and ran three. They were called leg-byes…. n I sighed in front of all of us wild hostel mates ‘what if Sachin misses century now by three?’ N guess what…… I was bannedcursed from predictingwatching Indian matches ‘ever after’! My memory said it was a SL bowler - and I just checked……indeed it was.” Wild Hostel Mates, eh. Hope you formed a band. 13th over: India 41-0 (Dhawan 29, Rahul 10) Anderson continues, keeping Rahul honest but offering, by Anderson standards, little threat. Get Woakes on!12th over: India 41-0 (Dhawan 29, Rahul 10) Stokes drops short and wide again, and it comes off the pitch so slowly that Dhawan’s cut for four goes in front of square this time. “It’s not really green,” says Kumar Sangakkara, who is shaping as an incisive commentator. “The greenness is right up in the bowlers’ footholds.” A tweet from Gary Foskett, aka Clapton Blues. “Swann called it right @bbctms: ‘Buttler is currently not worth his place, Curran is worth his weight in gold.’ You could also make a case for a fourth all-rounder – Moeen Ali in for Adil Rashid.” 11th over: India 35-0 (Dhawan 24, Rahul 9) Another single for Dhawan, who is playing Anderson late and well. Time for Sam Curr – oh. 10th over: India 34-0 (Dhawan 23, Rahul 9) Root makes his first bowling change, and it’s not Chris Woakes, the Man of the Match at Lord’s: it’s Ben Stokes, the prodigal son, who draws a few cheers and no boos from the Sam Curran Preservation Society. Stokes opens with two long hops. Rahul shovel-pulls his for a single Dhawan cracks his past cover, the shot of the day so far.9th over: India 26-0 (Dhawan 18, Rahul 7) Just a single for Rahul off Anderson, and India have won the first half-hour.“Morning.” Morning, Mr Starbuck. “One thing about byes and leg-byes is that, if it’s one bowler conceding most of them, especially in a tight run-chase, the skipper is likely to take him off and bring on someone with better control. Extras mean a lot in the context of the whole match.” Can do, yes, but not often at the top level?8th over: India 25-0 (Dhawan 18, Rahul 6) England’s fine leg isn’t fine at all, for reasons that are mysterious. It costs six more runs as Dhawan leg-glances Broad, twice, for four. Dhawan’s inside edge is a lot better than his outside edge. 7th over: India 17-0 (Dhawan 10, Rahul 6) Anderson bowls a maiden to Rahul, but it’s misleading: two deliveries are so wide that they wouldn’t hit a seventh stump. He makes up for it with a near-perfect last ball, which Rahul may have had a nibble at. Any views on Saturday starts, then? Especially if you have a nine-to-five job and normally miss the first day. Spoiler: once the excitement has worn off – around the age of 15 – the first day can be the dullest. But then this series hasn’t had any dull days.6th over: India 17-0 (Dhawan 10, Rahul 6) Rahul joins in the run-fest, getting right forward to meet a blameless ball from Broad with a well-timed push for four. To celebrate, Rahul takes a quick single.Dave Pople has a theory. “I wonder if leg-byes exist because it is hard to tell if bat hit ball with the naked eye, so the runs count either way and the umpire just decides how they are recorded. i.e. not so vital as a wicket-taking decision, so just an afterthought. With Snicko and Hotspot, they could in theory be done away with – would slow the game down though.” Some truth in that, but they’re still a drag, aren’t they?5th over: India 12-0 (Dhawan 10, Rahul 1) Anderson gives Rahul one off the mark, nudged to leg, then beats Dhawan. Just when you’re thinking he’s found his groove, he strays to leg again and gets glanced by Dhawan for the first four of the match. Then there’s an edge, but Dhawan flashes high, if not hard, and the ball sails over Pope at fourth slip. 4th over: India 3-0 (Dhawan 2, Rahul 0) Broad, getting a first glimpse of Dhawan, goes round the wicket, and produces another peach, angled in and shaping away. Then he beats the inside edge. For someone who opened the batting at school, Broad’s been a wonderful bowler. And a maddening batsman, so breezy and entertaining early on, just another tail-ender now. 3rd over: India 3-0 (Dhawan 2, Rahul 0) Ever the miser, Anderson concedes only a leg bye. Leg byes are odd, aren’t they? A reward, by definition, for missing the ball.2nd over: India 2-0 (Dhawan 2, Rahul 0) The first jaffa of the day is dished up by Stuart Broad, who sends a classic out-seamer past KL Rahul’s outside edge.The plea for a TMS link is answered by S Ashwin. “Should’ve sent this in earlier but was busy finishing my breakfast. Here is the link.” Thanks, S. Any relation of R? 1st over: India 2-0 (Dhawan 2, Rahul 0) Jimmy Anderson has the ball, and Joe Root has given him four slips, with Pope at fourth, not Stokes, who is prowling at backward point. The first ball is an inswinger to the left-handed Shikhar Dhawan, who plays a solid back-foot block. Second ball, similar but on middle-and-leg, he tucks for two. The rest he can leave, as Anderson’s radar suffers a rare glitch. Well played Dhawan.“Real potential, as the ball gets older, for reverse swing,” David Lloyd notes. “It’s a rough square.”“I feel Sam Curran has been very unlucky,” says Dave Brown. “I know the merits of Stokes but I’m not sure I would have changed the side from the last Test.”Jonathan emails to ask for the link for listening to Test Match Special overseas. Not for the first time, I fail to find it with a search – can anyone help?The first pun of the day comes from Mark Hooper. “May I be the 325th to say: Yo! Bumrah the show!”And the first tweet is from Gav Squires, recommending this recap of India’s Tests at Trent Bridge, written by, of all people, Gav Squires. “Bat ugly!” says Mike Atherton, who knows a bit about that. England make just the one change to a winning team, Stokes for Curran. India make three changes – Bumrah for Kuldeep as expected, Dhawan for Vijay at the top of the order, and, most interestingly, a new keeper, Rishabh Pant for Dinesh Karthik. Pant is a serious talent, only 20, with a first-class average of 54 and a triple hundred on his CV already. He’s Ollie Pope with a bit more experience, but he might have preferred not to make his Test debut against Jimmy Anderson at Trent Bridge.Joe Root wins the toss and takes first use of that juicy pitch. Viral Kohli says he would have batted anyway.Sam Curran’s been robbed. His place in the XI has gone to Ben Stokes. Yes, Stokes wrapped up the first Test with one of his hot spells – but he only had the chance because Curran had dragged England back into the match, twice, first with the ball and then with the bat. And he’s 20! Joe Root had a tricky decision to make, and it’s understandable that he opted for Stokes’s presence, multitasking and (ahem) aggression. But the lesser of the evils would surely have been to leave out Adil Rashid. The few overs of spin that England are likely to need could have been supplied by Root himself. Five seamers may sound samey, but Curran, with his angle and low trajectory, adds more variety than an unused leg-spinner. As it is, England are back to four right-armers.India, who bowled well at Edgbaston and poorly at Lord’s, are expected to bring in Jasprit Bumrah, whose first Test wicket was AB de Villiers, clean bowled. Morning everyone and welcome to something very few cricket lovers have experienced before – a Test in England starting on a Saturday. The last time this happened was in 1955. It reminds me of that line of Leonard Cohen’s - “I haven’t been this happy since the end of World War Two”. Not even the OBO team’s collective memory goes back that far – if yours does, or you have a grandparent on hand to help out, do get in touch. For England fans, it’s make-your-mind-up time. Do you support them so fervently that you want to see them win this series in three games flat, after being down-and-out on the third day? Or would you rather go back to where we were in the first Test, and have some drama? Cricket badly needs an Indian win. Or, failing that, a match that goes the distance. The Trent Bridge pitch, which has a green tinge, may not be in the mood to deliver."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42af7e6bda7c240fb40d09bc4817c1fd28e525d8/153_185_3315_1989/master/3315.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc45c55dfd24c0a77335c920f80dd448","title":"stardust review pleasance dome edinburgh fringe festival miguel hernando torres umba","story":"Pleasance Dome, EdinburghMiguel Hernando Torres Umba takes us into Colombia’s heart of darkness to reveal the human cost of the west’s most popular illegal drugOne-person shows that have both a human and a political edge are a tricky tightrope to walk, and few stories are as steeped in the politics of humanity as that of cocaine and its effect on the lives of Colombian people. Blackboard Theatre’s Stardust, which won the people’s choice award at this year’s Vault festival, manages to tell this complex story without veering into the territory of a preachy history lesson. Using a mix of animation, movement and monologue, the storytelling is beyond impressive.Over an hour, performer Miguel Hernando Torres Umba tells us about the popularity of cocaine over the last two centuries, the coca leaf’s original healing properties, personal stories of lives affected by cartels, and the process by which cocaine has become the west’s most popular illegal drug. This sounds like a lot, and it is, but he does it with aplomb. Charismatic and energetic, Torres Umba is also a beautiful dancer, switching easily from leading coca-leaf ceremonies to stylised, funny re-enactments of what taking cocaine does to the human body. Some moments don’t work quite as well as others. The show’s premise, that the writer has left a series of secret, as-yet-unseen notes in boxes for the performer, feels contrived, and often the audience participation causes the energy to dip. But this is a show not just about its writer or performer, or its global mix of creators, or even Colombia – it’s about all of us. Literally pulling us into the action only helps to reinforce this. In the show’s closing moments, Torres Umba, exhausted and emotional, looks for an answer to the violence in his home country that he just doesn’t have, but asks cocaine’s casual users to think about the human cost of a weekend high. On his knees, he pleads. In our seats, we listen. This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

She also accused George Soros of being “a nazi”.The drug manufacturer Sanofi, which makes Ambien, issued a statement after Barr’s outburst saying “racism is not a known side effect of any Sanofi medication”.Ambien, commonly prescribed for insomnia, was found in Tiger Woods’ system when he was arrested for a DUI in 2017. Police found Woods’ car parked on the side of the road with the engine running, the brake lights on and a right turn signal blinking. Woods said prescription medication was to blame.Charlie Sheen said Ambien was responsible for him allegedly trashing his New York City hotel room in 2010. The New York Post reported that “tables and chairs had been thrown around the room and a chandelier was also damaged”. In 2011 Sheen explained his behavior to the news show 2020:“Ambien, the devil’s aspirin! I think that led to that thing in New York. That was the one thing in the mix that was not part of my normal blend.”Appearing on the Late Show in 2017, Sean Penn pre-emptively blamed Ambien for any potentially disruptive behavior.“I’m doing well,” Penn told Stephen Colbert at the start of the interview. “You’ve inherited a little of the Ambien I had to take to get to sleep after a red eye last night.”A disheveled-looking Penn then started smoking a cigarette.Back in 2016 Paul Schrader, the screenwriter behind Taxi Driver and Raging Bull, pointed a finger at Ambien for a Facebook message in which he said Donald Trump’s presidency was “a call to violence” and “we should be willing to take arms”. The post earned Schrader a visit from the NYPD’s counter-terrorism unit.“A couple of cabernets and half an Ambien, and God knows what you’ll post,” he later told the Hollywood Reporter. “That is something that you have to be careful about because Facebook is not private correspondence.”Ambien’s pervasive influence in the world of celebrity is such that it even gets a mention in the Jay-Z and Alicia Keys song Empire State of Mind, in which the pair sing about New York City.“MDMA got you feelin’ like a champion,” Jay-Z says in the song.“The city never sleeps, better slip you an Ambien.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9dcc2340fa7c80afe70ca4b9f4be94586832cd9/0_7_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fac15a72b3374b63592ad75f74a3ac6","title":"elon musk says past year has been excruciating and worst is yet to come","story":"Musk says he has endured ‘the most difficult and painful’ time in emotional interview as confession wipes billions off Tesla valueElon Musk has said the past year of his professional life has been “excruciating” and that stress over his business had caused his health to deteriorate. To make matters worse, the confession wiped billions off the value of Tesla, the electric car company he founded.In an emotional interview with the New York Times, the founder of electric carmaker Tesla also revealed that the pressures of work had caused him to spend his birthday stuck in the Tesla factory and almost miss his brother’s wedding.“This past year has been the most difficult and painful year of my career,” he said in the interview.Musk, whose company posted a record $709.6m net loss in the first quarter of this year while struggling to manufacture large numbers of its Model 3 mass-market electric car, said he had been working up to 120 hours a week and his health had been “not great”. He said his friends had been worried about him.Musk said there were times he didn’t leave the factory for three or four days at a time and days when he didn’t go outside.He said he spent the entire 24 hours of his 47th birthday in June at work and flew directly to his brother’s wedding, where he was due to be best man, from work, arriving two hours before the ceremony and leaving immediately afterwards.Musk sparked a furore in the markets, the media and among investors earlier this month when he tweeted his intentions to take his publicly traded company private, with the assurance: “Funding secured.”Lawyers have warned that his tweet may have broken rule 14e-8 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which prohibits publicly traded companies from announcing plans to buy or sell securities if executives don’t intend to complete, don’t have the means to complete, or are trying to manipulate the stock price.In the interview with the New York Times, Musk blamed short-sellers, from whom he said he anticipated “a few months of extreme torture”.“I thought the worst of it was over,” he told the New York Times. “But from a personal standpoint, the worst is yet to come.”He denied “being on weed” at the time of the tweet and said he saw it as an attempt at transparency, but admitted in the interview on Thursday that no one had seen or reviewed it before he posted it. Observers puzzled over the price he cited.Musk explained that with an estimated premium over recent values, the share price should be around $419. He decided to round it up to $420, he said – a number that is slang for cannabis.“It seemed like better karma at $420 than at $419,” he said in the interview. “But I was not on weed, to be clear. Weed is not helpful for productivity. There’s a reason for the word ‘stoned’. You just sit there like a stone on weed.”Musk, who is a controversial figure, has drawn further criticism this year for his tweets. Last month he launched an extraordinary attack on one of the British ers involved in the rescue of 12 boys and their football coach who were trapped in a cave in Thailand, baselessly calling the er a “pedo” on Twitter.In June, Musk caused outrage when he responded to a tweet from a woman who claimed Musk had used her father’s unicorn artwork on Tesla merchandise without compensation or attribution, by telling her: “He can sue for money if he wants, but that’s kinda lame.” Musk later settled the dispute with the artist.Musk has also lashed out at both the media and analysts from large Wall Street banks in recent months, calling questions from analysts “boring, bonehead questions” and suggesting he would start a website to rank the credibility of inidual journalists, after Tesla received negative press coverage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12007a9d55bdcabfeff37f687e3bfc6eeb16d4bd/563_536_3287_1973/master/3287.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e83ac4671aeef136d00dfaf9dae145c","title":"the community space bringing scandinavian chic to glasgow","story":"For Fika Sake has become the centre of a thriving community in the heart of Scotland’s largest city, as part cafe, part learning space and lifestyle hubThe idea for an events space centred around coffee and cake was inspired by a place where so many good things originate – Scandinavia. Fika is the most recent Swedish tradition spreading across the globe. “It’s about taking time out of your day to actually sit down and maybe relax with someone or maybe yourself – usually over coffee and cake,” says Simon Forsythe, Glasgow-based owner of For Fika Sake.Forsythe’s space is part cafe, part community hangout and part creative workplace. Covering 185 sq m (2,000 sq ft) in the centre of Glasgow, For Fika Sake is drawing in everyone from students and freelancers to yogis and parenting groups who want to engage with other locals and like-minded people while learning something new.Forsythe brought the idea to life in January 2016, opening the doors after a year of planning. “It started when I was having fika at a cafe in town with a friend,” he says. “I was working a part-time job in a normal cafe and was fed up with that experience. She was running music workshops in Glasgow and wanted to work on a different project.” After bringing in one other partner, they came up with the name: For Fika Sake. “We thought up a funny, controversial title, a play on words and we stuck with that and went with it,” says Forsythe.The sense of community created by the cafe extends beyond its doors – the coffee, tea, and cake that give the space its name are sourced from local suppliers. On any day of the week you can walk into For Fika Sake to find people filling the space with music from an old piano donated by a local social enterprise, in pottery workshops run by local artists up on the mezzanine, discussing their latest reads during a book club, or catching up with friends.“It’s great to have this kind of community coming in and using the space for what it was originally designed for,” says Forsythe. “One in particular that stands out is the community for young parents. The big space means they can come in and store their prams in the corner and hang out with other parents and their babies.”After a challenging start, seeing the space come to life has been the big payoff for Forsythe. In December 2016, he had to take on the business himself after his two partners left to pursue other projects. “It was a bit of a shock,” he says. “But the business seems to have taken off since last January.” While he admits it was tough, particularly with the other stresses that come with starting a new small business – like big overheads – he says one of the perks to come out of it is being able to make decisions quickly and easily. “There was no compromise-with-partners involved, so I was able to get things done and out of the way,” he says.Now word of mouth has spread and the business is growing, and that quick decision-making is allowing Forsythe to try new ideas and systems to keep things running smoothly. He recently switched over to a new platform to help him get on top of his cashflow. He chose Square because he liked the “cool and simple” card machine – but also because he could access his funds the next working day.“It’s made a massive difference,” he says. “With this kind of business the most important thing for survival is cashflow, so being able to access your funds the next working day is a serious win. If it’s over the weekend you get your cash on Monday rather than Wednesday.”It’s also given him the time and freedom to focus on drumming up creative ideas for new workshops and events to help the cafe thrive. But if creating a community hub was the grand idea behind the space, it’s the cafe and fostering the tradition around fika that Forsythe reckons is the powerhouse of the enterprise. “It keeps the business going and it creates that space for people to use the workshop side of things,” he says.Using Square’s app, he can create a product button for a new kind of service on the spot – a convenience he appreciates, given the ever-changing use of the space and the introduction of new workshops and events. “Overall, it’s running nice and smoothly and going with that original plan, which is amazing to see.”Where does he see himself next? Hopefully with a second space, in a few years, although perhaps somewhere sunnier. “I’d love to see it grow and take on another premises in another part of Glasgow or potentially in another city,” he says. “But working on what we have right now and just gearing up more towards the community and growing it within this community is still number one.”Learn more about Square"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e8b95251ebe3dc89cac546ae4c1cc4d76ab924a/0_112_3307_1985/master/3307.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f728153027b0b5adae46feb466d00111","title":"hajj nap pods being introduced for pilgrims to saudi arabia","story":"The sleep stations – based on Japan’s famous capsule hotels – will offer clean sheets and air-conditioning Saudi Arabia plans to introduce sleep pods, reminiscent of Japan’s famed capsule hotels, in the western city of Mina in the coming days, as an estimated two million Muslims gather for the six-day hajj, one of the five pillars of Islam.The free pods are part of new measures being rolled out this year in a bid to modernise the centuries-old practice of hajj.The government has also introduced apps for on-the-spot translation and emergency medical care.A Saudi charity, the Haji and Mutamer Gift Charitable Association, is offering between 18 and 24 capsules for pilgrims to nap in for free in the coming days.Each fibreglass pod – less than three metres long and just over one metre high – features a mattress, clean sheets, air conditioning and a large, well-lit mirror.The pods can be lined up horizontally or stacked vertically to save on space.Each napper will have three hours so sleep in the pods, which are imported from Japan at cost of around $1,114 each.When the pilgrim wakes for prayer time – five times daily in Islam – workers will sterilise the pod before handing it over to the next pilgrim.“We believe it’s extremely well-suited for crowded places in our holy sites and in Mecca,” Amer said.But for hajj, which takes pilgrims across Mecca and Mina – cities in western Saudi Arabia home to the holiest sites of Islam - the pods were also inspired by the rising popularity of car and bike-sharing.“The capsules work through a share economy, like bicycles that you can rent for an hour and then leave for someone else,” said Amer.A trial run of 12 pods earlier this year was, he said, a success.

The move would also end a range of environmental initiatives funded by the programme, including rebates of up to C$14,000 ($10,700) for residents who bought electric vehicles.To the soften the blow, the government announced a transition period rebates would be honoured for anyone who bought electric vehicles through a dealership, as long as the vehicles are registered and delivered by 10 September.In an application for judicial review filed earlier this month, Tesla Motors Canada claimed this stipulation unfairly singled the company out, as it sells vehicles directly to customers rather than through dealerships.“The Minister of Transportation’s decision suddenly left hundreds of Tesla Canada’s Ontario customers in the unfair position of no longer being eligible for the rebate they had expected to receive when they ordered their vehicles,” the lawsuit claimed. It noted that those who purchased other brands of vehicles can still receive a rebate.The lawsuit asks the province’s superior court to quash what is described as an “arbitrary and entirely unreasonable” decision.“The decision has already inflicted substantial harm on Tesla Canada in the form of lost sales and the creation of an impression among Ontarians that Tesla Canada may be singled out for future arbitrary treatment under the law,” the lawsuit noted.None of the company’s claims have been proven in court.A spokesperson for Ontario’s transportation ministry said that it was aware of the lawsuit but declined to comment, noting that the matter is before the court."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Irish Government had asked the DUP leader to attend the pontiff\u0026rsquos speech in Dublin CastleAbout 270 workers engaged in industrial action over union representationActivists who occupied a vacant house in Dublin city say they are not vigilantesLotto price is to increase for the second time since the franchise was privatisedJust under 80,000 students to discover if application successful for third-level placeThere was little health and safety during previous visit, and no airportHope and a handcart fuelling cycle to east by faithful fans from BallygarPrelate, due in Dublin this week, is criticised in a damning US reportCouncil secures vacant possession of 50-year-old dilapidated complexFianna F\u0026aacuteil deputy leader also calls for Fine Gael to be \u0026lsquohonest\u0026rsquo about its failuresArchbishop of Boston says change only possible with significant involvement of lay men and womenAhead of the CAO offers being released, it is worth noting that progression to college directly from school is not the only routeTeam of four barristers shared daily payment of \u0026euro10,000 by DPP on top of brief fee\u0026lsquoAstronomical\u0026rsquo incidence of E coli infection this summer with 715 reported casesPatient sought help after her eyelid became swollen and droopy\u0026lsquoThere was an entire lack of empathy for the concerns we were presenting\u0026rsquoAvoid food poisoning with four simple steps: clean, cook, chill and separateCrash happened near Monasterevin on Friday afternoonRed Hot Mommas have delivered objections to plans for facility with sea outflow"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3599816.1534534210!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"all ireland final gerry the giant galway s lucky charm","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAaron and Craig Keighery in Ballinasloe, Co Galway, ahead of Sunday’s final. Photograph: Laszlo GeczoInpho Gerry the GAA giant had tears rolling down his painted face as he stood surveying the townlands around Galway’s Rahoon on Friday morning.It wasn’t so much Storm Ernesto that he and his Mincloon minders were worried about, but the health of Galway All-Ireland hurler John Hanbury who is from this parish.Sleep has been in short supply since word went round that the corner-back was being treated for an ankle injury suffered during the recent replay against Clare. Hanbury is under “no pressure” as one of the few city names in a panel dominated by senior hurlers from the south and east of the county.Supporters in his Rahoon-Newcastle club have homes and sheds and gardens bedecked in bunting, with even several large hay bales from one of the city boundary farms enveloped in maroon and white.“At least it is taking our minds of the fodder crisis,”one landowner from Boleybeg, near Rahoon, remarked.Rahoon-Newcastle supporter Keith O’Halloran (24) roped in everyone over the past week to wake “Gerry” from his slumbers – the giant is just over a year old, having been conceived before last year’s All-Ireland hurling final.“We made him in two parts, he’s all of 12 foot (four metres), and he took a whole can of paint to spruce him up,” O’Halloran explains.This year a baby-sized player in Limerick colours is suspended from his hurl, while a sign reads “Limerick in our pockets, McCarthy in our Hans (sic). ” “Myself, my brother Andy, Rob Keane, Boggy Coyne, Eleanor Keane, Catherine and Paul Murphy and Mairtín Coyne – the foreman – had had great fun working on it,” O’Halloran says.“Of course, we had to have a Limerick lad being caught by the scruff of the neck. Hopefully, Gerry will be Galway’s lucky charm,” he adds.O’Halloran has no ticket, and isn’t expecting miracles. However, Ballygar natives Melvin Smith (26) and Philip Coleman (41) are cycling to the match with both hope and a handcart, attached to their bike. Smith, who works in Medtronic in Galway, and Coleman, who is a blocklayer, used to prepare souped up cars in maroon and white for previous GAA finals. “We thought we’d do something a bit different this year – fewer emissions!”Smith laughs. “We are leaving Ballygar on Saturday morning, taking it in turns on the bike on the old road east, and stopping in towns like Athlone, Tyrrellspass, Kinnegad on the way.”The pair aim to raise money for three charities – the Alzheimer’s Association, Pieta House and the Irish Cancer Society – on the 170km route. “We hope to get there before dark . . . and hope there isn’t a replay where we’d have to do it all over again,” Smith says.The fittest city and county in the State would seem to be also the most competitive – outdoors, at least – with Galway’s minor hurlers also playing on Sunday, and with senior camogie and ladies football players excelling at national level. Sport is also an integral part of this weekend’s Galway Pride festival programme, with a soccer match scheduled for Sunday.Extra buses have been scheduled for the exodus, but Eyre Square is still expected to be invaded on Sunday for a big screen transmission. Superfan Jarlath Curran (23) will be up in Croke Park by then.Curran, who works as a waiter in Ard Bia restaurant, hasn’t seen his grandmother in Annaghdown in three months, as he and his grandfather, Gabriel, parents Paul and Bridget and brother Patrick have been to every GAA hurling and football match played by Galway teams this season.Curran is more than passionate about being a not-so-fair weather supporter. His parents gave him the interest, he says, and this has been his life since he was a child.“Work,holidays, are all scheduled around matches, and we get season tickets,” Curran says. “Out there in the open with a flask of tea and a cup in hand, and not even a coat in the rain – there’s nothing like it, whatever the result.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3599676.1534541762!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"geraldine kennedy papal visits underline ireland s progress","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSeptember 1979: Pope John Paul II signs the visitors\u0027 book at  Áras an Uachtaráin as the president, Dr Patrick Hillery, looks on.A different Pope, John Paul II, flew in on an Aer Lingus plane to a different Ireland for the papal visit at the end of September 1979.It lasted three days and 2.7 million people, almost half of the population of the island, turned out to greet and meet him.The present pope, Francis, is coming to a different Ireland next weekend. It is not the same country and we are not the same people.The Ireland of 2018 is such a world apart from the place it was 39 years ago that it is a foreign country: politically, socially, morally, ethnically and culturally. The outside, even the inside, observer would hardly recognise it.There was no internet, no Luas or Dart, no mobile phones.Ireland’s was a homogeneous society with very few people of different ethnicities to be seen on the streets. County councils were building good quality houses that have stood the test of time. There were big corporate donations to politics. The conventional family had a husband, a wife and four, if not many more, children.Gays were underground, the most notable pick-up point in Dublin being the men’s public toilet on Burgh Quay. Condoms were a prescribed product, often hidden under chemists’ counters in small towns.There was no child abuse. The carnality of senior clergy, which so undermined the authority of the Catholic Church, had yet to emerge in public. So had the cover-ups.These are only a sample of the major transformation in Irish society over the last 39 years since the Polish pope’s visit.He felt compelled to try to reconcile in his cabinet the personal and political fall-out from the 1970 Arms Crisis.George Colley was tánaiste, minister for finance and the public service. Lynch brought back Charles J Haughey as minister for health and social welfare while his Arms Trial adversary, Jim Gibbons, was minister for agriculture.Des O’Malley was minister for industry, commerce and energy and Brian Lenihan was minister for fisheries. Dr Martin O’Donoghue was piloted into a new ministry for economic planning and development.There was no woman minister in the cabinet. There had only been one in the entire history of the State at that point: Countess Markievicz, who was minister for labour in the first Dáil.There was no woman who had become president either. Candidates were put forward exclusively by the political parties. The county councils did not use their nominating powers.There were no women working as political correspondents.In 1979, the president was Dr Patrick Hillery and that September, shortly before the papal visit, he called the editors of national newspapers to a briefing in Áras an Uachtaráin.This would have been unusual, indeed exceptional, because the president was remote from the media.It appears from those who attended the briefing that that there had been an article in Hibernia magazine and a whispering campaign suggesting there was a woman in Brussels. Hillery had been the first Irish commissioner in the EEC, with the portfolio of social affairs from 1973 to 1976.It was believed that Charles Haughey had put out this rumour to destabilise the close relationship between Lynch and Hillery in the wake of the Arms Crisis.Douglas Gageby, then editor of The , was at the briefing and he came back to the newsroom to say that the president had told them that there was no other woman.He said he had suggested that the president should call in the political correspondents to tell them. Editors were editors then: they didn’t write stories.And so, the political correspondents were invited to the Áras for a briefing a couple of hours later. Being all men, of course, they were too embarrassed to ask prying questions. Hillery left the room and rang his wife, Maeve, who was away in Spain, during the briefing.Haughey was on his way to challenging Lynch’s leadership at the time of the papal visit. He beat George Colley to become leader of Fianna Fáil and taoiseach at the end of the first week that December.But Hillery had not told the political correspondents by the time he left that it was all off the record. The public was gobsmacked.These events do not do justice to the politics of 1979. We were a decade into 30 years of the Troubles. It was before the hunger strikes, the New Ireland Forum and the Anglo-Irish Agreement in November 1985 that set the template for everything that happened afterwards.The agreement stated that there would be no change in the status of Northern Ireland without the consent of a majority of the people there.The John Hume-Gerry Adams talks about the peace process hadn’t even begun. It was becoming Hume’s political mission to convince Sinn Féin and the IRA that they could achieve their aim of a united Ireland by political rather than paramilitary means.These were the circumstances when the first pope came to Ireland in 1979. He made a particular point, in his perfectly scripted speeches delivered in English, with a considerable cúpla focal in every single one of them, to say in Drogheda that his message was peace and reconciliation.“On my knees I beg you to turn away from the paths of violence and to return to the ways of peace,” he said.Ireland 39 years ago was, by any standards, a conservative, Catholic-dominated country with a plentifully-populated clergy. There was a high level of church attendance. There were no Educate Together schools.The Berlin Wall was yet to come down a decade later and we became a multicultural society when the eastern European bloc of countries joined the enlarged European Union in 2003.There was no political demand nor compelling demand to tackle the social agenda 39 years ago, apart from the pioneering work of Senator Mary Robinson and the lifetime campaign by David Norris to decriminalise homosexuality. The Women’s Political Association and other women’s aid groups had been formed.As minister for health and social welfare, Haughey had successfully steered the 1979 Family Planning Act through the Oireachtas. He was derided for describing it as “an Irish solution to an Irish problem” but he did put an Act on the statute books.A doctor’s prescription was required to obtain a condom in a pharmacy. The first attempt to legalise contraception had failed in 1974 when the then taoiseach, Liam Cosgrave, leader of a Fine Gael-Labour Coalition, voted against it in a free vote. The Bill had been introduced by his minister for justice, Patrick Cooney, who advocated that single people had no right to contraception. “I do not accept that there is any such right because that implies a right to fornicate and in my opinion there is no such natural right,” Cooney said.The Catholic Church was supported by Haughey’s Fianna Fáil party in opposing many social changes in the earlier years. There were two orce referendums, the Judicial Separation Act, civil partnership, gay marriage and up to five abortion referendum questions before the electorate decided to approve the availability of a limited abortion regime this year.Yet, it will not be these developments that will define the position of the Catholic Church as Pope Francis comes to Ireland.As he prepares to meet Leo Varadkar, our first gay Taoiseach, how does the pope deal with homosexuality being “objectively disordered” in the eyes of his church?Another challenge for Francis and his hierarchy is how he deals with the issues raised by former president Mary McAleese in recent times.There was the child abuse, as there was everywhere in the Catholic world. There were the mother-and-baby homes that often exported babies there were the industrial schools the Tuam babies, the Magdalene laundries.But, what damaged the church beyond repair in Ireland was the passage of abusing priests from one diocese to another around the country and the recent disclosure in The  that the Vatican wanted to suppress the files. The sin of giving scandal was greater in the Catholic Church than the abuse.And, looking back at a very different Ireland since the last pope’s visit, what would Peter Murphy, son of Bishop Eamonn Casey, and Ross Hamilton, son of Fr Michael Cleary, have to say now?Pope Francis to preside over the closing ceremony of World Meeting of Families in Dublin.

Photograph: The  When Pope Francis flies into Ireland West Airport for his brief visit to Knock shrine on Sunday week, he will have to atone for past sins, not least that of Galway’s “betrayal” of Mayo.Even as the village prepares with bunting and flags and floral tributes, memories are still fresh of what happened the last time a bishop of Rome arrived – in 1979. “People had been up all night waiting for Pope John Paul 11, and then so many of us never got to see him,” Knock resident Seamus Heneghan remembers.“The visit had to be cut short, because Bishop Eamon Casey and Fr Michael Cleary had delayed him in Galway . . . and then the weather closed in . . .”Little did anyone know that both Casey and Cleary were fathers of children already by then, and that the facts of their private lives should pale into into insignificance when set beside the revelations of child sexual abuse within the Catholic Church. An estimated 400,000 people located spots on gorse and bog around the shrine back then to view the pontiff. This time around, Knock shrine’s audience is restricted to 45,000 ticket-only holders.Back in 1979, there were few health and safety restrictions, and no airstrip. This time, Ireland West Airport is set to host the pope’s touch down on a runway used for private flights, and an associated hangar for VIPs and media. The facility has already been well tested with former US vice-president Joe Biden landing in a hefty US Air Force C17 plane for a family visit to the west in 2016. The Aer Lingus A321 transporting Pope Francis and delegation will be one of two guided on to the apron by air traffic control. “Like popemobiles, papal aircraft also have to have a backup in case of any technical difficulties,” the airport’s chief executive officer Joe Gilmore explains.A group of 100 students from local schools will greet the pontiff as he steps onto a red carpet and is then whisked away in a “modest car”, followed by a not-so-modest cortege on the 10-minute journey to Knock shrine.Gilmore remembers he was a school student selling Mass booklets in 1979. He was so exhausted by the all-night work that he found it hard to keep his eyes open for the actual visit. This time, any red eyes will relate to ensuring that the airport functions as normal. Ireland West handles almost 800,000 passengers annually – mainly on commercial, rather than pilgrimage, flights. Some 5,000 passengers on 20 flights between Britain and Europe on that day have been warned of extensive road ersions, as the main N17 will be closed from midnight on Saturday.“If it is a beautiful day, he will able to see Croagh Patrick and Nephin,” Gilmore says. “He may get to see the statue to Monsignor Horan on his way out.” To make up a £4 million funding shortfall, the monsignor initiated a lottery, or “jumbo draw”. By October 1985, the airport was marking an inaugural flight to Rome, and was opened by Fianna Fáil leader Charles J Haughey in 1986.Louis Gunnigan’s ballad in Knock shrine museum recounts the battle, concluding “and who is to say but that soon one fine daythe Pope just might fly in from Rome”.Bedecked with Vatican colours, Knock village shops are now selling papal flags and fridge magnets and car fresheners and Pope Francis T-shirts. Road ersions are already in place for the annual novena. A Garda presence at the roundabouts is “a not-so-subtle hint to the Travelling community to keep trailers and campervans out”, one resident who did not wish to be quoted said.“Yet Travellers are so loyal to this novena,” she added. “The church would be lost without them.”In the basilica, hardly a seat was free as more than 3,000 people participated in a Mass for the Feast of the Assumption led by Archbishop of Tuam Dr Michael Neary. On a day when Leaving Certificate results were issued, Dr Neary spoke of the challenges posed by contemporary culture where “success requires competition rather than collaboration, resulting in a deterioration of human relationships”. “ It used to be claimed that the undermining of religious values contributed to an undermining of the family,” Dr Neary said. “ Today we are becoming more conscious of the fact that the undermining of the family has further eroded religious faith.” “Prejudice dominates,”he continued. “There is an urgent need to become more conscious of some of the good which religious faith, the church and Christianity have done and continue to do in our world.“In a few days we will welcome the successor of Saint Peter, the Bishop of Rome, as a pilgrim to Our Lady’s Shrine at Knock. “He is coming to pray for the success of the World Meeting of Families. In doing so, he is praying for all of us and the families that we represent. May his visit and this shrine continue to be a beacon of hope for all who are struggling and for those who may have abandoned hope . . . ” Pope Francis to preside over the closing ceremony of World Meeting of Families in Dublin.

Photograph: Dara Mac DonaillMs Chambers, the party’s spokeswoman on Brexit, accused both parties of an “abdication of responsibility” in collapsing the Stormont institutions over the past 20 months. Speaking at the Parnell Summer School on the theme of ‘21st Century Democracy: Opportunities and Threats’, she said it was “remarkable” that the voices of Northern Ireland politicians were not being heard on Brexit. She pointed out that the only Northern Ireland representatives in Westminster are the DUP who are pro-Brexit, even though the majority of people in the North voted for the UK to remain in the EU. She accused the DUP of willingly ensuring that Stormont institutions are kept suspended because it suits the party’s agenda at Westminster and she said Sinn Féin was playing into its hands with its abstentionist policy. “These MPs matter all the more because since that disastrous snap election that Theresa May called where she lost her majority, their numbers are currently keeping May’s government in power,” she said. “The collapse of power-sharing in Stormont, with no imminent sign of its return, further adds to the imbalance in Northern Ireland’s democratic voice.” She accused the Government of “megaphone diplomacy” in relation to the backstop agreement that followed in the aftermath of the December agreement between the EU and the UK. There it was agreed that Northern Ireland would retain regulatory alignment with the EU if no deal could be reached between the EU and the UK. She said it created unnecessary tensions in Anglo-Irish relations and among Unionists. Speaking on the same platform at the Parnell School, former Siptu president Jack O’Connor, who will be a Labour party candidate in the forthcoming general election, said he too believed the Government had oversold the backstop arrangement agreed last December. Mr O’Connor said in his experience of 42-years as a union leader, he had learned the dangers of overselling deals. “The more you hype what you have achieved in negotiation, the more difficult it is for the people you negotiate with. The more you jeopardise the potential for the next agreement,” he explained. “This was a time for a more mature approach.” Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Henry WillsThe Government and Fianna Fáil should agree one more budget than already envisaged if they extend the deal, the Fianna Fáil deputy leader has said. The initial deal underpinning the minority government effectively ends after the next budget in October, the third of the Fine Gael-Fianna Fáil agreement, with a review process to follow thereafter.If the deal is extended to take in another budget, the Government would likely continue in office until at least 2020. However, Dara Calleary warned Fine Gael it must be “honest” about where it has fallen down in areas like housing and health when the review begins.In an interview with The , Mr Calleary, a Mayo TD who is also head of policy development for Fianna Fáil, stressed he would not “make any prediction” on whether the review will lead to an extension to the current deal, insisting that Fine Gael must be open to criticism.However, he added: “I personally believe – and this hasn’t been discussed – if we are extending, it has to be for a measurable period. That there is a timeline during that period during which we can assess policy. There is no sense in having an extension for the sake of it. At the end of the day, you are talking about people’s lives.“If it is to be extended, and we haven’t even opened a discussion yet, I think certainly another budget. But we are a long way off that position yet.”Some in Fianna Fáil are opposed to any such extension, while others believe a short-term extension should be offered to get Ireland through the Brexit talks, and the official date of Britain’s withdrawal from the EU in March 2019.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar recently proposed that both parties agree the next election be held in summer 2020, which would mean another budget being introduced in October 2019. Mr Varadkar also wants the review to begin before the next budget.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has already said his party’s commitment to facilitating budgets includes the passage of associated legislation such as finance and social welfare Bills. This process usually takes a number of months, which would likely push an election into 2020.Mr Calleary insisted the review would be “robust” and would have to take in policy areas such Brexit, health and housing among other issues. His party will be pushing for a €100 million affordable housing scheme in the budget to add to previous Fianna Fáil policies such as the increased funding of the National Treatment Purchase Fund. Noting there were “a million outstanding patient appointments in health” and a housing crisis, Mr Calleary said Fine Gael had to enter the review with a very open mind. “They are very sensitive to criticism and they have to leave that sensitivity outside the room and take criticism on board because the criticism is meant to improve what is happening in people’s lives on the ground,” he said. “The criticism is meant to test the policies that they are implementing, to see why they haven’t been delivered and see if they can be changed to deliver. And that’s what the review is about. It is not a political drama.”"},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

We\u0027re also looking at Ruth Davidson\u0027s piece on taxing internet giants and what you think about calls for a relaunch of the Brexit campaign.See what your fellow readers had to say and then join in the conversation below. Simply scroll down to the comment section, log in to your  account (or register for free here) and share your views on the week\u0027s most contentious events.Boris Johnson branded housing “the single biggest and most urgent crisis we face”, on Monday and said that Theresa May must slash “absurdly high” stamp duty and abandon affordable housing targets to get Britain building. Most of our readers agreed that stamp duty isn\u0027t the main reason that affordable housing is unavailable to first-time buyers - some argued that it\u0027s about demand and supply, and others that houses are being bought up by people on better wages.\u0027Prices are so high because of increased demand and limited supply\u0027\u0027In the UK, since about 1960 or perhaps even before, buying a property was the conduit through which have-nots became haves. The present difficulty that people unable to access the so-called Bank of Mum and Dad have in buying property poses an existential threat to those of us lucky enough to own our own homes. Unless something drastic is done we will become a shrinking group whose interests will matter less and less.\u0027Stamp duty has definitely curtailed activity in the million plus market but it is not the principal problem.\u0027Prices are so high because of increased demand and limited supply.\u0027We need a massive increase in the supply of low cost housing which means first, relaxing planning restrictions, second, some building on the green belt, third, much more innovative building methods - factory built for instance, fourth, tax incentives to diminish the incentives to horde land and fifth to make it worth the while of developers to build low cost housing.\u0027\u0027Little houses that used to go to first-time buyers are being sold to rich city-dwellers\u0027\u0027There are two other issues that are having a big effect on house pricing and availability. One is the lack of anywhere to invest money at a decent rate of interest. This means that older house owners are reluctant to trade down from houses that are too big because they have nowhere to put the money freed up where it will be protected from inflation.\u0027The second is the growing tendency for the better-off to own more than one home. I live in a tourist area and, over the years, I\u0027ve seen the number of second homes rocket and the little houses that used to go to first-time buyers being sold to rich city-dwellers. As a result, many houses stand empty for a large part of the year while young people dependent on local low wages struggle to find anywhere they can afford to live. \u0027 Ruth Davidson argued in her comment piece this week that there must be a level playing field between large internet giants and small shops in the UK when it comes to tax. She discusses how countries can ensure the big players play by the rules and exactly what rules should apply.This sparked a fierce debate among our readers, with some arguing that the problem is with our tax laws not the big internet giants, while others said that the high street is no longer a suitable alternative to online shopping.\u0027If there is a problem, it\u0027s with our tax laws\u0027\u0027Amazon pays its due taxes. If there is a problem, it\u0027s with our tax laws.\u0027I am a fan of Amazon. As well as appreciating its vast range of goods and low prices, I like that it has enabled me to self-publish and sell a lot of my books. I also sell items I make on Amazon Handmade, a new venture that gives a selling venue to many small businesses.\u0027A worker prepares packages for delivery at an Amazon warehouse in Brieselang, Germany\u0027The high street is no longer the desirable outlet for merchandise\u0027\u0027There may well be a case for Amazon to pay more tax. But this should not be linked to subsidising the High Street. That is a separate matter. The high street is no longer the desirable outlet for merchandise it once was and property values and business rates need to reflect this by dropping substantially. Or another use must be found for them. It\u0027s called market forces and I am surprised to hear Ruth Davidson talking like a 1970s Tory happy to prop up inefficient industries.\u0027Even if online outlets were taxed substantially more I suspect increased prices would not stop people shopping online. It\u0027s a fundamental shift in behavior driven as much by convenience as cost.\u0027Embrace the success of online shopping and allow our towns and cities to evolve from essentially a Victorian model to something more relevant to the twenty first century. Subsidies have no role to play. You can\u0027t buck the market.\u0027The ’s chief Brexit correspondent Asa Bennett wrote in his comment piece this week that German chancellor Angela Merkel is keen for a Brexit deal but is pushing for one that could meet her own needs.Mrs Merkel’s influence within the EU has made her a key name within Brexit discussions, which could leave some to speculate that her own interests persist over that of the UK and the EU.Readers have noted that every country involved would certainly be expected to prioritise their own needs and that perhaps the UK cannot afford to look any further than themselves when explaining slow negotiations.\u0027Slow negotiations still stem from the UK’s own need to prioritise\u0027\u0027With so many parties, each with their own vested interests, involved in the negotiations and behind closed door discussions, as well as the EU’s concerns around avoiding exits in other member states, it will be a miracle if the UK can secure a deal that will work for all.\u0027German Chancellor Angela Merkel arrives for an EU summit at the Europa building in Brussels on Thursday, Dec 14, 2017 \u0027No other country agrees with Britain\u0027s demands\u0027\u0027So Merkel wants it on her terms? 26 other countries agree with Barnier\u0027s negotiating strategy and haven\u0027t contested a comma. No other country agrees with Britain\u0027s demands. So who exactly is trying to impose on Europe something that they don\u0027t want?\u0027It was reported on Thursday that despite ‘tougher’ A-level exams, grades are at a six year high with 26.4pc of students awarded either an A* or an A.The report has found that just 55pc can secure an A grade in the new OCR Advanced Biology A-level, while 66pc can achieve an A in the reformed Mathematics A-level.Some  readers have suggested that top marks in A-level exams are now far too easy to achieve, while others have noted that new grade boundaries reflect tougher exams. \u0027This is absurd. How can the top grades be awarded even if the candidate only gets 55pc?\u0027\u0027We have made no progress in lifting standards or reducing grade inflation. With more lenient marking and only 55pc required to gain a A grade we are still making students feel everybody is a winner. This is absurd. How can the top grades be awarded even if the candidate only gets 55pc? You had to score over 70pc 50 years ago to get an A grade at A level and 75pc for GCSE O levels - less than 5pc of students gained a grade A.\u0027\u0027Many critics would struggle if tested with a current dumb exam paper\u0027\u0027Many of us are too ready to criticise the education system because we forget that our own knowledge was mainly gained after school, in the world of work. I recall that the best bit of going to school in the 1950s and 1960s was leaving, unless you were one of the tiny handful who were encouraged to stay on for O and A levels - this was only in Grammar Schools and by invitation only.\u0027Many critics would struggle if tested with a current dumb exam paper, but I would guess that it has always been the case.\u0027The reason the pass mark for the Biology A-level was lowered is because it was an extremely hard paper with some ridiculous nonsensical questions, not seen before in past papers with many students walking out of the exam hall in tears and I have that on good authority.The answers to A-level questions these days have to be so convoluted its absurd, there is no definitive right or wrong. There is no comparison between generations or indeed within generations as the goal posts are continually being moved. The students who received their grades yesterday and scored highly did so because they grafted throughout, likewise with university students of today, you can no longer party your way through uni and cram at the last minute to get a good grade. I’ve been there, seen it and done it and as a parent of three children I’m currently there, seeing it and have done it!Richard Tice and John Longworth, co-founders of Leave Means Leave, have labelled the next six months as \u0027a battle for Britain\u0027. Mr Tice and Mr Longworth have noted \u0027public anger is palpable\u0027 due to the way that Brexit negotiations have unfolded and have lamented that their new campaign will look to  \u0027take our campaign to the people.\u0027While some of readers have expressed support for the campaign, others simply do not feel it will be worth the cost. \u0027Very little chance of seeing any return\u0027\u0027Giving money to the save Brexit campaign is like betting on the national lottery: very little chance of seeing any return.\u0027We were always told that Brexit would make us poorer, and some Brexiteers have already started that process. They are poorer as soon as they make a donation.\u0027\u0027It will be very similar to what we have\u0027\u0027Battle for Britain? Whatever Brexit comes, it will be very similar to what we have now after a few years. That\u0027s the geopolitical, economic, cultural reality.\u0027\u0027I\u0027m ready to do my bit\u0027\u0027Thank goodness.  It should never have been left this late to fight-back.\u0027I\u0027m ready to do my bit.\u0027To join the conversation in the comment section below, log in to your  account (or register for free here).Please review our commenting policyFormer LabourMP suspended after \u0026#39losing respect for Jewish community\u0026#39s historic suffering\u0026#39Comment: Leave means leave, so stop being sentimental and get on with BrexitCinema chain under fire for \u0026#39charging double\u0026#39 Watch: Imran Khan sworn in as prime minister of PakistanFormer UN secretary-general Kofi Annan dead at 80Italy holds state funeral for victims of Genoa bridge disasterThe Royal Family are \u0026#39like Scientologists\u0026#39 because of their \u0026#39cult-like secrecy\u0026#39 says Thomas MarkleCrackdown on wood-burning stoves and open fires may lead to a \u0026#39black market\u0026#39Police condemn public for cheering escaping man who injured policeComment: For the first time in years, Brexit has given people hope.

The Office for Students are closely monitoring the number being issued and we fully expect them as the regulator to take appropriate action.Speaking to The Independent\u0026nbspabout unconditional offers ahead of results day, Michael Barber, chair of the Office for Students, said: “Some universities seem to be lowering the tariff because they are worried about not recruiting enough students.“I think the sector\u0026nbspneeds to think about this very hard.”A-level results 2018 – in picturesStudents celebrate their A Level results from Ark Academy in WembleyCharlie Jenner, Nathan Sharp and

courses was down 1 per cent compared with the same point in 2017.However the proportion of 18-year-olds being accepted on to courses broke records.In an exclusive interview with The Independent earlier this year, Ucas boss Clare Marchant called for an urgent rethink on universities using unconditional offers across-the-board.Universities minister Sam Gyimah has previously branded the rise in unconditional offers as irresponsible and has warned that the practice could undermine the credibility of the system.And on Thursday, Mr Hinds said he was “concerned” about the rate of growth in these offers.Department for EducationEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you

one another with regularity’Click to followThe Independent OnlineThe book centres on the samurai game 100 candles, where each storyteller must spin a tale to surviveThe kitchen is always a potential crime scene. A kitchen contains any number of lethal weapons. Knives, skewers, frying pans, chopping boards. Generally only deployed to inflict pain on radishes, cucumbers, and dead animals. But the possibility, the likelihood, of violence is there.Which is a fact that the late Anthony Bourdain – star of Parts Unknown, but who rejected the label of “celebrity chef” – has exploited in a now posthumous graphic novel, Hungry Ghosts, and a previous bestseller, Get Jiro!Bourdain’s long-time collaborator, Joel Rose, discovered (and was discovered by)\u0026nbspBourdain in the 1980s. Rose, noir novelist and author of Kill Kill Faster Faster, was then founder and editor of a magazine that captured the zeitgeist – and has since been acquired by museums like the Guggenheim, the Museum of Modern Art, and the Whitney – Between C and D.The C and D in question were the Avenues C and D on the East Side of New York, in between which Rose lived. “Back in 1982,” Rose recalls when I visit\u0026nbsphim in New York, “I had a book contract and I bought a computer to do the job.” It had a dot matrix printer attached, an Epson QX-10, running a Valdocs program.\u0026nbsp“When it printed out the clatter of it\u0026nbspmade me think of Gutenberg, sort of historic, but revolutionary.” Rose realised that he could print a magazine in this way if he could find writers to fill the continuous sheet, folded over upon itself, with holes down each side. “I drew on the cover myself, put it in a plastic bag the way the drug dealers did with dope, and left copies at a few book stores, St Mark’s and East Side Books.” Miraculously, the new format magazine was an overnight hit.Copies sold out. Epson donated more printers and they had five or six printers going day and night and they still couldn’t keep up. Artists and writers rushed to contribute. Including one young wannabe, Anthony Bourdain, who submitted\u0026nbsp20 pages of a comic book that he had written and drawn.Bourdain first showed Rose his work, he said: ‘The drawing sucked but the writing was good’ (Hungry Ghosts)“I liked his writing,” Rose says. “I wrote back to him and told him the drawing sucked but the writing was good.” A week later, the apartment buzzer goes, and a tall good-looking guy with dark hair is standing at the door, in his chef whites. It’s Bourdain. He’s turned up in person. “We were friends from that time on,” says Rose. “He used to say I was the only real writer he knew.”Bourdain’s first ever published story appeared in Between C and D in 1985, in the volume 2, no 1 issue. Bourdain didn’t like to call himself a chef, he preferred to say cook. Chef was too hifalutin. Bourdain and Rose had a lot in common. They had both started out at the bottom as dishwashers.Good food, good eating, is all about blood and organs, cruelty and decayRose’s father had been a waiter and Bourdain\u0026nbsphad worked as a waiter himself, as well as a busboy, so he’d lived and worked in restaurants around New York. Bourdain grew up in New Jersey, his mother worked at The New York Times and his father was a music executive, but he developed a passion for cooking after eating an oyster on a French fishing boat, studied at the Culinary Institute of America, and rose through the ranks to become head chef at the Brasserie Les Halles, a French-style restaurant in the financial district, serving up escargots, foie gras and steak tartare.But at the same time, he always wanted to be a writer. While working as a chef by night, he wrote by day and published a couple of mysteries, Gone Bamboo and Bone in The Throat. “But he was still unsure of himself, he wasn’t confident about his writing,” says Rose.Anthony Bourdain: Celebrity chef in picturesAnthony Bourdain with Nigella Lawson and Ludo Lefebvre in Channel 4\u0027s \u0027The Taste\u0027Anthony Bourdain winning Outstanding Informational Series Or Special at the 2016 Creative Arts Emmy AwardsBourdain\u0027s no-holds-barred account of life in American kitchens is both a memoir and an insider\u0027s guide to the tricks of the trade.58 Chefs Anthony Bourdain (L) and Mario Batali take a selfieChefs Anthony Bourdain (L) and Mario Batali take a selfieBourdain and Danny Bowien at \u0027The Mind Of A Chef\u0027 Premiere Launch Party88 Anthony Bourdain and Joel Rose return for the follow up to their bestseller Get Jiro!

Anthony Bourdain, and Joel Rose (Kill The Poor) return for the follow-up to their #1 New York Times bestseller Get Jiro! Then, in 1998, Les Halles sent him to Tokyo to open a Japanese branch. He would send Rose regular emails about his adventures in Japan. There was one in which he described his visit to a local fish market. “It was so good I printed it out and took it in to show Karen.”Karen Rinaldi, an editor at Bloomsbury, was Joel’s wife. She happened to be breastfeeding their first child, Rocco, at the time. She had her hands full. “So I read it out to her,” says Rose.\u0026nbspShe looked\u0026nbspup and said:\u0026nbsp“Does he have any other stories like that?”“Loads,” he said.She put\u0026nbspthe kid down and picked up the phone and called\u0026nbspBourdain’s agent and straight off made an offer on the book. “What book?” said the agent. Because it didn’t\u0026nbspyet exist. She just bet\u0026nbspthat it will. It was a good guess.That book became Kitchen Confidential:\u0026nbspAdventures in the Culinary Underbelly, published in 2000, combining memoir and an insider’s exposé of the cons, vices and sins of the New York restaurant scene, hymning “the dreamers, the crackpots, the refugees and the sociopaths” of the kitchen.Bourdain was outspoken about his drug use. He had acquired a heroin and cocaine habit and he said he needed it to survive the rigours and stresses of his trade. He was funny, but in a raw, wounded, vulnerable kind of way. The book became a huge hit. The core of it was published as an essay in The New Yorker, called Don’t Eat Before Reading This. This is how it begins:\u0026nbsp“Good food, good eating, is all about blood and organs, cruelty and decay. It’s about sodium-loaded pork fat, stinky triple-cream cheeses, the tender thymus glands and distended livers of young animals. It’s about danger – risking the dark, bacterial forces of beef, chicken, cheese, and shellfish.”Bourdain’s sense of violence in the kitchen (Hungry Ghosts)Bourdain does not bother to conceal the dark side of haute cuisine and speaks of “humiliation, injury, fatigue, and the threat of illness”. He adds:\u0026nbsp“Gastronomy is the science of pain.” Little wonder then that “there is a powerful strain of criminality in the industry”. According to Bourdain the leading civilian occupation of prison inmates in the US, before they were locked up, was cook.Thinking that the life-giving side of food had to be balanced by death, he was always a carnivore to his bones and reserved a corner in hell for vegetarians: “Serious cooks regard these members of the dining public – and their Hezbollah-like splinter faction, the vegans – as enemies of everything that’s good and decent in the human spirit.“To live life without veal or chicken stock, fish cheeks, sausages, cheese, or organ meats is treasonous.” He liked to squirt blood into his mouth from a spicy boudin noir. He praised ribs, hooves, organs, tripe, trotters. Bourdain liked the element of risk in food. In one of his shows in far-flung parts he sampled cobra heart and soft-boiled duck embryo. He was even an outspoken fan of cream and butter.The essay and the book changed his life forever. His writing took him out of the kitchen and put him on the road. “What if I go to the places I love – Vietnam for example, or Morocco – and write about the cooking there?” he suggested to Rinaldi. Thus were born the subsequent A Cook’s Tour: In Search of the Perfect Meal and its sequel, A Cook’s Tour: Global Adventures in Extreme Cuisines. At a certain point a production company called him up and asked if they could tag along and film his journey. His charm and honesty and, to a degree, his profanity, made the shows as big a success as the books.“He married his high school sweetheart,” says Rose. “But she couldn’t understand what he was doing, ultimately couldn’t stand it.” His second marriage was to Ottavia Busia, the hostess of a French restaurant, Le Bernardin, where they were introduced by the chef, Eric Ripert, whom Rose describes as Bourdain’s “idol”. Together they had a daughter, Ariane, now aged 11.Bourdain had started with a comic book and he’d always wanted to do a graphic novel. One Thanksgiving he went over to Joel Rose’s place, cornered him, and announced:\u0026nbsp“I’ve got a great idea.” The idea for Get Jiro! came from Bourdain’s sense of violence in the kitchen. He wrote that, “Since we work in close quarters, and so many blunt and sharp objects are at hand, you’d think that cooks would kill one another with regularity.” In Get Jiro! – and the prequel Blood and Sushi – they do.Serious cooks regard these members of the dining public – and their Hezbollah-like splinter faction, the vegans – as enemies of everything that’s good and decent in the human spiritA Japanese chef – a dab hand with sushi and knives – comes to a near-future LA and is caught in the middle of a culinary war. Bourdain and Rose worked up a few pages and sent it to an editor at DC Comics. It turned into a New York Times\u0026nbspno\u0026nbsp1 bestseller. “It outsold Superman,” Rose says.Hungry Ghosts is based on a samurai tradition, going back to the Edo period, of telling tales in the night frightening enough to put fear into the hearts of warriors. A hundred candles would be lit but with each tale another candle would be snuffed out and so the stories became progressively darker. “We just changed samurai to chefs,” says Rose.The book is a thing of beauty, but the stories are filled with images of death and destruction. Knives and axes feature prominently. Decapitation and amputation abound. Eating but also being eaten. These are horror stories with recipes.Bourdain was most famous for his ‘Parts Unkown’ series, but he rejected the label of celebrity chef (Alamy)When he hanged himself in a hotel room in northeast France, aged 61, Bourdain was on location, filming a new episode of Parts Unknown. His friends were shocked and mystified. “I thought he was happy,” says Rose. “He was happy. He told the film director how happy he was to be working on the comics. He carved out the perfect life for himself.” But he also had a long habit of referring to suicide and depression.Perhaps, as some have suggested, Bourdain was simply exhausted by a gruelling schedule. Rose suggests that he may have been too self-critical, set himself impossible standards. “He valued integrity so high. Maybe too high.”These were Anthony Bourdain\u0027s three tips to making the perfect burgerAnthony Bourdain death: No narcotics found in system when he diedAnthony Bourdain\u0027s former New York City apartment for rent for £11,000Anthony Bourdain reveals how he pictured Harvey Weinstein\u0027s deathAnthony Bourdain leaves fortune to 11-year-old daughterFor all his worldly success, Anthony Bourdain always thought of himself as an outsider. It’s why he spent so much of his time on the road, always looking for a home he could never find. He wrote:\u0026nbsp“In America, the professional kitchen is the last refuge of the misfit.” Even in the spotlight, he felt isolated. He once described his lifestyle as “crushingly lonely”.One thing that emerges from his books and television shows is that, as Rose puts it, “He always made sure to be nice to people”. But in the end there were “so many people” that needed him, were dependent on him. He was drained by it all. It may be the fate of the most popular cook to feel as though he is being eaten up by others. Carved up and served on a plate. Not for vegetarians. In the story, Bourdain and Rose imagine the Snow Woman,\u0026nbspa ghostly figure who is capable of sucking the life right out of you: “her kiss is like that of the vampire”. Another story features the Jikiniki who are “devourers of human flesh”. Bourdain was self-deprecating enough to feel he didn’t deserve his success. He once said:\u0026nbsp“I should’ve died in my twenties. I became successful in my forties. I became a dad in my fifties. I feel like I’ve stolen a car – a really nice car – and I keep looking in the rearview mirror for the flashing lights – but there’s been nothing yet.” Joel Rose, in a metaphor which Bourdain would have appreciated, said: “He thought he was like the rat who stole the cheese off the table.”‘Hungry Ghosts’ (Dark Horse Comics, £12.50) is out 2 OctoberEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/14/16/madonna-career-21.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-6463721  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt= 1984  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/14/16/madonna-career-21.jpg","title":"madonna 60 pop stars middle age patti smith kate bush","story":"Created with Sketch.In most\u0026nbspprofessions,\u0026nbspwomen of a certain age are invisible.

She has adopted four Malawian children and was in the country to celebrate the first anniversary of the Mercy James Centre for Pediatric Surgery and Intensive Care, named after one of her adopted daughtersMadonna and Jean Paul Gaultier arrive for the 2018 Met Gala But there is one area where the older woman is suddenly and somewhat unexpectedly thriving – rock music. Madonna celebrates her 60th birthday on Saturday. Kate Bush has just celebrated hers. In fact, they are the spring chickens. Suzi Quatro, 68, and Patti Smith, 71, are not just still rocking, they are still snarling. Cher at 72 pops up with a delightful cameo in the Mamma Mia!\u0026nbspmovie. The queen of soul, Aretha Franklin, is still recording at 76.\u0026nbspWho’d have thought it? Look back to the 1960s and there were precious few women at all in pop music, let alone older ones. In the UK, Sandie Shaw, Dusty Springfield, Marianne Faithfull and a handful of others carried the fight to the mass of male groups (the word boyband had yet to be invented).No one thought then about whether the stars would still be recording and performing in old age. Indeed the concept was unthinkable – for men as well as women, for stars as well as fans. When I put it to Paul McCartney that he must be surprised to be still going, he replied: “I do rub my eyes. I didn’t foresee it. In The Beatles we always said 10 years. But it kept on and kept on and it kept being good and we seemed to be the people who could do it. Now there is a great young generation of people who can also do it, but it tends to be that the people packing them in are the people who have the material, have hits, songs people know, and I think that’s important. I think they have stagecraft, they have an ability with an audience.”There’s no doubting that the likes of Madonna and Kate Bush have stagecraft in spades. Even in an industry that ostensibly prizes youthfulness and a certain amount of athleticism on stage, the female superstars, like the male, are now gliding into pensionable age, with fan bases, voices, charisma and downright sexiness still intact.\u0026nbspThough, when it comes to longevity, the women themselves didn’t always think it would be the case. Joni Mitchell once remarked, all too despondently: “Record companies want the look. And if you’re over 50, however well preserved, you just don’t have the look.”Maybe the look, or audience perception of the look, has changed. No one remotely cared that Kate Bush looked older than they remembered her (quelle surprise) when she made her stage comeback after 35 years in 2014. And tickets were inevitably like gold dust. I was there to note that she sounded the same, and she still exuded charisma and stage presence.She did a staggering run of 22 performances. Two things perhaps attested to the more mature Kate. The show was only part rock concert, it was also part theatre with video and dance, and even the odd comedy sketch starring her son. Also, she gave all her audiences an instruction on her website, which bore witness to the fact that she comes from an earlier generation than today’s performers. She wrote: “I very much want to have contact with you as an audience, not with iPhones, iPads or cameras.”Suzi, 68,\u0026nbspsays she\u0027ll \u0027retire when I go on stage, shake my ass and there is\u0026nbspsilence\u0027 (Getty)\u0026nbspEarlier this year I witnessed the return to live performance of Annie Lennox, at the age of 63. To raise funds for her charity she did a one-off show which was largely a chat show, interspersed with the odd song at the piano, going through her life and career. The self-deprecating humour was erting: “When I was studying at the Royal Academy of Music, I lived on £3 a week.” Pause. “Scottish people can do that.” Pause. “And we like it.”Perhaps she had stumbled across the format for the older star, a chat show setting interspersed with the odd song. Except, at the end that she knocked everyone there for six with a breathtaking 30 minute performance of Eurythmics and solo hits that showed she retained all her talent. She was the epitome of soul as she belted out Eurythmics anthems, sometimes crawling sensuously across the floor as she did so. The only surprise was that she had (lamentably) eschewed live performance for 10 years.For some female legends, the routine can be tiring. I was at Marianne Faithfull’s most recent London appearance, an intimate show at Ronnie Scott’s jazz club. Plagued by a variety of physical problems over the years, she had a walking stick and performed most of the show sitting down. It was nevertheless a beguiling evening. But notably at one point she actually pleaded with her fans to allow her to retire. “Please let me go,” she said, “I can’t go on for ever. I’m not Keith,” referring to her long-time friend Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones, definitely not one of life’s quitters.Madonna, too, is not one of life’s quitters. Her fitness routine keeps her more than show-ready, even for a show as heavy on breathless choreography as hers. But I think there is another clue to her longevity in what she said to the audience at one of her shows that I attended 15 years ago. Just before her final encore, she said in idiosyncratic style: “When I was a girl I always thought ‘grown-ups can f**k off’. But now I’m 45 years old, I have children of my own, and you know what, grown-ups can still f**k off!”As I say, it was a piece of philosophy delivered in her personal style. But it perhaps partly explains her longevity and continuing appeal. She retains the anarchic spirit she had when she burst on the scene. Female rock stars, just like their male counterparts, and possibly more so, have no intention of growing old gracefully. They haven’t just retained their vocal prowess and stage presence, they have retained the hint of adolescent rebelliousness that has always been an intrinsic part of rock’s appeal. And having met both Madonna and Suzi Quatro, I can attest that in both cases the aggressive, in yer face attitude is not just a stage technique.But rock-star rebelliousness is not the only reason that rock and pop’s biggest female stars go on and on or come back after long absences. Kate Bush was never keen on playing live and before her comeback had only done one tour of the country. But she was persuaded to perform again by her teenage son. As she had a song on one album about watching his clothes go round and round in the washing machine, it was clear that a request from him would, fortunately, carry weight.Victoria Beckham is, of course, far from the vintage of Bush, Madonna and the other older stars. But when the Spice Girls had their reunion tour, it’s interesting that she said the key reason she wanted to do it was that her children had seen Dad play football and knew all about his skills. Now was a chance for them “to see what Mummy did” before they were born.Performing for a global audience is important. But performing for the family clearly also is a factor in keeping the career going.Jonathan Morrish, a long-time senior executive at Sony record company, and now a music industry PR consultant, says: “Women generally live longer than men, so it should come as no surprise that so many as they get older seem to flourish creatively with their music and on stage. None of this is easy. I know from the many artists that I have worked with you need tenacity. So perhaps it’s the staying power they had to show at the beginning of their careers, perhaps a savvy emotional intelligence –\u0026nbspwhatever it is, I admire and welcome it. And applaud them.”\u0026nbspAnd even for those female rock and pop stars who have decided to call it a day, a new avenue has opened up: the stage musical. Right now in London, audiences can see Tina Turner on stage at one theatre, and The Supremes and all the other Motown stars at another. Or at least, one can enjoy their music and life stories, delivered by lookalikes and sound-alikes. It’s possible not just to go on into old age, but literally forever.Faithfull pleaded with a crowd at Ronnie Scotts: \u0027Please let me go. I\u0026nbspcan’t go on for ever. I’m not Keith\u0027 (Alamy)Meanwhile, there is a core of\u0026nbsp 60- and 70- something female rock stars, who thankfully show no signs of even thinking about stopping and relying on musicals to seal their immortality.No one puts it better than Suzi Quatro, celebrating 54 years in the business, who states: “I will retire when I go on stage, shake my ass and there is silence.”David Lister is the former arts editor of The IndependentEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/17/16/waterworlds.jpg","title":"waterworlds common discovery alien life proof rocky exoplanets nasa","story":"Created with Sketch.Scientists expect to find much more about the strange worlds in the coming yearsClick to followThe Independent OnlineWatery worlds could be common throughout the universe, scientists have said in a discovery that could have major effects on the search for life elsewhere in the universe.Planets covered in large amounts of water could be far more common than we\u0027d previously realised, according to the new study.

By comparison, the Earth is only 0.02 per cent water by weight.It was a huge surprise to realise that there must be so many water-worlds, said lead researcher Dr Li Zeng from Harvard University.The worlds themselves might have water, and might even have life. But that doesn\u0027t mean they look anything like our home planet, or even a watery version of it.This is water, but not as commonly found here on Earth, said Li Zeng. Their surface temperature is expected to be in the 200 to 500 degree Celsius range. Their surface may be shrouded in a water-vapor-dominated atmosphere, with a liquid water layer underneath.Moving deeper, one would expect to find this water transforms into high-pressure ices before we reaching the solid rocky core. The beauty of the model is that it explains just how composition relates to the known facts about these planets.Previous studies have found that many of the 4,000 confirmed or potential exoplanets fall into one of two sizes: those that are about 1.5 times the radius of the Earth, and others that are roughly 2.5 times the size of our planet.The new research looks to explore how those planets might be structured on the inside. It found that the smaller of the planets tend to be rocky – but the bigger ones are probably water worlds, according to the researchers.Scientists expect to find more of those planets – and therefore more water worlds – in the coming years. Leading that search will be Nasa\u0027s TESS mission which will look out for more of the exoplanets, and the James Webb Space Telescope which is due to launch in 2021 and will analyse the atmosphere of those worlds.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"subscribe to the daily edition our newspaper for your tablet","story":"For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript...Please follow the instructions in the link below.Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience."},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/01/21/russian-ship-chase.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/01/21/russian-ship-chase.jpg","title":"hms queen elizabeth porsmouth us donald trmp royal navy ship","story":"Created with Sketch.Warship\u0026nbspwill first dock in New York and\u0026nbsptrial landing F-35B fast jets on deck for the first timeClick to followThe Independent OnlineHMS Queen Elizabeth leaves Portsmouth for historic US trip, amid rumours of potential Trump visit“Having the aircraft carriers maintains our credibility, without the aircraft carriers it would dilute it. Not to have an aircraft carrier at sea, to denude yourself of them, would be a folly,” declared Captain Jerry Kyd.“We remain an island nation with obligations. For national security reasons it is essential\u0026nbspwe have to maintain a strong capability.”The commanding officer of HMS Queen Elizabeth was speaking on the bridge of the aircraft carrier as she prepared to depart from Portsmouth for America\u0026nbspand trials to land F-35B fast jets on deck for the first time, the final crucial preparations as the 65,000 tonne ship comes into service.The carrier will dock first in New York and there are rumours that Donald Trump will come on board, which may be consolation for him after the military parade he ordered was postponed by the Pentagon with costs climbing to $92m\u0026nbsp(£69.5m).Captain Kyd did not know whether the presidential visit will happen.\u0026nbsp“I wish he would,” he said before going on to\u0026nbsppoint out why, in his view, the Queen Elizabeth and her sister carrier HMS Prince of Wales were imperative for Britain in the face of Russian aggression, Chinese expansion and\u0026nbspthe unpredictability about North Korea’s nuclear programme.The Kremlin, he believes, is\u0026nbspthe most immediate threat. “Without these two ships I think we would be struggling to remain credible as a first-class sea power,”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspthe Captain said\u0026nbsp to a group of journalists.\u0026nbsp“The increase in Russian submarine activity has been frightening, it has been quite eye-watering what we have seen over the past two years.“We have seen a huge increase in Russian activity in the maritime area we need to respond to that.\u0026amppound650m Navy warship arrives in Portsmouth“When you see how active as Russia has been you have to recognise that they do not spend all that money and do all this activity just for a laugh.”But it is the money spent on the Queen Elizabeth and the Prince of Wales –\u0026nbsp£6.2bn – while the defence budget is being slashed across the board, which has led to fierce criticism, some of it coming from the military.For General Lord Richards, the former head of the Armed Forces the programme\u0026nbsp is having a “huge distorting effect” on the defence budget. “Now we have the carriers we have to make them work” he acknowledged, “but you make them work at the expense of the rest of the Navy, the RA, and the Army”.Lord Richards, who\u0026nbsphad been an opponent of the carrier programme when he was Chief of Defence Staff, rejects the notion that the two ships would project the UK back into being a major military power able to take part in far flung conflicts on, for example, the China Seas or off the Korean peninsula.“For Britain, with its Army of 78,000 and its Navy of 20 frigates and destroyers, to have the conceit to think it can fight a war in the Far East is almost laughable,” he said.\u0026nbsp“Our practical role should be confined to Nato, Africa and the Middle East. We lost all other capability not just in the recent cuts, but in the cuts in the early 90s, at the end of the Cold War.”Major General Jonathan Shaw, who was in charge of the SAS as Director of Special Forces, also points to the problem caused by cost of the carriers.“Most of the tasks they would perform can be done through cheaper alternative means. The cost has imbalanced the budget . The Army made its cuts two years ago, but it’s still suffering because of the carriers, it has also had a damaging effect on the Navy as well”, he stated.Some critics of the carriers can barely contain themselves in the vituperation of their disapproval.Max Hastings, the military historian and commentator wrote: “I have compared these boats to the ancient Egyptian pyramids: they have consumed immense resources while possessing almost zero utility.“At least the pyramids are amazing to look at I doubt in years to come a single tourist will visit Portsmouth to see the QE rotting at its moorings.\u0026nbspIf I sound intemperate, it is because many people who care passionately about Britain’s defences have been warning for years that the carriers would prove a disaster.”The criticism is refuted by the supporters of the carriers. Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said: “ HMS Queen Elizabeth is a true statement of our national power and the whole country can be proud to see this magnificent symbol of our engineering prowess and international ambition leaving port to sail onto the world stage.China launches its first home-built aircraft carrierWreck of Second World War aircraft carrier found after 76 yearsUS Navy aircraft carrier visits Vietnam in a warning to ChinaLeak discovered on new £3.1bn aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth“Her voyage to America not only shows her global reach, but strengthens our special relationship with the US Forces who have worked hand-in-hand on this iconic programme.”Commodore Andrew Betton, commander of UK Carrier Strike Group also wanted to stress the “iconic” nature of programme.“These first F-35B embarked trials in a UK aircraft carrier are not only key to future operational success but represent an iconic moment for the modern Royal Navy”, he said.“At the heart of our Maritime Task Group, the aircraft carrier is well protected and sustained, ready to operate around the world as a potent and exceptionally flexible instrument of our foreign policy.”As the media departed the Queen Elizabeth, Captain Kyd warned: “No negative stories please, otherwise we’ll come and bomb you!”There will probably be no need for that but a ceasefire from the critics of the carrier programme remains unlikely in the near future.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/28/10/mi6.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/28/10/mi6.jpg","title":"final say brexit referendum steel union peoples vote eu uk petition","story":"Created with Sketch.Exclusive: Major union joins the campaign as The Independent also teams up with People\u0027s Vote\u0026nbspfor mass march in LondonClick to followIndy PoliticsBritish steelworkers join The Independent\u0027s campaign for a Final Say referendum on BrexitBritish steelworkers today throw their weight behind The Independent’s campaign for a Final Say referendum on Brexit. \u0026nbspThe Community union – representing some 30,000 workers in total – calls on Theresa May to “do the right thing” and allow the British public to determine their own future.In a further significant development in the drive for a new referendum, The Independent and the People’s Vote campaign are joining forces for a mass march through central London later this year.The alliance will see the two organisations mobilise activists and media across the country to capture the growing tide of opinion that a further referendum on Brexit must be held.Polls show fast increasing support for the idea amid deepening Tory isions, doubts that Ms May can secure parliamentary backing for her plans and meagre public support for her approach.Relations between UK and EU negotiators have also descended into a new state of paranoia this week, with Brussels not denying reports that its officials believe they are being bugged by British spies.It is against this backdrop that Community general secretary Roy Rickhuss writes exclusively for The Independent, saying: “In June 2016, the British public gave our government a mandate to go and negotiate a withdrawal from the European Union.“Exactly what that looked like was unclear, but Theresa May told us she would go in and negotiate a deal that is in the best interests of British workers and their families.“It now seems that such a deal is unachievable or may not exist. That is why my trade union, Community, is backing\u0026nbspThe Independent’s Final Say\u0026nbspcampaign, to secure a people’s vote on the final deal.”Contribute to the march of a generationAt the last People’s Vote March in June, well over 100,000 people marched on parliament.Community’s roots are in textile manufacturing and the steel industry – pushed to the brink of collapse in recent years as much larger economies such as China distort international markets.In 2018 the industry has faced new pressure in particular from steel tariffs imposed by Donald Trump’s US administration, which Brexiteers are relying on for a favourable future trade deal.Community also supports prison and justice workers, logistics, finance, politics and public affairs staff, the charity and freelance sectors and is affiliated to the Labour\u0026nbspParty.Mr Rickhuss highlighted London School of Economics data concluding Brexit was already costing the average UK household more than £404 a year by June 2017.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline

“profoundly different to those presented in 2016”, branding the promise of £350m a week for the NHS “worthless” and the guarantee that European trade would not be harmed as “at best a mistake, and at worst a deliberate lie.”The general secretary added: “When Theresa May believes she has got the best outcome she can, then she must come back and allow us to decide if her best is\u0026nbspgood enough.When Theresa May believes she has got the best outcome she can, then she must come back and allow us to decide if her best is good enough.\u0026nbsp If that outcome is rejected, then all

away from asking our members to vote on important or difficult issues in the workplace our politicians must do the right thing and give the people a Final Say on their future.”The People’s Vote launched in April demanding a referendum on the deal agreed with the EU\u0026nbspand has a grassroots network of around 1 million people, holding rallies and action days across the country.The Independent launched its own Final Say campaign three weeks ago,\u0026nbspso far gathering 615,000 names to its petition along with a string of political endorsements.In June this year more than 100,000 people from all walks of life marched on parliament to demand their democratic voice be heard in a new Brexit referendum.But following the newly forged alliance, the People’s Vote and The Independent March for the Future, on Saturday 20 October\u0026nbspin London, is set to be much larger.Ireland is closer than ever to unification because of BrexitWhy hasn’t the NHS been prioritised in

gathering, with young people whose voices were not heard two years ago at its forefront, will constitute one of the most significant demonstrations in British history – just as Ms May returns from Brussels from a critical Brexit summit.Amatey Doku, vice-president of the 7\u0026nbspmillion-strong National Union of Students and a supporter of the For our Future’s Sake group that backs a new referendum, said: “This Tory government, unfortunately assisted by the Labour Party,\u0026nbspthreaten to harm young people’s futures.Rees-Mogg suggests a second Brexit referendum would be acceptable in clip from 2011“That’s why students across the country are coming together for the People’s Vote and The Independent March for the Future. Students and young people can no longer be ignored – and on 20 October, we won’t be.”The prime minister had once aimed to have a deal agreed with Europe earlier this summer, but with negotiations badly stalling and a major cabinet fallout, expectations turned to the October summit.British ministers privately admit it is now unlikely the UK will be able to agree a deal even by October, with a special summit potentially needed before Christmas – leaving just three months in the new year for the UK and the EU to ratify any agreement.It is also unclear if Ms May will be able to navigate any deal across her party’s deep isions, with the European Research Group of backbench Tory MPs drawing up alternative proposals highlighting the benefits of a no-deal Brexit.An exclusive poll carried out by BMG Research this week found that 48 per cent of the public would now back a vote on any deal struck between the UK and the EU – up from 44 per cent just four weeks ago.Just 24 per cent opposed the idea, down three points over the same period.

But if they can’t and we end up in this position, then we have to reopen the question of whether we go forward with Brexit at all. It is not too late to do that.”The government is preparing to publish a series of technical notes on preparations for a no-deal Brexit next week, something Lord Kerslake said is “too little, too late”.He went on: “A pause to reflect would certainly be necessary. I think that is a pretty high probability now.“But I think that pause would need to include – and I suspect this would be insisted on by the (European) Commission – some re-examination of the decision itself.”Mr Corbyn has refused to commit to a further referendum so far, but has also shied away from explicitly ruling one out in the future.The Independent has reported moves from grassroots groups to try and push the issue to a vote at this year’s party conference in Liverpool, with several shadow cabinet members said to be sympathetic.The co-chairman of the pro-Brexit Leave Means Leave campaign group, Richard Tice, said Lord Kerslake’s intervention aimed to prepare the country for a delay to Britain’s withdrawal.He said on the same programme: “What we have just heard from Lord Kerslake is part of the deliberate negativity from the civil service who are looking to soften people up in order to extend Article 50.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchIn a significant development in the drive for a new referendum,\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspand the\u0026nbspPeople’s Vote\u0026nbspcampaign are joining forces for\u0026nbspa mass march through central London\u0026nbspon October 20.The alliance will see the two organisations mobilise activists and media across the country to capture the growing tide of opinion that a further referendum on Brexit must be held.An exclusive poll carried out by BMG Research this week found that 48 per cent of the public would now back a vote on any deal struck between the UK and the EU – up from 44 per cent just four weeks ago.Just 24 per cent opposed the idea, down three points over the same period.

“security officials like Ali Hassan Salameh”, who was operations chief for Black September, the group behind the Munich attack which left 11 Israeli athletes dead.It then records how Bseiso was killed

None of this is easy to doClick to followThe Independent OnlineFrom cricketing legend to prime minister of Pakistan, the rise of Imran KhanAfter more than two decades of political campaigning, much of it spent in the political wilderness, Imran Khan has finally become Prime Minister of Pakistan. Along the way, as his ex-wife Jemima Khan\u0026nbspnoted on Twitter, he endured “humiliations, hurdles and sacrifices”. Now, the former cricket legend and philanthropist could become one of the most powerful civilian leaders the country has known.Older readers will of course be familiar with him. After playing cricket for Oxford while he studied politics, philosophy and economics at Keble College, Khan became one of the best known Pakistanis in Britain. He figured prominently in tabloids for his social life, was often spotted at exclusive private members clubs like Annabel’s and Tramp.\u0026nbspHe\u0026nbspbefriended Mick Jagger, Sting and Goldie Hawn while being on nodding terms with Prince Charles and other royals. He married Jemima Goldsmith, the journalist and filmmaker sister of Zac, and invited Princess Diana to Pakistan.For Pakistanis, Khan was one of the few people who did them proud. Winning the Cricket World Cup in 1992 was a rare moment when Pakistan distinguished itself internationally. Pakistanis had grown weary of being principally depicted as a Third World basket case beset by social problems where women, minorities and the poor were treated appallingly. At times when boorish and condescending English cricketers like Ian Botham described Pakistan as “a place to send your mother-in-law”, Khan confronted that racism publicly.Pakistanis craved a confident, good-looking spokesman and the former cricketer could play the part. It’s one of the reasons why many voted for him.“I believe Oxford educated Imran Khan can stand toe to toe with world leaders and make a strong case for Pakistan,” wrote Haroon, a Pakistani singer and one of many celebrities, including cricketers, singers and actors who backed him.\u0026nbspBut he was also supported by a bewildering array of people from religious conservative backgrounds, wealthy businessmen, grafters from the middle classes, taxi drivers and factory workers.Khan is many things to many people. Central to his appeal is that he has not been in power before. It was common to hear his supporters say: “We’ve tried the others”,\u0026nbspreferring to the parties of former prime ministers Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif, “let’s try him this time”.\u0026nbspFor people alarmed at endemic levels of corruption, Khan represents a rare, honest and financially “clean” leader valiantly battling against an entrenched venal order. For religious conservatives and nationalists, he soothes feelings of injured pride and rouses their spirits.There are people whose support he should be embarrassed by. Sara Taseer, a Singapore-based entrepreneur, declared herself appalled by the sight of poor Baluch women lining up to vote. “Love seeing this turnout of women,” she tweeted, “but then I think would I allow these ladies to make a decision even about what be cooking in my kitchen today? And these ladies will decide on the future of the nation. Scary thought.”And there are supporters he should stay clear of. Asad Umar, Khan’s finance minister to be, posted photos of himself courting the support of Fazlur Rehman Khalil, someone whose name is on a US\u0026nbspterror watchlist.Khan’s rhetoric is often studded with references to the plight of the poor and the ravages of the elite. “A country shouldn’t be measured by how its wealthiest live,” he said in his first speech after the election, “but by how its poorest people are treated.” Critics say that message is at odds with the composition of his party, which is dominated by some of the wealthiest people in Pakistani politics. Many of Khan’s candidates this time around were also drawn from conventional old parties or military regimes, undermining the claim that their election will herald a “new Pakistan”.There are contradictions people notice in Khan\u0027s own pronouncements. When I interviewed him for The Independent, he came across as thoughtful, polite, serious and even good-humoured. On the campaign trail, however, he was seen as boastful and arrogant – making crude jibes against his opponents, taunting voters who support his rivals as “donkeys”, and denouncing liberals as “bloodthirsty”. He has forcefully denounced terrorism, and yet has been accused of being soft on the Taliban. Khan was a critic of Pakistan’s blasphemy laws and has defended religious minorities, but more recently vowed to protect the laws and accused his opponents of being part of a foreign plot to undermine it.When I first came to Pakistan to report for The Independent, Khan was a fierce critic of General Pervez Musharraf’s military rule. I saw him on the streets supporting an independent judiciary, interviewed him the night before he was arrested for defying emergency rule, heard him speak out against attacks on the press, enforced disappearances, civilian casualties in military offensives, and covered his protests against CIA drone strikes. Those experiences do not easily reconcile with the image of him as a mere shill for the Pakistan army.As prime minister, Khan will want to be the most powerful leader in the country. That distinction has usually belonged to the head of the army, which has ruled the country directly for three decades and wielded its clout backstage for the rest. It will be interesting to see how he negotiates these structural tensions. Some of the areas of dispute between Khan and the army have faded: drone strikes are rare, military operations he opposed are a thing of the past, and the US-led, Pakistan-backed “war on terror” is all but over.So, how will Khan rule? As a crusader against corruption and champion of the poor, or as an angry demagogue? Will he strengthen Pakistan’s feeble civilian institutions or disappear into the shadows of the military? Can he unite all the different Pakistanis he appealed to this afternoon, or will he seek to deepen the dangerous political isions that this election has revealed? Will Pakistan pursue peace with its neighbours, or will old modes of chest-beating belligerence endure?Only time will tell. He has vowed to lift the country out of poverty to combat corruption – starting by hold himself and his own cabinet accountable he said he would educate the more than 25 million children out of school and he said he would protect the rights of minorities and women. None of this is easy to do. There are strong reasons to believe Khan won’t be able to. But it would be good to see him try.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/11/15/phnewclarkcityeyelevel.jpg  width= 1500  height= 846  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/11/15/phnewclarkcityeyelevel.jpg","title":"manila rubbish waves monsoon philippines city waste rubbish","story":"Created with Sketch.Footage shows tonnes of trash being swept back into coast-side streetsClick to followThe Independent OnlineWaves of rubbish crash into Manila after monsoon washes city garbage into seaMassive waves of rubbish have been filmed crashing into the shore of Manila in the Philippines after a storm burst the city’s rivers and washed several tonnes of dumped litter into the sea.Footage posted on social media shows residents and city workers struggling against a tide of debris made up of plastic, foam, clothing, deadwood and domestic waste.Trash can be seen completely carpeting the water as officials and volunteers attempt – fruitlessly – to clear it from the bay.Other clips show streams of garbage washed up in the capital city’s roads and side streets, following a seasonal monsoon.It was such a horrible scene,” said Matthew Doming, who shot some of the footage as his university club, the Bedan Environmental Philosophers Organisation, took part in the clean-up effort.In a statement posted with the video, Mr Doming, who attends the city’s San Beda University, added: “We\u0027re aware that we can\u0027t clean the entire Manila Bay in just one day and it may take years of countless effort. This also applies with other clean-up activities nationwide.

For many women and their partners, a miscarriage means the loss of a baby and the hopes and the dreams for that child,” she told The Independent.\u0026nbsp“It would give people the time out you need when you have been bereaved. It acknowledges a miscarriage is a significant event and this is even true for people who don’t take the leave.”She said the discussion the proposed bill had provoked\u0026nbspwas helping to reduce the taboo which surrounds miscarriages.\u0026nbspSome other countries have provisions for paid leave if a woman miscarries. Indian law instructs that women are eligible to six weeks’ leave if they miscarry a baby.

The samples, they wrote, had “no smell and only a dusty taste.”But even if the cheese Mr Greco tested isn’t the oldest ever found, the findings stand out for another reason: the application of a state-of-the-art protein analysis.“As I say to my students every year when I get to Egypt, someone has to go ahead and analyse these residues with modern capabilities,” said Mr Kindstedt, who added that he plans to use Mr Greco’s paper in his teachings this autumn. “This is a logical next step and I think you’re going to see a lot more of this.”In their analysis, Mr Greco and his colleagues found hundreds of peptides, or chains of amino acids. Most were human and represented skin and saliva contamination, but, crucially, nine were linked to bovine or ovine milk.Adventurous eaters be warned: The cheese may not be cursed, but the analysis found evidence of a bacteria that causes brucellosis, an infectious disease that can cause fevers, headaches, muscle pain and other symptoms that can reoccur or never go away at all.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/14/15/senator.jpg","title":"australian senator fraser anning final solution muslim immigration","story":"Created with Sketch.Crossbencher Fraser Anning widely condemned for his isive remarksClick to followIndy PoliticsAn Australian politician has provoked outrage after using the term “final solution” in an incendiary\u0026nbspspeech about immigration, in which he called for a plebiscite asking voters whether they want to stop\u0026nbspMuslims and those “from the third world” from entering the country.Queensland senator Fraser Anning’s provocative maiden speech called for an immigration program that favours “European Christian” values, claiming it would protect Australia from potential terror attacks.We as a nation are entitled to insist that those who are allowed to come here predominantly reflect the historic European-Christian composition of Australian society, the Katter’s Australian Party upper house MP said.Trump isn’t the only one whose immigration policy is doomed to failLaura Ingraham defends her immigration comments, disavows David DukeIf Trump got his way, Melania\u0027s parents would be illegal immigrantsMr Anning, who replaced Malcolm Roberts in the Senate back in June, called for “a plebiscite to allow the Australian people to decide whether they want wholesale non-English speaking immigrants from the third world, and particularly whether they want any Muslims”.“The majority of Muslims in Australia of working age do not work and exist on welfare. Muslims in New South Wales and Victoria are three times more likely than other groups to be convicted of crimes, he claimed.\u0026nbsp“We have black African Muslim gangs terrorising Melbourne, we have Isis-sympathising Muslims trying to go overseas to try and fight for Isis and while all Muslims are not terrorists, certainly all terrorists these days are Muslims.“So why would anyone want to bring more of them here?”He went on to state\u0026nbspthat\u0026nbspmigrates should learn the English language and embrace Australian values.“Ethnocultural ersity ... has been allowed to rise to dangerous levels in many suburbs, he said.In direct response, self-segregation, including white flight from poorer inner-urban areas, has become the norm.World news in picturesMuslim pilgrims walk out after the Friday prayer at the Grand mosque ahead of annual Haj pilgrimage in the holy city of Mecca, Saudi ArabiaA man wades through flooded water in Kochi, Kerala state, India.

Mr Longworth said: This is a massive fraud on the electorate which is being dressed up as the UK leaving.In actual fact, we\u0027ll be a vassal state of the EU if we sign up to the Chequers deal.

This is apparently down to the fact that we had to develop that stance as it is easier to keep our heads above the water.We are also covered in a layer of fat which keeps us warm from the cold water and like every other marine animal, we do not have hair.

Life on Mars could be found within THREE YEARS astrobiologist saysSince the discovery of the first exoplanet in 1992, scientists have concluded that many of the 4,000 confirmed or candidate exoplanets discovered so far fall can be ided into two categories: those with the planetary radius averaging around 1.5 that of the Earth, and those averaging around 2.5 times the radius of the Earth.Unveiled his exciting research, Dr Zeng pointed to findings which suggested the proportion of water on many exoplanets appeared to dwarf that of the Earth, where it makes up just 0.02 percent of the mass of the planet.He admitted: \u0026ldquoIt was a huge surprise to realise that there must be so many water-worlds.He and his colleagues analysed exoplanets with mass and radius measurements from the Gaia satellite in order to develop a model of their internal structure.Swathes of exoplanets are likely to contain vast amounts of water, the study suggests (Image: NASA)Scientists analysed data from the Kepler space telescope (Image: )This indicates that exoplanets which have a radius of about 1.5 times the size of the Earth, which are five times the mass of our own, tend to be rocky planets, while those with a radius 2.5 times the size of Earth, and 10 times the mass, are likely to be water worlds.Dr Zeng added: \u0026ldquoThis is water, but not as commonly found here on Earth.\u0026ldquoTheir surface temperature is expected to be in the 200 to 500 degree Celsius range.Their surface may be shrouded in a water-vapor-dominated atmosphere, with a liquid water layer underneath.

The next generation space telescope, the James Webb Space Telescope, will hopefully characterise the atmosphere of some of them.\u0026ldquoThis is an exciting time for those interested in these remote worlds.Professor Sara Seager, Professor of Planetary Science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and deputy science director of the recently-launched TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) mission, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos amazing to think that the enigmatic intermediate-size exoplanets could be water worlds with vast amounts of water.\u0026ldquoHopefully atmosphere observations in the future \u0026ndash of thick steam atmospheres \u0026ndash can support or refute the new findings.Earlier this month Dr Airapetian said the discovery of the Mars lake, coupled with a separate study suggesting fluctuations in the levels of methane in its atmosphere which could be caused by biological processes, were \u0026ldquoexciting.He added: I agree that within next 3-4 years we can witness new evidence from Mars that will excite us with the interesting and surprising possibilities of microbial life forming in harsh conditions of this planet.

The Local Government Association revealed 22,000 children are classed as severely obese when they leave primary school.Last night it said ministers should reverse the \u0026pound600million cut to councils\u0026rsquo public health funding, which is used to fi ght obesity. LGA spokeswoman Councillor Izzi Seccombe said: \u0026ldquoThese figures are a sad indictment of how we have collectively failed as a society to tackle childhood obesity, one of the biggest health challenges we face.Type 2 typically develops in adults over the age of 40, so it is extremely worrying that we are seeing more young people develop the condition.\u0026ldquoThe Government\u0026rsquos childhood obesity plan sets out bold ambitions to halve the number of obese children by 2030. But we need urgent action now. \u0026ldquoThese figures will only multiply if we delay.Diabetes costs the NHS more than \u0026pound10billion a year.There are three times the number of diabetes cases as all cancer cases.McDonald\u0026rsquos has been a key commercial partner of the Football Association for 15 years. (Image: )Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said: \u0026ldquoTheresa May\u0026rsquos recently published strategy is nowhere near as bold and ambitious as Councillor Seccombe would have you believe.It\u0026rsquos full of ambitions but contains little of the action that she demands. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos monstrous to consider but some of these children could be dead by the end of the decade. The Department of Health and Social Care said: \u0026ldquoWe know the damage obesity causes and are determined to halve childhood obesity by 2030.We have invested billions in public health services and have already removed the equivalent of 45 million kilograms of sugar from soft drinks every year.Our new childhood obesity plan will now get children exercising more in schools and reduce their exposure to sugary and fatty foods.

Yesterdays employment figures revealed that the proportion of young people unemployed (and not in full-time education) is now at a record low of 4.7% for our country - and far lower than for many other developed countries.It sends a significant message out about the drive and innovation of our young people, and the opportunities that our economy offers to them and their future.With our welfare changes this country can now be powered forward by this young generation.Since 2010, youth unemployment has fallen by over 45%, giving 130,000 more young people a job, and a future.Add the fact that wages are on the up and there are more than 829,000 vacancies nationwide, it’s clear that young people are entering the best jobs market in a decade.On average, the number of vacancies has increased by 4,280 each month over the last year, and those vacancies span from construction to technology.So when young people this week are deciding on their next steps, they can think big as there are plenty of opportunities out there for them, from a job with career progression, to taking up an apprenticeship.Look at Daisy, who turned down five university offers to work at global engineering firm JCB designing new equipment, and she didn’t have to go to university to get there.I’m forever being told, and intrinsically understand, that people want to study at different times in their lives, often inspired to do so when they see the practical benefits of their studies.That’s why so many people prefer, and do better, getting a job first and then studying for exams while they work.Even over the last few decades, how the world of education and work are linked has shifted dramatically. People no longer have one job for life, and lifelong learning is becoming more and more commonplace as people dip in and out of education.Many more people up-skill and retrain throughout their career – and this is how the future jobs market will remain vibrant and strong.And when I speak to employers up and down the country, from manufacturers to marketers, what they want are young people with the right attitude, prepared to work and learn. As they say, ‘if you’ve the will, we can give you the skill’.So when young people this week are deciding their next steps, the academic route isn’t the only option.You can now become a solicitor, an accountant or even a nuclear engineer through the apprenticeship route, earning as you learn and without the cost of going to University. Studying a Higher Apprenticeship gives an average wage boost of £150,000 over a working life.When I speak to young people around the country, I’m impressed with the confidence and self-assuredness with which they look to the future, and the range of options they consider beyond traditional routes.Im certainly no job snob. Life teaches you its not where you come from, its where you get to, and work is exactly the same.You can start anywhere and get to the top as Im repeatedly being told by our countrys top entrepreneurs.Top performers in their fields such as Debbie Moore, Jean-Christophe Novelli, Deborah Meaden and Jo Malone, did not go to university and are just a handful of the individuals who show that with drive and determination you can succeed by treading your own path.Its all about getting a break and taking the opportunities that come your way.So best of luck to everyone today, but whatever your results, there are many opportunities and pathways into a successful career.    Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We have debt distress.”Pohiva said with China debt becoming so prolific, it was no longer a problem to be dealt with individually. He added: “I think these small countries will eventually come together to find a way out.”China defended its lending practices, saying they were sincere and unselfish, and insisting it only lent to countries that could repay.Tonga is one among a list of South Pacific countries that have taken on debt in recent years.Sydney’s Lowy Institute think tank, which has closely monitored China’s activities in the Pacific, estimates Beijing has poured nearly £1.4billion into Pacific countries since 2006.Other big debtors include Papua New Guinea, which owes roughly £498million in development and aid debt, Fiji, which owes £496million, and Samoa, with debt of £181million."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000427153572.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"dr pimple popper removes tail from woman","story":"Taylor, 22, has had the lump, named “Lizzie the Lipoma” in between her bum cheeks since she was born but over time it grew bigger.A doctor removed the lump in 2016 but it eventually grew back.Desperate to remove the fatty deposit, which had destroyed her self-confidence, Taylor turned to Dr Pimple Popper.In the last episode of her new TV show Dr Sandra Lee sets to work trying to remove Taylor’s tail.She initially refused to operate due to how close the lipoma is to Taylor’s spinal cord – Dr Pimple Popper worried she could cause permanent nerve damage.“Theres two warning bells,” she said.“One is, why did this doctor remove this and then it came right back?“And then the other big thing for me is, a regular lipoma does not appear at birth.“You get that over time. There could be something else going on.”Dr Lee ordered an MRI scan, which shows there is a deposit of fat inside Taylors spinal cord.She offered to remove some of the bump to make it more aesthetically pleasing, but warned the procedure could disrupt Taylors spinal cord.“Even tugging on this lipoma in any way could potentially disrupt the growth within the spinal cord, and I dont want to do that in any way,” Dr Pimple Popper added.“By staying as superficial as possible Im able to shape this well and make sure it looks good without really disrupting it.”When the removal is complete, Dr Lee sews Taylor up with two to three times the normal amount of stitches to make sure the incision heals correctly.Afterwards Taylor revealed she has decided to see a neurosurgeon to see if its possible for her lipoma to be completely removed.“Im ecstatic about my results. Since my surgery with Dr Lee I feel more confident,” she said.“When I lost a part of Lizzie, there was a lot lifted off my shoulders.”A lipoma is a benign, fatty lump that grows under the skin.Theyre harmless and can usually be left alone if theyre small and painless.They are non-cancerous and are caused by an overgrowth of fat cells.Lipomas can grow anywhere on the body, but are most common on the shoulders, neck, chest, arms, back, bum and thighs.They grow very slowly and dont usually cause any problems.Lipomas dont usually need to be removed unless theyre causing problems, such as pain, or if theres uncertainty about whether its a lipoma.However it can be removed if it is large or is in an obvious place and is affecting your self-esteem.You should always see your GP if you develop a growth or swelling on your body."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000427246727.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"worlds oldest cheese found in egyptian tomb and its older than jesus","story":"The solidified whitish substance was found in an ancient jar and was made from a mixture of cow milk along that of a sheep or goat.In a study published this week, scientists say they have discovered that probably the most ancient archaeological solid residue of cheese ever found”.The cheese was buried in the 19th dynasty tomb of the Ptahmes, mayor of the ancient Egyptian city of Memphis.The sample was wrapped with a canvas into a broken jar, said lead author Enrico Greco, from Italys University of Catania, told the ABC.The archaeologists suspected it was a kind of food left for the owner of the tomb and they decided to ask for chemical analyses.There are several examples in mural paintings with barter scenes where cheese was represented and certainly it was used in the Egyptian medicine during the Ptolemaic period.But until now we were not sure whether it was really part of the daily life of the ancient Egyptians.The team are, however, not sure what the ancient cheese tasted like.We do not have much information on what the taste could be, we know it was made mostly from sheeps and goats milk, but for me its really hard to imagine a specific flavour, Dr Greco said.Im Italian, I love cheese and I know how much they can change in flavour and appearance even with very few differences in ingredients and process.The cheese sample was excavated at the Saqqara necropolis near Cairo between 2013 and 2014.The findings were published in the journal Analytical Chemistry this week.Scientists also found cheese contained bacteria potentially causing the deadly disease brucellosis, caught by eating unpasteurized dairy products.If confirmed, it would be the first biomolecular direct evidence of the diseases existence during the pharaonic period, according to the study."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT0004254419541.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"indonesia earthquake sumbawa latest news","story":"Tremors were felt in nearby Bali.Indonesias Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG) said in a tweet there was no tsunami risk.The latest quake is the fourth to hit the south east Asian country in recent weeks that have left at least 460 dead.A massive 6.9 quake initially struck the island of Lombok which was followed by one measuring 6.4 on July 29.The epicentre of todays quake was around 500km from the island of Lombok which is still reeling from the impact of two deadly tremors and dozens of aftershocks. The vast quake struck two miles south east of Loloan in the north east of the island, at a depth of around 19 miles.Then on August 9 a third, measuring 6.2, struck.The Indonesian government reports that more than 1,400 people were injured and more than 156,000 have been displaced.Thousands of people have been left homeless and are in desperate need of food, medical care and shelter.Celebs including Take That star Gary Barlow, model Chrissy Teigen and David and Victoria Beckham were among the thousands of tourists caught up in horror scenes on the idyllic Indonesian islands when the first quake hit."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000427250158.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"rare jumping spider uk first six feet","story":"The crafty creepy crawlie -

If youre doing a good job, if youre responsive to your members, then youre going to get reselected, arent you?If youre not, if youre railing against your leader, if you are disregarding your members, then members might take a different view.He added: It leads to a coup where the leader has got the biggest political mandate of any leader in this country, theres an attempt by the Westminster elites to kick him out.If people were concerned about the possibility of maybe losing their nomination through an open selection, it might just concentrate their minds a bit.The veteran leftist insisted the purpose of his democracy roadshow wasnt to campaign for deselections - but went on to name four of moderate MPs hed like to see gone.Mr Williamson said: Theres a few people I would like to see deselected - but its not up to me.I mean, if it was theyd be gone tomorrow, in fact theyd be gone yesterday. But its up to the members in each and every constituency.He continued: Im not suggesting theres going to be wholesale deselections - its not a deselection tour, contrary to what some people are saying about it or trying to characterise it as.Even though we are going to people like Chuka Umunnas seat, and Chris Leslies, and Neil Coyles, and Wes Streetings constituency.The four MPs named are all fierce critics of Mr Corbyn who have recently savaged his stance on Brexit.Mr Leslie, MP for Nottingham East, mocked Mr Williamson and suggested he was just trying to curry favour with the Labour leadership.He told The Sun: Chris should spend less time trying to get a job in the Shadow Cabinet and more time in his own Derby constituency where the Tories have been doing well in his absence.Mr Williamson quit as shadow fire minister in January after repeatedly calling for Mr Corbyn to enact even more extreme left-wing policies.And he has repeatedly stood up for leftie activists whove been thrown out of Labour following anti-Semitism claims."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000159739694-e1534531485294.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"madonna best at being madge","story":"She might have had a bit of assistance to retain such a fresh-faced youthfulness, but the body is all her own work.Through hours of  gym graft and sheer willpower she’s even more bendy now than when she first burst on to the scene back in 1984 warbling Holiday in a Minnie Mouse falsetto.Madonna is the biggest-selling female artist ever, shifting 300million albums and is worth around 454million quid.She’s achieved success on her own terms and been a trailblazer for every other successful female act following in her wake. There would be no Katy Perry, Miley Cyrus or arguably Lady Gaga without Madonna.She might not be the best singer or dancer in the world, but she’s certainly the best at just being Madonna.You simply can’t imagine anyone ever telling her what to do. She’d laugh in their face.Madonna had always known how to grab attention, whether it’s publishing a book stuffed full of naked photos of herself, faking self-pleasure on stage, or kissing Britney Spears.And only Madonna could have bounced back from almost being strangled by her bright red Armani cape when she took a tumble and fell on her backside during the Brit Awards three years ago.She merely dusted herself down and carried on regardless, but I bet whoever was in charge of her wardrobe that night would have been given the b******ing of their life.Madonna is always in charge, professionally and personally. Even during her brief fling with aging lothario Warren Beatty, he was very much a bit player in the Madonna Show.That must have badly bruised the ego of a man who had always had the upper-hand in his relationships until then.It has to be said her love life hasn’t been anywhere near as successful as her career.There was a brief, destructive marriage to American actor Sean Penn in the Eighties and in 2000 she married Guy Ritchie, but the couple divorced eight years later.Since then she has dated a string of handsome and often young men, but they usually seemed to have the whiff of a photo opportunity about them rather than anything long term.She chews them up, spits them out and moves on to the next one.Madonna seems happiest as a single mum.She has uprooted the family to Lisbon, in Portugal,  because her adopted son David wants to play professional football.With her vast wealth she could easily have bought him a team such as LA Galaxy but she has always had a Calvinistic work ethic that she has tried to pass on to her kids.She has also made up with son Rocco Ritchie after a bitter custody battle and appears to be in a very good place.In an era where most young female vocalists all sound the same — bored, whiny and more than a wee bit yodelly — we really do need a one-off like Madonna.I hope she had a fabulous birthday on Thursday in Marrakech, Morocco, and danced until dawn to all of her greatest hits.Happy 60th birthday, ma’am, and I’ve no doubt you will still be in your fishnets and basques when you get that 100-year birthday message.Just when the royals and their advisers thought the whole fiasco between Meghan Markle and her dad had gone quiet, there comes a bizarre twist.Meghan’s rent-a-gob half-sister Samantha, who seethes with rage and jealousy, has announced that Thomas Markle is bringing out his own clothing range.This led to speculation as to what the brand might be called.  “Markle \u0026amp Spencer” or “Primarkles”  (thank you, Alan Carr). But joking aside, surely this can’t be a serious  concept.Apart from being a crass, money-grabbing exercise cashing in on a quasi-royal connection, who on earth would buy garments from a pensioner who dresses like a hobo?I’ve had a great deal of sympathy for Thomas  in the past. He was treated poorly in the build-up to the  Royal Wedding, when his daughter married Prince Harry.He should have been embraced by his new family and given guidance on how to deal with the  media attention.Instead he was cast adrift. The result? Those stupid paparazzi set-up photos and a series of interviews that painted Meghan in a poor light.Every time her dad talks on TV or to newspapers and magazines, her popularity is dented.The two of them obviously have a fraught relationship. It turns out Thomas didn’t attend Meghan’s first wedding in 2011 either.Thomas increasingly comes across as bitter, angry and dislikable.To gain media attention he keeps making more and more outrageous accusations.My advice would be to stop listening to his bitchy daughter Samantha and maintain a dignified silence.All thoughts of profiteering through a clothing range or any commercial activity must be abandoned forthwith.That just might mean there could be some  sort of reconciliation in the future.Otherwise he will lose his daughter forever.ONE of the week’s most astonishing stories involved a young US woman who has been given her life back with a groundbreaking face transplant.Three years ago, Katie Stubblefield, from Mississippi in the US, tried to take her own life and shot herself in the face with a hunting rifle. She was just 18.Doctors saved her life but she was left with a mass of scar tissue instead of a face.Katie, the youngest person ever to receive a face transplant, endured more than 30 hours of surgery.Of course, the operation requires a donor – and in this case it is  a very sad story.Katie received the face  of a mum who died of a drug overdose.She was a registered organ donor and her grandmother bravely approved the donation.That decision can’t have been easy and we should always salute those who are donors, and the loved ones who give their consent.Katie won’t look like anything like her donor because the “face” is moulded on to her new bone structure.She continues to heal and  make progress, but this kind of surgery is still in its infancy.She will always look “different” but she has a second chance of life and now wants to help others in anguish and with suicidal thoughts.It’s an incredible story of despair that turned to  hope.  The skill and dedication of the team of surgeons and medics that helped her is awe-inspiring.I’m always surprised to learn that Caroline Flack is 38 years old.The presenter looks a  lot younger – and at the moment she is acting like a lovesick teenager going through the agony and ecstasy of her first serious crush.Her off/on romance with red carpet fever victim Andrew Brady is becoming laughable.This week the couple apparently had yet another spat in a London ­restaurant.If these two are to have any chance of staying together long term, they need to get out of the public eye and spend some quiet time alone.I’m sure Caroline knows of a certain Love Island that isn’t being used right now. That would do very well.The ending of the second series of The Handmaid’s Tale had me shouting in despair at my TV.I don’t want to give away too many spoilers but this cliffhanger will break your heart.It also, however, sets up season three for long overdue revenge.As always, astonishing performances from Elisabeth Moss as  June/Ofglen and Yvonne Strahovski as Serena Joy.They will soon fight it out for real when the TV actress awards are up for grabs.I’ve lost track of the amount of slippers our border terrier puppy Angus has chewed up, but this week he surpassed himself by getting his paws on his Pet Passport and virtually destroying it when we were in Spain.Luckily a  local vet issued him with a Spanish version and he now boasts dual nationality.He’s suddenly developed a liking for an afternoon siesta, but at least we were able to get him back into the UK – although who knows what will happen to him after Brexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They need to speak up!“They are cult-like — like Scientology — because they are secretive.They close the door, pull the shades down and put their fingers in their ears so they don’t have to hear.“Maybe they have a secret handshake too! You cannot ask a question of them — as they won’t answer.”American Thomas has been met with a wall of silence from Kensington Palace, including Meghan, 37, since speaking out publicly about her.The Church of Scientology, founded by L Ron Hubbard, has provoked controversy for its practices and secretive methods.It has always strongly denied claims that it is a cult and that it manipulates members.The religion has attracted a huge celebrity following — including film megastars Tom Cruise and John Travolta.The Stepford Wives is a 1970s thriller novel by Ira Levin where men in American suburbia turn their spouses into brainwashed submissive robots.Thomas, an Emmy-winning lighting director, has tried to encourage Meghan and her husband Prince Harry, 33, to contact him — after three months of silence.They have not spoken since the day after the couple’s wedding at Windsor Castle.Thomas, who also has children Samantha, 53, and Tom Jnr, 51, dismissed reports that he was hoping for money from his kids.He said: “I worked hard to provide for my children. I’m their father, I don’t expect them to pay me back.”The retired Hollywood lighting director has openly criticised the Duchess in a series of interviews since her wedding.He claimed he had been completely cut off by Meghan.But people close to Meghan have insisted this is not the case.They said: His behaviour is something she has had to deal with for most of her adult life.There has been a long history of dad disappointment with her life being splattered with upset because of her relationship with him.She isnt shocked or surprised by his behaviour and dealt with it all with a lot of grace.Meghan has also come under fire from her half-sister, Samantha, who urged her to reconnect with her father.Thomas laughed off a claim that he is to launch a clothing range for men — which Meghans half sister Samantha had made in a tweet.He insisted: “It is just a joke.“The only clothes line I have is the one I hang my shirts on to dry.”He was famously pictured being measured for a suit in staged paparazzi shots in the run up to the Royal Wedding.GOT a story? RING The Sun on 0207 782 4104 or WHATSAPP on 07423720250 or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It has to be registered and declared when he spoke. Paisley got 30 days for the same offence.”Mr Corbyn’s office did not respond to a request for comment last night.He has refused to come clean over the costs of the controversial trip.He said he didn’t declare it in the register of MPs’ interests because it fell below the then £660 threshold for which MPs must declare hospitality they’ve received.But revelations in The Sun earlier that he stayed in a luxury 5-star hotel during the trip challenged these claims.Last night a Labour party spokesman claimed Mr Corbyn was not obligated to disclose his trip in the Palestine debate.The spokesman said: “The cost of Jeremy’s trip did not meet the threshold requiring it to be declared. Even if it had, Jeremy wouldn’t have had to declare it in every debate about the broad topic of Israel and Palestine.”GOT a story?

Jeremy did not honour those responsible for the Munich killings”.Holding a wreath should not be reckoned to be any kind of endorsement of the wreath we know Jeremy deplores this kind of thing and, indeed, all other forms of wreath.Hark, though, at how quickly the approved line may shift. What was a “smear” yesterday is a forgotten truth today, airbrushed from history because, well, that’s the way these people do these things.The new line is Jeremy wants to see “a fitting memorial to everyone who died in every terrorist incident everywhere”.I dare say he’ll be visiting Enniskillen soon. Of course.And yet, in one sense there really isn’t very much to look at. Or, rather, very little that is new. This is who Corbyn is and who he has always been.He has never bothered hiding this, leaving one to assume he only does so now because there is some small, nagging part of his brain which accepts it might be sensible to do so, since failing to hide it might prove politically inconvenient.Even so, he cannot change. Anyone who has been at university will recognise Corbyn and all his fellow travellers.These were the people — some of them clever but not many of them intelligent — who fouled student politics for everyone else.The chiselling parsers and pedants and revolutionaries whose appetite for procedural minutiae bored everyone else into submission.And usually that would be that. They would, most of them, grow up eventually. But not St Jeremy and not his devotional disciples, either.They are greyer now but as instantly recognisable as they always were: Experts in room-clearing.They ought, by rights, to be confined to dingy rooms above down-at-heel pubs, where they could cut and paste their thuddingly dreary newsletters. Instead, mystifyingly, they have been given control of one of Britain’s great political parties.How much will this summer of anti-Semitism really cut through with the average voter? Less than you might think, I suspect.In the first place — and this may be a good thing — Twitter remains a niche platform and political Twitter a niche even there.Secondly, the public have already made up their minds about Corbyn and they think he’s a dud.Each month YouGov asks whether Jeremy Corbyn or Theresa May seems the best available Prime Minister and each month Corbyn trails.Sometimes he is also beaten by “Don’t know”. That’s Corbyn: He can come third in a two-horse race.But, they splutter, look at what a kind and gentle and decent man he is. Why can’t other people see that he’s a valiant activist for peace?Possibly because, for a decent fellow, he spends a startling amount of time with thoroughly indecent people.He keeps falling in with the wrong crowd while never being a member of the wrong crowd himself. There is no need here to document the long list of unsavoury people with whom Corbyn has been happy to associate himself because, really, what is now the point? He is who he is and we know who he is.In Corbyn’s world every-thing has a single, simple explanation. Colonialism is the root cause of all root causes.That insight — if we can call it that — dictated his views on Ireland just as it dictates his views on the Middle East, Cuba, Venezuela and everywhere else.From there it is but a short leap to the kind of deluded wishful thinking that animates what passes for his thinking. Once you have assumed that Northern Ireland should not exist, you absolve yourself of any and all need to think about what should happen next.You may ignore the inconvenient, and stubborn, reality that Northern Ireland — like, well, Israel — does exist and is not going to disappear.Practical politics means wrestling with things as they are, not as you think they should have been decades previously.But if you start with the theory, you may avoid practical reality. If this leaves you with nothing — precisely nothing — useful to say then so be it. You will at least remain pure in heart.If this means you are no kind of “peace campaigner” at all, that’s fine too, because you will be shielded by your own impenetrable sanctimony.As poses go, this is an awfully comfortable one but it’s not serious politics.Perhaps Corbyn really is just unlucky. But it seems more probable that he’s not. And that, far from being the decent man of legend he’s actually thoroughly indecent.The only possible alternative is that he’s thunderously, crushingly, toe-curlingly thick.On balance, however, it seems more probable that he is, in fact, both.Enough of this. Enough, already.GOT a story? RING The Sun on 0207 782 4104 or WHATSAPP on 07423720250 or EMAIL exclusive@the-sun Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Retailers and producers would be hit for using or making “virgin plastics”.The crackdown comes after a record 162,000 responses from the public to the Government’s consultation on how to reduce single-use plastics and boost recycling.Treasury minister Robert Jenrick said: “There was clear support for a new incentive for businesses to use recycled plastics over new plastics when producing packaging — such as takeaway boxes or water bottles.“This is about using the tax system intelligently to encourage manufacturers and retailers to take more responsibility for the products that end up in shops.”Campaigners welcomed the move to place the burden for recycling on businesses.The Tories are supposed to stand up for low taxes.Across the Atlantic, President Trump has instituted tax cuts that have contributed to a booming American economy.

In this instance, the child was booked on two separate bookings for the outbound and return flights. “While we regret any inconvenience, as no other adult was travelling on the return booking, she could not travel on the flight. “As a gesture of goodwill, the child and an accompanying adult were moved on to another booking on the next available flight, which departed to East Midlands later that day.”But Michelle claimed Daisys family members explained the situation - showing them the letter and passports, which the budget airline had told her mum to give her.  She said a crew member left and came back with a security guard who then allegedly escorted the girl off the plane.Michelle said: My 13-year-old is autistic and was absolutely hysterical.

It was wonderful to hear those words.“The next day we sat down and looked through all the photographs.If his memory starts to fade, we will have all those photographs and the video to show him how perfect our day was and how happy we were.”Daniel said: “Everything went so fast, it was like a twilight zone, but it was the perfect day.”The pair, from Nottingham, have 18-month-old twins together.And soon, the young man, will have trouble speaking and playing with them as the disease progresses and he struggles with speech and co-ordination.Even now he cannot look after them by himself as he cant remember if they have had anything to eat or drink, and cant carry them up the stairs to bed.Yesterday the couple spoke to the Loose Women panel about his diagnosis.He said: I had an inkling.  We did research ourselves before then but its not good news to take onboard.I have found acceptance now and Im sure Jordan has as well it is still hard.He was diagnosed in September last year, and the couple decided to get married as soon as possible so they could both fully enjoy the day.His disease is caused by a genetic mutation called PSEN1 inherited from his dad Adrian, who died from the condition when he was just 36 years-old.Doctors only discovered Adrian had Alzheimers 25 years after his death, when Daniel started showing the same symptoms.Fewer than 600 people worldwide have been diagnosed with it.Tragically they now know there is a 50 per cent chance the couples twins will develop it to.But the family plans to ensure they do as much together as possible before Daniel becomes more restricted.They have a bucket list of things to tick off - including walking the twins to their first day of school and holidaying in Florida."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT0004264910171-e1534376158392.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"why the time has come for the beeb to stop believing in the cult of jeremy corbyn","story":"No?

That’s the kind of chap he is. Actually, I say that was the “latest” case of Corbyn simpering around terrorists.Not quite. A day or two later a photo emerged of him giving the salute of the Muslim Brotherhood, a foul organisation proscribed as terrorists in six countries.And it’s all part of the anti-Semitism scandal which is tearing the Labour Party apart.

Yep, the BBC.The corporation refused to touch the story for a whole day, when it was first reported by blogger Guido Fawkes.

Six!Boris had likened women who wear the burka to letter boxes or bank robbers.The vast majority of the country agreed that he wasn’t being racist. The vast majority want the burka banned here — as it is in Denmark, France, parts of Germany, Belgium and . . . Morocco.His comments were not much of a story at all. And the moves to sanction him solely a case of his enemies in the Conservative Party gleefully hammering the bloke.But the BBC became obsessed by it. It is always obsessed when the word Islamophobia is mentioned.And it loves to stick the boot into the Tories. Yet was utterly silent on the latest example of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party.It took them a full day to even mention the story.It’s another shocking case of the BBC’s bias. A left-liberal prejudice which runs right through the corporation from top to bottom.The same prejudice you hear whenever it deals with immigration (bloody marvellous!) or Brexit (absolutely ghastly!).Haven’t we had enough of this? Enough of paying £150.50 every year to have these credulous dupes pipe liberal propaganda into our homes every day.Get rid of the licence fee. Let the BBC survive through the subscriptions of those who are willing to pay. And on that deal, I’m out, Evan.Heres a photo of Rhian Sugden dressed as a plum.I’ve included it this week so that Tess Daly can enjoy it.Her husband, the uniquely interesting Vernon Kay, had a long sexting relationship with Rhian, apparently.And Tess was a bit hacked off.So maybe this will cheer her up.I’m on a diet. One of those low-carb things. God it’s boring.My favourite kinds of food are fat and carbohydrates, preferably mixed together.At night I dream of mashed potato and steak and kidney pudding.How can people enjoy life on a diet of bloody stir-fry?And the worst thing is it doesn’t seem to have done much for my weight. I still look like a pregnant middle-aged lesbian in a Boris Johnson wig.If the pounds don’t fall off soon I’m going to give it up.

The hotel she was staying in was “full of Spaniards”. Well, fair enough. They can be annoying. They get over-excited and spoil everyone’s fun.Where was Freda on holiday? Spain. Freda thinks she should have been warned about the possibility of being surrounded by Spaniards in Spain.She added that they should go “somewhere else” for their holidays.Brits are flooding to Turkey to take advantage of the crashing lira. You can get a holiday for two-fifths of nowt, apparently.All well and good. But you would have to pay me a lot of money to go anywhere near Turkey.The reason it’s cheap is because the moron who runs the place, Recep Erdogan has wrecked the economy. And there will be big trouble there soon.Fancy a change in your career plans? There’s a new job just come available – head of the Islamic State.The post is open to male psychopaths with very large beards. Must be able to scream “Allahu Akbar” in a very menacing manner. Salary negotiable.Small print at the bottom probably says: “The Islamic State is not an equal opportunities employer. So, no women, gays or Jews, please.”This job has come up because the previous leader, Abu Bakr al Baghdadi (Bob Baghdad to his mates) got hit in a drone strike. According to the Islamic State, he is now brain-dead. Hmmm. How could they tell?A year or so back I was in a minicab at night on my way home when we approached the level crossing near my house.The gates were open and the driver, a foreign bloke, drove into the middle, stopped and said: “Sorry, left or right?” I looked at him to see if he was joking.He wasn’t. I said: “I would go straight on if I were you.“This what we, in this country, call a ‘railway line’.” I assume it’s his wife, then, who was caught driving her car along the Newcastle  this week.And only noticed she was actually on a railway when she pulled up at a station.An art student decided to do something about the bright light coming in through her window.There are a number of solutions, aren’t there?Curtains, for example. Or maybe some nice blinds.But nope, instead she covered her window with a painting. It was called Double Anal Penetration and was quite, um, graphic.The neighbours kicked up a bit of a fuss.There was also the suggestion the police could be called. The student’s name, incidentally?

Khan, 65, was finally declared the winner of a controversial election - just 22 years after founding his political party. It is the crowning political achievement for a man who made his name not as a statesman but as a sporting hero. Since finishing his sporting career as one of the world\u0027s most famous cricketers, he has become an outspoken campaigner against political corruption. Khan has pledged to bring to justice all those who have robbed this country through corruption.  “I want to thank the people and I want to thank God for giving me the opportunity to bring change,” Khan, wearing a black waistcoat over traditional white shalwar kameez robes, said in a combative speech in parliament. “First of all we have to do strict accountability,” Khan added. “Those who have robbed this country, I will hold each and every one of you accountable. Khan, a firebrand nationalist, has promised to create millions of jobs and build world-class hospitals and school systems in the mainly-Muslim country of 208 million people. Among his first challenges will be to decide whether to request an International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout to ease currency pressures, or seek support from China and risk deepening Pakistan’s economic dependence on its neighbour. His first major task will be to avert a brewing economic crisis after his party swept to election victory on July 25. Khan\u0027s party won power on an anti-status quo platform, vowing to fight corruption and lift millions of people out of poverty.  Pakistan has been plagued by boom-and-bust cycles and military coups since independence in 1947, as well as by Islamist militant violence in more recent years. In a sign of Pakistan’s bitter political divisions, opposition lawmakers surrounded Khan and disrupted his speech throughout by shouting “thief, thief Imran Khan” and “puppet”. Khan’s election was only the second democratic transfer of power since Pakistan’s 1947 independence, and came at a time when relations with on-off ally the United States are fraying over alleged Pakistani support for militants waging war in Afghanistan. Islamabad denies aiding insurgents. Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party holds 151 of the 342 seats in the lower chamber of parliament, short of a majority, but is expected to form a coalition government with smaller parties. In Friday’s lower house vote, Khan garnered 176 votes to defeat Shehbaz Sharif from the outgoing Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party, who won 96 votes. Khan, who will be sworn in on Saturday, has yet to announce his cabinet. His success in the election ended decades of political dominance by two dynastic powerhouses, the PML-N of three-time premier Nawaz Sharif, and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), founded and led by the Bhutto family.

Stefanie Boyce looked on with profound honour as her beautiful nine-year-old daughter, Brooklyn, took her final breath last week after battling a rare condition. Just eight months earlier, she had watched her 11-year-old son, Jayden - Brooklyn\u0027s beloved older brother - pass away peacefully as he lay between her and her husband. The siblings had both lived courageously with the same rare and terminal disorder. And as Brooklyn neared the end of her short life, Stefanie found herself asking an unimaginable question that no mum or dad should ever be faced with. What parent has to think these thoughts, \u0027I wonder if my daughter\u0027s death will be as beautiful as my son\u0027s?\u0027, said the 37-year-old writer, from Illinois, US.  Referring to Brooklyn as \u0027B\u0027 and Jayden as \u0027J\u0027, she added: My greatest fear was B’s passing would be sudden and tragic. A seizure. A morning I’d find her not breathing. Some way that I couldn’t say good-bye. Some way not as holy or sacred as Jayden’s. But since her daughter\u0027s death, Stefanie has experienced a form of peace, knowing her two brave children are together again, playing in Heaven. B is probably dragging him around Heaven giving him the tour even though J knows his way around, she said in an emotional tribute to the pair. And I bet J is chuckling and going along with it as she does. It was on Monday, August 6, that Brooklyn received her crown of life, surrounded by her loved ones, including her dad, Justin, 38, and six-year-old sister, Ellie.  Also known as Beeba, the youngster had a contagious laugh and lit up every room with her personality - which was as big as her beautiful blonde hair. The same day of the week, on November 13 last year, her brother and best pal Jayden had gained his own crown, while lying peacefully between their parents. A gentle little boy who had a vibrant smile for everyone, he had loved dancing with his mum, playing with his dad and holding hands with Brooklyn and Ellie. Brooklyn and Jayden had both been \u0027brave warriors\u0027 against Sanfilippo Syndrome, a regressive metabolic disorder that affects around one in 70,000 children. Youngsters with the condition progress for a couple of years, before slowly losing the ability to walk, talk and eat. They typically pass away before they reach 20.  In Stefanie\u0027s tribute, which she gave  permission to share, she described how her and husband Justin\u0027s routine has all disappeared in one breath. We are no longer a special needs family, said the mum, whose youngest, Ellie, does not have the genetic disease. Our membership to the club got revoked. Expired. And although we never wanted to join, once we did, we didn’t want to leave. Beauty is found in its members. God is found in its meetings. Don’t get me wrong, we will stay connected as honorary members, but honorary none the less. But she added that there’s a peace now that comes as I envision J and B together. Maybe they’re laughing together because B just had to pass on the 6 and J on the 13, so they could share the Monday, she said.  But in true Beeba fashion, her Monday would be first. She concluded: I always wondered why two, but not anymore. Although their lives were short, Brooklyn and Jayden both helped to raise awareness of Sanfilippo Syndrome and the desperate need to find a cure. An obituary for Brooklyn describes how the little girl navigated the condition with strength, grace, and a smile as genuine as they come. She did so while impacting the lives of others. On the day of her daughter\u0027s death, Stefanie said it was her profound honour to have watched the youngster take her first and her last breath. Mourning and sadness feel just as right as joy. Brooklyn, you have brought joy to our life and to every life that has ever been touched by yours, she said.  Even in your last few breaths you made me smile in my tears. May I always strive to live as beautifully as you have. She added that she would be forever looking for her sweet girl. The day after Brooklyn\u0027s passing, Stefanie and Justin marked their 14th wedding anniversary. They spent part of it at a funeral home, planning their daughter\u0027s funeral. Brooklyn\u0027s life will be celebrated at Immanuel Church in Gurnee later this month. Although she and Jayden had suffered from Sanfilippo, the syndrome was not all of them and they didn\u0027t allow it to stop them from smiling and having fun. Their parents say their legacies will last for an eternity.  Stefanie\u0027s full tribute Together. There’s a weird feeling I have that my grief feels complete. There had been an anticipation of having to do this again and fear of what it would be like. My greatest fear was B’s passing would be sudden and tragic. A seizure. A morning I’d find her not breathing. Some way that I couldn’t say good-bye. Some way not as holy or sacred as Jayden’s. What parent has to think these thoughts, “I wonder if my daughter’s death will be as beautiful as my son’s?” I do. But, I’m not the only one. There was an incompleteness to my grief. Maybe that sounds wrong but it isn’t meant to. I certainly would have chosen another day of anticipation if it meant I could have B. It’s just J and B were always, J\u0026ampB. A package deal. It was always hard to separate them, even google photo gets it wrong. Of course they were individuals, too. J was sweet, B was spicy. J was patient, B was ...me. J was a runner, B was a singer.

But I\u0027m not going to tell you about Aretha Franklin\u0027s failings. They don\u0027t matter to a single one of us, and they don\u0027t matter any more to those closest to her. Aretha reached. That\u0027s the only word I can find to describe how her life panned out, what she achieved and what she meant. She lost her mother at 10, was pregnant by a school friend at 11, a mother at 12 and again at 15, daughter to a perverted superstar preacher who ran drug-and-sex orgies, and wife to a pimp who beat her. Singer Sam Cooke, a friend of her father\u0027s, is thought to have had sex with a 12-year-old Aretha when he was 23. Etta James, who died six years ago, was in the same congregation and said: I can understand Aretha not wanting to talk about that . . . Who wants to admit that you’re praising the Lord at the 8 p.m. service and servicing some drop-dead gorgeous hunk of a singer an hour later? Today, it\u0027s called child abuse. It\u0027s abandonment, vulnerable girls, predatory men, the most troubled and turbulent background it\u0027s possible to imagine. Yet through it Aretha reached - in the period after her mother died, she learned to play the piano by ear.  She went on the gospel circuit with her father, had her first two children and signed her first record deal. She almost signed to Tamla\u0027s motown label, which worked wonders for Diana Ross but would have buried Aretha\u0027s talent. She did better at Columbia, but in 1966 signed to the soul label Atlantic and hit the heights.  In February 1967 she released first single I Never Loved A Man. The B-side was Do Right Woman, Do Right Man. The B-side. In April she released her version of Otis Redding\u0027s Respect and in the space of just 3 months she was a megastar.  She did all that by the time she was 25, and with two children. She did it with a crappy childhood, sexual exploitation, and at a time when women and black women in particular were segregated, sidelined, and dehumanised. She did it because she reached back into her life, found the love and the pain, and hauled it up like Jonah wrestling his whale. Listen to her quiet, sad, dignified request for men to treat her kindly, and ask yourself who else could perform the same feat.  Aretha became a star for the same reason as Elvis Presley - she reached across the race divide. But while Elvis made black music acceptable by being a sexy white boy, Aretha showed that black and white both hurt the same. There\u0027s not a woman on the planet who doesn\u0027t want a Do Right Man, and after listening to that song, no man who doesn\u0027t want to do better. She sold 75million records to people who were not born in a wooden shack, weren\u0027t raised by perverts, had no interest in Baptist gospel and who nevertheless felt at one with her. When I was a teenager, she whispered in my ear about unrequited love. When I was a woman, she and I belted out songs about freedom and joy. When I fell in love we sang of our sweet, sweet baby, and when I was heartbroken, she raged with me about The House That Jack Built. And she winked at me and nodded when I changed our lyrics to demand he never came back. She was us. They were all our songs. And if she reached through it all, then we knew we could find the strength to do the same.  There is a moment in every one of her songs where you think she\u0027s given it all she can. Then she takes a breath, reaches, and finds some more. I don\u0027t know whether it\u0027s her diaphragm, her voice, or just plain magic but it elevates whoever hears it. Douglas Adams described Mark Knopfler as a man capable of making his guitar hoot and sing like angels on a Saturday night said there was a moment in every Dire Straits song where it is possible to fly. Well, Aretha sings like the angels\u0027 jaded, yet hopeful barmaid, and there is a point in every song where she lifts the weight of the world from everyone\u0027s shoulders. Her loved ones said she never sought help for her demons, never truly dealt with her drinking, gorging, and trips to mental clinics. Instead she went on stage. Perhaps if she had the help she deserved she would not have helped the rest of us realise we were not alone. She kept back the careers of her sisters, raged at friends, threw strops that would have embarrassed Henry VIII, but I don\u0027t care that she must have been hell to live with. With her, the rest of us had heaven on Earth.  She played piano like it was a percussion instrument. She arranged many of her own songs, and had the same natural talent for music that the rest of us do for breathing. But there\u0027s one story that tells you more about her than anything else.  In 1998 she was at the Grammys to perform her Blues Brothers version of Think, with John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd. Her friend Luciano Pavarotti was due to perform Nessun Dorma, and despite rehearsing it perfectly he called in 30 minutes after the show began to say he had a cold and could no longer sing.  Aretha was asked to fill the gap, perhaps do one of her signature tracks. She asked instead to hear Pavarotti\u0027s rehearsal. Producer Ken Ehrlich said: In those days we had a boombox with a cassette. And I brought it to her and played it for her. When she heard it, she said, ‘Yeah, I can do this\u0027. She went out on stage, for a live, worldwide broadcast, with an orchestra she\u0027d not practised with, a choir she didn\u0027t know and a nervous conductor, and sang, in Italian, one of the most iconic and powerful songs in the world. One minute in, she reaches. Then reaches again, and again, and you\u0027re wowed, and somehow she reaches twice more and hits the final high note. Those final words, translated, are: At dawn, I will win. I will win, I will win!  At 16 Aretha had toured with Martin Luther King, and 10 years later sang at his funeral. She was rightly honoured and lauded throughout her later life, in 1987 she became the first woman inducted into the Rock\u0027n\u0027Roll Hall of Fame, and she even had an asteroid named after her. She\u0027s been called the greatest singer of all time, the voice of the civil rights movement, and much else besides. She was a spendthrift, a diva, and had a mink coat that she loved so much it used to have its own seat. Through it all, she remained an insecure little girl who thought she wasn\u0027t good enough. Still she reached for something more. More food, more drink, more men, more, more, more than this. And that\u0027s where her magic lay - the ability to show hope amid pain, to see potential in a poverty of experience. That is, after all, the thing that makes us human. We can rise, and when her voice soars it makes you feel that you have, and you can. If that\u0027s not soul, I don\u0027t know what is. In 2015 at a ceremony honouring songwriter Carol King, Aretha performed Natural Woman. She thumped those piano keys like they were in trouble, her voice hit the song at full speed, and Barack Obama wept 20 seconds after she\u0027d opened her mouth. Halfway through, she stands up and reaches for a high note as the auditorium gives her a standing ovation. She throws that mink coat to the floor, and finds more. She goes on, and up, and up, and there\u0027s nothing the audience can do but clap harder. She was a natural woman. She made us feel what it was like to be her, and to be us, and to be human. She showed us what soul was, and she\u0027ll never stop because that voice will never be silent. My daughter will grow up with Aretha in her ears, feeling that they two alone share a secret. You make us feel, Aretha. You always will.

Now vegans won\u0027t have to miss out on the fun, as Asda is going to sell a non-dairy cheeseboard when the festive season rolls round.  The board has three different types of plant-based cheese: a traditional cheddar style vegan cheese, a garlic and chive cheddar and a Wensleydale and cranberry alternative. The cheeseboard costs \u0026pound5, which is a bit of a bargain to be honest. However, it won\u0027t be on sale until 22 November, when the cheeseboard season really gets going.   It\u0027s not the first festive vegan offering from Asda. Last year, vegan mince pies were introduced , with the chain predicting it would sell a whopping 18 million of them.   Veganism has grown enormously in the UK. According to a survey conducted in April, 3.5 million Brits now eat a vegan diet - that\u0027s seven per cent of the population who are shunning animal products.   There are all kinds of vegan cheese out there these days, like cashew nut milk Camembert and plant-based blue.   Back in May, ASDA’s product development manager James Waters stated in a press release : We know how big the free from and vegan markets have become and understand that there is a demand for more free from and vegan products”.

Melissa Krim blasted the Bristol hairdressers for being discriminatory after its staff refused to shave her undercut just because she was female.  The 24-year-old, who lives in Old Market, said she nips into barbers all the time to have her undercut snipped – a style which involves exactly the same procedure as a man having his hair cut, Bristol Live reports.  But after she entered Everyman, in Broadmead, Bristol, which she claims had \u0027barely any customers\u0027 in, she was told women were not allowed to have their hair cut there.  She said: I felt really annoyed. I work in hospitality myself and I would never turn someone away because of their gender, their ethnicity or their sexual orientation. It just isn\u0027t done. I went in to Everyman because it looked pretty empty. I asked the woman who greeted me if they could trim by undercut and she replied \u0027no we aren\u0027t allowed to do women in here\u0027. She said her boss could see on CCTV and he \u0027gets really funny about it\u0027. I would understand if I wanted highlights or if I had really long hair and they weren\u0027t trained in that but it\u0027s exactly the same as shaving a man\u0027s head. There are no reason to refuse a basic shaving job based on someone’s gender. None. I wasn’t asking for highlights or a service they aren’t trained to provide. I’m still very shocked by this.

But she has no idea how long her new husband Daniel will recall their happy day. Dad-of-two Daniel, 31, has early onset dementia.  The couple planned their wedding in just three months to ensure he could remember as much as possible, for as long as possible. They also had a videographer film the ceremony and reception last Saturday, while their family and friends took hundreds of photographs to help Daniel cling to his memories as his mind fades.  Jordan, 30, says: “I was worried Dan would be really emotional and forget what he wanted to say in his vows, but he spoke from the heart. He was so clear and calm, he didn’t falter once. “He told me to remember how he feels about me and that he will feel that way forever, even when the disease takes hold and he can’t show me anymore. It was wonderful to hear those words. “It was me who got quite emotional towards the end of my vows.  I tried to hold my breath so I wouldn’t cry, but I ended up sobbing the last few words. I couldn’t help myself. Thankfully Dan understood me.  “The next day we sat down and looked through all the photographs. If his memory starts to fade, we will have all those photographs and the video to show him how perfect our day was and how happy we were.” The couple from Hucknall, Notts, had another reason for bringing forward their wedding.  As the disease progresses Daniel tires more easily, his speech slurs and his co-ordination deteriorates. They wanted to make sure Daniel could enjoy the day, share a magical first dance with Jordan, and speak clearly and confidently with his family and friends. The plan worked. Daniel and Jordan were the last ones on the dance floor and although his medication means he can’t drink much alcohol, he was able to enjoy a glass of \u0026shychampagne and a pint. ● Vascular dementia is the second most common type of dementia (after Alzheimer’s), affecting around 150,000 people in the UK. ● Symptoms can include memory loss and difficulties thinking, problem-solving or with language. ● 5.2% of under-65s in the UK have dementia – that’s over 42,000. ● Some people have both vascular dementia and Alzheimer’s disease – this is called mixed dementia. ● Dementia affects about 10% of those aged over 65, with 20% of those over 80 years suffering from severe dementia. They even had a special guest in the form of Nottingham actress Vicky McClure, best known for her BAFTA-winning role in This Is England and for cop show Line of Duty. Daniel and the actress became friends while raising awareness for the \u0026shyAlzheimer’s Society.  They’ve also worked together on a new BBC \u0026shydocumentary, My Dementia Choir, as Vicky’s \u0026shygrandmother died from dementia. And they will complete the charity’s annual Memory Walk together next month. Daniel says: “Everything went so fast, it was like a twilight zone, but it was the perfect day.” Daniel was diagnosed with early onset dementia in September last year.   It is caused by a genetic mutation called PSEN1 inherited from his dad Adrian, who died from the condition when he was just 36 years-old. Fewer than 600 people worldwide have been diagnosed with it. At the time doctors suspected Adrian had vCJD, the human version of mad cow’s disease.  They only discovered he had dementia 25 years after his death when they tested a sample of his blood and brain, which had been preserved at a laboratory in Edinburgh, after Daniel started showing the same symptoms.  First Daniel started suffering from depression, then his memory and \u0026shycoordination deteriorated and he started suffering from headaches.  Soon Daniel lost his engineering job because he was “under performing”. The couple discovered he could have inherited an aggressive form of dementia when Jordan was three months pregnant with twins Jasper and Lola, now two. Their worst nightmare was confirmed when they received Daniel’s blood test results last autumn. As the disease is hereditary, there is a 50% chance the twins will develop it too. If the couple had known before Jordan was pregnant they could have used IVF to ensure they used embryos without the faulty gene to avoid passing it on.  Daniel says: “The news was so bad I put my head in my hands and went into shock. Everyone was in tears.” His mum Lorraine fights back tears as she recalls the heartbreaking conversation that followed. “Daniel said to me, “If I ever end up like my dad did, please don’t let my children see me in that way.” “The last time Daniel saw his dad he was in bed and couldn’t speak. That is Daniel’s last memory of his dad. So I told him that no matter what, I will never let that happen.” Daniel can no longer carry his \u0026shychildren to bed, though he still reads them a bedtime story.  And he cannot look after them by himself because he cannot remember whether they have eaten or had anything to drink.   Losing his job and social life has left him isolated, raising his risk of \u0026shydepression, a common symptom of dementia. He is on medication to slow the disease, but it only works for one third of patients. The family have had to move to a new home where Daniel can have a ground floor bedroom and bathroom when he can no longer manage the stairs. Jordan has just returned to her job at an NHS diabetes clinic to support the family after taking time off to care for Daniel and the twins. Jordan says: “All the support for dementia is designed for older people whose children are grown up and can help care for them. They don’t have young twins. We’ve had to fight for everything.  Whenever we tell people Dan has Alzheimer’s they are confused because he is so young. It’s frustrating but we can’t be angry because a couple of years ago we didn’t know it was possible.” Determined to make their remaining time together happy, the family have drawn up a bucket list for Daniel. The talented drummer has performed live in a pub, playing Sweet Child Of Mine by Guns N’ Roses, and they have booked a holiday to Disneyland in Florida in November. Daniel has also set himself a goal of walking the twins to their first day of school. After 12 years together, Jordan proposed to him shortly after he was diagnosed – but he refused. Daniel says: “I wanted to be the one to ask her, I wanted it to be special. She deserves that.”  Given a free family cruise in Scandinavia by a relative, Daniel took Jordan for a walk on deck one evening as the sun set. Jordan says: “Then Dan’s mum came up to him. I thought she was straightening his jacket, but she was actually telling him to get the ring out. He forgot which pocket he put it in. The next moment Dan proposed and a bottle of champagne appeared. It was perfect.” With just three months to plan the wedding, they delegated much of the responsibility to friends and family.

David Jones was found guilty of one count of stalking and a separate charge of assault on Stacey Buckley following a confrontation at her home. Jones, 37, from Rochdale, suspected Ms Buckley may have found new love after they broke up and hid the device in the boot of her vehicle to track her movements. But when he monitored Ms Buckley who had been on an apparent shopping trip to Bury, Greater Manchester, he discovered she had made a detour to a house and decided to follow. He later found her holding hands and laughing with her sister\u0027s ex-girlfriend Laura Flynn, in a cafe at the Trafford Centre shopping mall, a court heard during the trial.  Ms Buckley found out about the device when Jones sent a bragging picture of the tracker after he kept inexplicably showing up in the same place as her. He wrote: I’ll find you wherever you are!. In a victim statement read to court, Ms Buckley said: “I am half the person I used to be. I no longer want to go out anymore. “My relationship has suffered with my children. I want to get on with my life but this is proving difficult. “It was in front of the children. I am upset it happened and the children had to see this.  “I do think he will come back and do not know what he would do. I do not know if he would talk to me or go for me again. “He left me feeling very scared and vulnerable. I am worried he will come to the house again and attack me.” The trial heard how Ms Buckley was attacked by Jones during a confrontation at her home in December 2017. She said: \u0027\u0027He pushed me back into the door, and then closed it behind him and began shouting at me saying he knew where I had been that day. \u0027\u0027He saw red. I have never seen him be like that, and he had never been domestically violent before. He grabbed my throat and pinned me against the door. It was like he was looking right through me. I was pinned against the door at the bottom of the stairs. I asked him to leave but he refused.” Defence lawyer Damien Pickup said: “He has not gone anywhere near her. He has moved on and is in a new relationship. “Unfortunately when you have been in a long relationship with children, when it breaks down suspicions start. “People act out of character and do things that wouldn’t normally do.

Chantelle Grace had been in labour for 12 hours when her younger sister, Natasha Palmer, was rushed in to the hospital maternity room next door, having also gone into labour with her first child.  Miss Palmer gave birth to her daughter Phoebe at 2:15am, just 45 minutes after arriving at hospital .  Mrs Grace then gave birth three hours later, with her son Lennox arriving at 5.20am. Both of the sisters were over a week overdue. Mrs Grace, a 30-year-old travel agent from Newport, Isle of Wight, was due to give birth on July 29.  Her younger sister, a 27-year-old nurse from Ryde, on the island, was due a day later on July 30. The odds of two babies being born on the same day are relatively low but for two sisters to give birth on the same day in the same hospital bookmakers put the odds as high as 1 in 125,000. The sisters were both hoping to avoid giving birth on July 30 as it is Mrs Grace\u0027s eldest son\u0027s birthday. Mrs Grace was already in labour at St Mary\u0027s Hospital, Isle of Wight, when she heard her family outside of her hospital room. She said: I was in the delivery room when I heard a voice outside in the corridor and it was Natasha\u0027s partner, Jamie. My husband Matthew went to investigate and came back saying Natasha was next door and about to give birth. I couldn\u0027t believe it.

Callie Rogers was only 16 when she scooped the \u0026pound1.8million prize in 2003.  Much of her fortune went on \u0026pound18,000 for boob jobs, \u0026pound250,000 on cocaine, another \u0026pound300,000 on clothes and she gave away \u0026pound500,000 to friends and family. However, Mrs Rogers says she wishes that she had saved some of her winnings for her son Blake who has cerebral palsy. The six-year-old cannot walk, talk or swallow unaided.  She told the MailOnline : I was never one for designer clothes or flash cars.  But it’s my one big regret is that the money isn’t here for Blake.  He loves sensory stimulation. If I had that money, I’d give him the biggest sensory room you could buy. Before hitting the jackpot she was earning \u0026pound3.60 an hour as a Co-op checkout girl in Cockermouth, Cumbria. Within weeks she met Nicky Lawson, father of her two eldest children, and had moved out to be with him. She quit work and splashed out on designer clothes, lavish presents for her biological parents and holidays, spending quarter of a million pounds on cocaine.  Now the single mum works as a carer, after going back to school to study social care. She stays in a \u0026pound400-a-month house in a cul-de-sac in Workington, Cumbris and says she now does her shopping at Asda. The mum-of-three said: My kids don’t want for anything. At the end of the month there is usually enough for a few treats, but I couldn’t go out and buy a new car tomorrow. She added: If I want a holiday, I have to save.

Taylor Smith, 18, sent pal Jordan Holgerson plunging into a river after shoving her off the bridge in Washington state, US, leaving her with multiple injuries. Prosecutors filed the charge yesterday as an officer said her actions created a substantial risk of death and resulted in serious physical injury to Jordan Holgerson. Reckless endangerment is punishable by up to a year in jail and a maximum fine of \u0026pound3,900. Earlier, Taylor - who family recently claimed \u0027didn\u0027t care about what she\u0027d done - said facing charges is scary but she will accept whatever the prosecutor gives me.  Taylor spoke out after the charge, telling ABC News: I accept the charges maturely and all I can do is hope for the best for Jordan and myself, Smith told late Friday.  Jordan, initially said she \u0027didn\u0027t really want\u0027 Taylor to get into trouble but earlier this week she told NBC News : I\u0027m kind of wanting her to sit in jail and think about at least what she did.  She added: I\u0027m in a lot of pain. In the mornings it\u0027s the worst, like it hurts to breathe. My side hurts. My shoulder hurts. I can\u0027t even get up. Jordan suffered serious injuries in the plunge, including six broken ribs, a punctured lung and air bubbles in her chest after she plunged the equivalent of three storeys into Lewis River at Moulton Falls Regional Park near Vancouver on August 7.  According to the complaint filed in Clark County district court, Jordan told authorities that Taylor was the one who pushed her and that it was unwanted. Taylor admitted to pushing her off the bridge but told authorities she did so in an attempt to help her friend overcome her fear and not to injure her. Earlier Friday Taylor said she didn\u0027t consider the repercussions beforehand, adding: She wanted to jump and she was scared and she had asked me to give her a push, and I didn\u0027t think about the consequences. I thought she would be fine. Taylor said she immediately apologised several times after the incident and even tried to visit her in the hospital but was asked to leave.  She said Jordan has since stopped speaking to her. Jordan said she had initially wanted to jump off the bridge after seeing a friend do it, but she got scared when she got to the top. She said: She was counting down but I didn’t think anything of it. And I was like, \u0027No, don’t count down, like, I won’t go if you count down. I’m not ready.\u0027 And then she pushed me. Jordan said she didn\u0027t feel any pain but adrenaline kicked in after she belly-flopped into the water. But Taylor claimed she never intended to hurt her friend, adding: I\u0027m really sorry it turned out that way. I just pray that she heals and gets better.  Dramatic video footage captured Jordan falling dozens of feet from the bridge in Moulton Falls Regional Park, Yacolt. The teenager could be seen standing nervously at the edge of the structure, before her pal, later identified as Taylor, pushed her from behind. Surrounded by friends, she was reportedly heard saying no twice, before plunging into the Lewis River. She landed with a \u0027belly flop\u0027.  Jordan sister, Vanessa, spoke to KOIN in Canada shortly after the incident.  I think she [the friend] tried to do it jokingly and didn\u0027t think what could have happened, Vanessa said. You don\u0027t really play around at 60 feet.

In the latest instalment on the TLC channel, Dr Sandra Lee, 47, treats a patient known as Taylor who comes to the clinic looking to get rid of a tail-like growth she has in between her buttocks. She has even nicknamed the growth \u0027Lizzie the Lipoma\u0027. The patient explains she has had the lump on her bottom since she was born but it grew bigger in her teenage years. A doctor removed it in 2016 claiming it was a benign fatty tumour called a lipoma but it grew back.  Lipomas are harmless lumps that can grow anywhere on the body. They don\u0027t normally need to be removed unless they cause a problem or a doctor suspects the lump could be something more sinister. But in Taylor\u0027s case, the lump was seriously impacting on her self-image.  Desperate to have it removed and her self-confidence restored Taylor comes to Dr Lee for help. But the worried doctor refuses to operate after her first consultation. She said: There\u0027s two warning bells. One is, why did this doctor remove this and then it came right back? And then the other big thing for me is, a regular lipoma does not appear at birth. You get that over time. There could be something else going on. Doctor Lee orders MRI scan which shows there is a deposit of fat inside Taylor\u0027s spinal cord. When Dr Lee offers to remove some of the tissue on the bump to make it more aesthetically pleasing, she warns that the procedure could disrupt Taylor\u0027s spinal cord.

Hearing the child\u0027s desperate cries of hunger, her maternal instinct kicked in. She asked staff if she could hold and feed him as it was clear they were overloaded with work.  As she started to breastfeed him, the baby immediately began to relax.    Speaking to local media , Celeste said: I noticed that he was hungry, as he was putting his hand into his mouth, so I asked to hug him and breastfeed him.  It was a sad moment, it broke my soul seeing him like this, society should be sensitive to the issues affecting children, it cannot keep happening. She said that she didn\u0027t think twice about helping the poor baby. A colleague of the police officer praised her for her actions on social media. According to Marcos Heredia, hospital staff said the baby was dirty, but that didn\u0027t deter Celeste. He took a touching photo of her breastfeeding the starving baby and shared it online.  He said: I want to make public this great gesture of love you made today for this little baby who you did not know, but for who you did not hesitate to act like a mother. You did not care if he was dirty, which is what the hospital staff called him. Good job mate. According to local media, the malnourished baby is the youngest of six siblings from a single mother who is struggling to cope and in a desperate situation.

I complicate my game sometimes but I’m working on just playing it simple and that’s what the gaffer and (assistant manager) Laurie Ellis want me to do.“They stress to me I have to play it simple at times and then do the magic when I can.”Not that it’s an easy process and Glass admits when he’s on the pitch he wants to be involved at the sharp end, doing the things that help win games.“I like to create chances and I really love to get shots in on the goal, it’s what my game is about.“I’m an attacking player and I like to excite but you can’t always do that and sometimes it is about keeping things simple and doing it for the team.”As those words show, this is a young man who does not lack confidence in his own ability but he’s also one who gives an honest assessment of his performances.For instance, while he was delighted to have played his part in a young United line-up that battled back from two goals down to beat St Johnstone’s U/21s in the Betfred Cup on Wednesday night, he was far from completely satisfied with his work.“It was a brilliant result, all the boys worked really hard to come from two behind like we did.“Obviously, the experienced players helped us a lot but I thought the young boys, including myself, dug in and we battled and battled.“St Johnstone were no mugs and I thought they really impressed so it was good to get on top of them by the end.“I know I wasn’t at my best but, like all the boys, I dug in and helped get the result.“I was maybe trying too hard at times for the killer pass or maybe trying to shoot too early.“Sometimes things don’t come off on the park but I still worked hard and helped the team and that’s what you have to make sure you do.”As he keeps grafting towards making the breakthrough in the first team on a regular basis, Glass was delighted by the victory, not least because it means there will be further opportunities to show he is ready.“This cup is a chance to get 90 minutes and, if I’m not playing in the league, I need to get games somewhere.“If it’s in the Irn-Bru Cup it’s better for me and the other boys, because they are very competitive, like league games.“You want to win them, both teams do, and it gives you the chance to show up well.“We want to do well in it and I think we can.“I thought our fitness was a big factor against St Johnstone.“We had a hard pre-season and I think we got the benefits of that against St Johnstone because we finished the game strongly and looked the fitter team.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/SNS-15266913-Dundee-United-v-Dunfermline.jpg-e1534240458997-820x564.jpg ","title":"el bakhtaoui speaks of frustration at not playing in right position at dundee","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee’s Faissal El Bakhtaoui is convinced he can still make it in the Premiership but is happy to have the chance to prove himself all over again at Dunfermline.The Frenchman left Tayside for the Pars on a season-long loan after becoming increasingly frustrated with his lack of game-time at Dens Park.The 25-year-old scored eight times in 66 appearances for the Dark Blues after joining from Dunfermline in 2016 but failed to scale the heights he did with the Pars first time round.The striker insists his opportunities in the central striking role were all too rare under Neil McCann and this term was unlikely to be any better.Now the former futsal star, who joined Dunfermline as a complete unknown in 2012, is desperate to breathe new life into his career in familiar surroundings.Speaking ahead of last night\u0026#8217s Irn-Bru Cup clash away to Inverness Caley Thistle, he said: “I have come back a better player, with more experience. I learned so much in the Premiership, even though I was a bit frustrated at Dundee.“I think I can play at that level but it just didn’t happen for me.

We were playing just one up front and I was playing as a second striker and on the left and the right wing.“I was happy to play, I was happy to get a game but I don’t think it was my right

first time it has broken through the 2,000 mark.Walkers will pass through Tentsmuir Forest in north-east Fife before coming into Dundee across the Tay Road Bridge.More than 325 Scottish good causes are expected to benefit, including Ninewells Hospital and Fairview School in Perth.All funds raised will receive a 40% boost, thanks to support from the Hunter Foundation and money raised at last month’s charity dinner with former US First Lady Michelle Obama.Kiltwalk chief executive Paul Cooney said: “We launched the St Andrews to Dundee Kiltwalk last year and it was a huge success.“With more than 2,300 participants signed up, this year will be even bigger.“The Dundee walk, which begins at the magnificent Old Course in St Andrews and features the Tay Road Bridge, is among the most picturesque of all four Kiltwalks.”The event is using three different routes again.The 25-mile Mighty Stride will set off from next to the 18th fairway at the Old Course at 9am.The Big Stroll will set off from Tayport at 11am and the six-mile Wee Wander starts at noon from the Tay Road Bridge Urban Arts Space.The finishing line for all three trails will be the Blue Seaway playground at Monifieth beach, with a party awaiting all those who make it to the end.Six-year-old Charlie Walker, from Inchture, is one of the youngest participants, taking on the Wee Wander in aid of Fairview, the additional needs school attended by his three-year-old brother Munro.Charlie aims to walk the full six-mile stretch by himself.Sky Sports presenter Jim White (pictured left) will join Hunter

Ann Street is home to Our Lady’s Primary, Rosebank Primary and Frances Wright Nursery School.Work on the development, on the site of the former Alexander Street multis, started last year.The campus will accommodate hundreds of pupils as well as providing facilities for the community.The new £17m North East Campus opened its doors to pupils of Longhaugh Primary, St Francis Primary and Quarry View Nursery yesterday.Dundee City Council’s depute convener of children and families service Roisin Smith said: “Pupils and teachers will be keen to get down to work in their new surroundings.“The new campus demonstrates how we are investing for the future of our young people through an ambitious building programme“These are state-of-the-art facilities to meet the challenges that our pupils will face in the years ahead.”Coldside councillor Anne Rendall said the opening of the new campus and the development of housing on Ann Street had “transformed” the whole area.She said: “I visited the site three times at the start of the project and most recently in the last four weeks.“It is fantastic to see how far it has come along.“There are some great open spaces and outdoor areas that will be a great asset to the pupils.“We will also be holding our surgeries at the school now as well.“The school is so close to new housing development, which will make the school a big focus for the whole community.“The arrival of the school and the new houses has transformed the whole area.”Meanwhile, a high school in Broughty Ferry has welcomed back a record-equalling number of pupils.More than 1,250 pupils will be taught at Grove Academy this year.Rector Graham Hutton said 236 pupils from Forthill, Eastern and Barnhill primaries had helped the school to equal the previous record number of students, which was set two years ago.He said: “There are so many great opportunities in further education that pupils are making the decision to stay on.“It’s great to see everyone back after the summer break and the extra first-year students joining us from the primary schools across the

at dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIT’s been a “non-stop” start to life at Dundee United for Pavol Safranko and he’s hoping an impressive debut is just the beginning of a successful spell at Tannadice.The Slovakian international was officially signed on Friday, despite having trained with the Tangerines through the week, and was quickly thrust into the starting XI at Queen of the South.Despite not having much time to settle, the 23-year-old quickly opened his scoring account for United as he looped the ball over Queens keeper Alan Martin for a goal that eventually gave his new side three points.He said: “I arrived five days before the game. It has been non-stop.“It was only five days and my first game so I need to know how my team-mates play.“I had four training sessions so it was a little bit crazy but it was good to help the team to win by scoring.“I’m happy with the start but the three points were the most important thing.“We have to start to win games but when I score it is always nice.“It was a good pass from Frederic Frans and I saw the goalkeeper went down so I just wanted to put it behind him and I think it was a good strike.“I think the first half was a good performance and we need to build on that.“The second half wasn’t perfect so we need to change something there.”Safranko joined the club on a year-long loan deal from Danish side Aalborg last week.He was well-known to manager Csaba Laszlo, though, as they worked together at Dunajska Streda (DAC) in Slovakia.There, Safranko knocked in six goals in 12 games after signing for the second half of the season as DAC went on an extended unbeaten run.And the chance to work with Csaba once more was a big draw for the striker once he heard Aalborg were happy to let him leave.He said: “I played under Csaba Laszlo in Slovakia at Dunajska Streda.“There we were unbeaten for 16 games in a row so I know what I can expect from him and I’m looking forward to playing for him again.“Csaba was the big part of why I joined Dundee United because I had a really good relationship with Csaba. I want to work for him.“I can honestly say that in Denmark there is a bit more combination football but here it is a little bit more fighting which will, hopefully, suit me better.“I can say every player dreams to play football in the United Kingdom so this was also one of the reasons I came here.”Safranko certainly knows the Scottish Championship is about “fighting” as he was given a welcome by the Queens backline.The makings of a black eye was clear in the Slovak’s face during and after the game as he battled with the Palmerston defenders.“I heard the Scottish league is quite hard – now I can feel it!” he added.“It is my style and how I play. We will see, I don’t want to speak too much because it was just my first game.”The Tangerines now have the best part of two weeks before their next Championship fixture – time Safranko thinks they can use to their advantage.“We will have time to train and I’m sure with this squad we can be much better in our next game.“The first half was our good phase because I had Nicky Clark close to me. He is a good player, and we can build on it.“Everyone fought and we have to continue with that because if just one person loses a battle, we will have problems.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b76a13d11fcf.jpg ","title":"some team is going to take a battering from us soon says dundee midfielder spence","story":"\t\t\t\t\tStraight-Talking Lewis Spence insists it’s only a matter of time before Dundee’s form in front of goal turns around, saying “some team is going to take a battering” from them soon.The 22-year-old is hoping that’s today as Ayr United come calling in the Betfred Cup last 16 at Dens Park.Although he’s backing his team-mates to start putting away the chances they are creating, he knows just how tough the Honest Men will be to get past.Dundee will have to keep an eye on dangerman striker Lawrence Shankland.He said: “It’s going to come, our luck has to change some time because we are getting the chances.“I think some team is going to take a battering soon, we’ll take three or four off somebody, and hopefully that might be this weekend.“It’ll be a really tough game, though, Ayr are no pushovers, I know a few of their players and they are a decent team.“They play some good stuff and have goalscorers in their team so it’ll be tough.“They won League One so they’ve come up with confidence and have goals in their team, boys that can put it in the net.“They’ll come here with confidence but we’re confident we can get the job done if we apply ourselves the right way professionally.“I’ve always said we want a cup run here to give the fans something back and this is a great draw for us.“It’ll be difficult but we win that and we’re in the quarters and a decent draw can see you to the semis at Hampden.“However, we need to take care of Ayr first – we can’t look past them.”Spence was an injury doubt for this one after he was subbed in last weekend’s 1-0 defeat at home to Aberdeen with an ankle knock. He says, though, coming off was just a precaution after needing surgery on the same ankle last season.He said: “It was nothing too serious. I had a shot and rolled my ankle a bit and I’ve had previous with it, so it was a bit of a worry at the time. However, a good bit of rest and the physio saw it. I’ve trained this week and it’s good. I just need to keep an eye on it.”Now would be an unfortunate time for Spence to be ruled out of action after some impressive displays in the early-season games and particularly due to the level of competition in the position now at Dens Park.“Last year there were a lot of centre-mids but again this year we’re very strong there, one of the strongest areas in the team,” he added.“I think that’s good because it keeps everyone on their toes, you can’t slack because there will be somebody else to take your place.“I believe in my ability and I’ve worked hard over the summer, worked hard in pre-season, too.“Obviously, I’ve been in the position but Glen Kamara is to come back and you’ve got Adil Nabi, Paul McGowan, Elton Ngwatala and Kharl Madianga, so there’s a lot of competition in there. I think throughout the season it will be getting rotated round and, hopefully, I can be in that team.“I think I’ve done OK so far. It’s still early but I want to keep this up through the whole season.“Last year I played well in stages and then got injured so I want to play consistently every week, play as much as I can, and obviously help the team climb the table.”And the way to do that will be to start finding the net, something Spence is adamant that’ll change soon.“I think our luck will turn around.“We have to put some of these chances away, we all know that, but the main thing is we are creating chances.“One day it is going to click, something is just missing at the moment but we all believe in the guys up front to go and do it.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b769ff279716.jpg ","title":"too many people have jumped witnesses recall horror as man stands close to edge of tay road bridge","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWitnesses have spoken about the horror of seeing the police incident that closed Tay Road Bridge yesterday.The bridge was shut in both directions yesterday amid fears for the safety of a man seen standing close to the edge.Police, the fire service, the coastguard and Broughty Ferry lifeboat were all on the scene, with the bridge closing at around 4am.The man was about a third of the way along the bridge, from the Fife side.Traffic was being diverted via Perth and the A90, with queues beginning to build up around 8.30am.However, some motorists had stopped and parked near the bridge entrance on the Dundee side as the drama unfolded.Ross Mackenzie, an apprentice bricklayer with building firm Panbride Contracts in Carnoustie, was on his way to St Andrews for work around 7.30am when police stopped his van to tell him the bridge was closed.The 25-year-old said he hoped the man could be brought to safety.He said: “We got here and were told we couldn’t get over the bridge. We thought about driving the Perth way to Fife but decided just to see how it goes and hopefully the bridge reopens soon.“We were told it’s someone at the side of the bridge and there’s concern for their safety.“Whoever it is, I hope they can be talked down.“Too many people have jumped from it.”A dog walker, who asked not to be named, said she thought there had been a road traffic collision initially.“The road closes for crashes all the time so that’s your first thought,” she said.“Then I noticed the lifeboat and realised there must be either someone in the water or fears they were going to jump.“It’s just terrible someone would want to do that.

But it’s been great for her to spend time with her little sister, and she’s happy to have them back.”The youngster was given the prognosis of spastic diplegic cerebral palsy at the age of 14 months – the neurological condition causes constant stiffness and tightness of leg and arm muscles, making mobility difficult.The family had previously thought treatment in the US was the only option and had set about raising £70,000 when they received the good news that Olivia had been deemed an ideal candidate for the operation in Bristol.Olivia is currently gearing up to go back to school next Tuesday.Senga hopes that she’ll be ready to go back with her classmates, and says they’ll “play it by ear” for the first few weeks.She said: “We’ll just need to see how she gets on, and if she needs to reduce her time at school then that’s what we’ll do.”Senga hopes that the surgery will now make Olivia able to do things that her friends and classmates can.She said: “So much has changed for her, she can sit on a bench now, she can sit crossed legged, it doesn’t sound like a big thing, but it is for her.“It’s little steps, and it’s good for her that she can be part of that.“I know that sitting on a bench isn’t a big thing, but her sitting with her classmates is a big thing for her.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/08/5b752334e0906-884x564.jpg ","title":"aberdeen sandwich shop cleans up with glowing report1","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn Aberdeen sandwich shop that was criticised by inspectors earlier this year has now been given a glowing report.Aberdeen City Council sent an inspector for a routine check of Deja Vu food shop on Rose Street in March and their report said improvement was needed.The inspector expressed concern about the condition of some of the equipment and cleanliness.Several insects were spotted in the back kitchen area, which is not used for food preparation.The business’s owner, Roy Duncan, said he immediately called in pest controllers and the insects were removed within hours.He added that he spoke with the council inspectors in depth so he was able to attend to their concerns.According to the council, the premises was re-inspected on June 8 and they gave it a pass rating – meaning that all the original concerns had been dealt with.Mr Duncan, who has been in the food trade for 30 years, said: “It was quite a shock because, having been in the trade for so long, I had always passed these inspections and known exactly what gets you a pass and what doesn’t.

an area masterplan.“We worked with Prime Four to develop a masterplan for that site,” said Mr Cox.He added: “It was all supposed to be high-quality, high-class type buildings, and we don’t think this fits into that.”A report sent to the council on behalf of the applicants said: “The sale of food and drink for consumption on the premises would serve Prime Four workers, Kingswells’ residents and people working at and visiting the new Aberdeen Football Club stadium – all within easy walking distance of the site.”KCC said it is concerned the safety of football fans could be at risk if large numbers of them walk along the A944 from Kingswells park-and-ride to the stadium, as they might spill out on to the road.“Approval of this application could have major implications to the safety of football fans,” its letter to the council adds.No Kingsford Stadium, a group opposed to the new football ground, has said the charity it has set up, called West Aberdeen Environmental Protection, will

The school will reopen as normal.”But Unite’s regional representative Mr Campbell said the discoveries were unacceptable and demanded action.Prolonged inhalation of asbestos fibres can cause fatal illnesses.Mr Campbell said: “There is no low-level contamination as far as Unite is concerned – once the asbestos is disturbed or broken it only takes one fibre that could be the cause of death later on in life.“Enough is enough and we won’t accept this poor managerial and inappropriate behaviour any longer.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"veteran in call for support","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA veteran has called for better support for soldiers leaving the Army.Andrew Christie, 36, from the Linksfield area of the city, was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder in 2007 after leaving the Army in 2005, having served in Northern Ireland, Kosovo and Iraq.Three of his comrades have committed suicide in the past eight months, something he said could have been prevented.Mr Christie said: “The treatment we’re getting after leaving the forces is appalling. There’s not enough aftercare for the forces from the Government.

Before that we lived in England. My husband’s mum comes from Peterhead and she stays in England but there are still family links up here. We came for a holiday in 2016 and loved it so much we decided to move here.“I have been out running regularly since we arrived, although to begin with I didn’t have much confidence as I didn’t know many runners here.“But I joined Jogscotland and ran with them, so that helped. Now I feel it is the right time for me to get involved in some local events and I am looking forward to taking part in my first Scottish race, the Simplyhealth Great Aberdeen Run. I don’t know much about it other than it is a big event and it should be exciting. It takes place on my daughter Grace’s 12th birthday so I will have to do well.“It is very mountainous where I come from in the Czech Republic and I seem to be faster running up hills than I am on the flat so I don’t really know how I will get on.”Martina juggles training around her work and a busy home life. She said: “I am a support worker in Peterhead, helping young people with autism. I also work for Aberdeenshire Council teaching English as a second language to people in Peterhead and, sometimes, in Ellon.“Running is one of my favourite things to do. It is funny because when I was young I hated running. It made me cry if I had to do it, so it is amazing how you can change.“I got started in 2013 because I had friends who were runners and they kept encouraging me to try it. To begin with I said no, but then I decided to give it a go on my own. I did 2km, then 3km, and every month I did a little more. Eventually I joined my local running club and I have been doing it ever since.”The Crathes Castle half marathon, which has attracted top Scotland international runners such as Robbie Simpson in recent years, has been saved by a new sponsorship deal.PIM, an Aberdeenshire-based integrity management company, swooped in with an offer to sponsor the race after seeing a Facebook post highlighting that the event might not take place.Now,with the support of the new backers, the National Trust for Scotland is adding a 1.5km cross country run for primary school-aged children to the event programme, which is on Saturday September 15.Martin Worth, director at PIM, said: “We’re delighted to be able to step in and work with the National Trust for Scotland to ensure that this well-known, local event takes place.“It’s also fantastic to play a role in encouraging the next generation of runners to get their trainers on and enjoy the great outdoors with the introduction of the children’s run.“As a company, we are running a health campaign throughout 2018 and some of our staff will be taking up the additional challenge to run the PIM half marathon.”Scotland international Fiona Brian set a women’s course record time of 1hr 22min 59secs in last year’s race while Great Britain ultra trail running representative Kyle Greig won the men’s event in 1:12:18.Brian is unable to compete this year but her clubmate Sarah Milne, winner of last month’s Chapelton of Elsick 10km, is among the leading women entrants so far.Greig is unsure as to whether he will be able to defend his title at the moment and will make a late decision.Entries, which close on September 8, can be made at www.nts.org.uk/visit/events/the-pim-half-marathon-at-crathes-castle-1\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 30","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 27/07/18, 3:43 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.It was a case of \u0026#8216all\u0026#8217s well that ends well\u0026#8217 for young Adam in the Furnace hills last week.Police officers and his mum left him in no doubt of how narrow an escape he had.

As well as hearing about numerous problems with local road repairs I also listen to concerns about slow internet speed with some areas lagging behind others when it comes to getting access to superfast broadband.I heard similar concerns when I attended the latest West Kintyre Community Council meeting. As ever, I will looking into every issue brought to my attention by local residents across my council ward.After travelling back to Islay I checked up on the state of road repairs across the island. Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council. It belongs to ACHA, and since obtaining this information I spoke in person to the very helpful and hard-working staff at the Bowmore ACHA office and asked them to fill in these potholes.Aside from road concerns on Islay, quite a number of my fellow Ileachs have mentioned lack of bed spaces in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital. Being an island community obviously means that transferring more and more patients to the mainland is hardly ideal.The consensus from my constituents who I have been in contact with is that the number of beds in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital is not enough. I have contacted NHS Highland to voice my constituents anger about this situation.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) is seeking volunteers to clean up Scotland’s beaches in the 25th anniversary Great British Beach Clean from September 14-17.Volunteers also record the litter they find, and this has really helped change policy and behaviours.Last year 1,588 volunteers in Scotland took part, cleaning 111 beaches in four days. A staggering 491.4 pieces of litter were found for every 100 metres cleaned, a seven per cent rise on the amount recorded during 2016\u0026#8217s event.The fight to stop the plastic tide has only just started and we need everyone to take part now more than ever.

The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"the sands of time are running out","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 02/08/18, 6:33 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAncient sayings relating to sand generally highlight its abundance. In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

Fraser Watt gave them the lead on 17 minutes and Lewis Montgomery added a second on 33 minutes.A second from Fraser Watt five minutes later made it 3-0 at the break.James Cameron pulled a goal back for Inverness on 54 minutes but most of the pressure was around the Inverness goal. Inveraray had plenty shots but didn’t hit the target as often as they would have liked.They did get a fourth goal though when Allan MacDonald scored on 64 minutes.Bute 5 Kilmory 0Bute stay in the title race after they beat Kilmory 5-0 on the island.Bute attacked from the start and a combination of dogged Kilmory defending and wastefulness in front of goal meant the hosts only had a good Steven Dunn finish on 30 minutes to show for their first half efforts.When referee Des McNulty pointed to the penalty spot on 54 minutes, Iain McDonald stepped up to slam the ball home.Robert Walker scored on 63 and 85 minutes, either side of a 70th minute Craig MacKay goal, to complete the 5-0 victory.Aberdour 0 Inveraray 1Inveraray\u0026#8217s second team moved off the bottom of the table after a \u0026#8216smash and grab\u0026#8217 job on fourth-placed Aberdour.The Royal Burgh side travelled with only 12 players. Despite having a hand injury, 16-year-old Gregor Mather returned between the sticks after missing the previous week’s defeat to Col Glen and he would go on to turn in a man-of-the-match performance. Coll Mackay and Calum MacDonald, both aged 15, started up front.Aberdour started the brighter, creating many chances, but a combination of wasteful shooting and superb goalkeeping prevented Lisa MacColl’s side taking the lead.Inveraray’s centre line grabbed a hold of the game towards the end of the first half, with wingers Campbell Watt and Steven Cameron adapting well to their unaccustomed roles.Aberdour dominated large chunks of the second half but struggled to break down the visitors.Inveraray, though, have Gregor Mather to thank for some heroic saves to keep the scoreline blank.Aberdour goalkeeper Tom Bowerman had a quiet afternoon until 89 minutes when he picked the ball out of the net. Young Calum MacDonald, the smallest player on the park, ran through several challenges to push the ball into the back of the net and give Inveraray the lead.There wasn’t much time for referee David Mitchell to add and his final whistle signalled an Inveraray victory.Photo: Stephen Lawson\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters week 31","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 03/08/18, 11:38 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,On behalf of local walkers I would like to thank the Forestry Commission for mowing the path between the Mealdarroch water tank track and The Kintyre Way.It is a beautiful forest walk and one of the least muddy in the area during the wet weather.Ann Thomas, TarbertThanks to the separatist\u0026#8217s tax hikes, Scotland has seen a 12 per cent rise in personal insolvencies.There were 3,208 bankruptcies and protected trust deeds from April to June this year, up from 2,869 in the same period last year.More and more Scots are struggling with debt yet the SNP has chosen to hammer families with higher income taxes.While taxes continue to rise in Scotland the revenue generated is being wasted \u0026#8211 a recent bullying claim probe into a police chief has wasted almost £100,000 of public money. The Scottish Police Authority disclosed the money spent on lawyers during the probe.Taxpayers have footed the legal fees of investigating the claims against former police chief Phil Gormley, who quit earlier this year amid multiple bullying allegations.The public was angry enough at how this case has been handled by the SNP Government and SPA, so it is even more frustrating to find out that tens of thousands were wasted on this fruitless task.It seems that the separatist\u0026#8217s wastefulness and incompetence which we have seen so much of in their mishandling of our economy also extends to their mismanagement of Police Scotland matters.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,With the Edinburgh Festivals about to start, can I remind your readers to helpfully inform visitors to our city that, unlike the made-up and damaging \u0026#8216tradition\u0026#8217 of rubbing Greyfriars Bobby\u0026#8217s nose, it is a genuine Edinburgh tradition to pause for a moment in the Royal Mile beside St Giles to lick the Heart of Midlothian.John Hein, EdinburghSir,I am writing to invite your readers to join me in hosting a World Tea Party this summer in support of working animal charity SPANA.Holding a Moroccan, Indian, British, Kenyan, or another world-themed party, is the perfect way to get together with friends and try out exciting and exotic new recipes, while also raising vital funds to help the world’s most hardworking animals.In many developing countries, working animals transport food, water, goods and people, and make it possible for millions of the poorest families to earn a small income.

They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ (HDD).energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process.

The coach kit will also bear Ardrishaig Community Trust’s logo.The funding will also see more than £2,000 per annum set aside to allow teams to take part in football festivals throughout Argyll and further afield, and also to pay for festivals to be held locally.This will allow local youngsters to benefit from the experience of playing in festivals against a wide range of teams from all over Scotland, and help to tackle remoteness and exclusion.As part of the funding agreement, the Soccer Centre will display a banner recognising the role of Ardrishaig Community Trust as its main sponsor.The player of the year award for each age group at the annual awards evening will be dedicated to the Ardrishaig Community Trust.And, finally, the Soccer Centre will look to encourage, support and participate in the work of Ardrishaig Community Trust.

The ball made its way through to the unmarked Robert Walker who had the simple task of tapping the ball home to open the scoring with 15 minutes played.Bute’s centre line started to dominate play and John MacCallum set up Iain MacDonald who made it 2-0 five minutes before the break.Inveraray came out stronger in the second half, enjoying the bulk of play, but it was Bute who scored a third goal with Robert Walker netting with 15 minutes remaining.The goal seemed to spark life into the Inveraray team who went on to score two goals in a four-minute spell.Craig Taylor fired home an unstoppable shot on 79 minutes, and just a couple of minutes later captain John MacKenzie made it 3-2.The visitors almost snatched a draw at the death through a Steven Cameron shot which went just inches wide of goal.Taynuilt 2 Kilmory 3Alister MacArthur scored twice as Kilmory beat Taynuilt at the Taynuilt Sports Field.Taynuilt started strongly, but while they dominated play the Kilmory keeper didn’t have a save to make the home side missed chances.The second half was only three minutes old when Alister MacArthur, who individually has scored more goals than the whole Taynuilt team this season, showed the reason why by firing the ball past Reid in the Taynuilt goal.He repeated the feat five minutes later to give Kilmory a two goal cushion.This seemed to stir Taynuilt into action and David Campbell scored from the edge of the D on the hour to reduce the deficit.Taynuilt went all out for the equaliser but were caught out on 72 minutes when Sandy Leiper ran away from his marker and laid the ball off to Ally MacLennan to slip it passed Reid and restore Kilmory\u0026#8217s two-goal advantage.It was a crucial strike as the home side pulled a goal back just six minutes later after a well-worked corner between David Campbell and Jamie MacFarlane with the latter firing a shot passed the Kilmory keeper to make it 3-2.Taynuilt laid siege to the Kilmory goal for the remainder of the game but they lacked the composure to get an equaliser.Best for Kilmory were Jones, Cunningham, and MacArthur and man of the match, Leiper.Kilmory leapfrog Taynuilt in the league and unless Taynuilt can find someone to put the ball in the net, they are going to be in the relegation dog-fight.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"past times present fun in lochgilphead","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/08/18, 11:29 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowOrganisers reckon 450 people came along to enjoy a dip into the past.Lochgilphead Community Council\u0026#8217s annual Celtic and Pictish Festival is gathering momentum year on year as it grows into an event with a character all of its own.Morning shoppers on Argyll Street were treated to the unusual sight of Picts, Vikings and Romans parading to Lochgilphead front green to begin the festivities. In front of the parade was musician Pat Kenny playing haunting tones on a carnyx, an Iron Age Celtic war horn.On the green there were stands selling everything from soap to artwork and woolly bunnets to garden shrubs.As well as battle re-enactments and weapons demonstrations there were living history demonstrations and workshops where adults and children tried their hand at traditional crafts such as spinning, weaving, metalworking, woodwork, dressing up and blowing the carnyx.Children took part in the Lughnasa Games, featuring various tests of Celtic warrior skills.Brian MacLennan of Lochgilphead Community Council said: \u0026#8216The day was a massive success and I\u0026#8217ve had lots of positive feedback.

Saints had the majority of possession in the second 20 minutes but the Star back line of Kyle Selfridge, Andy Weir and Luke Naisby remained resolute along with Luke Kalache in goal.The other sides in group two were debutants Port Glasgow who ran out 2-0 winners against Neilston as two first half goals sealed the match in the Inverclyde men’s favour.Red Star’s next game against Neilston was an entertaining affair. After a goalless first half, Star took the lead through Ian McGuinness before an equaliser from Neilston after some sloppy defending. Innes Meikle restored the Red Star advantage with a long range effort which he curled away from the Neilston keeper for 2-1. Star were once again pegged back however as a free kick into the box bamboozled Kalache in the box and ended up in the back of the net. Just as it looked like the points would be shared Gregor Peacock got on the end of a Cammy MacDonald flick on and headed into the net to secure a 3-2 win for the hosts.Oban Saints and Port Glasgow took to the Astro next and the Oban side soon got into their stride and ran out comfortable 2-0 winners to move to the top of the section on goal difference.Saints stayed on to play their final group match against Neilston and they continued to play some excellent attacking football with Donald Campbell scoring the pick of the goals in a 3-0 win to secure top spot.This left Red Star and Port Glasgow to face each other in the final game to determine who would go through as runners up. Both sides were keen to secure the victory but the defences remained on top in a 0-0 draw and the Lochgilphead side made it through after picking up five points from their three matches with Port Glasgow finishing on four.Over at the Ropework, Campbeltown Pupils opened up their campaign with a 1-0 victory over local rivals Tarbert. Kilsyth, making their tournament debut, also got off to an excellent start with a 3-1 victory over Dunoon.Dunoon stayed on to play against old rivals Campbeltown Pupils in what turned out to be a feisty encounter with the Pupils running out 2-1 winners thanks to a Martin McCallum free kick in the final minute.Tarbert then took on Kilsyth in a 1-1 stalemate, with Nikki MacDougall scoring the equaliser, before fighting out another draw with Dunoon to end the campaign with two points.This left Kilsyth and Pupils fighting for the top two spots in the final match of the section and the North Lanarkshire side edged the tie 1-0 to secure top spot and a semi-final against Red Star.The first semi-final saw Oban Saints take on Campbeltown Pupils, with Saints taking the lead in the first half after Fraser McFarlane was felled in the box. Up stepped Lewis Cameron to make no mistake from the spot.Pupils weren’t lying down, however and got back into the game with a penalty of their own to equalise, and will be disappointed not to have forced a winner late on.The match was decided by a penalty shoot-out and Saints eventually came out in top on a contest that swung back and forward, providing some excellent entertainment for the crowd that had gathered.The second semi-final also proved to be an exciting affair as Red Star took on Kilsyth. The hosts fell behind early on when Kilsyth opened the scoring after their midfielder finished well from 20 yards to beat Kalache in the Star goal.Red Star equalised soon after with a Ben Forbes wonder strike from 30 yards which thundered past the Kilsyth keeper. Star took the lead when Gregor Peacock was barged in the box and Andy Weir stepped up to fire the penalty beyond the ‘keeper to give the hosts the lead. Kilsyth were causing Star plenty of problems however and were level again before the half-time whistle when a scramble in the box saw the ball deflect in off the unfortunate Luke Naisby.The winner came for Star early in the second half when Kilsyth couldn’t clear a free kick into the box and the ball broke kindly to John Kennedy, who volleyed home to secure the win and send Red Star into the final where for the second year in a row they would face Oban Saints.Into the final and the Red Star side were clearly feeling the effects of their exertions as they struggled to contain a fluid Oban Saints attack early on. Saints had a couple of good attempts saved by Luke Kalache before Matt Rippon opened the scoring after the ball broke kindly on the edge of the box.The Premier division side put themselves 2-0 up on the stroke of half time when more good play saw the ball fall to Shaun MacIver who bundled home.The second half saw Saints stretch their lead through James Ford before Cammy McDonald pulled a late consolation for Red Star but it was Oban Saints who ran out deserved 3-1 winners and won the tournament for the second year running.Saints also had the Player of the Tournament, which was awarded to Lewis Cameron who was excellent throughout the day.Red Star would like to thank all the teams and officials who took part in the competition, as well as the Stag Hotel for their excellent hospitality.Tomorrow Red Star round off their pre-season schedule with a home match against Helensburgh which will take place at the Ropework, with a 2pm kick-off.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 32","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 6:15 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,At the latest Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Islands meeting I stated a large number of my younger constituents have been contacting me in regards to the availability of housing.While a greater number of affordable rental accommodation is more than welcome, a larger amount of affordable housing to buy needs to be built across Argyll.I was also very happy at a recent meeting with my fellow Conservative councillors to discuss the huge importance of having a more streamlined planning service that helps rather than hinders economic strength across Argyll and Bute.An effective planning system plays an important role in supporting growth – promoting and enabling the homes, jobs and services that communities need, creating a more competitive local economy and minimising uncertainty and delay for those proposing or affected by development.We in Argyll are seeing a tremendous increase in our industrial output and we as a council must not place barriers in the way of future growth in this area.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.Sir,I\u0026#8217m calling on Argyll and Bute\u0026#8217s small shopkeepers to enter the Best Small Shops competition, celebrating the creativity of small shops and the central role they play in their local community.Argyll and Bute is a hub of small local retailers, many of which are a lifeline.The Best Small Shops competition is open to any small shop operating in the UK.

Builder John MacDonald followed with colourful tales of Archie McVicar, with whom he worked as a young man. Greta Cameron talked about the early years of the Oyster Bar, established on the estate in the late 1970s by Christina\u0026#8217s brother Johnny Noble along with fish farmer Andy Lane.Piecing together records from her father\u0026#8217s journal, estate records and blending these with the recollections of the people of the estate, Christina has created a remarkable piece of work.This book is not just about the Nobles, but the Ardkinglas community, the people who make it and have made it and the story of how they lived and worked.\u0026#8216I\u0026#8217m very pleased that so many people have come along today for our launch party,\u0026#8217 said Christina.\u0026#8216Ardkinglas is a place that is very dear to me, and the place and the people have contributed to making me who I am today.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex (number two) from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray. They searched all the places they had visited, including the George, but the keys were not found, so they returned to Cairnbaan by taxi.Fortunately the hotel found the keys and managed to make contact with them, and they returned to Inveraray by taxi to collect the keys from the staff who had been kind enough to wait for them.Once again I would to thank you for your help in making my guests\u0026#8217 stay memorable.Pauline Houston, Crinan Canal CottageSir,I was very happy to attend this year\u0026#8217s Islay, Jura and Colonsay Agricultural Show.It was great to hear about the terrific work being done by the Islay Development Initiative with their Islay Pollinator Initiative which generates employment, including two Modern Apprentices in Beekeeping.I spoke to local farmers about single farm payment delays, feed prices, fuel prices, broadband speed and the poor quality of our infrastructure.

The pitch at the school is too small to host even an under-13 game.‘For Mid Argyll Rugby Club to grow, it needs to have a home to create an identity. In recent years, plans and promises to create a rugby facility have always come to nothing and the game in Mid Argyll has suffered for it.\u0026#8216We have a Scottish School cup game on Tuesday August 28 and at the moment we are still looking for a venue. How can we compete with central belt schools, or even our neighbours in Oban, who have facilities provided by the council?’The club has steadily been developing fresh talent for more than five years, but with nowhere to play it cannot field a first 15 despite plenty of willing players.The pitch project, supported by Scottish Rugby and Argyll and Bute Rugby Development Officer Allan Wright, hopes to be open by autumn 2019.Another supporter of the project is Councillor Dougie Philand, who said: ‘I have been involved with senior rugby previously and having our own pitch was always a problem.\u0026#8216I would fully support any development or plans that would promote a permanent pitch and changing areas especially now when there is a resurgence in junior rugby. I would also be happy to be involved in any negotiations to obtain the land from the council.\u0026#8217\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"russell voices opposition to inveraray rbs closure plans","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 17/08/18, 5:48 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowArgyll and Bute MSP Michael Russell has written to the external consultants considering the future of key Royal Bank of Scotland branches to express his continued opposition to closure of the Inveraray Branch.Along with nine other rural branches, Inveraray was given a stay of execution earlier this year – but if the figures do not stack up by December 2018 the busy tourist town will be left with no bank to serve residents, businesses or visitors.Mr Russell said: \u0026#8216I have been against the slew of closures in Argyll and Bute and still am, but all those threatened have now gone with the exception of Inveraray.\u0026#8216Inveraray is a tourist magnet with a need for services for those who don’t live in the area, while tourism and other businesses require banking services.\u0026#8216Argyll and Bute Council along with other agencies are working hard to reverse the depopulation of rural parts of Argyll and Bute and the removal of such a vital service can only work to undermine this.\u0026#8217Mr Russell added: \u0026#8216It should be acknowledged that as RBS is state owned, it should have a duty of care to those who rescued it from bankruptcy.

The big bird was scoffing the chips close to the Gaiety Theatre in Ayr. A grainy image of the pointless attack has only now emerged. The man is wearing what looks like a white short sleeved shirt, black trousers and white training shoes. He is seen lifting his right leg back and then battering the chip-loving gull. Any kick to a creature like this would have left it in a very painful condition or at worst cause it to die from internal injuries. The chips had already been dropped on the ground close to the junction of Carrick Street and Boswell Park and it is not been regarded as a case where the gull actually stole the grub. Ironically the bird’s attacker was also eating his own portion of takeway food. The grainy image looks to have been taken from mobile phone footage. It appears to be right outside a late night food takeaway. The bird-brained incident took place on Saturday July 28 and only yesterday (Tuesday) was it able to be made public. An undercover inspector from the charity’s special investigations unit has been working on the case. He said: “We are being assisted by Police Scotland in our investigation and we would like to trace the individual involved. “I would urge anyone who recognises him to get in touch. “ Any information given to our animal helpline is treated confidentially and can be given nonymously. “Recently we have been made aware of a number of incidents involving attacks on seagulls and would like to remind the public that gulls, like all other birds, are protected by law. “We’d encourage the public to clear up any rubbish as gulls are attracted to it as they look for food.” Anyone who thinks they know the lout or remember him from that Saturday should call the Scottish SPCA animal helpline on 03000 999 999. Ayr is in the middle of a seagull crisis at the moment with some of them attacking people including a prominent lawyer who had to fight off the attack using a rolled up copy of the Ayrshire Post. He was pecked on the top of his head in Burns Statue Square and the attack drew blood.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsPolice Scotland"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13080662.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_IBP_AYP_090818LABOUR_07JPG.jpg","title":"scottish labour leader richard leonard","story":"NewsScottish Labour leader Richard Leonard stops off in Doon ValleyHe made a good impression on a whistle-stop tour of Dalmellington and Bellsbank.Share\u0026nbspByLochlin Highet13:53, 14 AUG 2018NewsLabour leader Richard Leonard visited Dalmellington (Image: AYRSHIRE POST)Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRichard Leonard went on a charm offensive in an area that was once a Labour heartland. And he is well aware that Labour must recapture votes in places like the Doon Valley if it is to regain power at Holyrood and Westminster. “This is precisely the kind of constituency we need to win back,” admitted the Scottish Labour Party leader. He made a good impression on a whistle-stop tour of Dalmellington and Bellsbank. But time will tell whether or not this will bring voters back to the fold. Mr Leonard chatted amiably to lady volunteers at the Kirk Shop, in the middle of Dalmellington. There was clearly lots of goodwill for the Yorkshire-born politician. The affable Labour leader then moved on to Dalmellington Care Centre, where he planted a red rose to mark the 70th anniversary of the NHS. “My grandfather was a gardener, back in Leeds,” said Mr Leonard, as he wielded a spade. He heard about grassrooots co-operation in Dalmellinton among groups like The Zone and the care centre.  Mr Leonard said: “It’s the resilience of the people that’s keeping the Doon Valley going. “But it’s about time they were given a helping hand from government. “There are too many people living in poverty and on poverty pay. “We need investment in public services and we need to see communities having more control, with the possibility of community buy-outs.” Mr Leonard said only Labour is pledging a decade of investment. “We’re the only party opposing the austerity policies of the Tories, which are being passed on by the SNP.” He said the SNP’s own Growth Commission report revealed there would be even more austerity in an independent Scotland. And he was adamant: “The Labour Party is absolutely opposed to a second referendum on independence.”  Labour colleague Colin Smyth MSP said: “We’re seeing a growing frustration among voters on a debate focused on the constitution. “People want to see improvements in education and health.” Mr Leonard popped up to Bellsbank to see how streets are being transformed with ‘Balamory’ style painting of houses. In the afternoon, he visited the Sovereign Credit Union in Cumnock to hear about its services in the community. Then it was on to Tarbolton, to meet residents who are unhappy about their doctors’ surgery hours being cut, due to a shortage of GPs.

Four examples of these keeps survive in a ruinous state around Innerleithen and Traquair.\nThe walls themselves cannot speak so I have turned to Innerleithen \u0026amp Traquair, Past and Present, with an Angler\u0026rsquos Guide to the Tweed and its Tributaries (Second Edition \u0026ndash 1867), commonly called Smail\u0026rsquos Guide as it was published by Innerleithen printer Robert Smail.\nElibank Castle: \u0026ldquoAbout a mile east of Bold is Juniper Bank, near which \u0026ndash a considerable way up the hill \u0026ndash is the ruin of Elibank Tower, the ancient seat of the Murrays of Elibank, and famous for the story of Muckle-mouthed Meg, in which young Scott of Harden figured so conspicuously.

They resided in the old Tower on the hill, which is now in ruins. The Govans continued in possession of Cardrona until the latter end of the seventeenth century, when it was purchased by Mr Williamson, writer in Peebles, and Town Clerk of that burgh.

This was granted, and the work of demolition was soon begun. The roof was taken off and the chambers filled with earth, and in the course of a short time the effects of the weather made themselves apparent. The walls cracked in every direction, and large masses of the building fell.\nNext the crowbar was applied with great success and to make the appearance of an ancient ruin as near perfect as possible, a cartwheel was fixed in one of the largest rents, that the effect at a distance might be that of a venerable abbey. (Smails\u0026rsquo Guide, pp. 15 \u0026ndash 16)\nNether Horsburgh Castle: \u0026ldquo...we find that the lands of Easter Horseburgh, then called Schelynelaw, together with lands of Traquair and Innerleithen were, in 1634, in the hands of John Stewart of Traquair, who in that year was served heir to his brother Robert. The tradition in the family [Horseburgh] is that this part of the property was sold to defray the expenses of a lawsuit which had arisen between two brothers.\nAt Nether Horsburgh there are the remains of an old tower or keep, which used to be called Shillinglaw Tower. Tradition is silent respecting it, but it was probably built about the time the lands came into the possession of the Stewarts [sometime after 1550].

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre. Gilson, who spoke before and after the showing, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great pleasure to be able to finally show this in Swindon.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a film to be appreciated, and to spread a message.

The proposal to turn the library, which as built in 1905 through funds from Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, into a shared facility and move council services from their offices in the town\u0027s Aldhammer House, were first put to the public in June 2016.  But they were criticised by Prestonpans Community Council, which said merging the services would take away people\u0026rsquos views of the library as a safe and neutral area.  And at a public meeting in the town Manja Porteus, then six, whose dad Tim is a professional storyteller and Courier columnist, appealed to the council to rethink its proposals and leave the library alone.  Following a public consultation the local authority announced it had scrapped the plans in March last year stating \"the majority of respondents said that they wanted the two services to remain in separate buildings and did not want to see any changes to the Library building.\"  However the council has now said that following a service review\u0026nbspit will move a wide range of services into the library from Monday, August 27.  Housing services will continue to be dealt\u0026nbspwith at Aldhammer House.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \"As more of our customers make use of online services and library staff are readily available to help people to go online, the council has reviewed its service provision and Aldhammer House will be developed to provide complementary services which give more support to the local community.\u0026nbsp  \"Meanwhile, Prestonpans Library will be developed as a joint Library/Area Office as has been done in Dunbar, North Berwick and Tranent.\""},{"url":null,"title":"council-staff-look-after-family-of-ducklings","story":"  The mother duck arrived at the courtyard at John Muir House and found an enclosed area where she was able to keep her young safe from predators however, it was lacking a pond.

It is one of the few islands on the West Coast I don\u0026rsquot know, and for sure I will be back. It is a less-known treasure, I think.  I was camping with my family so our accommodation was pretty basic, but the kids absolutely loved it. As I write, we have just returned and I am in recovery mode from five nights under canvas.  We could afford it because my wife and I were stewards, two shifts each then we were able to access the festival. My main responsibility was the \u0026lsquobeach gate\u0026rsquo, a quieter access point which allowed festival-goers to visit the beach and return without needing to go through the main gate.  And so there I was, with a high-visibility vest and a walkie-talkie, checking people\u0026rsquos wrist bands as they left and entered. I met lots of wonderful people, but most of the time I was sitting on a mound of sand by the gate, admiring the stunning view of Ettrick Bay and the mountains of Arran in the distance.  It was a rare and wonderful time for reflection. The rest of the family were nearby but having a ball inside, so I was free to enjoy my thoughts.  There was a prehistoric standing stone circle close to the site of the festival which gave the same view I was enjoying. It made me realise that although I had vague idea of the general history of the area, I did not know the tales steeped in the landscape.  Story anchors our relationship with the land, and sitting in that beautiful and wild place made me want to make that connection there as well. I can simply enjoy a view, of course, but perhaps a burden storytellers carry is the need to pick the wisps of stories from the land wherever we go.  I thought of a possible connection with East Lothian in the travels of St Kenneth. He was a monk from Ireland and an associate of St Columba. He must have known this shore, perhaps he walked the sand of Ettrick Bay itself.  His name is embedded in many place names, both in Ireland and Scotland, and one of them is Cockenzie. The legend states that this name comes from the Gaelic Cul Cionnich, meaning Kenneth\u0026rsquos Cove.  He is said to have arrived in the small picturesque natural harbour, now called the Boat Shore, in the sixth century, and thus baptised the community with his name. The Boat Shore was for many years the harbour of what was to become the village of Cockenzie. For sure it seems the saint\u0026rsquos travels took him to the Forth valley so the legend may be rooted in a real event.  I love the Boat Shore at Cockenzie. I played there in my childhood, as so many have. Both high and low tide has it different pleasures there.  I reflected on the fact that perhaps the main difference between the Boat Shore and Ettrick Bay on Bute is not their varying size but the fact that Cockenzie is now \u0026lsquobuilt up\u0026rsquo.  Yet when I walked the shore from Port Seton to Cockenzie recently, the sea was no less dominant on my senses. In fact the remains of old salt pans, the survival of a fishing community and its traditions, the gable ends of houses facing defiantly at the sea all added to the experience.  Cockenzie is a place where the tiny threads of personal memories entwine with ancient stories and history of fishwives and fishermen, salt makers and coal miners, where the tracks of the past run literally at your feet. Yet there is still a vibrant local community, a living connection to the ancestral past. That makes the place extra special.  My thoughts were interrupted by a comment from a festival-goer: \u0026ldquoLook! That\u0026rsquos the sea, I mean the real sea, so cool. He and his friends left through the beach gate and headed down to the beach to take photos.  The comment made me realise something obvious. A real connection is the sea, and it also made me feel lucky that I live next to it.  It was on the Saturday night that the sea brought me new thoughts. The blue sky turned grey, then a dark, brooding black. The calm water began to boil with rage as it brought warm air from the south which had turned into a storm. We managed to get into our tent just in time.  Howling winds and torrential rain swept through the festival campsite like a reaper, ripping up tents. I double-pegged our tent with the help of my friend Chris Yule, and then we huddled inside as the winds did their worst. The kids were both excited and a little scared by it, but mostly excited!  The family slept as the storm howled in anger outside, the canvas walls of the tent bending this way and that. If we needed to evacuate, Chris had kindly offered the floor of his caravan as a refuge.  I lay there listening to the storm and was glad I was not at sea. My home town, Prestonpans, was born of such a storm when a pirate, possibly a Viking, was shipwrecked on the shoreline a thousand years ago. He stayed and founded the village, his name still echoed in Aldhammer House.  I stayed awake until the worst was over, then fell into sleep. In the morning, birds were singing and the sun shining. The campsite looked like a battlefield site collapsed tents and stuff blown everywhere, including a small tent blown into the hedge by us. But the festival site was repaired and a great final day had.  We took the longer, scenic route home, via Argyll\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquosecret coast\u0026rsquo, a deeply wooded and beautifully quiet part of the West Coast.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos great to be home, said my four-year-old as we arrived. It was, not least to have a shower and to eat something that wasn\u0026rsquot from a tin!  \u0026ldquoCan we go for a walk by the sea? I was asked first thing this morning.  \u0026ldquoAfter I have written my story, I replied.  \u0026ldquoWhat are you going to write about this time?  \u0026ldquoNot sure, let\u0026rsquos see what comes to my mind, I said.  And so now we will head to the Boat Shore, and the walk by the coast there.  I love living by the sea."},{"url":null,"title":"day-centre-welcomes-zambian-visitors","story":"  The centre received a visit from the country\u0026rsquos social welfare minister Emerine Kabanshi and Julien Mwape, director general of Zambia Agency for People with Disabilities (ZAPD), who are in Scotland to see firsthand a range of health and social care facilities.

Higher pass rates in English at an A-C grade were also well above the national average with 81 per cent of pupils gaining the top marks, compared to 75.9 per cent nationally.  More than 10,682 awards were certified for 2,302 candidates across the county.  National 5 pass rates at an A-C grade fell from 78.5 per cent to 75.4 per cent however, the local authority said that this was affected by the removal of monthly assessments which made up a percentage of the final mark.  The percentage of young people achieving Grade A awards in English and mathematics at Higher level is also at its highest rate in five years.  In maths 37 per cent of pupils received the top grade, while in English 31 per cent did \u0026ndash both going up by four per cent on last year.  The percentage of S6 pupils gaining one or more Advanced Highers increased by 1.5 per cent in 2018 to 22.1 per cent and showed an overall improved trend in East Lothian since 2014.  Fiona Robertson, East Lothian Council head of education, said: \u0026ldquoThese results provide a clear indication of an improving trend across our secondary schools.  \u0026ldquoIt is testament to the hard work of the students and teachers that this year has resulted in the highest level of achievement in five years.

The move comes just 16 months after a public consultation on similar plans in which three quarters of those who took part objected to the change, leading the council to scrap the proposal.  The council said the move was part of a review of its service provision however, it has been criticised for not taking the plan back to the community before making the decision.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoIt is extremely disappointing that East Lothian Council are pressing ahead with service changes in Prestonpans that were rejected last year.  \u0026ldquoPrestonpans Community Council and other local community organisations should have been consulted on these changes rather than being presented with a fait accompli and we would ask that the council assure the local community that they will consult fully on the future proposals for Aldhammer House.  The proposal to turn the library, which was built in 1905 through funds from Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, into a shared facility and move council services from their offices in the town\u0026rsquos Aldhammer House, was first put to the public in June 2016.  At the time the community council raised concerns that merging the services would take away people\u0026rsquos views of the library as a safe and neutral area.  And at a public meeting in the town Manja Porteus, then six, whose dad Tim is a professional storyteller and Courier columnist, appealed to the council to rethink its proposals and leave the library alone.  Following a public consultation, the council announced it had scrapped the plans in March last year, stating that \u0026ldquothe majority of respondents said they wanted the two services to remain in separate buildings and did not want to see any changes to the library building.  However, last week they said that a wide range of services would move into the library from August 27.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoAs more of our customers make use of online services and library staff are readily available to help people to go online, the council has reviewed its service provision and Aldhammer House will be developed to provide complementary services which give more support to the local community.  \u0026ldquoMeanwhile, Prestonpans Library will be developed as a joint library/area office as has been done in Dunbar, North Berwick and Tranent.  \u0026ldquoThis builds on the council\u0026rsquos work to strengthen our communities and support town centres such as Prestonpans with easy access to high-quality local facilities and services.  Aldhammer House will continue to be staffed by housing service staff, as well as keeping The Pantry Foodbank, Citizens Advice Bureau and local politicians\u0026rsquo surgeries. Capital Credit Union will also continue to operate part-time there. All other services will move to the library.  The changes were welcomed by some on social media, who said it had worked in other communities.  One person said: \u0026ldquoDoes it really matter where you pay your rent or fill in forms? If the council can\u0026rsquot afford it then they can\u0026rsquot afford it.  However, there was an angry response from others.  One woman said: \u0026ldquoThis is an outrage, what can we do? Are they determined to strip Prestonpans of everything?  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe changes being made differ from those proposed in 2016. Housing enquiries will continue to be dealt with at Aldhammer House, while payments for other services can be made at the library. This will in turn improve the range of services available at our improved library \u0026ndash and we are grateful for the positive feedback we have received on this from customers so far.  Tim Porteus, Prestonpans storyteller and Courier columnist, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom disappointed. I recognise the council is under pressure to make cuts but they should say that it what is about: saving money."},{"url":null,"title":"catriona-matthew-brings-solheim-cup-to-north-berwick","story":"  Matthew will captain the European team for the event \u0026ndash the female equivalent of the Ryder Cup \u0026ndash and was in her home town on Monday to start the countdown.

For some it was a practical way to live in the country they have chosen to call home for others it was a way to end anxiety over their future under Brexit.  Christa Gerdwilker, 51, has lived in Scotland for over 30 years. She and wife Susan live in East Saltoun but she said the uncertainty over what would happen when Britain leaves the European Union had prompted her to seek UK citizenship.  Christa said: \u0026ldquoBrexit is the reason I decided to apply for citizenship.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove lived here for 30 years and came with certain expectations thinking we were secure but it has pulled the rug from right under our feet and suddenly the future is uncertain.  \u0026ldquoIt has caused some sleepless nights and so it made sense to get permanent residency.  The ceremonies, which are held in East Lothian three or four times a year, are the final part of applying to become a British citizen.  Since April 2016, 103 people have taken part in a ceremony in East Lothian.  Each person who takes part is presented with a certificate confirming their residency status and a welcome pack. East Lothian Council also presents everyone who takes part in a ceremony in the county with a memento of the occasion.  The Lord Lieutenant said: \u0026ldquoFor the people here it is the end of a journey which for some has been a very long one. It can be an emotional moment for many and is important to them.  \u0026ldquoIt is extraordinary to see the range of places people are from who want to be UK citizens.  The ceremony was held in the Adam Room at John Muir House and overseen by registrar Janet Fairnie.  East Lothian Provost John McMillan and Angela Leitch, chief executive of East Lothian Council, joined the ceremony welcoming the new citizens, who were watched by family and friends invited along.  Mr McMillan told the new citizens: \u0026ldquoCitizenship brings certain privileges. You now live in a parliamentary democracy where everyone is equal in the eyes of the law. It brings with it a responsibility to treat fellow citizens with respect and be good neighbours, and to take an active part in society, which I hope you will.  Ms Leitch praised the East Lothian residents who had gained their new status.  She said: \u0026ldquoI know it has been quite a journey for some who have come through a process that many of us who have lived in this country all our lives do not have to go through.  The citizenship process involves a series of tests which those applying have to pass, quizzing them on all aspects of British life.  Mohamed Sherif, 31, an engineer from Musselburgh, has lived here for 10 years and is originally from Libya. He said: \u0026ldquoIt is a lot easier to have citizenship than have to spend a lot of money on renewing visas.  \u0026ldquoWe know we want to stay in this country so it made sense to apply.  The seven new citizens who attended were: Christa Gerdwilker (originally from Germany), East Saltoun Mohamed Sherif (Libya), Musselburgh Carmen King (Mexico), Ormiston Bernadette Fitzgerald (Australia), Tranent Diego Onate (Colombia), East Saltoun Gabriele Hegerl (Germany), East Linton John Crowley (USA), East Linton."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-a-bath-in-butterdean-wood","story":"  BEING surrounded by trees, in a wood where the world outside cannot be seen, is a primeval experience. It connects us to our ancestral origins and reasserts our relationship with nature, of which we are also a part. There are few such important gifts that we can give our children, and ourselves, than a regular forest bath.  The term forest bathing of course comes from Japan, where it was first coined in the 1980s to describe the mental health benefits of regular meditative time spend in the woods. But the spiritual and mental uplift that nature provides has long been known, and here in Scotland the Celtic tradition in particular has a powerful relationship with trees and the nature.  But we are forgetting it all. We are forgetting who we are and from what we came. And we are suffering as a result.  Another recent term is nature deficit disorder, a phrase created by Richard Louv who wrote Last Child in the Woods in 2005. While it is not an actually recognised medical condition as such, putting a name on the effects of nature deprivation has made people more aware of it.  So for my final journey of discovery this summer, I took a friend who is unused to spending time in nature for a walk in Butterdean Wood. I cannot put into words how important this place is for my family and my soul. My children have grown up, and are growing up, in this wonderful wood. It\u0026rsquos a cradle of nature where you can feel simultaneously lost and found, for the trees envelop you, as if to say \u0026ldquowelcome back.  It\u0026rsquos horrific to think that a number of years ago there was a plan to cut the wood down, but thanks to Gregor Neil Robertson and others, a campaign to save the wood, supported by Friends of the Earth, was successful.  My friend suffers from depression and anxiety. When I told him I planned a walk in a wood he protested. He has weight issues as well, and going for a walk is something he knows he should do, but doesn\u0026rsquot enjoy.  \u0026ldquoYou will enjoy this walk, I reassured him.  \u0026ldquoDon\u0026rsquot think so, was his reply, but he nonetheless finally agreed to come along, after I\u0026rsquod promised it would only be a short one.  There are different options when you begin to explore the wood, but my family have a favourite part and so that\u0026rsquos where I took him. Trees have a way of bringing feelings to the surface and soon my friend was talking about stuff.  We first wandered through the pine wood. It\u0026rsquos planted with mainly non-native pine trees but has a wonderful atmosphere.  I told him of the story about the brownie who hides in the wood, because he is fearful of humans whom he believes to be cruel after witnessing a farmer\u0026rsquos son whip a horse.  The story took us to what my children call the \u0026lsquofaerie bridge\u0026rsquo. It is here that the wood changes in character. Once across the bridge the wood is more mixed, with mainly deciduous trees: oak, rowan, ash, sycamore, beech and hazel, but also the occasional Scots pine.  \u0026ldquoCheck for something metal on you, I told my friend. He looked at me funny. \u0026ldquoEh?  \u0026ldquoSomething made of iron or metal of some kind, I reiterated.  \u0026ldquoWhat for?  \u0026ldquoWell, because the faeries live in the part of the wood across the bridge, but iron undoes their magic. So you are safe if you are wearing something made of it, I explained.  \u0026ldquoSeriously?  I just smiled. He was lucky, he had a metal strap on his watch. And so we ventured over the bridge.  This part of Butterdean Wood is vivid green in high summer. We soon reached a junction in the path.  \u0026ldquoOK, this is the short way back, we\u0026rsquoll take that. I was keeping my promise that we\u0026rsquod only go on a short walk. But my friend protested.  \u0026ldquoOh naw, let\u0026rsquos go on for a bit more, I\u0026rsquom actually enjoying this.  And so we ventured further, past the tall beech tree which still has the rough end of a rope tied round one of its upper branches. It was here, in summers about 10 years ago, my now grown-up daughters would swing on the rope swing I made for them.  We sat here for a short while so my friend could take a breath. He noticed the silence, which was then softly broken by the swish of tree tops swaying in a breeze. We sat for perhaps two minutes, not looking at each other, but just being present under the canopy of nature.  \u0026ldquoOK, he said, \u0026ldquoyou\u0026rsquore right, it is magic.  I smiled and nodded.  We walked, at a guess, over three miles through Butterdean Wood on this day. I introduced him to different trees and we paused often, soaking in the power of it all. It\u0026rsquos a place of constant minor changes, as all woods are, and it\u0026rsquos only when you visit them regularly that you notice the changes.  As we left, my friend commented on how much better he felt, how his anxiety had eased and that he\u0026rsquod want to come back with his son.  \u0026ldquoButterdean Wood would be a gift for your son, I said, \u0026ldquolet him bathe in the forest too.  We all need this, and on a regular basis. We need to find time for it, find a wood we can reach and bathe in. It benefits our health in so many ways but it also helps us to connect and have a relationship with nature. It should be a birthright of our children to run free in the wood, to explore and become part of it.  Later in the week I returned with my children. We followed our trails of memory, my older daughters walking in their own footprints of younger years, which are now overlaid with the imprint of their younger siblings. I searched but saw no signs of autumn.  But soon the summer will end, and the heatwaves of 2018 will become part of our folk memory.  Autumn in Butterdean is nature\u0026rsquos show, but it\u0026rsquos not ready for that yet, it\u0026rsquos still fully clothed in summer\u0026rsquos colours."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8195899.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=128\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"disgraceful-state-of-north-berwick-toilets-slammed","story":"  The quality of the toilets on the town\u0026rsquos Quality Street has long been lauded by residents and visitors alike, but last week it drew criticism from one resident, who contacted the Courier to offer her concerns.  Helen Mulgray wrote: \u0026ldquoI was shocked to see how the cleanliness of the toilets had deteriorated.  \u0026ldquoThese once highly praised, award-winning toilets have been degraded to become offensive and at times a health hazard \u0026ndash no soap to wash hands and no toilet paper unless [it is] picked off the floor.  She described the condition of the toilets as a \u0026ldquodisgraceful memory of a visit to North Berwick for the thousands of visitors that flock to the town every summer.  East Lothian Council is currently proposing to cut the permanent toilet attendants at the county\u0026rsquos public loos and instead see them maintained by an extended team of mobile attendants.  Ms Mulgray slammed the council for the proposal, adding: \u0026ldquoImplementing the proposed plan to do away with full-time attendants means this mess will be a permanent sight for visitors to the toilets.  \u0026ldquoIt takes no account of the crowds coming from the beach until late, busloads stopping at the car park, and events like the Fringe [by the Sea] and the [Highland] Games.  \u0026ldquoIs saving money this way more important than the tourist image of North Berwick?  Ms Mulgray added that when she returned to the toilets last Monday, they were \u0026ldquospotless.  She put the improvements down to the fact that the usual full-time attendant had returned from annual leave.  Ms Mulgray wrote to the council to express her concerns about the toilets being allowed to deteriorate last week and, in a response seen by the Courier, Lorraine Faulds, senior officer of facilities management, wrote: \u0026ldquoLooking at your specific concerns with North Berwick toilets, it has been maintained by a combination of permanent and mobile attendants for more than six years.  \u0026ldquoThis pattern has ensured appropriate levels of cleanliness throughout the year and includes recognition of the busier summer months.  \u0026ldquoWe are aware that at any toilet, on any occasion, whether by intent or accident, toilets or sinks can be blocked by paper or left as debris.  \u0026ldquoFortunately these remain isolated incidents at our sites and North Berwick toilets actually have a more frequent attendance by the mobile attendants than some of our other sites.  She said the emptying of sanitary bins would increase from once a week to twice due to Ms Mulgray\u0026rsquos complaint of them \u0026ldquooverflowing.  The letter added: \u0026ldquoWe take our service provision extremely seriously and aim to maintain the very high standards of our public toilets.

It comes as the number of lairs at Deer Park Cemetery, opposite where the proposed new burial ground would be sited, reaches a dangerously low figure.  Ward councillor Norman Hampshire stressed the importance of new burial spaces being created in the town.  Mr Hampshire, chairman of the council planning committee, was unable to comment on the merits of any specific application because of his role on the committee.  But he said: \u0026ldquoI have been told by officers, early next year there will be no spaces available in the cemetery.  \u0026ldquoIt would mean people in the community would need to be buried outwith the town, which would not be acceptable to people. There is a desperate need for [a new] cemetery within Dunbar.  The proposed new cemetery comes as part of a controversial planning application approved by the planning committee last year.  More than 100 houses are set to be built on land at Newtonlees Farm, despite the site being outwith the sites identified at that stage by the council\u0026rsquos Local Development Plan and recommended for refusal by planning officers.  Mr Hampshire ultimately had the casting vote on the Gladman Developments scheme after the vote at the council meeting was tied at 4-4.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe original proposal had been to extend the existing cemetery.  \u0026ldquoHowever, when the consent was given for a housing development along with the golf course at Dunbar Golf Club, the land was not secured at that time by the council.  \u0026ldquoThere have now been more burials in the cemetery and the way the layout is the bit of land that was available to purchase would not have created the substantial extension that would have been viable for the future in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoThat is why the council had to look at alternative sites to create a new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoThe two cemeteries are very close to each other.  \u0026ldquoThere will be parking still available in the old Deer Park site and some new parking created within the new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoI think the two will work well together and be a cemetery which is available for a long number of years and satisfy the needs of the Dunbar community.  Deer Park Cemetery opened in 1953 and is expected, according to East Lothian Council, to reach capacity by the summer of 2020.  There are a total of 1,300 lairs in Deer Park cemetery, which are expected to be full within 18-24 months.  A spokeswoman for the council said: \u0026ldquoThe size of the proposed cemetery is approximately 1.2 hectares offering 2,000 lairs, 700 ashes-only lairs and an area for woodland burial.

Jan Wilson, chairwoman of the community council, said: \u0026ldquoWhere the surgery is at the moment is central.  \u0026ldquoI think as far as I am led to believe there is supposed to be a doctors\u0026rsquo surgery in the Letham Main development.

He said: \u0026ldquoIt is the same issues around working with a town that has got a good town square and you need to look at car parking.  \u0026ldquoWe are looking at that in a measured way and working in partnership.  \u0026ldquoIt is the same with families with young children coming in and an ageing population.  \u0026ldquoYou have to look at schools and the health service as well."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8207400.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"pear-tree-nursery-set-to-create-up-to-30-jobs-in-haddington","story":"  Pear Tree Nursery has opened a second facility in the town in a former bed and breakfast on West Road.  The new nursery, which saw more than 200 interested parents attend its open day last month, could employ up to 30 staff when it is at capacity, with six already recruited.  Nicola Pryde, director of the nursery group, which is already open on Meadowpark and has another facility in Dunblane, Stirling, said that the new centre had been opened to meet demand as the town sees more families moving in.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe wanted a second site because of the waiting list we had at Meadowpark and were delighted to be able to take on the former B\u0026ampB on West Road.  \u0026ldquoOur open day showed how much nursery places are in demand and with all the new houses being built we knew there was a need for it.  \u0026ldquoWe are delighted to have a second nursery in Haddington.  The new nursery, which features a giant indoor sandpit and separate baby unit with a sensory room and quiet areas, was officially opened by East Lothian MSP Iain Gray on Thursday, July 26.  He said: \u0026ldquoPear Tree Nursery has been doing a great job for many Haddington families in recent years \u0026ndash including my own grandsons. I have seen for myself on lots of occasions the great atmosphere in the existing nursery, and have watched that reflected in the many national awards Pear Tree has won for the quality of their provision.  \u0026ldquoI was delighted to help open the new Pear Tree on West Road. This is a beautiful building and it has been fitted out to provide the best of care. Not only will it increase the availability of childcare, but it will create a significant number of new jobs in the town too.  \u0026ldquoThis is now a highly qualified and professional sector, and Pear Tree has a great track record on staff support and training, so these are excellent opportunities for local people.  \u0026ldquoWith childcare entitlement expanding and Haddington also increasing in size, this is a much-needed and welcome facility."},{"url":null,"title":"in-this-weeks-courier","story":"  HADDINGTON...

If approved, the merger would follow the expected merger of Haddington Infant School and King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School, which have Jacqui McKinnon, headteacher at Cockenzie Primary School, as interim headteacher until their formal merger goes ahead.  According to the Prestonpans proposal, the two schools would \u0026lsquoclose\u0026rsquo in February \u0026ldquoor as soon as possible thereafter, with a new non-denominational primary school then created. The town\u0026rsquos St Gabriel\u0026rsquos Primary School would be unaffected.  The merged school would continue to operate over the two sites within the existing buildings and facilities, but with a single management team.  Currently, Prestonpans Infant and Nursery School, on West Loan, has a school roll of 358 up to P3, with the primary school, on Preston Road, home to 332 pupils from P4 to P7.  The leadership of Prestonpans Early Learning and Childcare Centre, which opened last year on Kirk Street to provide additional nursery places for the town, would also transfer to the headteacher of the new single school structure if the move goes ahead.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, was surprised to hear the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoFirstly, I would like to see the details of it and what is behind the proposals because the infant school is a superbly-run school and works exceptionally well.  \u0026ldquoThe primary school is a very well-run and successful school as well \u0026ndash we have got two very well-run and successful schools.  \u0026ldquoWe would need to look at what the implications are.  Fiona Robertson, East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos head of education, stressed the local authority was \u0026ldquoabsolutely committed to continuously improving the quality of education at the two schools.  She said: \u0026ldquoOur Education Service Local Improvement Plan sets out a range of key outcomes, one of which is to ensure consistency in our approaches to planning learning, teaching and assessment.  \u0026ldquoWe believe that the proposal to establish a single school operating under a single management team offers the best solution to ensuring this consistency, improving transitions for children, and will deliver considerable educational benefits to all of the schools\u0026rsquo children and young people.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet member for education and children\u0026rsquos services, said: \u0026ldquoOur first priority is to ensure that we provide the best educational experiences and outcomes for the children and young people of Prestonpans. The consultation process will focus on how we do this through an educational benefit statement.  \u0026ldquoWe have already informed the chairs of the parent councils of this proposal.  \u0026ldquoAll parents, carers and the wider school community will have the opportunity to comment on the proposal once the consultation has been published and the statutory consultation period begins on Monday.  The consultation runs to October 2, with drop-in sessions held at both schools next month.  Prestonpans Infant School hosts a consultation event on September 4 from noon to 5pm, with the primary school event taking place a week later between the same times.

The scheme will apply to the section of the town north of the railway line, with major roads such as Belhaven Road also included.  All roads affected previously had 30mph speed limits.  The new order, which is an experimental order, will mirror what is already in place south of the East Coast Mainline in the Hallhill area of the town, where all the streets, with the exception of Kellie Road, are 20mph.  Herbert Coutts, from the town\u0026rsquos community council, has been heavily involved in moving the project forward and was pleased to see progress being made.  He said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased about it because that is what essentially the research carried out by the community council demonstrated. There was public support for it in Dunbar and it will be good to see it going ahead and I am hopeful the outcome will be positive.  Mr Coutts stressed that the change in speed limit would not see an end to speeding but he felt it would help improve people\u0026rsquos safety.  He added: \u0026ldquoIt was never thought by people supporting it that it was a magic answer to all our speeding problems but a step in the right direction and people become accustomed to going at 20mph in the town.  \u0026ldquoThereby the safety of pedestrians \u0026ndash particularly children and elderly but people of any age \u0026ndash will be enhanced.  \u0026ldquoThat is the hope and hopefully people will observe it.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe order has been made and we are just awaiting the appropriate signage, which should be within the next month.  \u0026ldquoThe order will be for an 18-month period and is an experimental order.  If the order is deemed a success, steps will be taken to see the 20mph speed limit become a permanent fixture.  Feedback from members of the public could also help decide whether any roads become exempt from the 20mph speed limit in the future.  Currently there are no plans for traffic calming measures, such as speed humps or chicanes, on the streets affected by the new speed limit.  The 20mph speed limit starts to the west of Edinburgh Road\u0026rsquos junction with Shore Road and Beveridge Row.

The findings come at the same time as overall employment in the county has increased slightly.  Figures show that the number of people in either part-time or full-time employment in East Lothian rose to 78.6 per cent between April 2017 and March 2018, an increase of 3.6 per cent from the previous year, when the rate was at 75 per cent.  Councillor Brian Small, leader of the opposition Conservative Group on East Lothian Council, said: \u0026ldquoObviously the fact that 4,000 households are without work is worrying.  \u0026ldquoWork isn\u0026rsquot only important for the financial benefits to those in employment, it also generates health and social benefits for them.  \u0026ldquoHaving something to get up in the morning for is good for you.  \u0026ldquoBut we have to welcome that East Lothian is better than both the UK and Scottish average but there is still more that can and should be done to get people back into work.  Peter Dicker of East Lothian Foodbank, based in Tranent, said: \u0026ldquoAlthough the statistics for the increase in the population in work is encouraging, the foodbank can only comment on the fact that over the same period that the statistics were compiled for April 2017 to March 2018 we here at East Lothian Foodbank experienced a 12 per cent increase on the number of referrals we had sent to us \u0026ndash this 12 per cent compares to a national average of a 13 per cent increase on referrals (Trussell Trust stats).  \u0026ldquoSince the introduction of Universal Credit in April 2016 we have seen an increase in people being referred to us by over 45 per cent (April 16 to March 17 was 37 per cent increase).  The figures from the ONS estimate that last year 14 per cent of households in East Lothian were workless, lower than the Scotland-wide average of 18 per cent.  County MP Martin Whitfield said: \u0026ldquoClearly the increase in the local employment rate over the last year is welcome. However, the fact there are still many people out of work remains a concern. It underlines the complacency of the UK Government, which is simply not doing enough to help people into work.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council, through its East Lothian Works employability service, is doing a good job supporting jobseekers, but both the UK and Scottish Governments must do more to enhance prosperity and create new jobs.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray added: \u0026ldquoI welcome the fact that East Lothian\u0026rsquos employment rate is higher than the Scottish average. However, too many local people are still not in work. We need a fundamental shift in how we grow our economy.  \u0026ldquoWe also need to ensure opportunities for creating these kind of jobs locally are maximised at the former Cockenzie Power Station site and the new innovation park at QMU.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoUnemployment figures in East Lothian are following a positive trend as there are over three per cent more people in employment now compared to last year.  \u0026ldquoThe council continues to strive to grow East Lothian\u0026rsquos economy and to make it the best place in Scotland to live, work and do business and we would very much hope our employment figures will continue to rise year-on-year as a result of this work.  \u0026ldquoIt is difficult to comment in detail on the figure of 4,000 households being classed as out of work as it\u0026rsquos unclear, as yet, exactly how this figure has been calculated.  \u0026ldquoIt is also important to note that the roll-out of full service Universal Credit in East Lothian has had an effect on the recording of our out-of-work levels so this too needs to be looked at more closely.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Works continues to support people of all ages and abilities to gain skills, re-train and undertake courses and work experience to get them back into rewarding employment, working closely with employers and education providers. There are also many initiatives to support the most vulnerable in our society, including those living in poverty, including projects initiated by our area partnerships designed to meet the needs of our very different communities across East Lothian.  Across Scotland, the most common reason people gave for not being in work was being sick or disabled \u0026ndash 37 per cent of out-of-work individuals cited illness or disability as the primary reason.  Students made up 13 per cent of the group, and 18 per cent were early retirees, with 10 per cent of jobless people in the area officially \u0026lsquounemployed\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash looking for work and able to start within two weeks.  A spokesperson from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said: \u0026ldquoSince 2010 the proportion of workless households is down in every region of Great Britain.  \u0026ldquoThe unemployment rate remains at its lowest since 1971, but we\u0026rsquore committed to ensuring that everyone who wants to work has the opportunity to do so \u0026ndash while making sure there is a safety net for those who can\u0026rsquot.  The DWP has also said that the majority of employment growth has been in both full-time and permanent roles.  David Leese, policy analysis manager at charity the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said that workless families in particular were at a much higher risk of poverty.  Figures from the DWP for 2016-17 show that in workless households nearly 75 per cent of children were growing up in poverty, compared to only five per cent of children with two working parents.  \u0026ldquoIf a child lives in poverty, it affects their health, their education, their family relationships and their plans for the future, Mr Leese said. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos not right that any child lives in such insecure circumstances."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-courier-pet-idol-see-the-top-50","story":"  Pictured here are all the 50 pets still in the running.

Among the East Lothian pubs to have permanently closed during this period are the Elphinstone Arms in Elphinstone The Hub in Tranent the Bay Horse in Haddington and The Hayweights, Burgh and Mrs Forman\u0026rsquos in Musselburgh.  The figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that in 2010 there were about 55 pubs and bars in East Lothian but by 2017 that had fallen to about 45.  Michael Peters, who is behind The New Pheasant in Haddington \u0026ndash which opened this week at the site of the former Pheasant, which shut in 2009 \u0026ndash was not surprised by the figures.  He said that there were a variety of reasons for the decline in the number of pubs, including the lowering of the drink-drive limit in Scotland in 2014, issues with breweries, and the state of the economy.  Mr Peters felt that there was a real need for pubs in towns and villages and said: \u0026ldquoI am not biased but every town needs a pub.  \u0026ldquoIt is not just for drinking but socialising and the community \u0026ndash nothing would be happening. Most things that happen \u0026ndash golf trips, football, anything like that \u0026ndash it is organised when you are in the pub.  \u0026ldquoWhere do most people socialise?  Across the UK, 5,745 pubs closed over the same period, and there are 54 local authorities across the country where 30 or more shut.  Pubs have been pointing the finger of blame at the taxman for their troubles, complaining about the duty on beer, VAT levels and the cost of business rates.  Britain\u0026rsquos Beer Alliance, a group of organisations in the pub and brewing sector, has started a campaign called Long Live the Local with a petition and calls for people to write to their MP to have beer duty reduced.  The latest data from the ONS shows that between 2016 and 2017, 655 pubs and bars across the UK called time for the last time.  In East Lothian there was a slight upturn in that period, with numbers up by about five.  A change in consumer habits, with people drinking at home more often, has been blamed for fewer people visiting pubs.  There are 21 areas of the country that have bucked the decline and have more pubs now than they had in 2010. Top of the list is Hackney in East London, which had 55 more bars in 2017 than it did in 2010."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8263378.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"new-world-record-set-at-haddington-rugby-club","story":"  A total of 458 men, women and children took to the pitch at Neilson Park on Sunday as part of the Haddington 700 celebrations.

He said: \u0026ldquoThe day was a fantastic occasion despite the worst day of weather all summer, and we were delighted by the huge effort and support from the club and the rugby and local communities in getting past the record.  \u0026ldquoAs a celebration of the town\u0026rsquos 700 years of the Royal Charter it was a great success, with the match kicked off by Provost John McMillan, and great support from the town, with particular thanks to the boys\u0026rsquo football team who arrived late on, like the cavalry, to help get us over the line.  \u0026ldquoMore than that, though, it was brilliant to see players [aged] from five to 73 enjoying our great game, with several cases of three generations from the same family playing at the same time, including one connected family group of 18.  \u0026ldquoThis is the power of rugby.

The match between Haddington President\u0026rsquos XV and Haddington Barbarians XV was kicked off by Provost John McMillan.  The councillor, who previously played for Murrayfield 3rds, said: \u0026ldquoIt was a real honour. I have not played rugby for well over 40 years and it was an amazing day, with a great turnout.  \u0026ldquoIt was very well-organised, despite the horrific weather.

That includes putting head offices for Inch Cape and the Scottish Government energy interests in one part of the site, identified as its \u0026lsquoEnergy Quarter\u0026rsquo.  It also floats the idea of flooding the power station footprint to create a marina \u0026ndash as suggested by a local fisherman \u0026ndash with associated retail and leisure facilities, attracting businesses such as a film studio or 3D printing innovation to the site, or even creating a brewery.  Graeme Jeffrey, community council chairman, said: \u0026ldquoAs a community council we are promoting our vision of what we would like to see. It supports the masterplan, looking at how it could be delivered.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe have set out our ambitions for a public energy company and its contribution towards tackling fuel poverty.  \u0026ldquoWe will be consulting on proposals later in the year and will make sure that Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council have an opportunity to provide their views."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8263580.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"whats-on-this-weekend-five-ideas-of-things-to-do-in-east-lothian","story":"  1.

Ms McAliskey became the youngest ever MP in Mid-Ulster in 1969 and has devoted much of her life to combating exclusion and helping minorities in Co Tyrone.  She addressed a conference marking the first civil rights march 50 years ago from Coalisland to Dungannon.  \u0026ldquoWe are on a hiding to nothing changing racism and sectarianism.  \u0026ldquoI run out of patience with that house on the hill. We deserve better and we should bulldoze the place.  Stormont has been suspended for months in a row between Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionists over identity issues like the Irish language.  In the 1960s, Ms McAliskey was a leading figure in the student civil rights movement, which drew inspiration from similar action in the US.  The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association\u0026nbsphighlighted discrimination against Catholics over issues like jobs and housing and sought voting rights for all.  Many unionists felt it aimed to create a united Ireland.  Ms McAliskey said racism and sectarianism were like rapidly spreading ragweed.  \u0026ldquoIf you take your eye off them in any time or place or generation they will reassert themselves, every single day.  She said people do not understand racism in the way they do sectarianism.  \u0026ldquoWe are the victims of sectarianism, the whole community, and we are the beneficiaries of racism.  \u0026ldquoWe have to change how we view the past, not simply how we view the present or the future, or we don\u0026rsquot understand the need to fundamentally change.  She said legislation addressing racism is not enforced properly and claimed Stormont had treated the Human Rights Commission with \u0026ldquoabject disrespect and failed to create a Northern Ireland Human Rights Act.  \u0026ldquoWe are fundamentally racist. We think we know a great deal of history and we know none.  A march is planned from Coalisland to Dungannon on Saturday afternoon retracing the route of the original parade of the civil rights era amid protests\u0026nbspabout unionist discrimination in the allocation of housing.  It was a reaction to the earmarking of Dungannon public housing to a single Protestant woman with less housing need than many Catholic families on the waiting list.

At an employment tribunal in Aberdeen in June the 49-year-old Canadian national said she felt intimidated after being sent anonymous cards, claiming she was targeted with sexual harassment and for being a woman, as well as over her age.  The abuse was said to have taken place between 2015 and 2017 while she was based in the government body\u0027s Scrabster office in the Highlands and continued after she was signed off.

The council said it is the first local authority in the UK to offer free sanitary provision in all of its public buildings.  It comes after the local authority introduced free sanitary products in its secondary schools last August, with young women accessing more than 13,000 free sanitary towels and tampons while at school in the last year.  Council leader Joe Cullinane said: \"Sanitary products are a necessity, not a choice. I wish for no women or girl here in North Ayrshire to find themselves in the embarrassing and often degrading situation of having to use improper sanitary protection simply because they cannot afford it.  \"After all, periods are not exempt from poverty - they don\u0027t take account of what is in your pocket or purse. Therefore, it is absolutely right that we should look at ways in which to tackle this gendered inequality.  \"This latest announcement in our period poverty programme aims to help address the issue and make period poverty history in North Ayrshire.\"  A study published by girls\u0027 rights charity Plan International UK earlier this year found that 45% of those living in Scotland said they have been forced to use makeshift sanitary wear including socks or newspapers because they have struggled to buy products.  The Scottish Government is rolling out a project to provide free sanitary products to women from low-income households across Scotland following a pilot scheme in Aberdeen, while free sanitary products will also be available to those at school, college or university from this month.  Scottish Labour MSP Monica Lennon, who is bringing forward a Member\u0027s Bill to create a statutory duty for free provision of sanitary products, welcomed the scheme in North Ayrshire.  She said: \"Councillor Cullinane and North Ayrshire Council are leading the way on ending period poverty.  \"Access to sanitary products should be a right, regardless of your income, which is why I am moving ahead with plans for legislation to introduce a universal system of free access to sanitary products for everyone in Scotland.  \"I\u0027m delighted that North Ayrshire will extend free sanitary product provision to all of its public buildings and I hope other organisations will follow their lead.  \"No-one should face the indignity of being unable to access these essential products to manage their period.\""},{"url":null,"title":"universal-basic-income-is-attempt-to-euthanise-the-working-class-as-a-concept","story":"  Tom Kibasi, director of the left-wing Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), insisted the scheme was to the UK\u0027s economic problems \"what snake oil is to medicine\".  He argued it would mean \"getting into bed with the billionaires\" by letting capitalism off the hook and entrenching power inequalities.  It comes after Nicola Sturgeon pledged to fund research into a universal basic income (UBI) last year, with \u0026pound250,000 set aside for potential pilots in four council areas. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has also said pilots could be included in the next Labour manifesto.  Mr Kibasi was debating the issue at the Edinburgh International Book Festival with economist and basic income campaigner Annie Miller and economist and journalist Stewart Lansley.  Ms Miller, co-founder of Citizen\u0026rsquos Basic Income Network Scotland, suggested every adult could be paid \u0026pound162 a week. This would be funded by hiking income tax to at least 45%.  The IPPR previously said such a scheme would cost \u0026pound20 billion a year in Scotland and would risk making child poverty worse.  Agreeing the economy is in crisis and in need of fundamental reform, Mr Kibasi said a basic income was seductive \"precisely because it\u0027s a big idea, but the problem is that big ideas aren\u0027t necessarily good ideas\".  He added: \"My real objection to UBI is that it lets capitalism off the hook. It is giving in, it is embracing defeat.\"  He said the policy was widely supported by Silicon Valley tycoons such as Elon Musk, former Google chairman Eric Schmidt and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg \u0026ndash as well as Richard Branson.  He continued: \"In politics you always get strange bedfellows \u0026ndash that\u0027s absolutely the case. But if you\u0027re going to get into bed with the billionaires, you\u0027ve got to ask yourself, \u0027Why are they in favour of it?\u0027  \"The reason is that UBI actually maintains unequal power relations.\"  He said introducing a basic income risked leaving 20 or 30 per cent of the population as a \u0026ldquodependent class, and insisted it was \u0026ldquotrying to attempt a form of kind of euthanasia for the working class as a political category and a political concept.  Dismissing the idea as \u0026ldquomagical thinking, he argued money should instead be spent on building good homes, boosting the budget of the NHS or improving schools.  He also insisted UBI would \"solidify and reinforce\" gender inequality, because women would come under pressure to stay at home and look after their children.  He added: \"UBI is to our economic problems what snake oil is to medicine.\"  Glasgow, Edinburgh, Fife and North Ayrshire councils are all considering basic income pilots.  They will be ready to begin their trials in March 2020 \u0026ndash subject to a final decision on whether or not the proposals are feasible.  Supporters deny the scheme is being held up as a \"silver bullet\" that will solve all of society\u0027s problems.  Ms Miller said UBI would help \"emancipate\" people and prevent poverty, and branded the current social security system \u0026ldquovery cruel.  But she said it would need to be introduced gradually to prevent disruption and allow the system to settle in.  She said UBI would live up to the four words engraved on the mace in the Scottish Parliament: justice, integrity, compassion and wisdom.  \"I can\u0027t think of a better foundation for a society than a basic income, bringing about some of these changes that I hope will happen,\" she added.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe are interested in any proposals to help reduce poverty and inequality.  \"We have awarded \u0026pound250,000 over the next two years to four local authorities developing work that seeks to better understand the impact of a citizen\u0026rsquos basic income \u0026ndash including costs, benefits and savings."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8251269.jpg?type=article-full","title":"fans-take-high-road-for-last-runrig-gigs","story":"  Tens of thousands of fans are this weekend making one last pilgrimage to hear Runrig play Loch Lomond. For they and their true loves - as the band\u0026rsquos floorfilling cover nearly goes - will never meet again.  The six-piece has sold 47,000 tickets for farewell concerts in Stirling today and tomorrow that will bring down the curtain on 45 years of their groundbreaking brand of Celtic folk rock.  Their fans - many in the Hebrides - have struggled to afford or arrange the journey with Calmac warning ferries were full and extra flights from the islands put on to cater for extra demand.  Against a backdrop of Stirling Castle, Runrig will perform, for just two last times, what amounts soundtrack of the last few turbulent decades of Scottish history, through two devolution referendums and 2014\u0026rsquos big vote.  The group - despite some changed faces - says it has a special bond with its fans, many of whom were enjoying rock in their own language for the first time. But the time, the musicians said, had come to bow out.  Vocalist Bruce Guthro said: \u0026ldquoI think we\u0026rsquore ready. I think we\u0026rsquore very proud of what we\u0026rsquove accomplished and we\u0026rsquore ready to give Scotland the show of a lifetime.  The Canadian, who has been touring with Runrig for 20 years, said of his time with the group: \u0026ldquoAll of it has been special. It\u0026rsquos almost impossible to pick certain highlights - it\u0026rsquos just been a great journey.  \u0026ldquoThe fans are are a family unto themselves and they are without question the driving force behind this band.  Since forming on Skye in 1973, Runrig have produced 14 studio albums and performed at Edinburgh Castle, the Royal Albert Hall and in New York\u0026rsquos Times Square.  They are hailed for their contribution to Scottish music, the Gaelic language and Scotland\u0026rsquos cultural identity. Though they were never entirely happy to be seen as a kitsch symbol of Scottishness.    Founding member Rory MacDonald said it is a love of performing that has kept the group going through the decades.  The bass player said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove tended just to go from album to album, we\u0026rsquove never had a grand plan, or the idea we\u0026rsquore going to take over the world - none of that stuff.  \u0026ldquoVery early on, maybe after the third album, we knew very much that this was what we wanted to do with our lives. It wasn\u0026rsquot for fame or fortune, it was just that we loved playing music and playing together.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove always had that sense of being comfortable with what we\u0026rsquore doing. That\u0026rsquos the way it has worked for us.  Guitarist Malcolm Jones added: \u0026ldquoIf you\u0026rsquod said then that 45 years later we\u0026rsquod still be doing this, you\u0026rsquod have thought no way, not a chance.  Jones said concerts - called Last Dance - marked the end of an era for the band but other projects would continue, including looking after the group\u0026rsquos legacy.  Keyboard player Brian Hurren admitted there has been nerves ahead of the final concerts.  He said: \u0026ldquoI would say it\u0026rsquos unlike any other show I\u0026rsquove experienced with the band. I\u0026rsquove had sleepless nights and I\u0026rsquove had elation and excitement, sadness - everything. It\u0026rsquos been an incredible journey.  \u0026ldquoThere are a lot of fans that can\u0026rsquot get to see us because they\u0026rsquore in Australia or places that are just too far away, but they have been trying to make it over for this show, which is amazing.  Meeting the band ahead of the concerts, Scotland\u0026rsquos Deputy First Minister John Swinney thanked Runrig for their \u0026ldquoextraordinary contribution to Scotland\u0026rsquos cultural life.  He tweeted: \u0026ldquoA very special privilege to thank Runrig1973 on behalf of Scottish Government for all they have done to strengthen Scottish traditional music, the Gaelic language and Scotland in 45 years of amazing music.  \u0026ldquoThey have been such an important part of Scotland\u0026rsquos incredible journey.    Mr Swinney\u0026rsquos SNP colleague Pete Wishart MP formerly played keyboards for the band. Mr Wishart had said he would never join the SNP when interviewed in 1991.  Speaking to writer Peter Ross in last weekend\u0026rsquos Herald Magazine, Mr Wishart stressed his band\u0026rsquos part in helping Scotland learning to love and appreciate a sense of itself as confident and assertive. He added: \u0026ldquoAll the other political changes could never have happened without a feeling that what we have in Scotland is important and worth celebrating.  The band did not write Loch Lomond.

Indicted on charges of espionage, links to terrorist organisations and collaborating with a Muslim sect to overthrow the Turkish government, Andrew Brunson, has soured relations between Ankara and Washington and plunged Turkey into a currency crisis.  Ever since his arrest in 2016 this middle-aged evangelical American pastor and missionary has not only become something of a martyr in the eyes of the US Christian right, but more recently a convenient cause celebre for US President Donald Trump and vice president Mike Pence, the latter sharing Mr Brunson\u0026rsquos evangelical faith.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspTurkey, Trump and Brexit continue to weigh on stocks and pound  The story of Andrew Brunson\u0026rsquos journey to the epicentre of the current diplomatic crisis between the US and Turkey is a peculiar one.  Prior to his arrest Mr Brunson who is originally from North Carolina, ran the small Church of the Resurrection in the western Turkish city of Izmir.  Arrested in the aftermath of the 2016 attempted coup against Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he was accused of working with the Fethullah Gulen network, a movement supporting the US-based Turkish cleric that is widely believed to have orchestrated the attempted putsch.  He is also accused of assisting the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which both Ankara and Washington list as a \u0026ldquoterrorist organisation.  As Mr Brunson\u0026rsquos cause was subsequently picked up by evangelicals in the US, political pressure began to grow, and Washington attempted to cut a deal with Turkey, the Trump administration subsequently dissuading Congress from immediate sanctions on Ankara.  By September of last year though, Mr Erdogan sought to use the pastor as a bargaining chip in Ankara\u0026rsquos long-running battle to secure the extradition of alleged coup plotter Mr Gulen.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspIn the shadow of Erdogan -\u0026nbspinterview with Turkish theatre director Murat Daltaban  \u0026ldquoYou have a pastor too, the Turkish president told the Americans. \u0026ldquoGive him to us. Then we will try Brunson and give him to you.  The Trump administration refused to play on the deal and dug in its heels. The culmination has been the current spat that has divided two Nato members, caused a war of words between two firebrand presidents, and seen the Turkish economy plummet.  Right now this is how the situation stands, and on the face of it, Mr Brunson remains seemingly at the core of the crisis. But there are other much deeper diplomatic, geo-political and economic factors at play here too.  Last week Mr Erdogan in a New York Times op-ed outlined his country\u0026rsquos grievances toward the US, making clear that unilateral actions against Ankara by Washington would only undermine American interests and force Turkey to look for other friends and allies elsewhere.  It was a scarcely veiled threat and one that did not go down well at the White House. It came too against a backdrop of even more complex tensions between the two nations.  Chief among these are arms deals, sanctions on Iran and Turkey\u0026rsquos increasingly ambivalent role in the US and western fight against the self proclaimed Islamic State (IS|) group in Syria.  To take the arms deals first, right now Washington is none to happy at Ankara\u0026rsquos plans to buy the S-400 advanced air-defence system from Russia.  Should Turkey do so, it would mean it both operating the F-35, the newest high-tech jet in the American military inventory, while depending on Russia for maintenance and spare parts for the S-400.  Such a scenario would put Moscow in the position to glean valuable intelligence on how to detect the US plane. Already Turkey has paid $1billion for the aircraft, but a delegation of US senators told Mr Erdogan in no uncertain terms during a visit to Ankara last month that the US Congress would block the transfer of the F-35s if his country deployed the Russian S-400.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspHeavy equipment brought in to move rubble from Genoa bridge collapse  The tension with the US around the arms deals issue has only been compounded of course by Mr Erdogan\u0026rsquos increasing diplomatic courting of Russia and threats to Washington of looking for allies elsewhere.  Which brings us then to the second of the three main grievances between the two countries, sanctions imposed on Iran. With the Trump administration having declared it will block any country that defies the measures it has recently taken over renewed sanctions on Iran, Turkey is faced with a difficult decision.  According to analysts at the US based independent intelligence group Stratfor, given that Iran is almost entirely dependent on imports to meet its fossil fuel needs, the return of sanctions on Iranian energy exports will mean either falling in line with the US or facing the consequences from Washington.  Given the current mood between them it\u0026rsquos extremely unlikely that the Trump administration would even consider granting Turkey a waiver to continue importing oil and gas from Iran. Given too that Ankara\u0026rsquos relations with other potential suppliers such as Iraq and Saudi Arabia are so bad, it leaves Mr Erdogan in something of a bind.  Which brings us to the last of the three most pressing issues rankling both countries. For some time now the Turks have been further complicating the US fight against the jihadists of IS by forcing Washington into protracted negotiations on the use of the crucial Incirlik Air Base that sits on Turkish soil.  Even worse, Ankara working in conjunction with Syrian armed Islamist groups, has launched incursions into northern Syria taking cities like Afrin and targeting Washington\u0026rsquos Kurdish allies.  Only this month Amnesty International reported that Turkish forces are giving these same Syrian armed groups free rein to commit serious human rights abuses against civilians in Afrin. For his part too Mr Erdogan has even gone so far as to threaten US troops operational in the area alongside Kurdish forces.  Yesterday against this bitter backdrop Turkey\u0026rsquos battered lira weakened more than 6 per cent against the dollar, after another US warning that Ankara should expect more economic sanctions unless it hands over detained American pastor Andrew Brunson.  Whether Mr Erdogan decides that such a concession is necessary remains to be seen. Even should he make such a gesture though, there is more than enough bad blood between him and Mr Trump to guarantee other and possibly even more serious showdowns ahead."},{"url":null,"title":"kevin-mckenna-why-i-question-the-motives-of-those-who-seek-to-bury-corbyn","story":"  Flowing from this are other principles: that a child has a right to an education and healthcare that is not based on the ability of his family to pay for it and that the innate humanity of the person will be upheld and protected from forces that would seek to erode these. This doesn\u0026rsquot mean that a degree of capitalism or financial speculation isn\u0026rsquot permitted but it does hold that the profit motive can never take precedence over the basic human right to dignity and respect.  Other beliefs in the catechism of the leftie are a little more uncertain and can be subject to the influences of a person\u0026rsquos religious faith or ethnic custom. Indeed the right to practise a religious faith at all and to be permitted to express your ethnic and cultural identity evoke a civilised, enlightened and just society that is at peace with itself. Nor should those rights rest on the mere numbers of those who identify as such.  If you were to unravel the DNA of my own belief structure you would see the ribbons of socialism and Christianity curling round each other as they rise and fall together. Each informs and nourishes the other. Within this too are some beliefs which I suppose would tilt me against those of others in the wider Labour movement. Three immediately spring to mind: my support for an independent Scotland my belief that an unborn child is fully human and thus deserving of protection under the European Convention on Human Rights and my deep affection for the Jewish faith. It\u0026rsquos this faith, after all that underpins everything else. My saviour was born an orthodox Jew, lived as an orthodox Jew and died as one. Without the faith that Jesus lived there would be no Christianity and no salvation.  Labour, though, is a broad church and while I\u0026rsquove enjoyed some robust debates on these issues with leftie chums I\u0026rsquove never felt assailed to the point where I would consider leaving the movement. In any case, they are all subordinate to something bigger and most eloquently articulated in recent years by Jeremy Corbyn and his proclamation \u0026ldquofor the many not the few. It\u0026lsquos best encapsulated by this line from a speech he made at a manufacturing conference in February. \u0026ldquoFor a generation, instead of finance serving industry, politicians have served finance. We\u0026rsquove seen where that ends: the productive economy, our public services and people\u0026rsquos lives being held hostage by a small number of too-big-to-fail banks and casino financial institutions.  My love for Judaism has not blinded me to the actions of the Israeli government in its treatment of Palestinians living on the West Bank. In recent times this has begun once more to be characterised by callousness with the building of illegal settlements in defiance of international law and the recent legislation that effectively makes Palestinians second-class citizens.  Only a fool though would deny though, that some on the left have slaked their malevolent anti-Semitism under the cover of disgust at the actions of the Israeli Government. Part of this is the suggestion that any equivalence between modern Israeli policies and the horrors of the Holocaust is unacceptable. The Nazis engaged in a truly evil project to exterminate an entire race and to wipe all traces of it from the face of the earth. It was fuelled by centuries of fear, suspicion and resentment that relied on our basest human behaviour for its oxygen something that sought to dehumanise this people by mocking their physical appearance their psyche their beliefs and their behaviour. In every country where they appeared they were criminalised good for nothing but making money (we banned them from doing anything else) and when they succeeded at that we dehumanised them further still. Any attempt to understand the conduct of the modern Israeli state can\u0026rsquot begin until you also try to understand what it must feel like to live with such a legacy and to be surrounded by countries whose stated aim is your ultimate annihilation.  I believe Mr Corbyn to be sincere in his aim of eliminating all traces of anti-Semitism from his party and I believe he has made much progress in this. I also accept that he was unwise in choosing to share platforms with people possessing darker motives. Yet, what can we say about the sincerity of those currently trying to destroy him for these? Just as some on the left have used the Palestinian conflict to camouflage their anti-Semitism so too have many on the right deployed a wholly manufactured and insincere horror of anti-Semitism to pursue their own agenda. This carries an iniquity all of its own. When did their purported hatred of anti-Semitism start? Does it extend to the curious pastime of holding Nazi-themed fancy dress parties as favoured by generations of our Royal family and their aristocratic fluffers? Does it include making common cause with far right demagogues who march under the swastika and favour solutions to immigration issues that recall the horrors of the Third Reich? Or does it begin and end merely with destroying a figure whose stated aim is to put an end to your centuries of unearned privileges?  Mr Corbyn still has much to do to rid his party of the anti-Semites and he could do worse than making this the main theme of his closing speech to the party\u0026rsquos autumn conference. In the meantime he needs no lessons from those who have only lately discovered their horror of anti-Semitism."},{"url":null,"title":"tom-gordon-nicola-sturgeon-is-running-out-of-time-to-make-her-call-on-indyref2","story":"  Many will be SNP members. Local SNP MPs Stewart Hosie and Chris Law are among those due to attend. But it is not an SNP event.  Instead, it has been organised by the All Under One Banner group, partly out of frustration that Nicola Sturgeon is not being forceful enough in pursuing another vote.  The tensions are such some Yes supporters even plan to demonstrate at the SNP conference in October to exhort the First Minister to use the \u0026lsquotriple-lock\u0026rsquo mandate she says she has to call a referendum by 2021.  At the last SNP conference in June, Ms Sturgeon tried to dampen down calls for a fresh vote, saying the focus should be on converting No voters, not the date. \u0026ldquoLet\u0026rsquos stop obsessing all of the time about when we might get the chance to vote on independence again, she said.  But the obsession never went away. Nor is it really an obsession. It is a completely reasonable thing for Yes supporters to contemplate given that mandate has a limited shelf-life.  But as the former SNP cabinet minister Alex Neil argued this week, the game\u0026rsquos a bogie. Theresa May will never give the Scottish Parliament the power to hold a referendum.  She blanked Holyrood\u0026rsquos request for a so-called Section 30 order before the last general election.  She would certainly do so again, not least because she is now reliant on the ultra-Unionist DUP to stay in power. Even if she were toppled, no new Tory or Labour PM would be any keener to add a fight over Scottish independence to an in-tray already bursting with Brexit.  Impatient Yessers may argue for a unilateral, Catalan-style referendum, and to hell with a Section 30 order.  But besides looking desperate, such a vote is open to legal challenge. A Catalan-style referendum wouldn\u0026rsquot end in independence, it would end in the courts.  Given the improbability of a Section 30 order, it falls to Ms Sturgeon to manage expectations and prepare folk for an anti-climax.  So far she\u0026rsquos kicked the can down the road. After being blindsided by the last election, she \u0026ldquoreset her March 2017 plan for a Brexit-related referendum and promised a new \u0026ldquoprecise timescale this autumn.  Now, with Brexit still a hazy mess, she has hinted she might not have enough information to say anything concrete this autumn after all.  But while kicking the can is a time-honoured political device, Ms Sturgeon is fast running out of road.  There are snap elections, but no snap referendums. Each referendum is governed by its own particular Act of parliament, and that takes time.  There also has to be six-month gap between the legislation and the vote to allow for lead campaign groups to be set up and for a campaign period.  The last independence referendum was governed by a 2013 Holyrood Act which started life a full 18 months before the vote.  Ms Sturgeon published a draft bill for another referendum in October 2016 for a three-month consultation. It is essentially a list of tweaks to the 2013 Act, which was to be used as a template. But it wasn\u0026rsquot introduced at Holyrood, so would still face a parliamentary passage of around nine months - opposition MSPs would be sure to take their time mulling all of the 100 or so variations to the 2013 Act.  The Electoral Commission says a referendum cannot be the same day as the Holyrood election, so we need to work backwards from there to estimate the theoretical deadline for calling one in this parliament.  It would not be spring 2021 in case it became entangled with the Holyrood vote. In 2017, a Tory surge in the local election rolled into a Tory surge at the general\u0026nbspelection. Ms Sturgeon would not want to see a No vote in a referendum snowball into a rout for the SNP at Holyrood.  So the latest practical date for a referendum is likely to be autumn 2020. But, critically, this would have to be preceded by 15 to 18 months of legislation and campaigning. That means Ms Sturgeon would have to start the ball rolling by the middle of next year to hold one, in theory.  So if, by summer 2019, she hasn\u0026rsquot called for a second referendum (albeit probably in vain), it will be obvious to all that it isn\u0026rsquot happening.  If she pretended otherwise and insisted it was still a live possibility she would be accused of treating people like fools who couldn\u0026rsquot read a calendar or do basic arithmetic.  Similarly, if she demanded a referendum at the end of the electoral cycle, it would be seen as a naked gimmick to gee up support for the SNP going into 2021.  She could, in theory, activate her draft referendum bill sooner without actually, calling for vote, introducing it to parliament as a \u0026lsquocontingency measure\u0026rsquo if needed.  She would have to leave the date blank, however. Theresa May tried that with the EU Withdrawal Bill, which initially referred to \u0026ldquoexit day. But after much criticism about this being weak, dodgy and ridiculous, the government included the date. If Ms Sturgeon tried the same trick, she would risk the same accusations of weakness, flakiness and abuse of process.  She would also be reminded Alex Salmond named the day of the 2014 referendum when he introduced the associated bill at Holyrood.  The First Minister\u0026rsquos headache is that if she comes out and declares a second referendum dead in this parliament, she risks antagonising an awful lot of Yes supporters who were counting on her to deliver it. Some might even have believed that \u0026lsquotriple-lock\u0026rsquo mandate stuff.  There would be recriminations, accusations she let the side down, gave up too soon, squandered her chance, blinked first against one of the weakest PMs in British history.  Internal party discipline would fray. It would also be hard to go into 2021 asking for a fresh mandate after admitting she couldn\u0026rsquot cash in the last one. But pretence risks antagonising people too. SNP members would not appreciate being left looking daft on a hill they had followed her half- way up.  Coming clean is the better option. It\u0026rsquos not a good look for a leader, especially one proposing a bold new destiny, to let drift and inertia make the decision for her. A shrug and \u0026lsquoOh, would you look at the time?\u0026rsquo isn\u0026rsquot quite as inspiring as \u0026lsquoFreedom!\u0026rsquo  She can\u0026rsquot keep everyone happy.

Some eight years and \u0026#65533120,000 later, that goal has now been achieved.      \t                                                             The independence celebrations will be marked here in Scotland by Polish people across the country.                                                    And taking centre stage will be the Great Polish Map of Scotland.        In the summers of 1974 to 1979, this lasting legacy was created in the Borders to celebrate the links between Scotland and Poland.Although dating back to before 1576, it was in that year Royal Grants first recorded the relationship – with the King of Poland protecting the Scots “who supply us with all that is necessary”. Our friendship has remained firm ever since.The Great Polish Map of Scotland was mainly the work of a small group of Poles from the Jagiellonian University of Krakow, led by the map’s lead designer, Dr. Kazimierz Trafas.                                                                                                        But its creation was the brainchild of Krakow-born Jan Tomasik, a sergeant in the 1st (Polish) Armoured Division, who was stationed in Galashiels during the war and married a Scottish nurse in 1942 after being treated in the town’s Peel Hospital.He became a successful hotelier in Edinburgh after the war and added Barony Castle in Eddleston to his properties in 1968, where the map was conceived and created.He wanted to show hotel guests the landscape of Scotland and hoped the map would become a tourist magnet.Jan also wanted to show the coastline of the country Polish forces had been responsible for defending.                                                                                                        He is remembered as saying to hotel patrons: “I shall die but I shall leave my map as a gift to the Scottish people to thank them for the hospitality they showed the Poles when it was needed”.After the hotel closed in 1985 and ownership of Barony Castle passed from the Tomasik family, the map fell gradually into disrepair.But in 2010, Mapa Scotland was formed – a group of volunteers who were dedicated to restoring the map to its former gloryThanks to grants from the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Fund, along with fundraising, that goal has now been achieved.And it is hoped it will become both a visitor attraction and an educational resource for many generations to come.                                                                                                        With that in mind, a digital documentation team from Historic Environment Scotland spent five days on site, laser scanning the map to create a 3D model.The team then spent several months, working with Mapa Scotland and the Polish Cultural Festival Association, to create an interactive app highlighting Scotland’s Polish heritage.For Marta Pilarska, digital documentation intern with HES, the project proved to be a learning curve.She said: “I’m Polish and even I was discovering new connections between Poland and Scotland which I had never heard before. “It was a really interesting project to be involved with.“I knew the basics – the soldiers during the war years and that Bonnie Prince Charlie’s mother was Polish.“But I never knew that 40,000 Scots emigrated to Poland in the 1600s and that many towns and areas are still named after Scotland.“One of the quirkier facts we discovered was that a Polish folk dance, dating back to the 1600s, is actually based on a ceilidh dance.“I had no idea about any of that until this project.”Marta joined the HES team at an ideal time too – just one month before work started on the project.She added: “I was in the perfect place at the perfect time – a nice coincidence.“We hope people will enjoy finding out more about the two countries links and that teachers will also visit the map and use the digital app as a learning tool.”The Great Polish Map of Scotland measures some 50 metres by 40 metres and lies in an oval pit surrounded by a 142 metres long perimeter wall. Covering an area of 1590 square metres, it is understood to be the largest three-dimensional physical representation of a country and the largest outdoor relief map in the world.Visit https://sketchfab/HistoricEnvironment Scotland to explore the app.A labour of love for MAPA Scotland volunteers who restored landmarkA business meeting at Barony Castle Hotel in 1996 led Keith Burns to stumble across the Great Polish Map of Scotland, literally – it was so overgrown.But it wasn’t until 1999, when the engineer from East Linton retired, that the discovery started “nagging away” at him.In 2000, Keith and several friends started discussing what they could do to transform the landmark’s fortunes.And in 2010 they formed the charity MAPA Scotland, with the aim of raising enough funds to restore the map.Initially, they thought it would take two years and around £45,000 to rectify – but it proved a much larger undertaking.Keith, who was the project manager, explained: “We seriously understimated how long the work would take and how much it would all cost.“There were two reasons for that: firstly, we didn’t realise how much repair work the foundations of the map would require. They had been built with old tin cans from the hotel and they were crumbling away.“And secondly we had to get one or two specialist contractors to repair the pit wall and relay a lot of underground water supply pipes for the seabed.“The water supply had never worked it now does so we’ve actually upgraded the map.“But all of that took money and, to date, it has cost in excess of £120,000 to restore.”That funding was raised thanks to the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Funds, as well as major contributions from the Barony Castle Hotel, Borders Council, the Polish Consulate and the Scottish Polish Cultural Association, as well as generous public donations.However, 12 MAPA volunteers bore the brunt of the labour.Keith added: “We were all retired and could spend time on the project. It was hard work and involved a fair bit of travel but we’re delighted the map has now finally been restored.”Collection boxes around the site will help MAPA maintain the map for future generations.

Another is from Sandra Gow, of Lybster, who stated that the plan would be detrimental to the \u0026ldquoexisting, privately owned hotels, B\u0026ampBs and self-caterers in the surrounding areas with the potential of closure to many small businesses during the winter months.The chamber, however, has since sought to clarify its stance, stating in a post on the planning department\u0026rsquos website that the original objection was \u0026ldquomade specifically on behalf of our members in the hospitality industry.Of the documented cases submitted to planning, the Caithness Disabled Access Panel has written in support of the hotel plan.It says it accepts the development could impact on other hotels, but adds: \u0026ldquoIt will be the only hotel in the county with completely disabled bedrooms and showers and adhering to the laws on discrimination.The organisation says it has had \u0026ldquonumerous complaints from visitors in the county on the lack of disabled rooms in the area.Since the chamber\u0026rsquos objection was first reported on July 13, social media users have voiced their feelings.Those posting online generally have fallen onto two sides \u0026ndash those in support of local hoteliers, and an opposition accusing them of self-interest.\u0026ldquoWe need more beds.

Some reports suggest it may be more than just a fanciful notion.When first contacted by Wick historian Harry Gray about the recent restoration of the \"Iron Wellie\", we had visions of a giant Wellington boot unearthed from the Caithness moors. That theory was firmly booted into touch after a visit to this unearthed marvel on the northern side of Wick Bay.The Iron Wellie is in fact a spring water well situated down a flight of recently restored Caithness flagstone steps close to the Soldiers\u0027 Tower on the North Head.Charlie Bain of Wick Paths Group explained how together with Denny Swanson, Tommy Munro and others from the Royal British Legion Scotland they recently restored the site of the spring.\"The steps down to it were overgrown and damaged,\" he said. \"We also replaced the pipe the water flows through and there is a marker stone at the top of the steps.\"Denny Swanson said he remembered bringing the water to his mother who suffered from arthritis for most of her life.\"She sent me down every second day for a bottle of \u0027Iron Wellie water\u0027, as she called it. She maintained it helped her arthritis and it certainly seemed to take some of her pain away.\"After Harry symbolically cut a ribbon of barricade tape the group, together with Charlie\u0027s dog Jet, went down for a taste of the water that many in the area depended on in bygone times. It is speculated that the inhabitants of nearby Tinkers\u0027 Cave would have consumed the water. The Wick worthy Tudor James resided close to the site and lived to a ripe old age.Harry said that the Iron Wellie was also known as the Chalybeate Spring and its taste has been described like \"sookin\u0027 pennies\".\"Chalybeate waters, also known as ferruginous waters, are mineral waters containing salts of iron \u0026ndash hence the local name Iron Wellie,\" he said.\"There is no written history of this well but it was certainly known in the 18th century and by the turn of the 20th century it was sometimes referred to as \u0027Jocky Simpson\u0027s Wellie\u0027. Who Jocky Simpson was, is lost in time.\"Harry said that \"generations of Wickers\" out for a walk along the braes or exiles home on holiday would nearly always stop for a drink from the wellie.\"We as youngsters firmly believed that the water did us good despite the taste and it was a welcome drink when playing around the North Head or when fishing or swimming from the rocks,\" he said.\"Young lads get hungry and we would sneak a turnip from Bob Cormack\u0027s field above the wellie, dock it on a stab [for the uninitiated that means removing the ends of the neep by striking it against a fence post] and we then cut off the skin and washed the neep in the Iron Wellie water before sitting on a rock and devouring it.\"Harry laughed at how present-day health and safety regulations would make drinking the water seem like a risky act \"but none of us became ill or died from it, perhaps proving the efficacy of the wellie\u0027s water\".Perhaps in the future Wick will host thousands of pilgrims queuing up for a taste of the rejuvenating powers of the Iron Wellie water.Saturday 18 Aug 2018 1:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117108.jpg","title":"Dont be put off if youre being bullied employees are told after Scrabster complaint is rejected by tribunal","story":"A LOCAL advice service is stressing that although a tribunal has rejected a complaint of workplace bullying made by a Scottish Government agency employee, others should not be deterred from launching similar action.DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment while employed as a fisheries officer for Marine Scotland at Scrabster harbour, but a tribunal this week ruled against her in the case.Speaking to the Groat, Iain Gregory, the deputy manager of Caithness Citizens\u0027 Advice Bureau (CAB), stressed that bullying regularly takes place in the workplace, and each year he hears numerous complaints.\"Clients feel that they have been the victim of unfair dismissal, discriminatory treatment, bullying or other types of incorrect treatment,\" he said.\"Anyone who feels they have been the victim of such conduct or treatment should never be deterred from reporting the matter.\"DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment after she became a \"whistleblower\" while employed as a fisheries officer at Marine Scotland at Scrabster.The 49-year-old Canadian national told an employment tribunal in Aberdeen recently that she felt intimidated after being sent anonymous cards between 2015 and 2017, and claimed she was targeted with sexual harassment, for being a woman, and because of her age.In a previous hearing, Ms Fitzpatrick had also alleged that she was taped to a chair and gagged by colleagues in 2010.The employment tribunal, however, ruled against Ms Fitzpatrick in its decision on the case.In its judgment, it said it could not agree whether the cards came from current colleagues, and is understood to have been unable to consider the chair allegation as it was said to have taken place more than three years before the complaint was brought.Mr Gregory says that each year CAB deals with a \"substantial number\" of bullying cases, each of which is examined carefully and then detailed evidence is obtained.He says in many cases CAB is able to resolve matters without progression to the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) or to a tribunal \u0026ndash \"perhaps by raising a grievance with the employer or by negotiation\".He added: \"However, there are numerous cases which require referral via ACAS and we can often resolve issues at this point by using the \u0027Early Conciliation\u0027 process.\"He underlined that it is \"comparatively unusual\" for a case to proceed to tribunal, with only a \"small percentage\" going that far.\"While it would be inappropriate to comment on any case in which we were not involved, I would stress that people should not under any circumstances be dissuaded from pursuing their rights,\" Mr Gregory said.\"The system exists to ensure that your case can and will be properly considered and we can advise you and make sure that you understand it.\"Saturday 18 Aug 2018 1:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116895.jpg","title":"Gala furore over Lidl Wayne absolutely ridiculous","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMany people took to social media to voice their anger and concern at the reaction and coverage in the national and regional press following the appearance of the character on Saturday night.Around 90 per cent of the responses were positive and supportive.

This will also improve the availability of recycled material for use in the production of bottles and cans in future.“I would encourage everyone with an interest to provide their views on how this scheme can meet Scotland’s needs and help us tackle our throwaway culture.”Iain Gulland, Chief Executive, Zero Waste Scotland, said: “Scotland’s planned deposit return scheme is a landmark in the nation’s circular economy journey, with the potential to drive inward investment and create jobs in Scotland at the same time as improving recycling and reducing litter.\u0026#8221Consultation available to view.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

They were both originally earmarked for closure, but were later given temporary reprieves to see if customer numbers increase.The new report also warned that while \"online banking, Post Office banking and mobile bank vans go some way to providing alternatives\", there were concerns over cyber security, \"the fragile nature of Post Office contracts\", and accessibility of mobile banks.Zoe Laird, HIE\u0026rsquos regional head of communities infrastructure, said: \"Along with the findings of the Scottish Parliament Enquiry into bank closures this [study] will inform how public sector agencies and service providers respond.\"Saturday 18 Aug 2018 1:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Even non-dog owners have praised our initiative.\"She added: \"This is a disappointing thing to happen in our village where so many volunteers do their best to maintain the area to ensure this is a clean and safe place for residents and visitors and I am appalled that this vandalism was apparently carried out by a local resident.\"The community council and Men\u0026rsquos Shed group were put in touch via link man Roddie McPherson, who lives near the fishing village\u0026rsquos landmark harbour.The eco-friendly wooden dispensers can be found at the Avoch end of the railway line path, on Shore Walk by the industrial units, at the harbour green and at the start of the Shaltie Burn path.The move follows a recent initiative in the village to highlight the many paths which can be enjoyed by visitors to the village via a panel erected at a prominent spot near the Lazy Corner.A police spokesman said: \"Anyone with information is asked to call police on 101, quoting NE5003/18, or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.\"Saturday 18 Aug 2018 1:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The 3.6km section between Glendoe and Loch Tarff has been particularly challenging and would not have been possible without funding support from SSE, Highland Council and the Scottish Government and European Union totalling \u0026pound250,000, as well as the full support from Glendoe Estate over whose land the trail has been constructed. The opening of this section opens up the South Loch Ness Trail to more walkers, mountain bikers and horse riders and, particularly on this section of the trail, to those of limited mobility.\"Mr Ambrose added that the creation of the LochNess360\u0026deg trail will bring new opportunities for businesses, communities and deliver major economic benefit to the area in the long term.\"It will achieve this because it will attract visitors who may spend up to six to seven days completing the full circuit,\" he added. We know from feedback that there is already substantial interest from key European markets, particularly Germany, and VILN hope by spring 2019 to confidently go out to markets and promote it.

I said you can\u0026rsquot do that \u0026ndash no one has been notified about this. The guys just said they were acting on instructions.\"Hamish Mackenzie of Tarbat Community Council wrote to Highland Council chief executive Steve Barron back in June after receiving apologies in January from local authority community services staff for the lack of warning.They said the equipment was removed on health and safety grounds \u0026ndash a reason given in other similar instances across the region.However Mr Mackenzie says follow-up enquiries for details about land ownership and the legalities of the situation have not been responded to months later.\"The first choice is to get Highland Council to continue to maintain the park in accordance with the original agreement. People certainly feel short-changed by the council.\"People are also aware of things like threats to toilet provision and grass not being mowed. We seem to have an endless series of services being cut, often without any notice.\"He added: \"I understand budget pressures but we will fight when things are taken away without any warning, particularly when we see no justification for it.\"He said the developer of the Knockshortie Estate, Micky Austin was \"staggered\" to learn of the latest development having paid \u0026pound18,000 towards the cost of the playpark, which he had assumed would continue to be maintained and available to locals. He said: \"He is a public spirited person and has developed a nice estate. A play park lets children to get outside and away from gadgets and devices. It\u0026rsquos a great tragedy.\"\u0026nbspQuestion marks though remain for the community over the legality of the move. Many on the estate feel cheated that a facility which helped attract them in the first place has been stripped away \u0026ndash while others say Highland Council has \"played the health and safety card\" without justification.\u0026nbspThey are now left seeking answers and facing the prospect of potentially having to raise thousands to replace the facility.Tain and Easter Ross councillor Derek Loudon said: \"Highland Council officers have ordered a search of the Land Register and the Register of Sasines to clarify ownership. \"This will allow what is a very pro-active community to acquire or lease the land for a lottery or other funding bid. That is a prerequisite for any lottery bid. Let\u0026rsquos hope the community gets a quick turnaround and are able to buy the equipment needed and get it ready for next summer.\"Highland Council was approached for comment but had not responded as we went to press.Saturday 18 Aug 2018 1:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Hopes for a visitor trail around an area that was heavily militarised during WWII are now full steam ahead after the project team behind the Aultbea museum secured almost \u0026pound73,000 from the Scottish Land Fund towards the purchase of a former butcher\u0026rsquos shop it has been renting to house the display.People from 19 countries outside the UK were amongst the 5500-plus visitors dropping in between May and October last year and that number is set to mushroom as the facility is improved and plans for a wider trail developed.The project\u0026rsquos chairman Francis Russell told the Journal: \"To some extent we have become masters of our own destiny. This opens up new avenues of funding. The location on the NC500 is very important.\"We ask people when they come in how they heard about us and some say it was while they were driving by. It puts us on the map. We\u0026rsquoll look at the feasibility and cost of a major refurbishment and possibly an extension. We could do with much more space.\"Fellow project volunteer Elizabeth Miles said the boost \"will allow us to get on to develop it the way we would like\".She said: \"Owning the site will open new possibilities. We will look to create a WWII trail where everywhere gets visited. We\u0026rsquore hoping to really do something with it.\"Research found the NC500, which passes the makeshift museum, brought 29,000 extra visitors in its first year, adding an extra \u0026pound9m to the Highland economy.The \u0026pound72,820 award will contribute towards the purchase of the former butcher\u0026rsquos shop and surrounding land.Honorary president of the RACP George Milne said the aim is to create a multi-site museum for current and future generations to learn about the convoys.He said: \"The overall aim is to establish a unique multi-site museum in Wester Ross. Around Loch Ewe we hope to create a permanent exhibition centre, a WWII Trail with interpretation panels, a memorial garden, and the preservation of selected wartime buildings to honour all who served in the Arctic convoys to and from Russia from 1941-1945.\"\u0026nbspThe 75th anniversary of the last convoy to sail from the area will be marked in 2020, with relatives of servicemen and visitors from around the world expected to come in their droves.Gairloch Heritage Museum, which itself secured backing from the Heritage Lottery Fund and Highlands and Islands Enterprise for a \u0026pound2m project to convert the old anti-aircraft operations room in the centre of the village into a state of the art new facility, welcomed the news.It said: \"Congratulations to our friends at Russian Arctic Convoy Museum on procuring the funds to purchase their exhibition centre. Their volunteers have worked really hard to achieve this.

All my sculptures contain a memory and I felt it apt that this particular work should be imbued with the feeling of being held in a loving embrace, feeling safe and secure enough to develop your potential.\"The Shelter of Your Arms is one of a collection of pieces created by Ann on display throughout the garden and in the Sawyer Gallery within Inverewe House.Operations manager Kevin Frediani said: \"As a result of the Gulf Stream meeting the Highlands, Inverewe Garden is a nirvana of unusual and wonderful plants and wildlife. Through our arts and exhibition programme we are providing visitors with another dimension to the garden and new way to enjoy Scotland\u0026rsquos national and natural treasures, as our reputation as a centre of arts and culture grows.\"The exhibition is open now and runs until August 30.Last month, NTS unveiled its vision of a proposed new 20m viewing tower within the garden.The plans, which have been submitted to Highland Council for consent, would see an observation tower overlooking Loch Ewe.If given the go-ahead, the tower would provide unique panoramic views for visitors with, according to the NTS, minimal impact on surroundings and could be used to host educational talks.A spring 2019 opening is planned if all goes according to plan.The attraction has enjoyed a surge in visitor numbers after recent investment including the renovation of Inverewe House, the development of the new Sawyer Gallery and Bothy Caf\u0026eacute and new glasshouses.Saturday 18 Aug 2018 1:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

We wanted to take positive action to help the red squirrel population spread into the local woodlands as safely as possible. The combination of bridge and road signs definitely appears to be working well, which is great news.\"It\u0026rsquos safer for reds to travel in the tree canopy rather than on the ground, so it\u0026rsquos likely that if they have the option of using a bridge rather than crossing the road, they will take it. We also installed feeders at each end of the bridge to encourage the squirrels to use it.\"Since the bridge and road signs were introduced, there has only been one known red squirrel road death locally, with none reported so far in 2018. The year before, there were three reported road deaths of reds in the immediate area and two others further away.The rope bridge is suspended over the A896 outside Shieldaig village, alongside the Ben Shieldaig woodland, one of Scotland\u0026rsquos few remaining fragments of ancient Caledonian forest.Local climber Chris Hingley worked with Becky to install the bridge last June 2017, with support from Highland Council.

This would be an organisation of first recourse that could advocate and lobby for the town and for what the town deserves.\"Mr Murray will talk about the plans at a business breakfast being held at Ross County Football Club.He added: \"Dingwall is a market town and we should develop and promote it as such to maximise every single opportunity available that can make a profit for our businesses and allow the town to thrive.\"People should be able to make a good living in their home town, and currently there is a feeling that despite serious setbacks, like parking charges, we are moving in the right direction.\"One of the big myths about Bid schemes is that they exist to tell businesses what to do.\"On the contrary, it is for businesses to tell us what they need done.

She said: \"All the neighbours were out watching. The road was like a volcano.\"She said: \"If they patch this now, it\u0026rsquoll only burst another six weeks down the line further down. It keeps bursting and they keep fixing it. It\u0026rsquos a nuisance and it\u0026rsquos been happening more and more often over the last few years. We\u0026rsquore also very concerned if there is asbestos.\"Sally Shepherd, who has lived in the area for 20 years, said: \"It must be more cost-effective long-term to repair the main. We\u0026rsquore also a bit concerned about the asbestos in the pipe. There are also patches all the way down the road. One burst in May at 5am cut off half of Tain.\"Councillor Alasdair Rhind voiced frustration over the pace of the clean-up and wants Scottish Water to replace a substantive length of pipe to combat a repeat. He said: \"The most cost effective way would be to renew the pipe rather than having to call in squads of repairmen each time.\"A spokesman for Scottish Water apologised to customers affected and said the performance of mains is closely monitored \"to target investment where it is most needed, recognising that replacing water mains typically involves higher cost and further disruption for residents, whereas targeted repairs can often restore reliable service\".He said: \"Given the deteriorating performance of a section of the main serving customers in Knockbreck Avenue over recent months, this has now been identified as a priority and we will therefore be replacing the length of water main where bursts have occurred. We will keep residents informed once a proposed timescale for this work to take place has been identified in consultation with Highland Council.\"On health concerns, he said the water supply across Scotland is sampled, on average, once every two minutes and tested against strict quality standards to protect public health. Additional samples are routinely taken when a main is returned to service.He said the World Health Organisation has concluded there is no evidence of a health risk connected to drinking water from asbestos cement water mains.Saturday 18 Aug 2018 1:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Construction began in 2016 and is expected to be completed on schedule in late summer.\nLocated at Seafield the new centre is just a short distance from the long-standing Eric Gray Centre. Once opened the centre will provide specialist assistance for adults with complex care needs and learning disabilities.\nThe building has been designed by Richard Gibson Architects and construction is being led by DITT. The drone footage was shot by Nick McCaffrey.\nThe centre does indeed look good and is on schedule well done DITT , the clients and staff are all looking forward to being in the building. It has taken many years to reach this point  and is much needed.\nI wonder what, if any, proof you have that clients and staff are looking forward to being in the building? If you do have some proof to justify your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in different buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call (01595) 744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate  (John Tulloch) and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! (I use the scientific meaning of parasite here).\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists ( or any other activity) when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.  Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself ?  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory.

But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"various apprenticeships ","story":" Radar Technician – SERCO – Unst\nApprenticeship vacancies are open to male and female applicants, candidates over age 25 will be considered for some vacancies.\nWages vary dependent on employer.

In other areas customers have been left facing road and ferry journeys of more than 50 miles to get to a bank.\nIn 1989, there were more than 17,800 bank branches estimated to be operating in the UK. By the end of this year that number is expected to fall to fewer than 8000.\nSome projections have suggested it could drop to as low as 600 branches in five years\u0027 time.\nBetween 2015 and 2018, 48 bank closures have taken place or are under way in the HIE area including 22 in the Highlands. Some of these are the last banks in their communities.\nConsultants Indigo House Group said banking facilities need to be understood as core to community infrastructure.\nIt said access to cash remained fundamental to the viability of the small retail businesses that are prominent in rural areas. This is especially true in relation to tourism businesses where the loss of access to cash via local banks could have a detrimental effect on long term prospects.\nAlthough there are potential alternatives, including online or Post Office banking and mobile bank vans, the report warned that these options raised concerns over such issues as cybersecurity, the fragile nature of Post Office contracts and accessibility of mobile banks for less able people. Customers facing a shift from a local branch to a mobile bank also consider this a backward step.\nIn its recommendations, the report calls for a collaborative approach involving Scottish Government, HIE, local councils, community members and delivery partners, including the banks and Post Office.\nIt also wants recognition of the importance of cash to local economies and support over time for a sustainable transition to digitally based economies. This includes the creation of digital inclusion strategies to help businesses benefit fully from online banking.\nThe report also recommended a Post Office banking strategy that would include securing the long-term sustainability of contract Post Offices to support rural economies and infrastructure.\n\nSaturday 18 Aug 2018 1:39 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117085.jpg","title":"Dalwhinnie makeover starts to take shape","story":"Tom Ramage\n\u0026nbsp\nDALWHINNIE is on the verge of a major makeover at its southern entrance.\nFor too long dogged by a disused, overgrown compound and a rusting old water treatment works, villagers are now beginning to hope that things could change dramatically over the next few months.\nAll being well, they heard on Tuesday, a \u0026pound2.3 million upgrade by Scottish Water could get under way in the new year which would leave the village with a new treatment works by this time next year.\n\"There\u0027s a long way to go,\" said the north\u0027s corporate affairs manager Gavin Steel when the Strathy met with an SW team in the village hall, \"but we\u0027re hopeful that all the many stages will be gone through on schedule.\n\"We are having to consult with a lot of different individuals and organisations \u0026ndash not least the national park authority, the Highland Council, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and landowners \u0026ndash but this is work which will have to be done on behalf of the community.\n\"Quite simply the current system has reached its sell-by date.

The tourism industry’s treatment of seasonal workers has also come under the spotlight in reports which island firms say has painted an unfair picture of local business.\nThe letter, which was co-ordinated by local MSP Kate Forbes and tourism promotional body SkyeConnect, said: “Nearly everybody on the islands is linked in some way to tourism, and the economic opportunities of the tourism industry support the rural and remote communities of Skye, Raasay and beyond.\n“The tourist industry can be a relatively unpredictable industry and so it concerns us to see sensationalist stories in the national press, for a second year running, which could jeopardise the jobs, businesses and income of local people.\n“We would hate to see an industry which has taken many years to develop undermined by a few stories which don’t fairly depict the efforts of hardworking people across the area.”\nThe letter also backs recent investment in infrastructure at some of Skye’s most popular sites.\nIt adds: “The Isle of Skye and Raasay, like many areas of the Highlands and Islands, is home to communities whose future is dependent on good jobs, steady incomes and business opportunities. Tourism makes a critical contribution to the local economy, and indeed the wider Scottish economy, and indirectly enables people to live, work and raise a family on the island.\n“As such, we write to categorically assert that Skye and Raasay is well and truly open for business.”\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/001WH1008NCA.jpg","title":"highland exodus to stirling as runrig get set for final","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nAfter 45 years, Runrig will bring the curtain down on a remarkable musical career this weekend when they play their last ever shows.\nAn exodus of west Highland and islanders will be among the throng at Stirling’s City Park in the shadow of the town’s famous castle this Friday and Saturday.\nThey will be there to enjoy and celebrate one final time with a band which owes its roots to Skye and North Uist, and became an international flag bearer for Gaeldom’s language and tradition.\nSpeaking to the Free Press ahead of the ‘Last Dance’ shows, guitarist Malcolm Jones said he held conflicting feelings but there was excitement none the less at a final performance which will chart over four decades of music.\nHe added: “I would say we’re all approaching these final concerts with mixed emotions. There is certainly great excitement surrounding them and anticipation is high amongst both band and audience.\n“The Stirling concerts will be celebrations of our long musical journey, albeit tinged with the realisation that these are farewell appearances and so naturally emotions will be high – this is something we experienced recently at the farewell concerts in England and Europe – all spectacular events but nevertheless very moving.\n“We’ve been overwhelmed by the response to the announcement of the Stirling concerts – all the positive comments, the stories about what our music has meant to so many people, the sadness as the end approaches. But overall there will be a huge amount of love and positivity at Stirling and that’s what will carry everyone through these days ahead.\u0026#8221\nJones has been with Runrig all his adult life, having first joined the band on stage as a 17-year old at a dance in Portree’s Skye Gathering Hall in late 1977. He hopes the set list – which will be lengthy – will give a full reflection of the groups’s journey from a three -piece Scottish dance band playing island village halls to one which has sold out major venues across Scotland and Europe.\nHe said: “Compiling a set list is always a dilemma, with such a large back catalogue to choose from. Of course, there are certain songs that have to be included, otherwise we’d be lynched – but it’s also nice to pick some lesser-performed songs, possibly giving them a fresh twist.\n“Our set will be a good bit longer than usual – the problem was trying to keep the length down to sensible proportions – in essence, it will hopefully represent the band’s whole career, a celebration of our music and the unique bond with our audience.”\n century – the history of their native communities has shaped Runrig’s lyrics and songs. Jones believes that staying true to their roots – fusing them with the popular rock and pop influences they listened to in their teenage bedrooms \u0026#8211 has made sure the band’s popularity has endured through the generations.\n“We’ve been fortunate that throughout our long career we’ve continually gained new fans of all ages, at home and abroad, which has sustained us, even as fashions come and go around us,” he adds. “I guess there must be something in the lyrics, the melodies and the ethos of the band that has attracted such loyalty amongst fans, something universal that transcends our shared background in the heartland of the Highlands and connects with the wider world.”\nAuthenticity has been the hallmark of a band which can essentially still trace its origins to the three Portree streets of Fraser Crescent, Kitson Crescent, and Balmoral Road.\nThe original Run-rig dance band was founded by the Skye-raised sons of North Uist Calum and Rory MacDonald, along with Blair Douglas in 1973, and a year later the trio were joined by Donnie Munro, who became the band’s singer for more than two decades. Munro, who left in 1997 and was replaced by Canadian singer Bruce Guthro, will be on stage as a special guest this weekend.\n\nJones’ hopes for a legacy of music that people can continue to enjoy, and be inspired by, seem assured.\nHe adds: “Even though the band’s touring and performing life will have finished, I hope that people will continue to enjoy and discover our music for many years to come, perhaps giving inspiration to musicians that will follow on from us, in the knowledge that if you stick to your own path, be true to your musical roots and retain an open mind, great things may happen.”\nAs for the future – the band say it might be the end for Runrig, but it won’t mean retirement or the end of their music-making careers.\nSaid Jones: “The first thing to say is that there will be a long wind-down period – for instance we’ll film and record Stirling, so that will have to be worked on and brought to some sort of completion, plus there is the whole ongoing administration of the band archive and legacy which may lead to some interesting sideline projects.\n“Beyond that, we’ll all still be involved with our own individual performing, writing and music-making projects – that’s something you never retire from.\n“Personally, I’ll miss the band dreadfully but on the positive side I’ll spend more time on Skye plus I’ll have time to learn some new accordion tunes!”\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27429  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\nSpeakers at today\u0026#039s march urged attendees to make their way to Belfast over the next week to celebrate Belfast Pride, who will host Ireland\u0026#039s biggest LGBT festival, with the annual parade held on Pride Day which is celebrated on August 4th.\nSinn Féin were among the thousand strong crowd of people who marched at the first ever Transgender Pride parade that took place in Dublin this afternoon.\n The march started outside Liberty Hall and made its way to Fairview Park, where Declan Flynn was murdered by a gang of five so-called “queer-bashing” teenagers in the early hours of September 10th, 1982.\nThe suspended sentences for his attackers triggered a long march towards equality in Irish society.

In 2017 just 391 people took part in newly established apprenticeship programmes, compared to the government’s target of 800. - Maurice Quinlivan TD\nSinnFéin has today published its policy proposals to reform the apprenticeshipsystem in Ireland. The party’s spokesperson for Business, Enterprise andInnovation Maurice Quinlivan TD has announced proposals to increase the numberof people in apprenticeships to 60,000 by 2023, whilst also branding thecurrent government’s reform plans as “unambitious, uninspiring and unacceptablyslow”.\nThe document outlines Sinn Féin’s proposals to reform the system in ways suchas trebling the number of apprenticeship programmes currently availablealongside focusing on plans to increase the female \u0026amp people withdisabilities participation rates within the programmes. \nDeputy Maurice Quinlivan said\n “Thegovernment is currently missing its own targets when it comes to reforming theapprenticeship system. In 2017 just 391 people took part in newly establishedapprenticeship programmes, compared to the government’s target of 800.\n “Inaddition, only nine of the promised fifteen new apprenticeship programmes wereintroduced last year.”\n SinnFéin has also outlined the benefits of an all-Ireland apprenticeship system andthe benefits that would come with including trade unions in the development andgovernance of the programmes. The document reiterates Sinn Féin’s aim toabolish student contribution fees for apprentices and details how the partywill promote apprenticeship programmes as another tertiary education choice.\n Apprenticeshipis a tried and proven way for employers to develop highly skilled workers fortheir company and industry by using a mixture of coursework and practical onthe job learning. Record numbers of students are attending third leveleducation, but with this route not being suitable for everyone, Sinn Féin wantsto create more alternative routes for young people.\nDeputyQuinlivan continued\n“AcrossIreland we lack significant alternative opportunities for young people topursue other education. We want to build on the success of the traditionalcraft trades in Ireland such as plumbing, bricklaying and plastering, andexpand this way of learning, into a host of new fields.\n“Apprenticeships in fields such as green energy, retail, hospitality andfinancial services are hugely popular in other European countries. We aim toexpand the system into these areas to create different opportunities for allyoung people including more females and people with disabilities.”\n Currently,most apprenticeships are aimed towards male participants with just 160 out of13,589 people in apprenticeship programmes across the state being female in2018. In addition, the physically demanding nature of the current availableapprenticeships has resulted in just 1.7% of total apprentices in 2016 beingpeople with disabilities.\n\nSinnFéin aims to increase investment in apprenticeships to over €350 million perannum within five years. \nTheLimerick City TD, Deputy Quinlivan has said that this will “fund the treblingof the number apprenticeship programmes and provide places for 60,000apprentices”.\nDeputy Quinlivan continued: “€5,166,000 of investment will be required overfive years for the development of 63 new apprenticeship programmes, bringingthe total number of craft and new courses to 100.\n“Ireland’sallocation from the EU for training and education of the young is €68 million.Fine Gael was forced to return €19.8 million of this allocation in 2016, asthey failed to submit a payment application.\n“SinnFéin will ensure all EU monies allocated to Ireland would be fully utilised, tobenefit the education and training of our young people. To date, none of thismoney has been drawn down from the EU.”\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27460  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nLet\u0026#039s exceed those who turned out on the very first civil rights march in August 1968 and let\u0026#039s ensure that a very clear and committed demand is presented to the governments - the Irish government as much as the British government - to address those issues of a rights based society that are enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement. - Mitchel McLaughlin\nThis Saturday the 50th anniversary of the first organised civil rights march in the North will be marked with a commemoration march from Coalisland to Dungannon. \nThe original march, held on August 24, 1968, was the first to be organised by the Civil Rights Association in the north, which was founded the previous year to challenge the institutionalised discrimination and injustice of the Six County state. \nIt was stopped at an RUC cordon before it reached its destination at Market Square in Dungannon but the organisers went ahead with their protest and held speeches at sang the civil rights anthem, \u0027We Shall Overcome\u0027, at the police cordon. \nAn estimated 2,500 people took part in the original march fifty years ago. \nThe Coalisland to Dungannon march was followed by a march in Derry on October 5 1968 which was brutally attacked by the RUC. The attack on the marchers was carried out in front of the news cameras, brining global attention to the civil rights campaign and the the discrimination of the unionist regime at Stormont. \n\nThis Saturday\u0027s march, organised by Sinn Féin, is the first in a series of events planned to mark the 50th anniversary of the beginning of the civil rights campaign. \nMid Ulster Sinn Féin MP, Francie Molloy, who helped organise and took part in the original parade 50 years ago, said that the campaign for rights is as relevant now as it was in 1968 and encouraged people to take part in Saturday\u0027s march. \n\"Presently, with the deliberate denial of rights, a shortage of affordable housing and the ongoing issue of constituency boundary proposals, it is clear there is still a job of work to be done,\" he said. \nWith the DUP\u0027s denial of rights to the LGB\u0026ampT community, Irish language speakers and bereaved families awaiting inquests, it is clear the campaign for rights needs to continue in the north. The onset of the Tory Brexit, backed by the DUP, also represents an attack on the rights of people in the north. \nThe main speaker at the end of the commemoration at the Square in Dungannon will be former Sinn Féin MLA Mitchel McLaughlin. \nSpeaking ahead of Saturday\u0027s march, the former Northern Assembly Speaker called for a huge turnout. \"Let\u0027s exceed those who turned out on the very first civil rights march in August 1968 and let\u0027s ensure that a very clear and committed demand is presented to the governments - the Irish government as much as the British government - to address those issues of a rights based society that are enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement,\" he said. \nThe parade will begin in Coalisland at 3pm on Saturday and make its way to Dungannon. \n\n\ntest\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a05f-jpg.jpg","title":"65470  ","story":"    \nNORTHERN Ireland have been crowned World Champions after the local sailors took on the best from around the world for the Atlantic Challenge and won.\nTeams of young people from around the globe converged on Lough Neagh for the toughest test of endurance, strength and skill.\nThe Northern Ireland crew had an outstanding week in Antrim, with big wins in the two Jackstay Transfer tasks, traditional rope work, man overboard and the rowing slalom races.

Heart Foundation Northern Ireland (BHF NI).\n  \nMairead Agnew was inspired by her young neighbour Mark Lynn, who has complex congenital heart disease. At just 8 years old, he has undergone four open heart surgeries and numerous cardiac procedures. \n  \nIn 2015 Mark was diagnosed with heart failure but this still hasn’t stopped him and his parents Donna and Geoff supporting BHF NI and raising almost \u0026pound3,000 for the charity.\n  \nMairead explained: “My sister was born with congenital heart disease so this is a cause that has always been extremely close to mine and my family’s hearts. When I saw the wonderful fundraising that Mark and his family had raised, I wanted to do something to help. When I told Mark I was taking on the Berlin Marathon, he was sure he wanted us to support BHF NI once again.”\n  \nKaren McCammon, Health Services Engagement Lead for BHF NI explained: “When the BHF was founded in 1961, 8 out of every 10 babies born with congenital heart disease died before their first birthday. Our research has helped to turn this around, and now 8 out of 10 babies survive to adulthood. Breakthroughs such as these are only possible because of the support we receive from supporters like Mairead, Mark and his family. We are therefore extremely grateful for all their efforts.”\n  \nBHF have also developed pioneering surgical techniques to treat complex congenital defects. However, there is still much more work to be done. For children like Mark, who have complex congenital heart disease, treatment can be much more difficult.\n  \nMairead, Mark and his family are keen to raise as much awareness and funds as possible and are asking everyone to support in any way they can. You can donate to Mairead or Mark in person or call into any of the following businesses in Ballymena: The Moat Bar, Kockeden Lodge, Credit Union, Willy Allen’s Butchers, The Mace, Ballykeel Chemist, Molly Malone’s Chip Shop and A Star Valeting and Detailing, Ballymena who are running a special offer between August 16 and September 16 - offering full valets for just \u0026pound60 and \u0026pound70 for jeeps and 4x4\u0027s, \u0026pound2 of every full valet will be donated to the cause.\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_921264.jpg--.jpg?1534230306000\n","title":"plans to extend public realm scheme to greenvale street","story":"  \nPLANS are being considered to extend the Public Realm Scheme to Greenvale Street in Ballymena Town Centre.\n  \nHowever, one local business owner who has been based on the street for 20 years, has hit out at the lack of consultation around the proposals.\n  \nClaire Brennan of Oasis Hair Salon claims she has had to rely on “hearsay” in a bid to find out more about the plans.\n  \nNIE is currently carrying out utility works on the street which is expected to last four weeks.\n  \nClaire said: “I have heard that after the four weeks they are planning to rip the entire street up and replace it as part of the Public Realm Scheme. I understand that the work is expected to last right up until Christmas.\n  \n“My issue is firstly there has been no consultation, I don\u0027t know exactly what they are planning to do. \n  \n“We are relying on hearsay at the minute and I have heard that there are plans to lay stone similar to the rest of the town.” \n  \nClaire said she had written a letter to Mid and East Antrim Borough Council about the issue.\n  \nShe continued: “It took ten days to get a reply which said there was “nothing concrete at the minute”.\n  \nClaire said that among her concerns was that the area has a very slopping street which raises issues around what type of paving is used.\n  \nShe added: “Also there are concerns around water flowing down the street due to the slope and the fact that if the paving used is light in colour chewing gum, which will eventually cover it, will turn black and soon make the street look grubby and shabby.”\n  \nClaire said she would like to see either the street remain the same and be “brought back to its former glory” or be consulted on any proposed plans.\n  \n“We want to have a debate about it, not have to rely on hearsay.

Alan rounds off with some insights into the general history of dam-building in this country and relates how civil engineering has developed its own code of ethics over the 200 years since the foundation of the Institution of Civil Engineers.\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_921285.jpg--.jpg?1534232428000\n","title":"estelle in the frame for spectacle wearer of year win","story":"  \nA Ballymena woman has been chosen from thousands of proud glasses wearers as a finalist for Specsavers’ Spectacle Wearer of the Year.\n  \nEstelle Wallace, shortlisted in the 45 – 59 age category from Rasharkin could follow in the footsteps of last year’s Award winner, Love Island hunk Alex Miller, winning \u0026pound10,000 and the chance to mingle with the stars at the annual awards. \n  \nGlasses wearers across the UK and Republic of Ireland have been showing off their specs style by sharing their selfies online.\n  \nEstelle, who is a health and wellness coach, was invited to visit her local Specsavers store in Fairhill Shopping Centre to receive a bottle of champagne, a certificate and a \u0026pound125 glasses voucher.\n  \nEstelle said: “I was really delighted to be shortlisted as a regional finalist.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit.

We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

This unique history project is being supported by Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council as part of the PEACE IV Shared Spaces and Services programme.\n\nUrsula Kearns from Mayfair Business Centre said: “We are really keen to speak to any women and men who worked in the factory during the 1960s and 1970s, including those who were made redundant when the factory closed. We want to hear and collect their experiences and memories and we want those stories to be recorded and shared. The intention would be for the former workers to meet together on a regular basis over coming months. It will be informal and will be a chance for old friends and acquaintances to meet up. We intend that the project will be led by those taking part, so we expect that it will touch upon other work-places as well as people’s social lives. It’s also intended that the project will result in a permanent exhibition within Mayfair.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nInterested?

Their actions made history but Dungannon’s pivotal role in the quest for social justice was soon forgotten as images of beaten and bloodied marchers on the Duke Street march that October grabbed headlines around the world.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nDungannon-born presenter Lynette Fay with Bernadette McAliskey during recording for Stories in Sound: In The Footsteps, due to be broadcast on BBC Radio Ulster this Sunday (August 19) at 12.30pm\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nBorn in Dungannon only a decade later, presenter Lynette Fay had no idea that people she knew growing up – her brother’s primary school teacher, and her next door neighbours – were among the organisers of that first march.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIn this Stories In Sound documentary for BBC Radio Ulster, she follows ‘In The Footsteps’ of those first civil rights marchers. She revisits the issue of housing discrimination and the ground breaking protests of the young mothers of the Homeless Citizens League, and learns first-hand about the organisation of the march from the so-called “Protestor Number One”. She hears from Bernadette McAliskey about how the march turned her into a lifelong campaigner, as well as from those who took part in a counter protest.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nUsing a blend of highly personal interviews and archive audio, Lynette asks what spurred them to take to the streets in pursuit of civil rights, whether or not they achieved their aims – and at what cost. Fifty years on from that first civil rights march, how has Dungannon – and Northern Ireland – changed?\n\nIn the Footsteps - presented by Lynette Fay and produced by Freya McClements – is broadcast on BBC Radio Ulster on Sunday, August 19.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8602191.1534343875!/image/image.jpg","title":"fundraising in memory of elizabeth","story":"\nElizabeth Adams was an employee of Mountvale Private Nursing Home, Dromore for over 11 years, she was a work colleague but mainly a friend.  \n\n                \nAfter a short illness called Sarcoidosis, she passed away peacefully on January 15.

Since its formation in 1994, the initiative has sent over 2000 students from Northern Ireland to all four corners of the United States where they have successfully completed a year studying\n\nJonathan Stewart, Director, British Council Northern Ireland, added: “I am confident that the students departing for the US this year will be great ambassadors for Northern Ireland and will help to further important long-term links and connections. A recent report published by the British Council has highlighted that the relationship between the US and the UK is driven as much by cultural factors, as political with programmes such as Study USA supporting these links and strengthening them for the future. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Through Study USA, students will have the opportunity to not only enhance their employability skills but also develop intercultural skills, which will help them to prepare to work in a global economy. We wish them success, and trust that new connections and friendships will be developed in the year ahead.”\n\nStudy USA is just one of many international opportunities available through British Council Northern Ireland.

As the years went on they became less and less involved, but they were still on our board of directors for a number of years.\n“As time went on we became more secular and we didn’t have that relationship with the Church anymore. But we’re still very grateful for them for setting it up and for identifying the huge need for counselling and support in this area, I suppose because Ardoyne was hit so hard by the conflict.\n“The Passionists worked tirelessly, and I remember sister Kathleen constantly bringing funders into a room and saying ‘You have got to fund this.’ Because there was very little funding in the early days she worked extremely hard to get us established, funded and working.\n“We have grown considerably, and we now deliver about 12,000 to 13,000 sessions a year to about 2,500 people. As well as operating from this site, we also work in a range of local schools and community venues. If someone wants to be seen or needs help somewhere else we can do that too.”\nNorma continued: “Our clinical practice is excellent. We have just been awarded BACP [British Association for Counselling and Psycho-therapy) accreditation for our services. Most counsellors are individually accredited by the BACP, but very few organisations carry the accreditation. We are one of only six in Northern Ireland to be accredited this year.”\nWith a degree in psychology and a professional background in both therapy and conflict resolution, Norma said that New Life felt like a place where she could make a difference.\nIn the past, she has worked at New Life as a sessional counsellor and her experience in play therapy has allowed her to help children and adults alike. New Life is one of the few organisations in the north that offers child and family therapy – services that Norma insists are vital for North Belfast.\n“I think in this area you are working with generations of people who have had things really difficult,” she said.\n“Personal safety was at risk throughout the Troubles and the area has grown up with generations and generations of high unemployment. Poverty, conflict and trauma have a huge impact, not just psychologically, but on a cellular level it impacts people physically.\n“Poverty also has a huge impact on children’s education and a number of different things, so we’re working with multiple issues for a lot of families and they are trying really hard to overcome those things. It has a massive impact on people’s self-esteem, so it’s almost a vicious cycle.”\nShe continued: “There is a lot of research that has come out recently into adverse experience in childhood and the impact that those have on physical health, mental health, and educational achievement. The aim is to try to tackle things early. I think that’s why we believe that child therapy is so important, because you’ve got to be working with children from an early age to begin to address their issues early on.\n“If you don’t catch certain things in childhood, sometimes you’re working with very difficult teenage years because it’s harder to intervene. Sometimes those teenagers will come back as adults and they will feel like they are ready to tackle the issue at that stage.\n“At any stage in life it’s encouraging to know that anything can be repaired. Our brains are wonderful organs and in many ways they have a great plasticity so you can address those issues, you just have to be motivated and have the right motivator to identify what that change might look like.\n“Not everybody needs counselling, sometimes a friend or a colleague or anyone you can connect with can transform things for you. Talking to anybody helps you and can help you, but counselling gives a framework and a focus for those who need it.\n“If you can catch people before they hit the crisis it’s much better. When you’re in a crisis your ability to think clearly, to support yourself or to act lessens, so it’s much harder to activate the changes you need. If you can get into counselling when you’re not in crisis then you’ll be able to change things more quickly, but counselling can really help. It helps you to clear your mind enough to realise what needs to happen next to take you out of crisis.”\nWhile New Life has come on leaps and bounds since it began, offering thousands of yearly counselling sessions, Norma admits that mental health charities, including New Life, need more support to effectively help those in need of support.\n“I think pre-Troubles we didn’t have nearly enough mental health services,” she said.\n“People were just in lockdown mode, they were just surviving. Since the peace process there has been a lot more services established. I think mental health services are still desperately underfunded in Northern Ireland given what we have come through.\n“For our service we have a six-month waiting list and sometimes it can go up to a year. If you need a counsellor it’s way too long to wait, but we don’t have the funding to deliver any more sessions than we currently do.\n“I think there needs to be more accessible services. People get fed up sitting on a waiting list and a lot can happen in that space of time.”\nShe concluded: “If you do need someone to talk to it’s important that you come forward. Young people, especially can access our services quite quickly so we would really encourage them to come forward.”\nIf you think you might benefit from talking to New Life, call 90 391630.\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"tribute call for elisha scott","story":"\n\nTHE\n public vote to name the new road leading to the Olympia Leisure Centre in Belfast is in its final week and SDLP Councillor Donal Lyons is encouraging people to ensure they have their say and to vote for \u0026#8216Elisha Scott Boulevard\u0026#8217.\n\nElisha Scott is a Liverpool football legend and was Belfast Celtic’s most successful manager who also took the club on their tour of the US in 1949 where they defeated the then British champions, Scotland.\n\nCllr Donal Lyons said: “The vote to name this new road closes on this Sunday and the 125th anniversary of Elisha Scott’s birth will be on the 24th of this month, just days after. \n\n“I’m glad that my proposal to name this road after Elisha Scott has been included because despite Elisha being one of the most successful footballers to have come from our city, awareness of his achievements has faded. \n\n“It’s my hope, that by naming this road after Elisha Scott that we can correct this and begin to give him the full and long overdue recognition he deserves.”\n\nGoalkeeper Scott was born just yards from this new road. Cllr Lyons said it It would be fitting if the road was named after one of Belfast’s greatest ever footballers.\n\n“After famously signing for Liverpool FC in 1912 for ‘£1 and the price of the boat trip’, Scott would be a key player in Anfield for an incredible 22 years, making 468 first-team appearances. He holds the record as Liverpool’s longest serving player to this day. The earliest recorded football chant was Liverpool fans cheering his name. Scott is widely considered the first King of the Kop. \n\n“But it’s not just his time in Liverpool that’s worthy of celebrating. Elisha returned to the Donegall Road in 1934 to become player-manager for Belfast Celtic. Over the following 14 years, he would secure 31 trophies with the Grand Old Team, including 10 Irish League titles, six Irish Cups and eight Gold Cups. Belfast Celtic were the powerhouse in local football and the club still retains a loyal and dedicated fan base. \n\n“Scott also knew what mattered in football and when challenged amid worsening sectarian tensions in the 1930s, for fielding a cross community team he responded in his trademark forthright style, ‘I don’t play Protestant players. I don’t play Catholic players. I play good players.’ Scott’s success as both player and manager secured his place in history but his dedication to his club, players and fans ensured his place as a legend of the game.”\n\nYou can vote online at https://dof.belfastcity.gov.uk/NameTheRoadVote/  or by emailing NameTheRoad@BelfastCity.gov.uk with Elisha Scott in the subject and including your name and address.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"75m rooftop running track plan for old belfast","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

There will also be shops and food and drink options on the site, which has been renamed \u0027The Sixth\u0027 in a reference to Belfast\u0027s  evening edition, \"the sixth late Tele\".\n\nWork is due to begin by the end of the year if the plans get the go-ahead.\n\nStephen Surphlis of Bel Tel LLP said: \"Offices and workspace are evolving and UK and international companies are looking to Belfast and the wealth of talent we have on tap from our universities and within our professional, creative and technology sectors.\n\n\"These firms are placing a premium on employee satisfaction and are seeking working environments that facilitate team interaction, innovation and creativity. \n\n\"Our plans for The Sixth emphasise quality, heritage-led design that makes a contribution to both user wellbeing, and the fabric of our city.\"\n\nArchitecture firm Allford Hall Monaghan Morris (AHMM), winner of the 2015 RIBA Stirling Prize for its work on Burntwood School in London, has been enlisted to work on the scheme.\n\nPaul Monaghan, founding director of AHMM, said: \"The Sixth is a bold project, focused on the experience of its users and mindful of the site\u0027s landmark status and importance as part of Belfast\u0027s built heritage. We have taken cues from the surrounding buildings and the city\u0027s lost Victorian arcades, and will restore features removed or lost from the original listed building.\n\n\"For example, we\u0027re planning to reinstate the building\u0027s main access onto Royal Avenue and reintroduce dormer windows removed from the original roofline.\n\n\"New features such as the roof-top running track, roof-top terraces and break-out spaces complement the building\u0027s focus on the user.\n\n\"A new public atrium space serves as walkway through the building, which alongside a range of ground floor retail and food and beverage offers will enliven the street level space around Royal Avenue and Donegall Street.\n\n\"The Sixth will contribute to the rapid regeneration of the area and with its close proximity to Ulster University, it will be at the centre of an emerging creative district serving the education, culture, media and technology sectors.\"\n\nCouncillor Aileen Graham, deputy chair of Belfast City Council\u0027s City growth and regeneration committee, said: \"The partnership is pleased to have submitted its full planning application for The Sixth. \n\n\"We\u0027ve made a commitment in the Belfast Agenda to growing our city\u0027s economy and positioning the city to compete internationally. Quality, innovative workspaces like The Sixth will attract the high-value jobs necessary to grow our economy and help our people reach their full potential. \n\n\"Not only will The Sixth boost the city centre\u0027s vibrancy as part of an emerging creative district, it\u0027s going to breathe new life into one of Belfast\u0027s most loved and iconic buildings.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"belleek firm marks papal visit with special souvenirs","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

However, in a second clip, taken outside the airport, Novo is seen approaching the man and asking him why he “disrespected” him, saying he had done nothing to deserve the abuse and that he “was not scared of him”.\n\nLast night the Celtic fan said he wanted to apologise unreservedly to Novo for his “indefensible behaviour”. He said: “I had been over to watch football and had returned on the same day and I was the worse for drink. That is not an excuse but it is true. I’ve let myself down.\n\n“Since the incident went viral, I’ve had an insight into the effects of abusive behaviour. Threats have been made online and I can appreciate how upsetting the original incident was.”      \n\nNovo, posting on social media later that evening, said: “Arrived at Belfast International Airport tonight to support the local community for all sides of the divide.\n\n“As soon as I walked out of the airport I was surrounded by Celtic supporters that hurled abuse and tried to attack myself. I would like thank genuine Celtic supporter.”\n\nNovo was left fighting for his life in January after suffering a heart attack while starring in a Rangers legends tournament in Germany.

We deserve better and we should bulldoze the place.”\n\nStormont has been suspended for months in a row between Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionists over identity issues like the Irish language.\n\nIn the 1960s, Ms McAliskey was a leading figure in the student civil rights movement, which drew inspiration from similar action in the US.\n\nThe Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association highlighted discrimination against Catholics over issues like jobs and housing and sought voting rights for all.\n\nMany unionists felt it aimed to create a united Ireland.\n\n\n\nWe are the victims of sectarianism, the whole community, and we are the beneficiaries of racism\nBernadette McAliskey\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nMs McAliskey said racism and sectarianism were like rapidly spreading ragweed.\n\n“If you take your eye off them in any time or place or generation they will reassert themselves, every single day.”\n\nShe said people do not understand racism in the way they do sectarianism.\n\n“We are the victims of sectarianism, the whole community, and we are the beneficiaries of racism.\n\n“We have to change how we view the past, not simply how we view the present or the future, or we don’t understand the need to fundamentally change.”\n\nShe said legislation addressing racism is not enforced properly and claimed Stormont had treated the Human Rights Commission with “abject disrespect” and failed to create a Northern Ireland Human Rights Act.\n\n“We are fundamentally racist. We think we know a great deal of history and we know none.”\n\nA march is planned from Coalisland to Dungannon on Saturday afternoon retracing the route of the original parade of the civil rights era amid protests about unionist discrimination in the allocation of housing.\n\nIt was a reaction to the earmarking of Dungannon public housing to a single Protestant woman with less housing need than many Catholic families on the waiting list.\n\nAustin Currie MP had squatted in a house in Caledon earlier in 1968 in protest and that led to the first of many civil rights marches, some of which attracted violence and heralded the start of the Troubles.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"house of fraser web shoppers in limbo as 500m","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

For items less than £100, you may be able to use your debit or credit card provider\u0027s Chargeback scheme,\" he said.\n\nThe comments came as it was revealed House of Fraser owed more than £484m to creditors including top designer brands Armani, Diesel, Prada and Gucci. \n\nAnd Sports Direct chief Mike Ashley, who bought out House of Fraser, will not be footing the bill for any money owed before his £90m rescue last Friday.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"i have done nothing to justify any resignation says paisley","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":null,"title":"service to mark anniversary of ballygawley bus bombing","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

It\u0027s inhuman\u0027\n \n\n\n\nThe force of the explosion hurled the bus 30 metres down the road, threw soldiers into neighbouring fields and left a six-foot crater behind it, scattering wreckage at least 100 yards.\n\nShortly afterwards the Provisionals claimed responsibility, saying its Tyrone \u0027brigade\u0027 carried out the attack and adding: \"We will not lay down our arms until the peace of a British disengagement from Ireland.\"\n\nMany families and individuals connected with the soldiers\u0027 regiment will return to Omagh this weekend to remember those murdered.\n\nThe services and events, which come days after this week\u0027s commemorations for the 1998 Omagh bomb, have been planned by South East Fermanagh Foundation (SEFF), a local victims\u0027 support organisation which has worked collaboratively with Ballygawley residents over the years.\n\nSEFF has supported the return of the families to the scene where their lives forever changed to mark the 30th anniversary - both those who lost their lives and those who were and remain affected by the attack.\n\nAt 10am, survivors and relatives of the soldiers who lost their lives will attend a ceremony held at the site, where there will be an opportunity for wreaths and poppy crosses bearing messages to be laid.\n\nA replacement memorial and panels explaining what occurred on the Co Tyrone road in 1988 will also be dedicated during the hour-long service, organised by SEFF.\n\nThis will be followed by a morning prayer service in Newtownsaville Church of Ireland at 11.30am. This will include a special act of remembrance in respect of those murdered on August 20, 1988, prayers for their families and for the surviving injured.\n\nKenny Donaldson, director of services at SEFF, said the events are designed to bring together all those affected by the atrocity.\n\n\"Over the weekend leading up to the 30th anniversary we have arranged a variety of events for everyone impacted by the bus bombing, he said.\n\n\"This includes the medical physicians, local police and military response, fire service or ambulance personnel, locals living on the Ballygawley Road, the band buses which were following the soldiers\u0027 bus and who came to the scene and heroically offered what assistance they could and others who came upon the scene.\"\n\nThe 52-seater unmarked Ulsterbus coach had been transporting 36 soldiers of the 1st battalion of the Army\u0027s Light Infantry Regiment from Belfast International Airport back to Lisanelly Barracks in Omagh. Eight soldiers from England, aged from 18 to 21, were killed, all but one dying instantly, with another 18 wounded.\n\nThe security forces suspected that an informer may have told the IRA of the bus route and the time it would be at a specific spot. Following the attack, the military started ferrying troops to and from East Tyrone by helicopter to stop future attacks.\n\nThere was evidence, given the fact the explosive used was Semtex, that the Libyan government had supplied the material. Ten days later, three members of Tyrone IRA suspected of having carried out the bombing were killed by the SAS.\n\nThe Omagh Protestant Boys Flute Band and the Londonderry marching band Star of the Valley, who came across the scene on their way home from an event in Portadown, stopped their buses.\n\nA number of bandsmen and women helped the wounded and dying soldiers and were soon joined by local people, as well as the emergency services.\n\nThe dead were Jason Burfitt (19), Richard Greener (21), Mark Morsworthy (18), Stephen Wilkinson (18), Jason Winter (19), Blair Bishop (19), Alexander Lewis (18) and Peter Bullock (21).\n\nAll had been returning to Tyrone to complete six months of a two-year tour.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"arlene foster turns down invitation from irish government to popes visit","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

But outbreaks have occurred at Muslim, Christian and Hindu religious events, at sports events, and at large-scale open air festivals in the past. \n\n\"When they occur, they most commonly involve vaccine preventable diseases such as measles, influenza, mumps and hepatitis. \n\n\"Other reported outbreaks are mainly of gastrointestinal infections caused by a number of different pathogens,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan said. \n\n\"Given the nature of this historic papal visit, a large number of young children and elderly visitors are expected to attend the final mass, including many international visitors. \n\n\"In the current context of ongoing measles spread in Europe, it is highly advisable that all attendants, especially young children, ensure that they are up to date with their vaccinations,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan added.\n\nAccording to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the measles outbreak is continuing across Europe, with more than 30 deaths reported in 2018. \n\nThe Papal visit is expected to attract 15,000 overseas visitors and the final mass will draw a crowd of around 500,000 people. \n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) defines a mass gathering as \"a planned or spontaneous event where the number of people attending is sufficient to strain the planning and response resources of the community, state or nation hosting the event\". \n\nDr Jack Lambert, specialist in infectious diseases at the Mater Hospital, Dublin, said the reality is people risk contracting diseases during mass gatherings.\n\n\"There are real outbreaks, as with the Hajj in Saudi Arabia in the past… but most of the population in Ireland are protected against diseases like measles,\" Dr Lambert said. \"But, in saying that, if one person with measles is walking around 15,000 people and coughs, some individuals might get it.\" \n\nHe cautioned, however, that while infectious disease spread is not impossible during the Papal visit, it is \"highly unlikely\" and the risk is \"minimal\". \n\nPope Francis will attend the \u0027Festival of Families\u0027 in Croke Park on August 25 and a final mass in Phoenix Park on August 26.

profit.\n\n“RMT is angry and frustrated that efforts by the union to get an agreement on the guard guarantee with South Western Railway bolted down this week was met with the same old tired response from the company that refuses to move the process on and address the fundamental issues.\n\n“That is no way to treat a serious dispute that will impact on huge numbers of passengers through into the autumn and SWR need to get out of this bunker mentality.\n\n“Instead of winging it on passenger safety today, and misleading the public on the level of service, the company should be round the table working out an agreement that ‎puts safety first.\n\n“Our members are striking today to put public safety before private profits and it’s about time SWR took note of what is going on elsewhere in the rail industry, and the settlements RMT has struck that underpin the guard guarantee, and started talking with us seriously around a similar package that puts safety, security and access to services

It really captures the true spirit of the event which has always belonged to the people of this city who go to such great lengths to put on a show every year.\n\n“This year we also celebrate 400 years of the City’s magnificent Walls which play such a key part in our celebrations and we can look forward to another spellbinding celebration and an extended festival with plenty for everyone, young and old, to enjoy.\n\n“Be warned, accommodation always gets booked up fast, so anyone travelling should plan their trip now.”\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push(function () {            var mapMpu = googletag.sizeMapping()                .addSize([100, 100], [[320, 50], [300, 250]])                .addSize([980, 200], [[300, 250]])                .build()            slot = googletag.defineSlot(\u0027/29764278/derrynow_article_mpu\u0027, [1, 1], \u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)                .defineSizeMapping(mapMpu)                                                            .setTargeting(\u0027section\u0027, \u0027news\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027page\u0027, \u0027article\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027id\u0027, \u0027243184\u0027)                                                    .addService(googletag.pubads())            googletag.display(\u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)            googletag.pubads().refresh([slot])        })    \n\n\n\nAmong the regular highlights which draw thousands to the city each year, is the Awakening of the Walls, which makes a welcome return for 2018.\nAs we celebrate four centuries since the building of the city’s stunning ramparts, watch as they come alive with an illuminated animation trail on and around the City Walls from October 28-30.\n\nThe Guildhall will once again be at the centre of the celebrations with the magical Museum of the Moon bathing the Main Hall in its ethereal light for seven days, and where the Samhain Sessions will showcase some fantastic musical talent under its ghostly glow.\n\nUp to 1000 people will be taking part in the carnival parade which is always the main highlight of the programme and a mass community celebration for all. Following the spectacular carnival celebrations and fireworks finale on October 31st, just when you thought it was all over, on November 1st the Walls will once again become the setting for First Light, which will bring the community together for a special celebration of light, remembrance and renewal.\n\nAdd to this story-telling, ghost tours, the Jack-O-Lantern Festival, the Monster Funfair, Little Horrors, Shape Shifter costume and make up workshops and the haunted Harvest Market, and you have the secret formula for the best Halloween celebration in the world.\n\nLooking ahead to the event, Festivals and Events officer with Council, Liz Cunningham, said: “Tonight’s gathering of witches gives just a hint of what’s to come, and really shows how much the people of the city have made this celebration their own. We are thrilled that so many wicked witches turned up for some fun this evening. This year we’ve extended our programme, making it our biggest celebration to date, and we just look forward now to showing the world how it’s done.”\n\nYou can find out more about all the spooktacular
