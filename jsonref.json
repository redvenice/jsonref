I used to have some people tell me, date someone for a year, get to know them and see them. I have had some really crazy relationships.\u0027And men over stepping their boundaries. I am very much about a man being a man and a woman being a woman. And I am all about power couples like Jay Z and Beyonce.\u0027It is a rarity you do not find that every day.

But when I do date, I am not really intrigued right now.       Abraham voiced her concerns for her 10-year-old daughter Sophia\u0027s online life\u0027With all my life experiences I feel like I have lived about five different lives from successful businesses to TV shows to being creative. And I do feel like I will find a man that fits my goals and aspirations and someone to help me with those and be a partner in that.\u0027A person needs to be a serial entrepreneur like myself . And I have only seen very few men who can do three things at one time. Some men can only do one thing at one time, and I am like, you have got to do it all. And when it comes to first dates... I am not one for a drink and a date. I am like, I will meet you in Bali, let\u0027s go have an experience. I take it to another level.

But following a turbulent relationship she forfeited the HRH title when the couple orced in 1996                  Going forward, Harry, who was born a prince of Wales and has been styled HRH since birth, will remain a prince.He keeps his title of the Duke of Sussex that was given to him by his grandmother the Queen on the morning of his wedding.Meghan Markle became HRH the Duchess of Sussex after saying her vows.Their son, Archie Mountbatten-Windsor, is not an HRH - nor a prince - as he is too far down the line of succession from the monarch.Harry and Meghan could have used the courtesy title Earl of Dumbarton for him or he was entitled to be Lord Archie Mountbatten-Windsor.But they took the personal decision to make him a plain Master, most likely inspired by Harry\u0027s wish to have been a normal child rather than a prince, as he grew up.Archie will, however, be entitled to be HRH and a prince when the Prince of Wales accedes to the throne - although it is thought that Harry and Meghan will no longer opt for this. "},{"url":null,"title":"Prince Harry Meghan expected getting 2 3m Duchy Cornwall cash Charles","story":"Share this article One figure went so far as to say that the money he spends, not just on Harry and Meghan but also on financing William and Kate, was ‘draining him’.Officially, the brothers and their households are funded out of Charles’s Duchy of Cornwall estate, but, in fact, the Prince has at times had to dip into his own private reserves.           Buckingham Palace\u0027s bombshell announcement tonight revealed that the couple will give up their Sovereign Grant money - which equates to about £100,000-a-yearAt one stage he was paying the Sussexes more than William and his family. That figure is now understood to be around the same, with Harry and William each receiving approximately £2.5 million.However, the Prince has let it be known that his funds are not inexhaustible and that there is a limit to how far and how much he can pay.Insiders speak of the ‘hundreds of thousands of pounds’ the Prince made available to furnish the couple’s Windsor home after their decision to abandon Kensington Palace.           They will also be repaying the £2.4million Sovereign Grant cash that was used for their Frogmore Cottage revampAccording to a source, the figures involved in providing for both boys have in recent times been flagged up to the Prince by his accounting staff on more than one occasion.‘There’s usually a raised eyebrow, but the Prince always just signs them off,’ says the source.All the same, he has made it clear that while he will continue to fund his sons, there can be, as one courtier put it, ‘no blank cheque’. The couple will now be free to do any commercial deals they like and appear to be continuing their \u0027Sussex Royal\u0027 brand, even though they are no long Royal Highnesses.    If Meghan were to go back to acting she could be in for a princely sum of money, as she made £3million from appearing on American TV show Suits. A source said the couple will spend the majority of their time in North America, and had not signed any commercial agreements as yet."},{"url":null,"title":"Q immediate questions Harry Meghan wish walk away royal family","story":"Share this article When will the changes take place?In the spring of 2020.Will they be financially independent?Not completely.

The 85m-long billboard she installed there last November – a luscious and cinematic sequence of roses, lips, female faces, food and Roman votaries that emerged from research into local figures and places and the archive of London Transport – is called The Bower of Bliss. And that, as it happens, is a quaint old phrase for vagina. “It suddenly came back to me when I was filming at Chatsworth last year,” she says of the term she had first discovered years before in an issue of Oz magazine edited by Germaine Greer. The work is a reminder that women don’t just need safe spaces but joyful ones, too.Sex and pornography can loom large in the work of Linder. Among her best known are those where super-tanned 70s Playboy nudes are embellished with explosions of flowers and naked women in coquettish poses have an electric heater, or a clock, or a Victoria sponge for a head. Linder, who changed the spelling of her first name as punk exploded in mid-70s Manchester (“It felt more European”), has been busy. She spent much of 2018 as artist-in-residence at Chatsworth House, digging through the history of that stately Derbyshire pile to create a film, an exhibition and even a fragrance. “It’s such a treasure house. There are parcels in the attic that have never been opened,” she says, though a more 20th-century discovery was Debo, Duchess of Devonshire’s adoration of Elvis. She also had an exhibition of her finely scalpelled montages at Nottingham Contemporary and created a film and a flag for Glasgow Women’s Library.When we meet, it is at Kettle’s Yard in Cambridge, where a major retrospective of her work will open in February. After that, she is off to Liverpool to create something for the Biennial, which kicks off in July. It seems that in her 65th year, the world is finally ready for her unflinching, upfront feminism.Linder likes to describe herself as a pop baby – “I was born in Liverpool in 1954” – but she is better known for her association with punk. Arriving in Manchester in 1976, she chose to study graphic design at the polytechnic “because it felt connected to the real world”, though she took the opportunity to make masks out of lingerie, too. She was soon sharing a flat with Buzzcocks singer Howard Devoto, and in 1977 she put herself on the map when her artwork was used for the sleeve of the band’s first single, Orgasm Addict. The image, of a muscular naked woman with an iron for a head, was both an homage to the pop-art sensibility of Richard Hamilton’s 1960s collages and a strident feminist scream against the domestic trap. “I grew up in a working-class family in a tiny mining village,” she says. “There were no guidelines for how I should behave, and I found them in The Female Eunuch and other texts of second-wave feminism. By the time I got to Manchester, I was ready to go, ready to make my mark.”She did, as an artist and a performer. While her imagery, which continually raised questions around gender identity and the power of the male gaze, mirrored the low-tech frankness of punk itself, her own image was defined by sharp cheekbones, quiffed hair and bondage trousers. “I’ll never forget the hostile stares I got the first time I wore them,” she says. “Manchester was quite a violent place then. We loved Quentin Crisp and his advice to just look straight ahead.” Fronting her own band, Ludus, at the Haçienda in 1982, she came on stage in a dress made of chicken flesh, and – to further subvert expectations – pulled it up to reveal a huge black dildo. In a city, and on a local music scene, where women were relatively invisible, Linder says now that she felt “like a female astronaut, being sent out into cultural space”.She also became known as Morrissey’s muse and went on to photograph him extensively in the early 90s as he toured the US. “We shared the same taste, liked the same books,” she says. “We shared a house for a brief period in Whalley Range – it was a red-light district then.” With his counterintuitive views on the far-right For Britain party, Morrissey is a touchy subject these days, but Linder is loyal. “We’ve always disagreed,” she says. “It’s a healthy disagreement, the sort that comes with unconditional love.”In the mid-80s, Linder stopped performing. “The underground was over,” she says. “Wham! and Bananarama came along and that was strange if you were in the north of England. We had the miners’ strike.” London had never called to her. But Brussels did, in the form of Les Disques du Crépuscule, an avant-garde music label that invited her to the Belgian capital. She lived above a nightclub called Interference, and people such as Billy Mackenzie and the Lounge Lizards came and went. “From Whalley Range to the rue de la Tête d’Or and all that civic gilding in the Grand Place,” she says. “It was incredible.” In 1990, Linder had a child and went to live on the north-west coast. “I carried on making work, hidden away in a cocoon-like place in the north,” she says. “You have to sit out various periods in culture if you’re like me. The YBAs, for example, they were so much for irony, and that wasn’t a game I wanted to take part in. But I’ve always had the sense that someday acknowledgment would happen.”The second time I speak to Linder, she is in her archive space, which occupies the top floor of a former textile mill in Lancaster. “It’s a 10-minute walk from where the Pendle Witches were hung in the early 17th century,” she says cheerfully. “They were punished for their unacceptable glamour.” (In that period, glamour meant casting of spells, rather than diamonds.) She is keen on witches and mediums, women who defy the social stereotypes and demonstrate the more mystical depths of female psyche. A recent obsession is Ithell Colquhoun, a British female surrealist artist and occultist – you can see the influence of her work in the Southwark billboard. “She had a mantic vision of the universe …” says Linder. “Mantic being to do with ination and prophecy and a little madness. It’s not Enid Blyton.”In the archive, established thanks to a generous grant from the Paul Hamlyn Foundation, she is surrounded by an astonishing 40 years’ worth of material and is busy categorising every item. “I mean, a fan letter from the 1980s – what is that as an object?” She says it is something she has to do “in case I slip under a bus”. She thinks about her funeral a lot, planning the music. “It’s due for an update,” she says. Meanwhile, she is working on the Kettle’s Yard show with a young curator called Amy Tobin, whose own interests are 70s and 80s feminist art practice as well as the complexities of archivism. “I think she knows more about my work than I do,” says Linder.As well as frequently being the subject of her own work, she has organised a series of huge productions that are as montage-like as the flat artwork she makes in her kitchen. One, The Darktown Cakewalk, staged in Glasgow and London in 2010, lasted 13 hours. It included Lindy hop and beauty queens, witch trials, scenes of prejudice and gold lamé suits. Richard Nicoll, the fashion designer who died in 2016, provided the costumes. She has since worked with menswear designer Christopher Shannon on a production that took place on the steps of the ICA in 2016 and combined Tiller Girls with Northern Soul. More recently, Louise Gray designed the outfits worn in the film she made for the Glasgow Women’s Library, another part of the Bower of Bliss project, which shows Mary Queen of Scots exercising in the bower at Chatsworth. “She creates layers and layers of meaning by drawing together all of her historical, political, female and sometimes very funny notions for her works,” says Gray. “I worked on the ICA piece, too. She was ‘live collaging’ artists, dancers and singers on the stairs outside the ICA. I dressed a 30-strong LGBTQI choir from Hackney, who performed in the rain.”Kettle’s Yard was once the home of Jim and Helen Ede, who moved there in the mid-50s and filled it with their collection of Lucie Rie bowls, Alfred Wallis seascapes and sculptures by Brancusi and Gaudier-Brzeska. “It feels like the last gasp of modernism,” says Linder of the house that has been left as they lived in it. “And it really feels like the Jim Ede show. We have had many conversations about why Helen is so not present here.” Indeed, her room, where she would pass the afternoons as Jim entertained Cambridge students, is the only one with no conservation status. Alongside the retrospective of her own work, Linder is creating work for Helen. She is making products for the “House of Helen” brand that will be available in the Kettle’s Yard shop. “Perhaps it suited her to hide away,” says Linder. “I’m really interested in the idea of the invisible woman – that also has a kind of power.”For Linder, on the other hand, invisibility is definitely no longer an option. “I think she’s the most relevant artist of our times,” says Gray – though she might not like that accolade. She might just want to be an artist.”Linderism is at Kettle’s Yard from 15 February to 26 April (kettlesyard)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aeb87202541ab6ff5f42edeb17e1758d2547e559/21_14_2532_1519/master/2532.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44c172f0d4fec30951076dddbebec472","title":"wrappers delight jonny trunk jarvis cocker","story":"The vivid packaging of yesteryear hooked children with images of space travel, pop stars and smoking, as seen in a new book showcasing the bounty of avid collector John TownsendBefore we get on to aspects of design, let’s just take a little time to think about what these wrappers actually contained. A generation of children raised on bubble gum, fizzy drinks and sweet cigarettes – in the days before sugar tax, when E numbers were a signifier of quality and sophistication. It’s a wonder any of us who lived through this era have any teeth left at all.All these products were aimed at kids – but they gave a peculiar foretaste of the adult world we could expect to grow up into. It would seem the main thing we were expected to do as adults was smoke – the aforementioned sweet cigarettes, coconut tobacco (my personal favourite), liquorice pipes and grotesque chocolate cigars. Career options, meanwhile, were law enforcer, space explorer, racing driver, footballer or pop star. Failing that, you could always become a monster. No wonder we couldn’t wait to grow up.If you’re of a certain age these wrappers will speak to you deeply of your desires as a child. The one that presses my buttons is the image of the mini racing-car construction kits. This product is unusual in that it didn’t even pretend to be a sweet – unlike most of the tattoos and trading cards featured in the book, which also contained a sliver of brittle, bright-pink gum that could draw blood if not chewed carefully. These kits were unapologetic tat. I vividly remember working out how to get money out of my ceramic piggybank by jamming a knife blade in the slot and then holding it upside down and shaking it. As soon as I had liberated enough coins I went to the corner shop and bought one of these. Then I ran home to construct it – which took about two minutes. So I jammed the knife into the slot again to get more cash and rushed off to the shop again to buy another one. This went on all day. I was like a nine-year-old crackhead. The world of addiction abruptly reared its ugly head in the suburbs of Sheffield.Lucky bags also provoke an almost Pavlovian response in me: what’s lucky about a bag containing the sweepings from a novelty factory floor with a couple of sweets thrown in? But it was the mystery that had us hooked – what if something really, really precious was in there?It never was, of course – no matter how many times we tried. So in that sense the wrappers featured in this book were the perfect preparation for life in a late-capitalist consumer society: the package promised so much but never delivered on that promise. They were simply designed to separate kids from their loose change as effectively as possible. They were like those mythical beads supposedly used to buy Manhattan Island from the Native Americans.This is by far the safest way to consume these products. To see them for what they really were. To focus on what was important about them all along: the designs that hooked in an entire generation, the pretty pictures that spoke to our primal desires. At this distance, preserved for all time upon these pages, they are beautiful.Go on… feast your eyes.• Wrappers Delight, compiled by Jonny Trunk with a foreword by Jarvis Cocker, is published by Fuel (£24.95).

Since Occupy Central – and the umbrella movement that succeeded it – ended without achieving its stated goal, Hong Kong has entered one of its most challenging chapters. Protesters coming out of a failed movement are overcome with disillusionment and powerlessness. The appeal sentencing of myself and my fellow umbrella leaders Nathan Law and Alex Chow has dealt yet another devastating blow to the morale of pro-democracy activists. Even though it feels as if we have hit rock bottom, we need to stay true to our cause. We must. To my friends who have decided to walk away from politics, I hope my being here and writing you this letter will convince you to reconsider. If not, our sacrifices will have been for nothing.I miss my mum’s hand-brewed milk tea terribly, and the chicken hotpot at the street-food restaurant where my friends and I always hang out. That’s the first place I’ll visit as soon as I’m out of here. But at the moment, my biggest worry is the state of my political party. Ever since Nathan and I co-founded Demosisto in April 2016 we’ve suffered a series of significant setbacks. Four weeks ago, Nathan lost his hard-won seat at the legislative council (LegCo) after he and five other members were disqualified on the grounds that they had failed to properly recite their oaths during the swearing-in ceremony. Nearly everyone is now out of a job, while half of our executive committee is behind bars, or will be in the coming weeks. My message to the pro-Beijing camp? Don’t celebrate too soon. I began my journey in 2012 when I led the campaign against the national education curriculum. It’s been a tumultuous five years. I didn’t shed a single tear when the judge announced my sentence, not because I was brave but because I wanted my supporters to embrace my loss of freedom as a necessary step on our collective path to democracy. To quote JK Rowling’s Hagrid: “What’s coming will come and we’ll meet it when it does.”Hong Kong is at a crossroads. The ruling regime will stop at nothing to silence dissent. For those who dare to stand up to them, the only way forward is together. And tonight, alone in my cell, I ask you to keep your chin up and use your tears, anger and frustration as motivation to charge ahead. Hong Kong people, carry on!I’ve been assigned a two-person cell. My cellmate seems friendly enough, although we didn’t have a chance to say much to each other before the lights went out. So far the biggest source of discomfort is perhaps the bed. In fact, calling it a bed is an over-statement. It’s nothing more than a wooden plank with no mattress. But, then again, if I could spend 79 nights sleeping on a highway during the umbrella movement I’m sure I can get used to this too.Twice a day, the news is broadcast on the PA system. This morning I was woken up by a story about Chris Patten, the last governor of Hong Kong. “Mr Patten told reporters that he was heartened by the sacrifices made by Joshua Wong, Alex Chow and Nathan Law, and that he believed these three names will be carved into history ...” It felt surreal to hear my name mentioned. The reality that I’m a convicted criminal has finally sunk in.I feel a little embarrassed about the enormous media attention that Alex, Nathan and I received last week. Local newspapers plastered my picture on their front pages the day after I was sent to prison. The reality is that countless others are being tried or are about to be tried in Hong Kong for their activism work. Many face much harsher prison terms than we do.Being phoneless is like having my limbs cut off or an itch I can’t scratch.LegCo member Shiu Ka-chun, nicknamed “Bottle”,  came to see me this morning. I met him six years ago, when I was a 14-year-old secondary school student and he a social worker and radio presenter. He later hosted some of my anti-national education rallies. In the documentary Netflix made about me, Joshua: Teenager vs Superpower, there is a scene in which I appear on Bottle’s radio show and he asks if I have a girlfriend. “My mum told me it’s too early for me to be dating,” I reply, and everyone in the studio bursts out laughing. Neither of us would have guessed that five years later we would be talking to each other on different sides of a glass partition.A prison supervisor approached me this afternoon for a chat about recent news events. He began by declaring himself to be an “independent”, and that he’s neither a “yellow ribbon” (a supporter of the umbrella movement) nor a “blue ribbon” (a supporter of the government and the police). He asked me whether I had any regrets about entering politics and ending up behind bars, before launching into a 30-minute monologue on my conviction. His point – if there was one: we all got what we asked for.Like every other day since I arrived, a handful of inmates and I spent most of today sweeping the 2,000-sq ft canteen. We clean after every breakfast, lunch and dinner. Most twentysomethings in Hong Kong live with their parents and many middle-class households have a live-in maid. My family is no exception. I’ve never cleaned this much in my life and I keep telling myself that it’s good for my character.Twice a day, a senior correctional officer visits the facility. All inmates have to stand in a straight line with our chests out, make a fist with both hands, and stare, not straight ahead, but 45 degrees upwards.Today I had my first dreaded morning march. I’m scrawny and spend nearly all my spare time playing video games and watching Japanese anime.I don’t go out much and I’ve never been athletic or particularly coordinated. I’ll be lucky to get through the march without embarrassing or hurting myself.Three years ago, I joined hundreds of thousands of brave citizens in the largest political movement in Hong Kong’s history with the simple goal to bring true democracy to our city. We asked to exercise our constitutional right to elect our own leader through a fair and open election. Not only did the Hong Kong government – appointed by Beijing and under its direction – ignore our demands, it also arrested and charged many of us with illegal assembly.Until recently, the charge of unlawful assembly was used only to prosecute members of local gangs. In the past, the term “political prisoner” conjured up frightening images of dissidents in mainland China being rounded up and thrown into jail. It’s hard to imagine that the term now also applies to Hong Kong. As Beijing’s long arm reaches into every corner and threatens our freedoms and way of life, the number of prisoners of conscience is only going to increase.Unfortunately, few foreign governments are willing to take on the world’s second largest economy and hold its actions to account. For instance, I was disheartened by the latest Six-Monthly Report on Hong Kong published by the British foreign secretary, Boris Johnson. Despite the political persecution of activists like me, he concluded that the “one country, two systems” framework was “working well”. As a signatory to the Sino-British joint declaration on Hong Kong, Britain has both a moral and a legal obligation to defend its former subjects and speak up on their behalf.More than one inmate has asked me: “How much do they pay you to do your political stuff?” At first I thought they just wanted to provoke me with accusations that I take money from foreign governments. But I’ve slowly realised the questions are genuine. Most people don’t understand why any sane person would risk prison to do what I do if it wasn’t for money. Today is the third anniversary of my Civic Square siege, the event that set in motion the umbrella movement and a turning point in my life. This time three years ago, I scaled a metal fence near the government headquarters and called on other protesters to follow me. I was tackled by a dozen police officers and taken into custody. There’s a huge variety of political views here. The younger prisoners tend to be yellow ribbons. Several of them have opened up to me about their involvement in the umbrella movement and subsequent protests. But there are plenty of hardcore blue ribbons too. Yesterday someone from the security unit pulled me aside and told me that some older guys in the workshop had heckled me and yelled “Traitor” when I walked past.I received letters from a few university classmates today. We started in the same year and now they’re about to graduate. By summer next year they’ll be starting their first jobs, moving ahead in life.My last day in prison came and went like any other. By the time I’m released I’ll have spent 69 days behind bars. They represent an important milestone in my seven-year journey in political activism. I’ll come out of prison stronger and more committed to our cause than ever.In June 2019, on the heels of the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, a controversial fugitive transfer arrangement with China tabled by the government set off a fresh round of protests. It felt as if it was the umbrella movement all over again, except this time protesters were angrier and more combative. Young people’s voices went from loud to deafening as they refused to be brushed aside as they had in 2014. Street demonstrations escalated quickly after million person marches failed to move politicians. Peaceful rallies soon gave way to full-scale urban guerrilla warfare.A new cold war is brewing between China and the rest of the democratic world, and Hong Kong is holding the line in one of its first battles. Nothing captures that tension more vividly than the moments on 1 October 2019 when live coverage of the 70th anniversary celebrations in Beijing were shown side by side with scenes of demonstrators braving teargas and throwing eggs at Xi Jinping’s portraits on the streets of Hong Kong. The contrast sends a clear message to the world that China’s tightening grip on Hong Kong is part of a much broader threat to global democracy.In May 2019, I went to prison for the second time. I spent seven weeks at Lai Chi Kok Correctional Institution for violating a court injunction during the umbrella movement. I tried to comfort my parents and joked that my biggest regret was having to miss the opening night of Avengers: Endgame, the sequel to Avengers: Infinity War. Before I headed to prison, a foreign reporter asked me for a soundbite about my second incarceration and China’s crackdown on pro-democracy activists in general. I thought about the discussion I had with my parents and said: “This isn’t our endgame. Our fight against the CCP is an infinity war.” The infinity war that has ravaged Hong Kong for years, I am afraid, may be coming soon to a political theatre near you.• Edited extract from Unfree Speech by Joshua Wong and Jason Y Ng, published by WH Allen (RRP £9.99) on 30 January.

But why were they even controversial?In her maiden speech to the House of Commons, the new Labour MP for Coventry South, Zarah Sultana, said, “In 10 years’ time, at the start of the next decade, I want to look teenagers in the eye and say with pride: my generation faced 40 years of Thatcherism, and we ended it.”In failing to distinguish the previous Labour government’s tenure under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown from the Tory governments that preceded and followed it, Sultana raised a tediously inevitable stink. What about Sure Start? What about cutting rough sleeping? What about the minimum wage? In 1997, to say that Blair built on the economic foundations of Thatcher’s economic reforms would have been neither a radical statement nor something with which either Thatcher or Blair would have disagreed. Blairism would not have been conceivable in 1979 by 1997 it seemed inevitable, and it was Thatcher’s reforms that made it so. So why is that now unsayable?Thatcher reconfigured the British economy. The ultimate aim of the Tory government during the 1980s was to smash open the postwar consensus of unionised work and the welfare state, and place “the market” at the cornerstone of British governance.Blair and Brown took this reconfigured economy and added a layer of income redistribution to blunt its harshest effects. As Peter Mandelson famously said, Labour was “intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich, so long as they pay their taxes.” The fundamentals would not only remain unchanged it was essential that they stay in place. The energised, aspirational, entrepreneurial economy was Thatcher’s gift to Blair – taming it to serve the common cause was the supposed genius of the third way.When the global financial crash happened, it turned out that ownership mattered a great deal. Just as Blairism based itself on Thatcherism, so the moral foundation of austerity was built in the Blair years. By redistributing income rather than wealth, Blairism left the country primed for a “makers v takers”, “strivers v skivers” attack. All those owners were suddenly asking: why am I paying for all this?Through right to buy and the easy availability of finance capital, Thatcher’s Conservatives created a new layer of homeowning, aspirational middle-class Britons who at least felt richer, even if they were just overmortgaged against a housing bubble. Rather than replacing council houses to stymie rent growth, New Labour used housing benefit to effectively subsidise a new class of Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen-watching aspirational landlords. Housing was provided, people were getting filthy rich, taxes were paying for it, and everything was great until it wasn’t.Whom to blame now that Brown’s vaunted end of boom-and-bust had itself come to an end? Reliably enough, both parties turned to the scapegoat of Those People – the benefits claimants, the foreign-looking, that suspiciously affluent next door neighbour you don’t like. Once the country was no longer thinking in terms of “entrepreneurial aspiration” but back to “keeping hold of what I’ve got”, the Tories were fighting on their home turf. Paying for public services turned neatly into unsustainable, wasteful spending.As the mafia knows, the best way to cover up a crime is to make sure everyone is complicit. If I go down, you go down. How to challenge finance capital’s death-grip on the economy when doing so would knock the house prices that make your voters feel good? Ultimately, even Corbyn fought and lost on that battleground of “how will you pay for all this free stuff?”You cannot rely purely on the material explanation, though, to explain the ferocity with which the centre-left rejects this plain reading of history. There is an element of ideological self-preservation here, even as they deny the existence of an ideology and appeal simply to common sense. If Blair had a choice, if we all had a choice, then there is some hard explaining to do.The younger generation, clustered in cities, paying unsustainable rents while they seek precarious gig- economy work, are asking difficult questions of those who brought us here. Smashed as Corbynism is, its abortive groundswell happened for a reason. As climate catastrophe takes its toll, as Deliveroo riders cycle past rough sleepers knowing it could easily be them on the cardboard, they are asking if it really had to be this way. Was there, in all honesty, no alternative to this?It is this question that so exercises the defenders of Blair’s legacy. There had to have been no choice, so nobody can be to blame for having made it. The alternative is simply unthinkable.• Phil McDuff writes on economics and social policy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62c9ef86dc2a64fea62930c2153375184ad4f33d/0_313_5020_3012/master/5020.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11d9e98612af396af44ebff23e00d19a","title":"the uncomfortable truths about roger scruton conservatism","story":"I first met Roger Scruton almost 20 years ago at a symposium in Sweden. I admired the eloquence with which he could talk about Kant and the elegance of his writing on beauty. I learned from his conservatism, even as I disagreed with what he said. But although I got to know him quite well over the years, our relationship was always fraught. For there was another Roger Scruton, not the philosopher but the polemicist. For all his warmth and generosity, and for all the poise of his writing, his views were often ugly. “Whatever its defects,” Scruton wrote in his memoir Gentle Regrets, “my life has enabled me to find comfort in uncomfortable truths.” His death last week seems an appropriate moment to reflect on the “uncomfortable truths” of Scruton’s conservatism, and on the relationship between the philosopher and the polemicist.It was Scruton the polemicist who became the founding editor of the Salisbury Review, established in 1982 to defend a traditional conservatism that many felt was being eroded by the Thatcherite revolution.Today, the Review is remembered largely for the Ray Honeyford affair, in which the Bradford headmaster was forced to resign after a furore over a1984 article critical of multiculturalism. Honeyford’s polemic was, however, bland by the standards of the Review in the 80s.The first issue published a talk by John Casey on the politics of race. The presence of “West Indian communities”, he claimed, “offends… a sense of what English life should be like” and “a sense of what is civilised behaviour”. Only the “repatriation of a proportion of the immigrant and immigrant-descended population” could forestall “the possible destruction of civilised life in the centres of the big cities”.If race was one obsession, sex was another, especially gay sex. “A concern with social order,” Scruton wrote in an editorial, “prompts us to view… homosexuality as intrinsically threatening.”In the 1980s, the Salisbury Review, and Scruton himself, was seen as occupying the fringes of politics. In many of the past week’s eulogies, he was presented as a figure ostracised by political correctness but ultimately proved right. In fact, many old Salisbury Review authors, including Casey, have long since disavowed their views. Scruton said in 2010 that homosexuality was a “complicated” issue, but he no longer believed it to be “repellent”.The reactionary views about immigrants and gays do not however merely reflect the attitudes of a less enlightened time. They expose also the character of the conservatism that Scruton espoused, which drew deeply upon Edmund Burke’s vision of society and human nature. Both men viewed society as a kind of “trust, with the living members as trustees of an inheritance that they must strive to enhance and pass on”.For both, “prejudice” was the key social cement. “Our most necessary beliefs may be both unjustified and unjustifiable,” Scruton insisted, “and the attempt to justify them will merely lead to their loss.” The ideal society was built not on values such as liberty or equality but on obedience, “the prime virtue of political beings, the disposition that makes it possible to govern them. In the good society one accepted one’s station in life.It was, for Scruton, impossible to conceive of society without prejudices and exclusions, discrimination and inequality. That’s why his views, despite mellowing over the years, never substantially altered. Scruton the philosopher required Scruton the polemicist. Immigration, he claimed in a 2006 defence of Enoch Powell, had led to “the people of Europe… losing their homelands”. He echoed Casey’s argument about the inherent unsuitability of non-white immigrants, applying it this time not to blacks but to “pious Muslims from the hinterlands of Asia who would never “aproduce children loyal to a secular European state”. In 2007, he wrote that although homosexuality “has been normalised, it is not normal”.Does all this mean that we can only embrace the need for society if we also accept illiberal policies? That we have to choose between a liberal inidualism that corrodes social life and a notion of a society that is intolerant and exclusionary? Burke developed his ideas in response not to liberal inidualism but to a different kind of threat: the actions of what he called the “swinish multitude”, ordinary people acting collectively to transform the conditions of their lives. From struggles for suffrage to battles for decent working conditions, the swinish multitude challenged the traditional social order and through organisations such as trade unions nurtured new ideas of solidarity, community and belonging that confronted both the inidualism of liberalism and the conservative demand for inequality and obedience.But as such organisations have crumbled in recent years, so have radical ideas of what society could be. For many, the only way to think of the “social” today is through Burkean notions of exclusion and prejudice. But this is to abandon any notion of a society that can enhance the lives of those with least power – the working class, migrants, minorities, the swinish multitude.I am glad to have known Roger Scruton, grateful for our conversations, fractious though they often were, and saddened by his death. What I learned from him, however, only strengthened my conviction that I am not, and could never be, a conservative."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72a129cdc27d8a375df219e7deb49ab3e7f0f522/61_0_915_549/master/915.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b804f365be2f184a3fb985ccc27d2019","title":"schools converting toilet blocks into isolation booths","story":"Children’s commissioner describes ‘horror stories’ of children put in isolationSchools are converting toilet blocks and classrooms to build isolation booths to accommodate “disruptive” children, the children’s commissioner has said, as campaigners warn that excessive use of the practice could be putting young people’s mental health at risk.Anne Longfield said she had heard “horror stories” about children’s experiences in isolation booths – spaces in which pupils sit in silence for hours as punishment for breaking school rules and disruptive behaviour.Some pupils told her they had been put in isolation repeatedly for days or weeks at a time and described the experience as “distressing and degrading”, while others said they had slept because there was nothing to do.The children’s commissioner is conducting research to find out how widespread the use of isolation booths is and what kind of children are affected in response to mounting disquiet among parents and mental health campaigners about the practice.At one school, Longfield said she had been told that a portable booth made out of cardboard was used to place over a child in the classroom. Pupils told her they had been put in isolation over minor uniform breaches or the wrong hairstyle.Longfield is also concerned that isolation is being used by some schools as a “gateway” to exclusions and that it affects disproportionately high numbers of children with special educational needs.Last week, the Centre for Mental Health charity warned that putting challenging pupils in isolation for extended periods at school could harm their mental health and that young people who had already suffered trauma were particularly vulnerable.But some in the education sector back the the use of isolation for disruptive children. The government’s behaviour tsar for England, Tom Bennett, recently told the  that “removal rooms” were used so children could learn in a safe, calm environment.“They aren’t isolation rooms – I’ve never seen a school leave a child unattended. They’re supervised, and more often than not, accompanied by other students. So claims that these are isolation spaces is nonsense. These are safe spaces, run by adults,” he said.Other headteachers say the use of well-run isolation rooms means lessons are disruption-free for other children. Ruth Robinson, a school leader from Swindon, explained on Twitter that at her school 10-15 out of 900 students on average spent the day in the school’s isolation room, though booths were not used.“The impact of this approach is that every single lesson taught at the school is disruption-free. No teacher is ever talked over. Pupils are not rude. Pupils don’t refuse to work. This system is strict but it isn’t draconian. It works because it’s fair and because everyone understands it.”In an interview with the , Longfield said: “I get lots of anecdotal evidence, lots of kids and some parents, telling me about the awful experience they have had in isolation and isolation booths.“I get to hear about children who have spent long periods of time in isolation rooms. They have told us that they find it distressing and degrading. They said they feel like they are being warehoused in isolation, and they say sometimes it’s for days or weeks at a time.“I was told of a school where they were converting a toilet section into isolation booths – and the comment there was it was very handy because they had already got the cubicles.”Longfield said she had also heard of schools where teachers were having their classrooms taken away because more booths were wanted, “and I heard of one bizarre example of how they had a kind of portable booth which was a cardboard booth which they just put over the child wherever they were sitting”.There are no official figures, but one BBC investigation said more than 200 pupils had spent at least five straight days in isolation areas in schools in England in 2017. A “Lose the Booths” conference has been organised for next weekend to encourage headteachers to remove booths and employ better practices.John Procter of Corporate Office Furniture, which sells isolation booths, said about 50 schools had acquired units from him over the last five years. In the last three months alone, around eight schools have bought around 100 units, each costing £175.“It’s not cruel,” said Procter. “These people who say it’s wrong, they need to spend a day in a school and see actually what these teachers have to go through. The teachers have not signed up to being abused.”Many in the sector say a distinction should be drawn between isolation rooms and the use of confined booths, in which children have to face the wall and cannot communicate with each other. They say there is also a balance to be struck between the needs of challenging pupils and those who want to work without distraction.But Longfield said she was concerned that there may be a link between the use of isolation and exclusions. “Often parents, especially those with children with special educational needs, will talk to me about how their children are always being put in isolation booths.“Some children have said they even just sleep in the booths. In fact, one child even said: ‘Oh well, they’re not that bad,’ – they get to have a sleep.”The government is due to publish fresh guidance later this year on managing behaviour and the use of isolation rooms and exclusions. “All kids have a right to a good education and if they are being removed from a classroom and put into isolation they are not getting their education,” said Longfield. “I’m being told that some children are put in isolation because they have their hair in the wrong style or they have forgotten something or they are wearing some part of the uniform that isn’t right. I don’t want kids put into isolation about that.”Longfield said she accepted there needed to be quiet areas outside the classrooms where children could calm down. “But what I’m concerned about is when those isolation booths seem to be booming in some schools and when those periods of isolation outside the classroom become very much the norm and when they are being abused.”A Department for Education spokesperson said: “Schools may choose to use in-school units, whether that be to provide additional support to vulnerable pupils, or as a sanction to remove pupils with challenging behaviour from the classroom.“Our guidance is clear, however, that use of isolation must comply with pupil safeguarding and welfare requirements. Pupils are not to be kept in isolation longer than necessary and their time spent there must be as constructive as possible.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cdd4278e4a8426ebf56b3e11a33ba9f201134936/0_257_6016_3608/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=615ea16544b1521fac26ec21038c39a5","title":"world tour luxury jet","story":"Forget cruises. The super-rich have found a new way to see the world in the luxurious style of an ocean liner but taking a fraction of the time: private jet round-the-world tours.This week, 50 members of the wealthy elite will board a privately chartered Boeing 757 to begin a 24-day guided tour of the globe, taking in Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro, the Galápagos islands and mountain gorillas in Rwanda.The trip involves 10 flights, 23 nights in five-star hotels or lodges, meals in some of the world’s most famous restaurants, champagne and “every single tip”. Thrown in are tour guides, an engineer, seven cabin crew, a chef and an “expedition physician”.The cost is £108,000 a person for couples, or £118,800 for one. The cost to the environment is the emission of 13 tonnes of carbon dioxide per passenger, according to research for the Observer by analysts at the clean transport campaign group Transport and Environment. It would take a typical family of four driving to their annual holiday on the south coast of France more than 30 years to rack up the same emissions. Going by train, they could make the same trip 150 times before reaching the same level of emissions.The jet used for the trip, which is described by the organiser, TCS World Travel, as “the Ferrari of commercial jets”, has been designed for well-heeled clients. The plane, which can carry up to 295 passengers, has been reconfigured to accommodate 50 customers in business class seats. The carbon footprint will be almost six times more per person than if the plane was filled with economy class travellers. TCS said it had paid to offset all flights.If you are thinking of joining the tour, you’re too late. The trip sold out months in advance.When the trip is completed, it’s a quick turn around before a fresh set of wealthy passengers begins another round-the-world adventure. The next 25-day trip includes Machu Picchu, Easter Island, the Great Barrier Reef, Angkor Wat in Cambodia, and a safari in the Serengeti. It starts in late February and has also sold out.At least three other companies, including the luxury hotel chain Four Seasons and the Singaporean hotel chain Aman, offer similar trips.Four Seasons’ trips include an onboard chef. “It’s the highest Four Seasons restaurant in the world,” says Kerry Sear, Four Seasons’ executive chef, in the marketing video. “I often hear, ‘how are you going to wow us on this trip, Kerry?’.Shelley Cline, the president of TCS, said the company had commissioned a dedicated private jet from Airbus to replace the Boeing 757 next year, with 52 Italian leather fully-flat beds.Cline said many of the travellers were entrepreneurs who had made millions from their own businesses. “Many are self-made and want to enjoy themselves after all that hard work, but no matter their age or how they make their living, they are all curious about the world,” she said.“Time-saving is absolutely one of the big selling points about our trips. We fly direct, which also eliminates the hassles of airport layovers. We did a calculation, and to do the same around the world trip on commercial air would take 10 more days (34 vs 24) and would entail 11 more flights, 39 more hours of flying time and about 74 more hours waiting between flights.“Another reason people take our trips is for the special experiences and access that would be prohibitive to do on their own. Whether it’s getting into the Hermitage before it opens to the general public, having an amazing private dinner at a temple at Angkor Wat, or having dinner with royalty in some countries, we are able to provide our guests experiences that last a lifetime.”Cline said TCS prided itself on thinking of everything a traveller might need, extending to all but writing postcards to families and friends for them.“They don’t have to handle their luggage, we fill out their immigration forms (well, they do have to sign them),” she said. “We even provide stamped postcards and spending money in the local currency at every stop.”Guests are accompanied by experts who give lectures on destination stops, including David Keeling, a professor of geography at Western Kentucky University.“As a cultural geographer I focus on destination context, such as demographics, economics, geopolitics, history and resource management,” he said. “Most of my lectures have an environmental component. For example, we are visiting the Males and my lecture for that destination covers the impacts of climate change, geopolitical implications for small island communities, and economic challenges. I talk a lot about carbon footprints and carbon offsetting, something that TCS is very sensitive about, and the company provides opportunities for guests to offset their footprint.”Jack Ezon, founder and managing partner of luxury travel agency Embark Beyond, said organised round-the-world private jet holidays started booming in popularity about four years ago. “They really give people the opportunity to explore the world in the limited time they have,” he said. “You’re not going to be able to deep e into Cambodia in a single day, but it enables you to stitch together a story from around the world. By looking at how quickly it’s proliferating, there are clearly enough people with enough money for this.”Ezon said most guests were baby boomers. “It is usually the cruise client who has done every port of call, and is looking for new experiences. They’re not just any old trip. They make it an experience, they do dinners in palaces or parties on the Great Wall of China. They really go beyond what you expect, and to places that ordinary clients travelling on their own wouldn’t be able to go to.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c933055d3ffef649cbba7ce04a25cf80e43ea24c/643_190_2857_1715/master/2857.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26f0d23b70d8a32d0593ab631b222c2a","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"The pick of the best flora and fauna photos from around the world, including an iguana and an injured leopard"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6dc539d9ce9c6c5f63c9b8feb90d4da9d518bf66/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=894246294ea52d06c6a03d46a24246a1","title":"ben gorham interview with byredo i wanted more inclusive approach to luxury","story":"After his career as a basketballer ended, Ben Gorham leapt into a whole new world – and set up the luxury brand ByredoHe has shops on the coolest streets of New York, Paris, London and Seoul, with two Beijing flagships having opened last year. He’s good mates with Louis Vuitton’s Virgil Abloh, Burberry’s Riccardo Tisci and Kanye West, and has Naomi Campbell and Edward Enninful RSVPing to his launch parties around the world. But Ben Gorham still might be one of the most influential people you’ve never heard of.You are, however, likely to be familiar with his brainchild, Byredo. The brand is, after all, largely responsible for the reason you may have coveted a designer candle or boutique perfume in the last decade. Since its launch as a fragrance brand in 2006, it has become a byword for independent cool, with multiple new categories – including handbags, eyewear, trainers, men’s tailoring and, most recently, jewellery – taking it from modest to major player.However, if this sounds like a straightforward success story, it is anything but. At 42, Gorham’s trajectory is one that makes him also one of the most inspiring people you’ve never heard of.Born in Sweden, he and his sister were raised by their Indian single mother. When he was 11, she took the family to Toronto where his first love was basketball. Interested in school only for the access it gave him to the sport, he trained for four or five hours a day and – encouraged by his mother – moved back to Europe after college to pursue basketball professionally. “She grew up in a garage in Mumbai with five brothers and was extremely poor,” he says, “but somehow she related to my passion for basketball and her support was key.”It was, however, not to be. While he assumed that he would be able to stay in Sweden indefinitely, given his Swedish birth, “technicalities” with his immigration process took three years to iron out, by which point his sports contracts had dried up. At 25, feeling unable to return to Canada, he found himself getting up at 4.30am to work long hours on construction sites.“I left being all ‘I’m going to do this’ and ‘This is going to happen,’” he recalls, “and so I stayed in Sweden with some level of shame or defeat. Looking back, it was one of the low points of my life – all these dreams came crashing down with the realisation that not only was who I thought I was irrelevant, but who I thought I was going to be was also irrelevant,” he says, his imposing 6ft 5in frame somehow surprising for someone so mild- mannered and softly spoken. “I was Ben the basketball player who was really talented, popular and confident and then I was just Ben. It was an existential crisis.”Pivotally, he continues in his gentle Canadian tones, “from that low came immense drive” and he discovered an interest in art. It was “an echo” that stemmed from his college days – when he chopped and changed his courses from business to political science to interior design to architecture. He put his head down and graduated with a degree in fine art from Stockholm Art School shortly after.With art and fashion natural bedfellows, it’s not a stretch to see how he developed his interest in style over this period, but it would be the art of fragrance that would first pique his interest after a chance encounter with the perfumer Pierre Wulff in 2004. Sometime later, with investors and advisers on board, a business plan drawn up and “a dotcom” bought, Byredo was born.“I had no experience in olfactory – or bags or sneakers, or building a store or opening a cash register,” he smiles. “I was quite naive at first, but learning by doing has been my formula.” This open-minded attitude makes Gorham something of a role model for a new generation of people who, instead of seeing boundaries in professional pursuits, are polymaths. When asked why, the answer is, “Why not?” If Gorham finds synergy with a product, he doesn’t see an obstacle in pursuing it – even if it seems out of keeping with the other products he sells.“This has been hard for people to fathom. One of the challenges over the decade has been this idea that people like to put things into boxes,” he says, reasoning that “a woman’s handbag possesses a level of intimacy similar to that of a woman’s perfume, because it’s about expressing who you are.”Gorham’s penetration of the world of luxury perfume and fashion has also been a perceptive one. “I remember looking at brand narratives and thinking they were old. Luxury, as an idea, was intimidating and I felt there could be an approach to it that was inclusive – this was before that word was used so much.”“Coming from an ethnic background,” he says, “growing up listening to hip-hop and going to an all-black and Latino high school, understanding culture and race, and travelling a lot,” he was keen to dispel the idea that brands needed cultural identity. “I would just say, mine doesn’t have one – it’s as erse as myself.”This open-minded, fluid perspective informs his business practice. His deliberate eschewing of marketing, for example, was not only because he was unable to compete “with the likes of Gucci”, but because he didn’t think it was a way to grow a business organically. “I felt like advertising was a bit like steroids – what happens when you stop taking your steroids?” he laughs. In addition, he’s kept all his products at both accessible and aspirational prices – ranging from £30 to £5,000 – and has sought the advice of artists rather than analysts to entice customers.“With consumer goods, people think there is this need to completely explain what they are selling somebody they think if people understand it, they’ll buy it. In art, it’s different because if the subject is understood completely, there is a tension lost and it makes the art less interesting.” This theory accounts for his stripped-back branding, multiple cross-genre projects and his shops, which have been designed to feel deliberately different. “Learning to gauge yourself and know that you do not have to spell it out for everybody, that people are intelligent, complex and emotional – that’s an important part of any experience.” When it comes to his own positioning, he explains that “there’s a part of me that wants to say, ‘You don’t know everything.’ I want to surprise, and I want to inspire.” He adds that, along with Virgil Abloh (the first black designer of the world’s largest luxury house), he still considers himself an outsider when it comes to the luxury industry. “We have attained a certain level of acceptance from people and have created an audience, but I don’t think we’ve been institutionalised – we’re not them. We’re still working in their industry, but in a different way. There’s a sobriety tied to it. Take a step back and things are quite different.”Living in Stockholm with his wife, Natasha, and their daughters, Inez, 10, and Anouk, five, helps with this perspective. “My daughter is going through a stage where her parents are awkward and uncool,” he smiles, “but I’m told she’ll come back to me.” Life revolves around the school run, his studio and outdoor sports that are “his reset” – his favourite being trips to Alaska to cold-water surf in a 6mm wetsuit, something he only learned recently. “I’m not thinking about budgets when I’m lying on that board,” he laughs.Such distance must help him reflect on his achievements. “I find myself in a state sometimes where I feel humbled, but I don’t feel surprised,” he says, frankly. “It feels like it was always meant to be. From being a child in a suburb in Stockholm, watching Michael Jordan on a video and saying: ‘I wanna be that guy’ I’ve always aimed high.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01caae18935f689832ded1acf2f5e4cc1e7146a5/0_8_2748_1648/master/2748.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c76d07cb691f8e8e7754a45da99f95fe","title":"johnny marr joins hans zimmer to score next james bond film","story":"No Time to Die will be the 25th film in the franchise and Daniel Craig’s final role as 007Former Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr will join composer Hans Zimmer to score the upcoming James Bond movie No Time to Die.Zimmer, widely celebrated for his scores for films such as Gladiator, The Da Vinci Code and the Pirates of the Caribbean series, was drafted in as a last-minute replacement earlier this month.No Time to Die, which is the 25th James Bond film in the franchise and Daniel Craig’s final fling in the role, will be released in April 2020.Marr told NME: “Part of the legacy of the Bond films is iconic music, so I’m very happy to be bringing my guitar to No Time To Die.”The pair had previously collaborated together to score a number of projects, including Inception and The Amazing Spider-Man.Zimmer replaces Dan Romer, who reportedly departed due to creative differences. It was Zimmer’s close friendship with Bond producer Barbara Broccoli that led to his initial involvement with the film. “I never thought I would do this. I honestly never thought about it other than that Barbara Broccoli is a really dear friend, I just love her as a human being, very much,” he said.Zimmer is one of Hollywood’s most high-profile composers, winning an Oscar for his 1994 theme for The Lion King. He is best known for his collaborations with Christoper Nolan on Inception, Interstellar and the Dark Knight movies.Earlier this week, Billie Eilish announced she would be writing and singing the theme song to No Time to Die. The 18-year-old musician is youngest artist to provide the soundtrack to a Bond film, which has over the years morphed into an highly anticipated music event.Eilish said: “It feels crazy to be a part of this in every way. To be able to score the theme song to a film that is part of such a legendary series is a huge honour. James Bond is the coolest film franchise ever to exist. I’m still in shock.”She follows some of the industry’s biggest names in creating a song for the franchise, including Shirley Bassey, Paul McCartney, Duran Duran, Madonna, Sam Smith and Adele. The UK’s Official Charts, which described Bond’s theme songs as an “integral part of British music and film legacy”, notes that Smith’s theme song for 2015’s Writing’s On The Wall is the only one in the franchise to reach number one, while Duran Duran’s A View To A Kill and Adele’s Skyfall each peaked at number two in 1985 and 2012 respectively."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fc5b3b47a41635b75574c33059a2bf66bc7d4fc/0_137_4098_2459/master/4098.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=faf1ce3ba008d936b87fcd928a4adf8e","title":"manchester city crystal palace premier league match report","story":"If this goes down as the day Manchester City all but mathematically surrendered their title, frustration will surely be the searing emotion. They dominated Crystal Palace and looked to have overturned Cenk Tosun’s first-half strike via Sergio Agüero goals on 82 and 87 minutes.However Wilfried Zaha raced upfield with the clock in added time and the winger hit a cross at Fernandinho, which the Brazilian turned beyond his own goalkeeper, Ederson.This quietened the home crowd, and the draw means Liverpool can pull 16 points ahead of City if Manchester United are beaten on Sunday, with the leaders still having another game in hand to play.On David Silva’s 300th league appearance Pep Guardiola made three changes, drafting in Ilkay Gündogan, Bernardo Silva and Raheem Sterling, with Roy Hodgson introducing only the on-loan Tosun as Palace’s forward.There is no doubt Benjamin Mendy enhances City – the issue is if he can stay fit. Here the left‑back’s ability to hit a curving cross that is difficult to defend was illustrated on countless occasions, with an early one aimed at Sterling coming close to creating an opening goal.David and Bernardo Silva, Sterling, Mendy and Kevin De Bruyne combined throughout to give Palace problems. When De Bruyne’s 20-yard free-kick crashed off Vicente Guaita’s crossbar, Fernandinho looked to finish the rebound from close in only to be put off by a shove from James McArthur. The Palace midfielder was lucky this went undetected as he had just been booked by Graham Scott for the foul that led to De Bruyne taking aim from the dead ball.When Hodgson had a fierce word with Guaita for hitting a clearance straight to Ederson, this indicated how the visitors could ill-afford to waste the scant possession they had.Zaha is expected to carry Palace’s attacking threat and it was noticeable how Bernardo Silva and João Cancelo worked hard to go tight on him when he received. John Stones, who was shaky throughout, may have been lucky not to concede penalty when attempting a tackle on Zaha: the Palace man went down but VAR, to the centre-back’s relief, ruled him innocent.Sterling is not renowned for headed finishes but he went near to opening the scoring from a Bernardo Silva ball in from the right.By now the half-hour had passed and Hodgson could be pleased at the goalless scoreline. The City support, though, were becoming frustrated at having nothing to show for their team’s superiority.Agüero looked to have fashioned a clear chance when he left James McCarthy on his backside but unfortunately for City the midfielder’s trailing leg cleared the ball.Palace then performed a classic smash-and-grab act. After winning a corner on the right McCarthy swung the ball in, Gary Cahill beat Stones and his header was turned home by Tosun.City’s shock did not last long, with Bernardo Silva forcing Guaita to tip a shot over but when the second half began they still trailed and while Palace had hardly attacked the home side were staring at conceding further ground to Liverpool.Guardiola’s instructions looked to be that his men should use the flanks more – Stones drawing his ire when turning infield instead. However, the centre-back’s pass reached Gündogan who found Mendy and suddenly City were advancing the Frenchman’s dipping ball deserved to find someone on the end of it.Sterling managed to reach the ball in the Palace box moments later when found by David Silva but his effort went wide.Mendy’s next delivery caused havoc as first Agüero and then Bernardo Silva had attempts blocked desperately, deepening the sense that Palace would soon be breached.City were still relentless but with added edge. A De Bruyne corner was the latest to pepper the danger area but the home team’s vulnerability at the back – it has plagued them all season – was illuminated again when a Zaha chip was controlled and volleyed by Tosun, Ederson having to save sharply.On 62 minutes, Guardiola replaced David Silva with Gabriel Jesus, the Brazilian partnering Agüero. The move nearly worked straight away as Jesus scrambled to shoot before the angle defeated him.City became more desperate, conscious of the need to engineer a win that would salvage any faint hope of catching Liverpool. They thought they had a penalty when Bernardo Silva’s cross was inadvertently kicked on to his hand by Jaïro Riedewald. The referee, pointed to the spot but VAR ruled this out: it was an apt summation of the agonising character of City’s display.Finally, Agüero came up with a classic poacher’s strike with eight minutes left, then a sweet glancing header from the Argentinian seemed to have clinched the points for City. It was not to be their afternoon, though.Neither, surely, is it their title."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/751cb689c3ae6d1f7f5a33d1a318a38a40b0a33b/0_167_4405_2643/master/4405.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=60cce026c2c4469ac571df8c17315352","title":"newcastle united chelsea premier league match report","story":"Is possession overrated? It certainly seemed so for Chelsea as they manoeuvred the ball up and down a series of apparent blind alleys and cul-de-sacs before ultimately seeing all that effort reduced to nothing when Isaac Hayden headed Newcastle’s stoppage time winner.At times Steve Bruce’s side appeared to have developed an alarming allergy to passing between themselves but few occupants of the Gallowgate End were worrying about that as Allan Saint-Maximin redirected the fallout from a poor, partially cleared, Matt Ritchie corner and Hayden rose above all comers to clinch three precious points.As T-Rex’s triumphalist lyrics of “we love to boogie on a Saturday night” blared out of the sound system at the final whistle, Newcastle celebrated a victory rooted in superb defending.If it helps erase lingering relegation worries on Tyneside, Frank Lampard saw Chelsea’s grip on a top four place slacken. “It’s been the story of parts of our season, we don’t score enough goals,” he said. “We controlled the whole game but Newcastle were very well organised. We had the lion’s share of possession but it’s not easy to get behind Newcastle, they don’t come out. We had to go from side to side. We’re controlling games without being clinical. We need a killer instinct.”Steve Bruce – close to securing Valentino Lazaro, the Austria winger, on loan from Internazionale – was considerably happier with his side’s “smash’n’grab” masterclass. “We could look after the ball better,” he said. “But we’ve proved that, especially against the big teams, we’re difficult to play against, hard to beat and we never give up.”The game had barely begun before his already extensive injury list grew a little longer. Jetro Willems twisted a knee and landed awkwardly following a tussle with Callum Hudson-Odoi before departing on a stretcher, in tears. “It looks a horrendous injury for Jetro,” said Newcastle’s manager, amid fears the left wing-back has ruptured a cruciate ligament.A hip problem had left Andy Carroll in the stands, protecting his ponytail from Tyneside’s bitter January chill with a flat cap. He was out of his seat when the much improved Joelinton connected with Federico Fernández’s fine cross and powered in an unstoppable, distinctly Carroll-esque, header only to see it rebound off the underside of the crossbar.As the sub-zero evening cold intensified the biggest winners seemed to be Newcastle’s new sponsors, Barbour International, the South Shields-based clothing company and winter coat specialists.While Bruce’s players had all arrived at St James’ Park swaddled in insulated Barbour jackets, too much of Chelsea’s play had seemed semi-frozen, lacking the fluency and fluidity required to unhinge the excellent home back three of Fernández, Jamaal Lascelles and Ciaran Clark.Much as James delighted in reminding everyone that England’s Gareth Southgate is spoiled for choice at right-back, too many of his teammates saw their undeniable technical assurance undermined by the sheer obduracy of Newcastle’s often immaculate organisation.On this evidence Southgate should sign Bruce up to choreograph those “out of possession” coaching sessions beloved of FA technocrats. The way in which Willian was persistently, diligently and rapidly closed down looked testament to plenty of hard yards on the training ground.As the clock ticked down, Lampard’s demeanour was increasingly that of a man fiddling with the dials as he struggled to find the find the correct frequency on a portable radio with slightly unreliable reception. His team were not quite on the right wavelength and even when Sean Longstaff’s mistake virtually gifted Abraham a goal, the striker miscued.A draw beckoned but then Joelinton won that 11th-hour corner, the impressive Hayden eluded Kepa Arrizabalaga and Bruce defied a suspect knee and hip to make a celebratory leap almost as high as the scorer’s. Who needs high percentage possession?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/405b1b48871ff82385effa9768eb359d51034c00/0_71_3540_2124/master/3540.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77e7d6fa553c8c9a2e973b46eb6f702b","title":"newcastle united v chelsea premier league live","story":"Chelsea did most of the attacking, but Newcastle held firm and executed a classic smash-and-grabSo that, my good friends, is that. Louise Taylor was on point at St James’ Park tonight. Here’s her verdict. Click and enjoy ... and thanks for reading this MBM. Nighty night!Frank Lampard’s analysis. “That’s football. You have to get your head round it quickly. The feel of the game was domination. They had a header against the bar, three headers in the game, and one of them they score with. Other than that, I don’t remember them endangering our box. We camped around their box, creating chances. You won’t always create clear-cut against Newcastle because they have so many defenders around their box, and fair play to them. But we absolutely controlled it. At 0-0 I was going to say to the lads ‘you gave everything’. They pushed and pushed. We know we have problems at the top of the pitch, we don’t get enough goals if we want to bridge the gap. And if you don’t score, you’re always liable for a sucker punch, and we got hit. It’s something we need to address. We need to be clinical. I am pleased with the players we’ve got, but we can’t work any more in training on finishing. We finish and we finish, and sometimes you need to have that killer instinct. It’s quite clear from what I’m saying that we know where we need to strengthen ... so we’ll see.” January transfer action ahoy!Chelsea’s defeat has given Manchester United extra incentive - not that they need it - to beat leaders Liverpool tomorrow. If they manage a result at Anfield, they’d move to within two points of the Blues, who stay on 39 points in fourth place. Newcastle move up to 12th spot on 29 points, seven clear of the relegation places. Hayden’s late goal has proved so precious.Chelsea had done all the attacking, Newcastle all the defending. But the hosts made one last surge, Joelinton winning a corner that would prove decisive. Saint-Maximin’s deep cross was forced home by Hayden from close range, and the Toon will be bouncing tonight. A massive three points in their bid to stay clear of trouble. I wonder whether Kepa could have done better? Hayden’s bouncing header wasn’t the most powerful, and the keeper got a hand to it. But the points are Newcastle’s. Steve Bruce smiles warmly Frank Lampard looks sick.St James’s Park erupts! A huge three points, won by Isaac Hayden, with additional thanks to Joelinton and Saint-Maximin. Drama worth waiting for.Ritchie’s corner is appalling, cleared easily by first man Willian, who heads upfield. But Saint-Maximin curls one back in from a deep position on the left. Hayden rises highest at the far post and heads down. Kepa can’t parry as the ball bounces back up, and Newcastle have snatched all three points at the death!90 min +3: Steve Bruce prowls the touchline. He’ll be pleased with his side’s resolve in defence. He might be even happier if Newcastle can snatch a dramatic late goal ... because Joelinton has just won a corner with a bustle down the left. They couldn’t, could they?90 min +2: Kante tries to slip Barkley into the Newcastle box with a sliderule pass down the middle, but Lascelles is on point to clear.90 min +1: Hudson-Odoi drops a shoulder and glides infield from his beat on the left. He tries to plant a curler into the top right, but gets far too much on it and the ball sails into the stand behind.90 min: “This is what we are reduced to,” writes this MBM’s co-author Mary Waltz. “A RADA rejection audition of a wounded soldier.” Do you think Mary is looking forward to the four added minutes?88 min: Some rare quality in attack from Newcastle, as Almiron puts his foot on the ball 30 yards from goal. He sizes up the options and dinks a ball left for Saint-Maximin, who cushions it down for Joelinton. Newcastle’s number nine snatches at his shot, sending it sailing wide left. Kepa should have been called into action, at the very least.86 min: Barkley feeds Hudson-Odoi down the left. Hudson-Odoi wins a corner and takes it himself. Emerson, in the middle of the mixer, cocks his leg back to shoot ... but at the last second the ball is clattered clear by Sean Longstaff. Newcastle are hanging on a little here.85 min: Matty Longstaff comes on for Shelvey.84 min: From the set piece, Emerson twists and turns just inside the Newcastle box. Sean Longstaff sticks out a leg. Emerson runs into it deliberately and flops over. No penalty, though, the referee deciding it was a e. Emerson goes in the book.83 min: Emerson sends a rising screamer towards the top right. It’s deflected out for a corner by Fernandez. Chelsea are getting closer and closer.82 min: Hudson-Odoi, out on the left, nearly finds Batshuayi at the far post. An inch or two too high.80 min: That’s Abraham’s last contribution. He’s replaced by Batshuayi.79 min: Jorginho crosses from the left. Azpilicueta rises to win a header at the far post. Abraham, in the middle, hooks past Dubravka. The ball bounces slowly towards the net. But it won’t go in, because Ritchie tracks back to hook clear. Dubravka might have got a piece of Abraham’s effort, in fact, allowing Ritchie to perform his heroics. 77 min: James, having picked up his injury on the far side of the field, is at least able to make his own way back round the pitch to the dugouts. “At my advanced age seething isn’t an option,” replies Mary Waltz. “Sliding into a quiet depression is more accurate.”75 min: At the next break in play, Chelsea replace James with Emerson. Then they win a corner down the left. Hudson-Odoi takes, but it’s no good.74 min: Poor James is in the wars. Now he goes down holding his leg. Having left the pitch, he tries to roll back on for treatment, but the referee wants the game to continue and orders him back off. Chelsea aren’t happy about it, but this is how it’s going to be.73 min: Jorginho and Barkley one-two their way down the left. Sean Longstaff tries to break up the move, only to prod the ball down the channel towards his own goal, and straight to Abraham, who rounds Dubravka on the outside ... before slicing a poor effort into the side netting.72 min: Good news, as James is good to continue. His first post-recovery act is an overhit cross from the right that flies out of play on the other side of the field. Chelsea are just glad to see him back.71 min: As James receives treatment, Sean Longstaff comes on for Emil Krafth.70 min: James writhes in agony, having landed awkwardly on his arm after a non-event of a challenge in the middle of the park. Not sure whether he’s hurt his elbow or jarred his shoulder. He called for the physio immediately. His captain Azpilicueta stands over him with a concerned look on his face.68 min: Chelsea make their first change of the evening, hooking a below-par Mason Mount and replacing him with Ross Barkley.66 min: More low-quality wizardry. Nothing is coming off. Mary Waltz will be seething by now.64 min: Hudson-Odoi takes a corner out on the right, and flies it over a crowded box. Newcastle try to spring upfield through Saint-Maximin, but the move breaks down quickly enough. These impotent attacks continue to cause Mary Waltz great discomfort. In an email with the subject heading Bad Magic, she writes: “When either side approaches the penalty box all their skills seem to be removed from their bodies.”62 min: Hudson-Odoi dribbles in from the right in style. Just as he begins to think about pulling the trigger, Clark executes the perfect slide tackle to put a stop to his gallop. The crowd enjoyed that, and why not? A satisfying crunch wonderfully timed.60 min: Some staunch work by Joelinton, who bustles his way up the left flank and moves infield. He eventually gives up possession to his team-mate Shelvey, who tries his luck from 30 yards. His luck’s not in. Chelsea go up the other end, Hudson-Odoi working his way down the right and pulling back for Abraham, who hooks over harmlessly.58 min: Kante has a whack from the best part of 30 yards, sending a bobbler towards the bottom left. It’s meat and drink for Dubravka.56 min: Mount works his way down the inside-left channel and is unceremoniously flipped into the air by Hayden. In the book you go, sir. A free kick in a very dangerous position, 25 yards out. Chelsea work a routine, and make a total hash of it, Jorginho clipping a ball down the inside-right channel to absolutely nobody. The ball trundles apologetically out for a goal kick.55 min: Willian glides in from the left. He feeds Jorginho, who shuttles the ball further infield for Azpilicueta. Chelsea’s captain slaps a shot towards the bottom left from the edge of the box. Dubravka is behind it all the way.53 min: Newcastle fling a few men upfield, and are nearly caught out on the counter, hoist by their own petard. Chelsea sling a long ball up the right. Abraham turns and feeds Willian, who drifts towards the left of the D before dragging a weak shot across goal and out on the right. He should have worked Dubravka at the very least.52 min: There really isn’t much going on right now. Mary Waltz is not impressed: “Is the field icy? Does the ball have corners?”50 min: Space for Ritchie out on the left. But there’s nobody making a move, and he’s forced to turn tail. It’s all a bit slow from Newcastle.48 min: The early signs suggest Willian is just fine. He skedaddles in from the left wing, slipping past two men and shooting from the edge of the box. His effort is blocked, but there didn’t appear to be any problem with his movement there.47 min: All very scrappy at the start of the second half. St James’ Park is a quiet place as a result.We’re off again! Newcastle get the second half underway. Willian was holding his groin as he walked off for half-time, and he was doing the same just before kick-off now. Pedro has been out warming up, but Willian’s good to continue. For now.And that’s your lot for the first45 min +5: The home crowd accuse the referee of ineptitude via the medium of song, but that was the correct decision, and VAR would have spotted it anyway.45 min +4: Joelinton has the ball in the net, Ritchie having taken a quick free kick from the centre circle with Chelsea light at the back. The striker raced free down the right, and slapped the ball past Kepa, but Chelsea had stopped playing because the referee had noticed the ball was rolling when Ritchie took the set piece, and whistled accordingly.45 min +3: Some pinball in the Newcastle box, instigated by Azpilicueta’s low left-wing cross. Willian nearly gets a chance to shoot. Instead, Ritchie hooks hysterically over the bar. Hudson-Odoi’s resulting corner is no good.45 min +2: Willian sashays in from the left, then feeds Azpilicueta on the overlap. Corner. Mount takes, and it’s easily snaffled by Dubravka.45 min: There will be five added minutes, a result of the Willems injury.44 min: Mount whips a low free kick towards the bottom right, but can’t get past the Newcastle wall. Not great. The resulting deflection does earn a corner, mind ... but that particular set piece is easily cleared by the home defence. Chelsea come back at Newcastle, but there’s more misery for Mount as he slips while crossing from the left. Shank! Goal kick.42 min: Almiron clumsily runs into the back of Jorginho, 25 yards out, just to the right of centre. A free kick in a very promising position for the visitors.40 min: Hudson-Odoi finds Mount, 12 yards out, with a cross from the right flank. Mount slaps a header harmlessly over. Both sides have had their chances.39 min: James drops a shoulder to diddle Ritchie down the right. His cross hits the first man, but top marks for the way the young full-back earned himself the space and right to do so, even if the final product was uncharacteristically lacking this time.38 min: A free kick for Newcastle out on the right. Shelvey swings it in from deep. Fernandez rises highest, but can’t keep his header from six yards down."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45d8df3b6b5667ded0c141d9e55843d71063db3c/0_1003_3648_2189/master/3648.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f13deb7137bd7e5bd6c76e472d4de287","title":"babysitting embryo carry child for friend surrogacy","story":"Surrogacy between friends can be life-changing. The people who have done it talk emotions, legal hurdles – and WhatsApp birthing groupsIn a flat in north-east London, Abi is cradling her best friend’s baby. At 15 weeks old, the little boy is smiling up at her, testing out his first sounds. His mother, Rachel, prepares his bottle while Abi rocks him, showing all the love she would to any of her friends’ children. The only difference is that Abi gave birth to him.Abi and Rachel, both 35, met on their first day at university in Birmingham in 2003 and rarely left one another’s side. At 16, Rachel had been diagnosed with MRKH, a congenital condition meaning her uterus was undeveloped. Although she produced eggs, she would never be able to carry children, something she kept to herself. “I’d tell people I didn’t want kids but deep down I was insanely jealous,” says Rachel, who works as an events producer in London. “I wanted them so badly but assumed I’d never have my own, so I learned to live with it.” After meeting her boyfriend, Sam, at a warehouse party on the eve of 2014, she avoided the “family” chat for two years before confiding in him. “We continued our relationship knowing kids may or may not happen,” she says.A weekend stay at Abi’s home, in November 2017, bringing together five friends, their partners and kids, presented an opportunity to open up to them, too. Abi, a mother to three boys, remembers: “My partner, Rich, was cooking a curry, the kids were asleep and we were sitting around the kitchen table. Everyone spilled something personal. When Rachel told us about her condition, I knew, in my gut, that I would help her to have a child.”Rachel and Sam had explored IVF, surrogacy and adoption, but had dismissed using agencies, which can be vastly oversubscribed, with waits of up to two years to find a match. “It felt too impersonal too life-changing somehow,” she says. Her younger sister had yet to start her own family had she already had children, Rachel might have asked her to be a surrogate. Abi and Rich, meanwhile, “spent Christmas contemplating what being a surrogate would mean for everyone. We had been so lucky, yet one of the people I love most hadn’t,” she says. “I hate this phrase but it was a no-brainer.”She called Rachel in the new year and told her to sit down before offering to carry her baby. Rachel remembers: “She said it would be like ‘babysitting’ our embryo and that term stuck. She’d made up her mind, and that blew me away. I hadn’t told my friends expecting one of them to be the answer. When Abi offered, it felt, for the first time, as if having a child was a very real possibility.”Surrogacy is a delicate arrangement with high stakes. Pregnancy and childbirth can be gruelling, and present health risks, while the unknown territory of handing over a baby you have carried – or parenting the child you have not – presents added fears over bonding or changes of heart, albeit rare.When there is an existing friendship at the arrangement’s heart, the stakes can feel higher still, for both the surrogate carrying a longed-for child and parents asking such as sacrifice of someone they care for, typically with a family themselves to consider. (Medics and lawyers advise against surrogacy until women have completed their own families, citing concerns about reproductive health and fears that it would be harder for them to give up the baby.) Not surprisingly, the friendships that underpin these arrangements are life-changing.Abi, Rachel and Sam embarked on medical appointments at a London fertility clinic. The friends were invited for counselling and asked to consider everything from how they would feel if Abi backed out, to how she would feel if she gave birth to a girl, after three sons. They set up a WhatsApp group. “We left Rich off that,” Abi says. “I’ll talk about body parts and womb washing till the cows come home but he saw his role as keeping things normal – remaining practical and pragmatic in a hyper-emotional situation.” They told their families, including Abi’s boys – four, three and nine months at the time. “We always talked about ‘Rachel and Sam’s baby’. We said, ‘Rachel’s womb doesn’t work but Mummy’s does, so we’re going to look after a baby for them.’” After initially being refused any NHS fertility treatment that would lead to surrogacy, Rachel successfully lobbied her local commissioning group for a single round of IVF, in May 2018, allowing her eggs to be extracted for fertilisation by Sam’s sperm, creating a viable embryo. It would later be placed in Abi’s uterus at a private clinic, using money Rachel’s parents had saved for her wedding. “Surrogacy is still seen as something you do if you’ve got money rather than through biological need,” Rachel says.Abi was given oestrogen and progesterone, and the embryo was transferred, via catheter, in a simple, minutes-long procedure, on 2 October. “From that moment, it was out of my control,” Rachel says. “I felt like I was holding my breath.” When Abi took a pregnancy test, at 7am on a Saturday morning nearly a fortnight later, Rachel and Sam were in bed, on the end of the phone. “When she sent through a picture of the positive test, we were in total shock it was extremely emotional. We didn’t know how to get on with our day other than staring at that picture.” They remained in daily contact and Rachel travelled the 150 miles to Abi’s home for midwife appointments and scans, as well as attending antenatal classes, along with Rich. “In hindsight, the distance was a good thing,” Rachel says. “If we were round the corner, I’d have been posting steak through her letterbox.”They had to consider how to announce the pregnancy. Rachel would say: “We’re expecting a baby, but I’m not pregnant. My friend is carrying our baby.” Abi, who works in public engagement at the BBC, recalls: “Everyone’s mouths dropped at work. My mum asked, ‘Why you?’ But they all thought it was amazing.”When it came to maternity leave, Abi was entitled to a year, but took six weeks, while Rachel was entitled to a year’s adoption leave. Outdated surrogacy laws require that Abi’s name is on the birth certificate alongside Sam’s had Abi and Rich been married, he would have been named as the father. They also recognise Abi as the mother until Rachel obtains the court order granting her legal parental status. Seven months on, she is still waiting. “The fact that on paper he’s still not my son is upsetting,” she says, “but I can’t dwell on it. It’s a process, so we treat it that way.”Many surrogacy pairings put an agreement in place. Although not legally binding – it is illegal for solicitors to negotiate one – it helps mitigate against concerns over all aspects of the pregnancy, from supplements to who first holds the baby. Rachel and Abi decided against it. “If Abi had changed her mind on anything, we all would have,” Rachel says.Surrogates can receive reasonable expenses, such as extra food, travel, childcare or housekeeping costs, and Rachel and Sam gave Abi a cash card. “It’s the trickiest part because no expenses can repay her,” Rachel says. “She was militant about not asking for too much, but I wanted her to have a meal on us because she had our son with her.” The baby was born on 8 June 2019. Rachel and Sam drove Abi to the hospital and witnessed the birth. “I could hardly believe it was real,” says Rachel, who fainted as he was delivered into her arms. The couple spent the first two nights after his birth in hospital, down the corridor from Abi.“Rich was working late and arrived to find us all in the room together and the baby just minutes old,” Abi says. “He stayed for the placenta delivery, had some tea and toast and went home to be there for our boys in the morning. I don’t think the scale of what we’ve done will hit us for a long time. I’m relieved at how normal it feels when I see the baby. Rachel was so generous with her trust in me.”Rachel adds: “Abi put herself mentally and physically through the most selfless act for me, to make us a family. She gave up a huge part of her life during those months to change ours for ever. I couldn’t handle what I was putting her through at times but she’d always say: ‘You’re not putting me through this, I’ve chosen to do it.’ If I ever asked why, she would say: ‘Well, I can’t think why not.’”As fertility medicine has advanced and different family units evolved, surrogacy has emerged as a more familiar route to parenthood, but demand far outweighs the number of women willing or able to volunteer, and the British legal system is playing catchup. London-based family lawyer Joanna Kay, who has advised on surrogacy for more than a decade, says: “The landscape of what a family looks like has changed beyond recognition, but the laws are from the mid-80s. Without a court order, intended parents can’t make decisions about their child’s medical care or education there can be problems with passports and inheritance. I don’t think anyone would argue against the need for reform. “In most cases, everyone knows what they’re signing up for and is happy to honour their agreement. On rare occasions things go wrong and the courts are asked to intervene. There have been a handful of cases where the surrogate didn’t want to hand over the baby or the intended parent didn’t want it.”Other relationships between parents and surrogates have been deep and enduring. Kim Cotton, who became Britain’s first surrogate in 1985, went on to help her friend Linda, who was unable to carry children because of complications associated with a miscarriage Cotton gave birth to twins in 1991. “The family moved to New Zealand when the twins were teenagers but I still track their lives, mostly through Facebook now,” says Cotton, who is 63, and the founder of the Cots surrogacy agency. “Christmases and birthdays are still special and the twins and I always send messages to mark them. My friendship with Linda remains the kind where you are for ever aware of that person and can pick up with them anytime, even if you don’t speak often.”Yet even longed-for pregnancies don’t always run smoothly. After Laura was made infertile five years ago, at 28, by treatment for stage two cervical cancer, her best friend Kerrie represented her only hope of becoming a biological mother. Last year, Kerrie offered to carry Laura’s fertilised eggs, frozen before she began intensive chemo and radiotherapy five years ago.They had been friends since childhood and shared everything, Laura says, over a cup of tea at Kerrie’s home in Lancashire. “Relationships, breakups, marriages, my illness she cries with me and laughs with me,” she says.In 2014, Laura, a nursery manager, and her now-husband Grant were about to start IVF for problems unconnected to her own fertility when a routine smear test detected cancerous cells. “They talked about a hysterectomy,” she remembers. “Knowing my illness would take away my chance of having children was what broke me, not the cancer.” By this point in the story, both women are in tears. “As we left the hospital, I told Grant to leave me,” Laura adds. He didn’t. And while a hysterectomy was ruled out, Laura spent Christmas and New Year’s Eve undergoing treatment, with Kerrie by her side. She had delayed it by one month, so her eggs could be extracted and later used to try for a child via surrogate.In April 2015, a scan revealed the tumour had gone. When Grant and Laura married in Cyprus in 2016, Kerrie was a bridesmaid. “When I was ill, a few friends had offered to be a surrogate,” Laura says. “And when we finally came round to thinking about it, two years ago, it was Grant who said: ‘It has to be Kerrie.’”Kerrie, 33 and a hairdresser, had a similar conversation with her husband, Danny. “At the clinic, he told us he knew when Laura became ill that I would do it one day. I’d had two good pregnancies and it would only be nine months of my life to improve hers for ever. I focused on seeing them with a child.”Although it was NHS-funded IVF that had led to the discovery of Laura’s cancer, when surrogacy became her only option, the funding was withdrawn. “I didn’t let it go without a fight,” she says. “Ultimately they were taking it away because I had cancer. The NHS saved my life to then dictate that life isn’t fair.”In the end Laura’s family paid for her treatment. “They would have helped me with a house deposit but I said, no, give me a baby, please.” The surrogacy was delayed when Kerrie unexpectedly became pregnant with her third child in 2018, but in October 2019 Laura’s eggs were thawed. Eight had been fertilised – but only one looked viable for transfer and pregnancy. It was placed in Kerrie’s womb on 7 October. The women held hands as they sat on the clinic’s bed. “When they told us there was only one chance, I couldn’t look at Laura,” Kerrie says. “She can read my thoughts. I wanted to stay positive for her but the pressure was huge.”On 23 October, two clear lines showed on the pregnancy stick, but Kerrie tested and retested, with Laura by her side, to be sure. Both women were ecstatic. However, on 1 November Kerrie started bleeding. A miscarriage, at five weeks, was confirmed two days later at hospital.“It hit me like a ton of bricks,” Kerrie says. “I’d been carrying her most treasured possession. We were numb. We drove home in silence. My priority was being strong for her but I was broken. We went from speaking all day, every day, to nothing for 48 hours. I’d type a message asking, ‘Are you OK?’ then delete it. When we eventually sat down together, we cried our hearts out. I felt responsible but I knew I’d done everything I could.”Laura is still coming to terms with her grief. “I was uncontrollable, heartbroken. We each had our own grieving to do it wasn’t that we didn’t want to speak, we just didn’t have the words and didn’t want to add to each other’s pain.”Kerrie has offered to be a surrogate again, with a donor egg, but Laura says she couldn’t put her friend through it. She has also thought about adoption but needs time to heal before giving it serious consideration.“I don’t think anybody realises how difficult the process is,” she says. “Kerrie gave me my only chance of being a biological mum. I didn’t know I could love her any more than I already did.”In Kent, Kevin, 45, a chief marketing officer, and Spencer, 30, a solicitor, are getting their six-month-old son ready for bed when the other half of “Sawyer’s birthing squad” (the name they gave their pregnancy WhatsApp group) arrives: surrogate Leanne, 36, and her sister Rachael, 33, Sawyer’s egg donor. “There’s not many teams like us out there,” says Leanne, grabbing a bedtime cuddle.Spencer and Kevin have been together 10 years and married in 2015. “I told Kevin on our first date that I needed to be a dad,” Spencer says. “The biological connection was important to us. We wanted to be involved from the start.” They explored agencies but the networking aspect turned them off. “It was like speed dating. There were more couples than surrogates. It felt hard to be your true self.” They spoke to relatives and asked close friends but none provided an obvious solution. So, despite reservations, they turned to an agency and invested five months getting to know a potential surrogate, only to be let down by an early morning text weeks before treatment was due to start.The one thing they did have was an egg donor. (Medics typically discourage having the same woman perform both functions, to offset concerns around the possibility of bonding too strongly with the baby.) Spencer and Rachael, a credit controller, had become friends two years earlier after meeting on an IVF forum on Facebook. Rachael, then pregnant with her third child, was exploring egg donation, and Spencer wanted to know more about surrogacy. They lived nearby and began meeting up, forming a close friendship that involved weekends together, takeaways, dinners and days out. Spencer and Kevin became unofficial uncles to Rachael’s youngest son and joined in family celebrations, which is how they grew close to Leanne, a mental health support worker who had three sons of her own.Leanne remembers: “Kevin and Spencer were lovely, and I’d seen how close they all were and how badly the boys wanted to be parents. When Rachael told me their surrogate had let them down, I instinctively offered.”The group drew up a 12-page “intention agreement”, detailing expenses, medical tests, pregnancy supplements and protection – including life and critical illness insurance – for Leanne’s children in the event that anything went wrong. Kevin and Spencer spent £25,000: £6,000 for the cost of Rachael’s egg donation £6,500 on medical appointments, screening tests (for all four), medication and scans £2,500 to transfer their embryo to Leanne’s womb and £10,000 on surrogate expenses. On pregnancy test day, they sat around Leanne’s kitchen table together, dipping the stick in a cup she’d wee’d in.“This was the next best thing to carrying the baby ourselves,” Spencer says. “We were so involved. Friendship-first gave us trust and openness.” The expectant dads attended scans, sent hampers each trimester – the first contained ginger biscuits and tea for morning sickness – and downloaded an app that allowed them to read bedtime stories for Leanne to play to her belly. When her waters broke three months early, at 28 weeks, the responsibility weighed heavily for all. Leanne says, “You don’t want to let anything go wrong. Decisions about what happened next were theirs to make. I felt guilty.” The men felt responsible, too. “Leanne has three children she had to go home perfect at the end of this,” Spencer says.Leanne was monitored as an outpatient until labour started a month later. When Sawyer arrived, at 2.36am on 6 April, eight weeks premature and weighing 5lb, all four were in the room, Rachael as birthing partner. Sawyer spent 16 days in neonatal intensive care. His fathers stayed by his side but the now familiar outdated legalities meant Leanne had to return for his discharge.Even once they have left hospital, it is common for surrogates to be contacted by health professionals seeking consent for newborn checks, despite parents being present. Kevin remembers: “Before the birth, our consultant emailed ahead to enforce our right to be there. Some nurses called Leanne ‘Mum’ which none of us wanted. It felt antiquated. I think it’s sexuality and gender more than surrogacy. It took us being by his side for 16 days to prove ourselves, and it shouldn’t be that way.”After the birth, Leanne was flooded with emotion: “Your body doesn’t know you’re a surrogate he was premature and my natural instinct was to know he was all right. I talked a lot with Rachael to be sure what I was feeling was OK. The openness and honesty between me and the boys was vital. Once home, I was back to being Leanne again.”She expressed and froze milk for Sawyer for two weeks before returning to work. Going home from hospital, Kevin and Spencer stopped at her house, “to give her boys the first cuddle,” Spencer says. “They’d been through a lot, too.”When the friends share their story with others, it is the egg donation that tends to generate the most interest, Kevin says, but for Rachael it represented nothing more than a tiny piece of DNA. “It’s that black and white for me,” she says. “My own children are the ones I’ve created with my husband. The way Kevin and Spencer look at Sawyer is the exact reason I wanted to do this.”They see each other often and last month shared a Christmas outing and an early New Year’s Eve celebration before Sawyer’s bedtime. “I want our son to know who the two most incredible women on the planet are,” Kevin says. “They’ll for ever have that bond with him. The more love he has, the better.”Back in north-east London, Rachel and Abi echo the sentiment. As the baby goes down for his nap, the friends leaf through a photo book of their pregnancy, created for their children. “I can’t wait for my son to know how many people brought him into the world,” Rachel says. “It’s the biggest act of kindness imaginable I can never thank her enough.”Abi smiles. “But you don’t need to thank me,” she says, “because it just feels entirely normal. We were going to be friends for the rest of our lives anyway it’s just cemented our bond.” • If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine’s letters page, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cae4be5e89f83697350aacea463d597797712bd/0_34_521_313/master/521.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5ac8ab539b43195fdafc3491df15b4b","title":"flower arranging instagram generation boom","story":"Classes are a sell-out at new breed of floristsOnce upon a time flower arranging was the preserve of the 1950s housewife accessorising the kitchen table, perhaps with help from doughty members of the Women’s Institute. Now, floristry is attracting a younger, cooler crowd out to impress their Instagram followers.The owners of Sage, a flower shop in Peckham, south London, that hosts monthly bouquet and vase arranging classes, have seen a huge increase in interest from young people since they opened. “It’s young people in their mid-20s to mid-30s that are coming. It’s super popular and they’re fully booked,” says the 25-year-old co-founder, Iona Mathieson.What’s behind the surge in popularity? Some say it’s an extension of the recent trend for house plants, the sense of pride in being a “plant parent” and the homemade movement. Others, less idealistically, attribute it to Instagram. “Flower arranging is so colourful and immediate and that’s how we’re seeing life these days, in these bright coloured squares,” says Emma Weaver, 30, founder of Palais in Shoreditch, east London.Heston Blumenthal, who last week took a potshot at diners who spend more time snapping their food for social media than eating it, would sympathise.The new wave of floristry has become more artistic. Mathieson says people are bored with traditional bouquets. “This is art through the medium of flowers, as opposed to the old grandma thing,” she said.Many are incorporating different materials. “It’s very sculptural. We use anything from melted plastics to bespoke metal frames and do a lot of carpentry alongside more traditional flower arranging,” says Weaver. “We are putting the two together and making it more of an art form.”George Plumptre, chief executive of the National Garden Scheme, thinks young people appreciate the benefits of connecting with the natural world. “Flower arranging can be hugely therapeutic and creative. It provides a wonderful sense of wellbeing,” he says.Amy Montague, 33 from Nottingham, who has attended flower arranging workshops, agrees. “It’s a creative outlet from my work in online consultancy and it’s relaxing,” she says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1e8cd93fbadb22ea72b69f0f61904b812118a11/0_288_5315_3189/master/5315.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e0bab2ce05af174e96de0f223a6c189","title":"norman conquest imaginatively restored french farmhouse interiors","story":"With everything from running water to a new roof needed, the key to updating this once-derelict farm in Normandy was patienceWhen Vincent Dewas first came to view the farm that is now his Normandy home, several potential buyers had already been put off by its derelict condition. But one glance at the property and its adjoining outhouses, built in 1875, was all it took. “I didn’t need to go inside to make up my mind,” he says. “What sold it to me was its proportions, the extensive grounds and the fact it sits quietly in Le Perche national park, close to the village of Bellême, surrounded by trees and cows. I told the agent I wanted it and I signed the papers there and then on the bonnet of the car.”Not many homeowners facing a full-scale renovation choose to install a swimming pool ahead of running water and heating, but that was first on the agenda when former communications director Dewas arrived in 2017: “I figured the works to the house would be both costly and stressful. The pool was factored into the budget straight off, with the idea that I could retreat there when I needed to escape the chaos.”During the two years that it took for the farmhouse to be given an updated dose of shabby chic, Dewas made many crucial decisions poolside. It’s a relaxed attitude that proves to have served him well.Untouched since the 1960s, the main farmhouse was exposed to the rafters and featured only a kitchen, bathroom and a couple of small bedrooms. Dewas’s plan was to take full advantage of the building’s generous volume by adding a first floor to accommodate five bedrooms and three bathrooms, and rework the ground floor to allow for a large kitchen and dining room, a sitting room and snug. “Creating an extra floor allowed me to double the size of the original layout, which made the purchase feel more like a bargain,” he says.But the renovation was not without its complications: the roof had to be completely replaced and, due to the building’s historic nature, alterations were subject to complicated consents, leaving Dewas and his partner at the mercy of haphazard French bureaucracy. As a result, works sometimes ground to a halt for weeks at a time. On top of that, his desire to do the job once and do it well meant putting in hours of legwork.“For me, it was all about creating a space that remained entirely in tune with its surroundings,” he explains. “This place was never going to feature swathes of marble or polished stone floors – I wanted to be able to tell at one glance that it was a Normandy house, in keeping with the local vernacular.”Joinery was particularly important – a visit to the region’s eco-museum enabled him to consult an archive of France’s buildings, which led to choosing persimmon for much of the woodwork. Dewas replaced all the original windows on the ground floor with double glazing, but retained their typically small openings in keeping with other houses in the area. Original fireplaces, wood and brick flooring and beams were restored.In a nod to the building’s origins, discarded tools from around the farm also played a part, including wooden cattle-feeding utensils that have been reimagined as stair rails. Meanwhile, wood from the old roof was turned into a dining table to seat 16 guests.A keen bric-a-brac hunter, Dewas knew early on that the interiors would feature some of his treasured finds. “In France, we take the occupation of antique-hunting so seriously that we have a verb for it – chiner,” he smiles. “Now I’m on first-name terms with the owners of the many brocantes in Bellême, including a favourite called La Brocante de Brigitte, where I can pick up furniture for between €20 and €50.”Despite weekly visits to his network of sellers, Dewas rarely swaps one piece for another. “I’ll just keep on adding until I run out of room,” he laughs. Recent acquisitions include a bamboo sofa in the sitting room, a set of cubby holes from the local post office and a pair of wicker coffee tables. “It’s about the thrill of the chase and returning home with something no one else has, at an affordable price.”A palette of dark greens, putties and mid-blues provides an ideal backdrop for a mixture of rustic materials, from exposed wood to brick flooring. But some unusual design decisions, such as painting the sloping walls of the kitchen in a contrasting dark tone (Farrow \u0026amp Ball’s Off-Black), add a contemporary note. “I didn’t want to create a pastiche country house I just wanted it to feel authentic.”Soon after moving in, Dewas, virtually a died-in-the-wool Parisian, having lived in the capital since his student days, decided to relocate entirely to Normandy. “It may seem like a big move, but I was ready for it,” he reflects. “It’s not so far from the city, but it’s fantastically peaceful. I made a plan to do up the outhouses and rent them out for events and long stays so that I can live and work in one place.”Fortunately for Dewas there are some reminders of his old stomping ground in the form of several of his Parisian friends. “Not long ago, a few of them followed suit by buying properties within a few kilometres of this place,” he says. “It’s brilliant, as we often gather together – although it does mean that eventually I might need to invest in an even bigger dining table.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1cb4cecc6767b5cb31da33f6b3ae884fb406176e/562_819_3005_1803/master/3005.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8e747d3d0d00e4d273a8318f9e5abbe","title":"stellan skarsgard i dont give advice to my children who act","story":"The actor, 68, on dreaming of being a diplomat, smashing telephones with skill and the days before Marvel ruled the worldI intended to become a diplomat.

The BBC will consider waiving these confidentiality clauses on a case by case basis.The broadcaster stopped asking claimants to sign NDAs in pay disputes four years ago. But it still uses such clauses in settlement agreements which restrict employees from disclosing trade secret type of confidential information.The BBC is understood to have agreed to consider releasing staff from confidentiality clauses in equal pay settlements before Ahmed’s landmark case. Ahmed, who was paid a rate of £440 per an episode for presenting the viewer feedback programme Newswatch, took the BBC to court for paying Jeremy Vine £3,000 an episode for hosting the similar show Points of View.The public broadcaster was dealt a heavy blow after an employment tribunal unanimously concluded that it had failed to provide convincing evidence that the reason for the pay gap was not due to gender discrimination.Lawyers have warned that the BBC could face a bill running into the millions for similar claims by other female staff. The hearings revealed that 120 female employees had pursued gender pay complaints against the corporation.Leading male news and current affairs presenters were shamed into taking pay cuts, as the broadcaster was investigated by the equality watchdog over claims men were consistently paid more than women for doing the same job.Most recently, the BBC has come under fire again for hiring an employment consultancy with a gender pay gap twice the size of the broadcaster’s to help tackle its gender pay gap. According to the Financial Times, the Croner consultancy, which was first brought in by the BBC in 2018 to handle equal pay complaints, became a central player in the BBC’s attempts to tackle its gender pay gap problems."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37b29f8665719a7bcd97bff51c41f54c42dabb2a/0_94_5600_3360/master/5600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3dba510dcf2ed597b8ddfd3164dc8e56","title":"share your experiences of once in a lifetime jobs","story":"After hundreds apply to run a café on a remote Irish island, we’d like to hear about your one-of-a-kind job experiences Do you dream of quitting the rat race and moving to a remote island to run a B\u0026ampB, book shop or animal sanctuary?

It was set up in the 1970s and recruited veterans battle-hardened by the Troubles in Northern Ireland, Operation Storm in Oman – when Anglo Omani forces quashed an uprising – and the 1980 siege of London’s Iranian embassy.It won contracts with the Foreign Office to guard British embassies in global hotspots, as well as protecting Gulf royals, including Saudi Arabia’s oil minister Sheikh Ahmed Zaki Yamani and Sultan Qaboos bin Said of Oman who died earlier this month. The firm’s founding directors were so well connected that attempts in 1976 by the Labour prime minister Harold Wilson to ban mercenaries were thwarted amid Whitehall concerns about it going out of business.Keenie Meenie: The British Mercenaries Who Got Away with War Crimes quotes declassified intelligence files that reveal the warning of one Foreign Office staffer: “If KMS were legislated away en passant no comparable substitute protection would be available to the diplomatic service.”The Foreign Office’s Middle East department insisted that when it came to taking action against mercenaries “our firm preference is still for no legislation at all”, adding that civil servants should present to ministers “the benefits of doing nothing at all”.As a result of lobbying from inside Whitehall, no legislation was passed against mercenary companies. In the aftermath, KMS took on increasingly daring contracts in Asia and Latin America during the Thatcher era. In Sri Lanka, it earned millions of pounds directing military operations and flying helicopter gunships on combat missions in which scores of civilians were killed. In 1985, the Foreign Office’s South Asia head noted in a memo: “We believe only KMS pilots are currently capable of flying armed helicopter assault operations in Sri Lanka.”The book’s author, Phil Miller, a reporter for Declassified UK, an investigative journalism organisation, claims the continued use of air power caused a crucial ceasefire to collapse, prolonging the bloody civil war. Lt Col Richard Holworthy, Britain’s former defence attache to Sri Lanka, told Miller that the helicopters bombed Tamil civilians using grenades placed inside wine glasses. “They’d fly over and drop the grenade with the wine glass, and of course when it hit the ground the glass broke, the grenade exploded,” Holworthy said.In Nicaragua, one of the company’s directors worked with US-backed Contra rebels. Documents seized from Colonel Oliver North, who oversaw the funding of US operations in Nicaragua, confirmed KMS’s involvement in the country.David Gladstone, a former British high commissioner to Sri Lanka, told Miller that KMS had “some sort of political cover in this country … there were one or two British politicians who were connected to the company”.These included Sir Anthony Royle, a former SAS soldier who had been best man to the KMS founder Col Jim Johnson and went on to be vice-chairman of the Conservative party under Margaret Thatcher. On several occasions, Foreign Office officials asked Royle to have a quiet word with Johnson about KMS activities rather than put their concerns into writing.“You get the sense that at times the Foreign Office felt it was quite beneficial what Keenie Meenie was doing,” Miller said. “The British state didn’t have to get its hands dirty and Keenie Meenie could be doing things they didn’t want to be doing.”KMS closed down in the early 1990s after questions about its activities were aired in parliament.“Part of the reason for writing the book is for it to act as a cautionary tale, so if others think of going down this path in the future they could reflect on the consequences it could have,” Miller said. “While it can make these companies quite a lot of money in the short term, it’s a high-risk strategy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d675423d5d1f73c0bac3bb0e13517dc623afae2/516_307_1464_878/master/1464.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe70798d9a7fa4bd62c676d9c1c98f56","title":"happy fleet could electric vehicles enhance the joy of driving","story":"EVs mean cleaner cities, but could they improve the experience for drivers too? One ground-breaking partnership piloted by Audi and Addison Lee Group uncovered some surprising benefits to going electricFor companies that rely on fleet vehicles, change is inevitable. A raft of green policies have introduced zero-emissions targets, along with financial incentives encouraging businesses to adopt cleaner cars and vans, such as no vehicle tax for electric company cars in 202021.However, as well as helping the planet and improving a company’s bottom line, the “greening” of vehicle fleets by going fully electric could bring additional benefits. A recent widely reported study found that jumping behind the wheel of an electric car – rather than a traditional petrol or diesel – could also make drivers happier, calmer and less stressed too.Those findings are backed up by Audi’s own research, which found that electric vehicle drivers typically get more pleasure from the experience. According to a combination of 1,350 surveys and 2,000 minutes of interviews, the benefits include a reduction in vibration and engine noise, which can leave drivers feeling less drained after spending time in traffic. EV drivers also reported being able to perform difficult manoeuvres much more easily, and a greater sense of control. Others felt more at one with the vehicle as a result of all the technology. As one respondent put it: “It’s part of me when I drive. It has so much tech involved in it.”That Audi research is now being put to the test as part of a forward-thinking pilot partnership with the Addison Lee Group’s business class car service, Tristar.Addison Lee Group has added five new luxury e-tron SUVs, Audi’s first fully electric cars, with a range of up to 237 miles, to its premium London lineup. The aim is to offer chauffeurs, customers, and both businesses a unique opportunity to understand the real-world performance, opportunities and challenges of going fully electric to achieve a zero-emissions future.The Addison Lee Group chauffeurs underwent simple training with Audi’s electric vehicle specialists before going out to work as usual, driving premium customers around the capital.The ongoing trial enables Addison Lee Group and Audi to see how the cars perform in a real-world, business-critical situation – where running out of battery is not an option. That includes collecting hard data on mileage and usage from the car’s telemetrics, along with the driver’s subjective feedback on the challenges of adopting electric in real-world conditions, including things such as the availability of charging.The proof, though, is in the driving. So what did Addison Lee Group’s trialists make of the experience behind the wheel?“From the beginning I said that I was going to drive it the same way I would a diesel car and that’s what I’ve done,” says Alan Meere, a platinum chauffeur for Tristar. “I feel more relaxed when I get home because I haven’t spent the day fighting the steering wheel. There’s also no droning constantly in your ear like you can get with diesel cars, and you notice that especially after a motorway run. You still get the noise of the tyres but even that’s quieter.”According to Meere, who lives in Sittingbourne, Kent and has been driving for the Addison Lee Group for nine years, any potential anxiety about range soon subsided.“When I came into the pilot, my main reservations were things like whether there would be enough chargers,” he says. “Also, would living so far from London make a difference? But once you realise how good the car is, and you start to understand how to fit charging into your daily routine, that all goes away. Many service stations now have these chargers.”“Being able to plug it in and leave it overnight is hugely convenient,” says Meere. “But if I’m not home long enough for work reasons, then there are also options close by where I can charge it quickly, ready for the next day.”According to figures from Zap Map, a listing app that helps you find your nearest charge points, there are more than 10,000 charging locations in the UK. Finding nearby charge isn’t dissimilar to seeking out your closest petrol station – you learn the locations of the points you use most often.“I’ve developed a map in my head of where I can charge,” says Meere. “If I need a speedy charge, there are three places I use regularly – one at Heathrow and two near where I live. On the 150Kw points I can get close to full in 40 minutes,” he adds.This partnership has been so successful that it’s been extended beyond the initial six months. “I believe our collaboration with Addison Lee Group has been invaluable as a means of further demystifying the concept of the fully electric Audi,” says Andrew Doyle, director of Audi UK.“Although the e-tron is revolutionary as far as our brand is concerned, this project has helped to emphasise its uncomplicated, user-friendly normality to everyone who travels in one. On the one hand, it has proved that it requires minimal compromise as a daily-use proposition by meeting the understandably rigorous demands of Addison Lee Group’s professional drivers in an undeniably challenging working environment. On the other, it has driven home the fact that in terms of comfort, configuration and general usability, the car is a home-from-home for anyone familiar with a contemporary Audi.”Paul McCabe, corporate director at Addison Lee Group, says the pilot has helped to inform the group’s decisions about the fleet choices it will make as it works towards its target of having a fleet capable of zero emissions by 2022. “By generating data-driven insights, the e-tron pilot has allowed us to evaluate the real-world performance and requirements of electric vehicles in our fleet of the future,” he says.Although big change is coming, much will stay the same, and that’s a comfort for those who will experience the revolution first hand.“It’s still a car and you still just drive it the same way,” says Meere, “but it’s just more pleasant to drive. If I had the choice, I’d stay with the electric vehicle now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/005664f5d4d6232bcf5bfde2ccabc45e44aa0eac/149_0_4658_2796/master/4658.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4109bc03a6e7125984613cf7cb3a11f7","title":"understated beauty great brands have one big idea that chimes with people","story":"For a brand such as Audi, form really does follow function – which translates into designs that instill a sense of reliability, efficiency and trustIt was the audacious simplicity of it. At last year’s Milan Design Week, a giant ring was suspended inside the courtyard of the city’s Seminario Arcivescovile, a seminary that was built in 1564.Ma Yansong, the founder of MAD Architects, which developed the installation with Audi, explained the thinking behind it: “The illuminated ring in the square boundary of the historical courtyard stands for mankind’s strive for perfection.”The installation, called “Fifth Ring”, was arguably a perfect metaphor for a design aesthetic that has long been associated with the German carmaker. The air of quiet confidence. The understated beauty. Its sheer efficiency.But the aesthetic is also a business ethos rendered into physical form.“Audi are an interesting brand in the way they tapped very deliberately into the whole German design aesthetic of engineering efficiency, rationality and modernity,” says Jeremy Myerson, chair of design at the Helen Hamlyn Centre for Design at the Royal College of Art and founding editor of Design Week. “Those values go back to the Bauhaus roots of good form, everything precisely as it needs to be – and there is still commercial equity in that, as we’ve seen in brands like Apple. The idea is that in a complex world you need simplicity, and that continues to hold its own.”Audi has made a virtue of those principles in its adherence to functionality and to the concept of progress through technology (better known as vorsprung durch technik). It’s a subtle message with a powerful appeal. The beauty of its cars flow from fundamental engineering values that feed into quality and consistency.“Most great brands have one big emotional idea, very simple, very recognisable and it chimes with people,” says Myerson, “You buy an Audi because you’re identifying emotionally in a high quality, technical machine. It instils ideas of reliability and efficiency – trust essentially. And that’s what the best brands are about.”Simplicity should never be mistaken for predictability or dullness. Audi has always been ready to push the envelope, whether it came to the aerodynamics of its iconic 1980s Quattro or the sporty elegance of the TT.“Audi has always been able to be creative within its own defined rules,” says Howard Guy, co-managing director of automotive and aviation consultancy, Design Q. “They were the first manufacturer to start using materials and finishes that play off each other very imaginatively. For instance, the TT dash had a superb grain, a texture and softness which didn’t make it feel like it was a great big injection-moulded piece of plastic like most things at the time. There were little details, a bit of gloss, a bit of brushed aluminium, the way the materials were brought together that was very refreshing and everyone began to copy it. It’s about perception, the way of making something mass market look expensive. It’s clever because it’s about playing with surfaces and colours – things that don’t cost much. It’s the same approach that makes for a great handbag.”Audi’s lesson is one of boldness and confidence in its ability to take materials and technology and synthesise them into something that symbolises progress in an elegantly understated way, whether it be the Audi A8 aluminium Space Frame of the early 1990s or the 1995 TT coupe that has proved so enduring.“The very first TT had the baseball interior with the heavy leather seats with the huge stitching. Nobody had done that before or been bold enough,” says Guy. “They were very sure of their ground. When it came to those great cars, they did it with courage and that’s a disappearing value in the car industry today, there’s so much to lose, everyone plays safe.”The danger of homogeneity must always be set against destroying core values and Audi’s heritage has meant a consistency of approach. It is a premium brand and everything stays as in tune to that as its legendarily reliable engines.Embracing new technology in the shape of electrical motors and AI brings new challenges, but you expect that core principle of form following function will always provide a solution that connects with its audience. The Audi Q4 e-tron concept features recycled plastic fabric and sustainable paint developed to reflect sunlight so the car requires less air-conditioning.Being ahead of the curve while remaining faithful to its ideals is how Audi has managed to match its engineering prowess with an equally impressive design aesthetic. In short, it’s the Audi way of doing business – and it’s also why the phrase vorsprung durch technik has become synonymous with the brand."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/661047b370d2c0bf51bcd91718ec4f19bf635c20/0_178_2581_1549/master/2581.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7e63e705f70e56939a63f2f17614a22","title":"defi du seuil wins ascot clarence house chase horse racing tips","story":"• Barry Geraghty’s mount beats old rival Un De Sceaux• Ballyandy wins in photo for Haydock’s Champion Hurdle TrialDefi Du Seuil received what may be the ultimate compliment from Barry Geraghty who, unprompted, compared the horse to Moscow Flyer in the winner’s enclosure here. “Dazzling and breathtaking” was the jockey’s elated verdict after the pair kept their faultless season rolling with victory in the Clarence House Chase and Defi Du Seuil is now clear favourite for the Queen Mother Champion Chase.“I love riding him,” Geraghty said, pouring sincerity into an oft-used phrase with a lot of emphasis on the word “love”. “He’s not the biggest in the world but he has so much scope and just, he’s up for it. And that’s what you love with good two-mile chasers. Moscow Flyer wasn’t the biggest or the flashiest but he was up for it. And this lad is up for it.”A new generation of racing fans has come along since Moscow Flyer last won a race 15 years ago, so perhaps the significance of that reference is missed by some. Asked to name the best two-miler Geraghty has ridden, many would name Sprinter Sacre, but Moscow Flyer gave him his first Cheltenham Festival success, in the Arkle of 2002, and for years it seemed the popular Irish horse was unbeatable, so long as the fences didn’t get in the way.Defi Du Seuil is not there yet but he looks better with every race. There was just a neck in it at the line when Un De Sceaux rallied at him in the Tingle Creek last month but the margin this time was almost three lengths and the race was essentially over as a contest about two strides after the second-last, when Geraghty asked and his mount answered, shooting effortlessly into a clear lead.What is the form worth? One could fret about that, since Un De Sceaux is surely past his best at the age of 12 and the 143-rated Marracudja was just five lengths behind him.And Willie Mullins, trainer of the runner-up, evidently wanted to run the race again. “I was disappointed,” he said. “I thought the winner had improved hugely but I was disappointed in my fella. I don’t think we went fast enough.”Over in the winner’s enclosure, Philip Hobbs was naturally in another mood entirely, his eyes red-rimmed by the emotion of the moment. “I’m just surprised, very surprised, by how easy he did it,” said the Minehead trainer.“I couldn’t imagine he would go and beat Un De Sceaux as easily as he did. He’s won seven Grade Ones for us. No other horse we’ve had has ever done anything like that. And he’s only just turned seven.”There now remains the question of which race to shoot for at the Cheltenham Festival in March, bearing in mind that Defi Du Seuil won over two miles and five furlongs there last year. For that reason, he was expected to be a Ryanair horse this term but he has proved so electric over the minimum distance that he is now just 2-1 with most firms for the Champion Chase.Surely no owner erts a Champion Chase favourite to another target and it is worth noting that JP McManus has yet to win the two-mile championship race. But Defi Du Seuil has not faced horses of the quality of Altior or Chacun Pour Soi this season and the Ryanair, against A Plus Tard and Min, would be easier.Meanwhile, Haydock’s Champion Hurdle Trial seems as unlikely as ever to live up to its name, Ballyandy having snatched victory in the very last stride from a paddling Pentland Hills. The winner is extremely game but you can get 33-1 about his chance in the big one at Cheltenham.For the second time this winter, Pentland Hills raced too freely and failed to get home. Perhaps the faster pace and better ground of a Champion Hurdle will show him to better advantage but he has a lot to prove now. Nicky Henderson, his trainer, professed himself “gutted”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c5ff7fdd5b59f4842f28870214ae08b06b43a2b/60_0_2995_1797/master/2995.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=359c9ce4879785b9ae3936ece8f4f1b7","title":"dom bess thought about 10 wickets england south africa third test cricket","story":"• England off-spinner admits to dreaming of a famous record• Bess still aiming for nine-wicket haul against South AfricaDom Bess said he dreamed of taking all 10 South African wickets as he enjoyed the finest moment of his career on day three of the third Test at St George’s Park.The 22-year-old off-spinner, playing in this series only because of the illness to Jack Leach that led to his Somerset team-mate flying home last Thursday, claimed his first five-wicket haul in Tests on a rain-hit day that ended with the hosts reaching the close on 208 for six in response to England’s first‑innings of 499 for nine declared.However, during an eventful morning session when Bess added the scalps of Dean Elgar, Faf du Plessis and Rassie van der Dussen to the two he claimed on the second evening, he had a chance of emulating the great Jim Laker, who took 19 Australian wickets – including all 10 in the first innings – during the 1956 Ashes Test at Old Trafford.Ben Stokes put paid to that in the final session when he grabbed the sixth South Africa wicket, the nightwatchman Anrich Nortje.Bess, though, is hoping he can still clean up the last four home batsmen and take a nine-wicket haul. “I thought about all 10 a little bit,” he said. “But as soon as I did I was brought back to reality. Ten is a bit greedy, but there’s obviously four still out there and hopefully I can get them but I’ll be happy if we just get them.“It’s nice to know I am contributing to this side. As long as we get into positions to win games and I’m contributing I’m happy with it.”Bess is enjoying his moment in the spotlight after a season when he was on loan at Yorkshire after Leach blocked his route into Somerset’s first team. The youngster is also making the most of his unexpected second chance for England having played two home Tests against India in 2018.“It’s funny how cricket happens, how the ride goes,” said Bess. “I’ll cherish it for a long time because I’ve worked very hard for days like this, but also knowing that hopefully there’s a lot more to come.“The work I’ve done since my debut, I understand myself, my bowling. I still think there’s a lot to work on for me to get stronger technically, but it’s hopefully the start of a journey.”As for Leach, who contracted sepsis on England’s tour of New Zealand and has failed to recover fully, Bess hopes he can team up with his close friend on England’s tour of Sri Lanka in March. Bess made his debut against India at Lord’s after Leach broke his thumb.“It’s getting opportunities where you have to perform because it’s coming in for such a class bowler as Leachy,” he said. “That’s just been the nature of my career.“I’ve got to take it with a pinch of salt. I remember saying at Lord’s on my debut it was a great opportunity to test my skills. I’m a lot further in my journey than I was before.“I’m gutted for Leachy, he’s had such a tough time these last six weeks. I know he’ll be happy for me. We’ve always had it, so it seems normal. If it’s not him it’s me, if it’s not me it’s him.“He’ll be working really hard to get back for Sri Lanka and – hopefully if I get picked and he gets picked – I’d love us to play together. That would be a really nice touch if we could take wickets together for England as well as Somerset.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebf513010104659fc12f5e24aa48462f63e6be64/90_218_2820_1693/master/2820.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd3ca42a8adb3ebbf3669dfc30470cfb","title":"european champions cup","story":"The Northampton players were castigated by their director of rugby Chris Boyd for their lacklustre display against Benetton Treviso last weekend but the Saints recovered to keep their faint hopes of reaching the Champions Cup quarter-finals alive with a 36-24 success at Lyon.“We’re really pleased to come here and win, and to get five points I guess is a bonus given the situation,” said Boyd. “But probably more pleasing was we were down 17-5 at half-time, probably having created enough chances to be in front but we were just a little bit loose with our execution.“There was real clarity at half‑time around what we needed to do in the second half and if we just tightened up our execution and stuck with what we needed to do then we’d be in with a chance.”The hooker, Mikey Haywood, crossed for Saints’ solitary score in a first half that included too many Northampton errors for them to sustain any periods of real pressure. Lyon, who currently sit second in the Top 14, played with more precision and power in the opening period, with scores from their lock Felix Lambey and No 8, Liam Gill, giving them a deserved lead.But Saints were much improved in the second 40 minutes, with Teimana Harrison, Cobus Reinach, George Furbank and the replacement hooker, James Fish, crossing the line to seal a win with something to spare.Leinster clinched top-seed status and a home quarter-final as they made it a record-breaking 16 wins in a row in all competitions this season with an 18-0 victory in the Pool One game against Benetton in Treviso. It betters the previous record of 15 wins set by Leinster in 2001-02 for successive victories by a European club.Leo Cullen’s men had to battle hard against Benetton, with Caelan Doris and James Tracy tries in the second half helping them overcome the stubborn Italian side. Leinster advance through the pool stages with a record fifth European crown in their sights.Ulster also qualified for the quarter-finals for a second consecutive season with a 22-15 victory over Bath. The England wing Ruaridh McConnochie scored an 18th-minute try for Bath but replacement hooker Ross Batty was shown a red card for a no-arms tackle after he also scored a try after the break. Bath have lost all six games in a miserable European campaign.Harlequins have fared a little better in Pool Three and they went down 26-19 at Clermont. Paul Gustard, their director of rugby, claims the youthful side he played can provide the blueprint for the club. “We have played against a side with 15 internationals and almost 400 caps. We had four internationals in our squad,” Gustard said.“It is the next step for us to start growing our own internationals again and have the next period where Harlequins are going to be a big force. Brett Herron and Niall Saunders are both 22. Tom Penny is a young lad, Luke Northmore and Gabriel Ibitoye are 21 so we have a really youthful team.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f73ea7b35303230b69c6ae51058308f030cccb34/0_0_5308_3539/master/5308.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6aeffdde058440284b55a62a5b090f2 700w","title":"automation jobs universal basic income daniel susskind interview","story":"The Oxford economist talks about his new book on the challenges of a society with no traditional employmentDaniel Susskind is an economist and fellow of Balliol College, Oxford. He has held policy roles in the Blair and Cameron governments. His new book, A World Without Work, explores how society should respond to the increasing automation of employment.This isn’t an unexplored topic, so why did you write this book? My view is that this is one of the greatest questions of our time. And in spite of everything that has been written, I didn’t feel like we had done the question justice. I don’t think we’re taking seriously this idea that there might not be enough well-paid work for everyone to do because of technological advances that are taking place.Is that partly because of the way the question is framed, that “robots are stealing our jobs” when that’s not how these changes are happening? Yes. There are two mistakes there. One is the sort of anthropomorphisation of technology – these robots exist but they are often gimmicks. The technologies that are really very powerful don’t look, think or reason like us. The second mistake is to think of entire jobs being replaced. These technologies tend to displace people from tasks – what I call task encroachment.Many of the boundaries economists and computer scientists developed in the second part of the 20th century for thinking about what machines could and couldn’t do have been crossed. For example, driving a car, making a medical diagnosis or identifying a bird from a fleeting glimpse. All these tasks can be accomplished by software now.And machines are often performing these tasks using strategies that are new to humans?We thought many of these tasks would be difficult to automate because humans couldn’t articulate how they performed them. They relied on experience, intuition and gut reaction – so how could you write a set of instructions for a computer to follow? But by using lots of data and computing power, machines are creating new strategies.In the light of this technological change, what career path would you advise a 16-year-old to follow? Very crudely, I’d say, there are two strategies: either you learn to be good at the sorts of things these systems and machines cannot do or you try to build the machines.But forecasting which jobs and tasks will be automated is hard. Should people bother training to be doctors or lawyers when automation is already encroaching on these careers? For young professionals, perhaps somewhat counterintuitively, I say the best thing to do is pursue the traditional path. But be far more agnostic and open minded along the way about opportunities that come up. Because what’s interesting is that if you look at these technologies – take the systems developed by DeepMind or the ones that recognise melanomas by Sebastian Thrun’s team at Stanford – these teams contain lots of domain experts, such as trained doctors.Technological unemployment appears be growing alongside rising inequality – is there a direct relationship between the two? Work is our traditional way of distributing income, so one of the great challenges of a world with less work is how we slice up the pie. The labour share of income is falling in many parts of the developed world.Should robots be taxed and that money funnelled back to the victims of automation? There are various problems with this idea. What do we mean by a robot? A driverless car isn’t driven by an android. How do we do a robot headcount? We do need to tax capital, the owners – however that has a branding problem.But the owners of the these technologies are often quite good at avoiding tax. If the trends in inequality continue, focusing on how we resolve that problem is going to become more pertinent.You advance the idea of a “conditional” universal basic income. I think the challenge in a world with less work is how you maintain that sense of social solidarity. At the moment, that comes from a sense that everyone is paying into the collective economic pot through their taxes or, if they’re not in work, they are actively looking for work or training for work.But perhaps we can introduce conditions to a UBI, for example that you undertake some valuable voluntary work in return. There are something like 15 million people doing a hugely valuable set of voluntary activities in the UK – why not recognise that? The UBI solves the distribution problem – how do you share income if the labour market doesn’t do it very well? – and if everyone is contributing, some in economic and others in non-economic ways, that may solve the we’re-all-in-it-together problem.Volunteering requires empathy and hands-on skills that computers find hard and such activities are not rewarded very well. There is a paradox. Machines can’t do them and they tend to be unpaid by the market. There’s this huge gap between the social value of a lot of this work and the value that’s recognised in the market. So one of the reasons for optimism is that there’s an opportunity to potentially address that.Work not only gives people income, but often gives meaning and identity. How can people get meaning from more leisure? If we think the relationship between work and meaning is very tight, the alternative might be not to think of this as being about the future of work, but the future of leisure. You know, we have labour-market policies to shape how people live their working lives. Maybe we also need leisure policies to shape how people spend their spare time. We already have a pension system that is a heavily subsidised leisure policy of sorts.You’ve worked in government. Is automation a priority for politicians or are they reluctant to address things that may only pay off long after they have been voted out? Almost every government in the developed world has published some kind of AI strategy in the last few years. Whether or not they’re then following that strategy is less clear.You have to explain that this is not a story about the future – this is happening now. Every day, we hear stories of these technologies, driving cars, making medical diagnoses, drafting legal documents, designing buildings – this is something that is happening now it’s not in the future. It is closely linked to the inequalities we see emerging. It tends not to be acted upon because it’s thought to be something that doesn’t really matter, but it does.• A World Without Work by Daniel Susskind is published by Allen Lane (£20).

I have to be. To concentrate fully, to lock everything else out and to force myself not to feel the cold is the only way I can cope with the temperature. Friends ask me how this can be anything but torture, but my swim routine feels almost ceremonial. The fjord is tranquil, beautiful and reflects the majesty of the surrounding 1,500-metre mountains. I’ve tried swimming in the ocean, but the waves ruin it for me. They are meant for summer winter waves are loud, unpleasant and cold.I go swimming every Saturday, year-round, but the most memorable experiences always occur in the crisp months. Mastering the salty water at zero degrees gives me an overwhelming sense of happiness. Occasionally friends come along, and I have invited – or forced – my two daughters to join, too. They enjoy it in July and August, but refuse to swim the rest of the year. Kids these days …A friend of mine makes sure I feel safe. She lives on the other side of the fjord, and tells me that she keeps an eye on me to make sure I’m OK. Once she took a photo of me with a zoom lens to prove her  angel capabilities.Leaving my clothes on the beach in a particular order is important. After leaving the water, I need to get out of my bathing suit, dry myself with a big fluffy towel and get dressed as fast as humanly possible, which means I have ended up in some really strange non-matching outfits. But I don’t care, as long as I’m warm.

Friends converge on the slopes for picnics, or to go swimming in the natural Telese thermal pools to the north, or spend a day on the high ropes and climbing walls of the woodland adventure park.Every so often one of the villages has a harvest festival or celebrates their local saint. These are popular events that mix pagan and Christian traditions. My favourite is the Sagra della Castagna – the chestnut festival in Vitulano in November. Religious processions flow through the streets, folk musicians play the pipes and farmers bring their produce to town to be enjoyed in a huge collective feast.Food plays an important role in daily life here. The soil is particularly fertile, which means that vegetables can be grown without fertilisers and cattle are left to graze freely on the hillside. Olives, potatoes and beans grow especially well but the valley is most famous for its wine. This is where the ancient Romans grew their vines.Several years ago, Domenico decided to do up a place in the quiet village of Cautano, where we grew up, which has allowed us to lead a healthier lifestyle. If once the weekends were for partying, they are now for relaxing, eating good food and feeling the benefits of being outdoors. The cottage backs on to a rugged hill, which is lined with vines and planted with fruit trees. As soon as we arrive from Naples, Domenico heads out onto to the hillside to tend to his produce and enjoy the peace. Underneath the house is a small cantina where we store the vats of olive oil, wine and tomato passata, which we make yearly, carrying on the tradition of our parents and grandparents.It’s the desire for a more wholesome way of life that keeps drawing us back. However, we have noticed we are not the only ones enjoying the countryside: the villages are slowly repopulating as city dwellers are rediscovering the joys and health benefits of country living.Stay Family-run Poggio Antico Agriturismo (doubles from €70).Interview by Sophia SeymourHugo Brito, 45, from PortoWhen I need a break from the city, I get in my car (or, if I’m feeling energetic, get on my bike) and head out to the Serra da Freita, a range of low hills about 40 miles south-east of Porto. Although it’s close to the city, it’s always empty. I don’t know why, because it has some amazing bike trails and climbing routes. But my main thing is running: that’s mostly what I go there to do.There are some small villages around the edge of the range, hamlets really – places like Aldeia da Pena, Felgueiras and Mizarela. To eat, Felgueiras has a small restaurant that’s popular with locals. A speciality is beef from these hills, which tastes completely different because the cows are reared naturally on pastures rather than in feedlots.Serra da Freita isn’t a formal park as such. It’s more like this strange area of forgotten wilderness, full of granite boulders and coarse vegetation and biting wind. Once you’re on the top of it, there’s a vast plateau and you can see for miles. It’s beautiful but really quite barren, only the odd tree here and there. The fog often comes down, which adds to the magical atmosphere of the place.There are some signposted hikes, such as the 8.5 km long Passadiços do Paiva, on a wooden walkway, but I like to follow my nose when I run there. I just head off and see where the trails take me. The further you get into the range, the emptier and more barren it becomes.There are abandoned hamlets dotted about the place, which I love – a reminder that the area was once more inhabited than it is now.I’m quite a sociable person usually, but when I run I really enjoy being by myself. I even spent my birthday there once, running through the night in the dark. Being alone helps me connect with the surroundings and clear my head. But when I go climbing, I always go with a friend. It’s safer that way. The best climbing is around the Cascata da Frecha da Mizarela. Outside the Alps, it’s one of the highest waterfalls in Europe, at 75 metres. There are different routes up to the top, some easy and some for more advanced climbers. Stay Hotel Rural da Freita (doubles from €55 B\u0026ampB) in Mizarela, just above the waterfalls. Interview by Oliver BalchZsófia Fischer, 42, from BudapestI first started going to Dobogókő mountain when I was a child. About an hour’s drive from Budapest, it is easy to get there, but back then we would take the HÉV, the city’s suburban railway, and then get on to one of the bright orange and yellow buses.I didn’t return until a few years ago, and when I saw that it was as beautiful as it ever was, high up in the Visegrád mountains and overlooking the Danube, I wondered why it had taken me so long to come back. Dobogókő translates as “the stone of the beating heart”, perhaps a reference to the fact that the 700-metre peak at the heart of the area – called Dobogó-kő – has been considered the “heart chakra” of the Earth since ancient times by followers of the shamanistic Táltos faith.Dobogókő, near the village of Pilisszentkereszt, has a spiritual feel. The moment you arrive you sense great calm. Past the ornate entry gate there’s an easy trail through the forest. There is so much positive energy here – it is perfect for an outdoor meditation session.Some people come in the summer but for me it is magical in the winter, especially if there is snow clinging to the trees. The air is crisp and sobering and there is a cosy ambience in the restaurants, like Zsindelyes Vendégház in Pilisszentkereszt. It serves traditional Hungarian food such as bean gulyás (paprika-spiced soup), but its real draw is the setting, an old wooden hut in the hilltop village where you can take off your wet winter boots and warm up by the fireplace with a tea. Another atmospheric place in the village is the restaurant Baro Eotvos Lorand Menedekhaz. Try bogrács, the Hungarian beef stew cooked over open flames in a cast-iron kettle.The last time I was in Dobogókő, I brought my three-year-old daughter and we took her through the snow on a sled. From the smile on her face I could tell that she loved the experience as much as I had all those years ago. Stay In Pilisszentkereszt, Dobogókőjurta is a collection of yurts (from £15 for two people). There’s also the apartment-style Erdei Villa (doubles from £50).Interview by Alia AkkamHanna Scott, 42, from MalmöWinter bathing is one of the main ways in which I manage stress. If I feel like there is too much going on at work, at home, or just generally, I escape to the sauna by Gyllebosjön. It’s a small, wooden sauna on wheels, by this beautiful picturesque lake, very close to our summer house in Österlen.Österlen is in the south-east corner of Sweden, attracts artists, writers, hippies and hipsters from Stockholm, and people with summer houses. The great thing about this sauna is that it only opens when the summer season comes to a close. So when the sauna reopens its gates, it’s a bit like “OK, now we’re back on”. It’s so small that everyone sits very close together and you end up having these great conversations.The social aspect is one thing, but the reason why people go there is to swim. You sit in the sauna until you feel like you can’t take it any more. And then it’s just a short skip and a jump to the jetty, and into the lake.The temperature of the water can be anything between 4C and 9C in the winter. The sauna only opens in the evenings, so often it’s very dark, with candles lining the path to the water. It’s very beautiful here, surrounded by beechwood forest, with a starry sky above.Because the water is very cold, it’s just a quick dip, then back into the sauna. After doing this a couple of times, you can feel your mind and body start to relax.There’s an excellent hostel run by the Swedish Tourist Association in the nearby village of Baskemölla, eight miles away (doubles from £52). Interview by Richard Orange The stunning landscape was created by glacial erosion of the huge limestone massifs in the Cantabrian mountains, resulting in rocky peaks towering over steep valleys with forests of beech and oak. Some peaks are over 2,600 metres, but you’re still relatively close to the sea and rainfall is high so there is a lot of different vegetation: you can go from green pastures to craggy rock formations in just a few hours. While you’re walking you often see rebecos (the small mountain goat native to the area, also called Cantabrian chamois) bounding over the rocks near the trails, and vultures overhead. There are also brown bears and even a few wolves, but sightings are rare.I started hiking there with a group of friends when I was in my early twenties on the network of hiking trails called El Anillo. We used to spend days in the mountains, staying at tiny, isolated mountain refuges. Perhaps my favourite hike is the ascent from Fuente Dé to the top of Pico Tesorero, but there are many to choose from. Apart from hiking, there is a lot to explore in the surrounding area: pretty villages like Potes with stone buildings in the distinctive Cantabrian style, and even some prehistoric caves. The local dish is a beef, pork and chickpea stew called cocido lebaniego, which is perfect after a long hike.Stay The isolated refuge Collado Jermoso (€15pp, meals available) is high in the mountains and can only be reached on foot. Sit on the little terrace and watch the sun set with a beer and all your problems fade to insignificance. For those who prefer a little more comfort, the Parador Nacional in Fuente Dé (doubles from €75) is next to the cable car that takes you up to 1,843 metres in a breathtaking four minutes.Interview by Annette Pacey Stéphane Bertone, 50, from NiceMy maternal grandparents are from Saint-Martin-Vésubie, a small village 40 miles north of Nice, where my grandfather was the baker. Every summer holiday I would stay there, filling my days with hiking trips, mountaineering and rock climbing. The village is the gateway to one of the most beautiful national parks in France, the Mercantour, home to some of the highest summits of the southern Alps. Its highest point is the Cime du Gélas at 3,143 metres, which has been my favourite place since I first climbed it at the age of 13, having told my parents I was spending the day at the pool because they wouldn’t have allowed me to go on my own. Instead, I hitchhiked to the sanctuary of La Madone de Fenestre, eight miles away, where the mountain hikes begin. You can get the bus to it from Saint-Martin-Vésubie.It takes about four hours to climb but the 360​​-degree views are magical on the way up there are spruces, larches and pines, with chamois, ibex and marmots. Then after the treeline you’ll get a better view of any eagles and bearded vultures overhead. It is a mountain I have climbed many times, both alone and with friends.There’s a tough ascent for experienced climbers (with ropes) and an easier route for hikers. A few years ago a group of us walked to the summit from the Promenade des Anglais in Nice, 75 miles away. It took three days but it was an amazing experience, and despite a few aches and pains we all reached the top.In the mountains and especially at the top of Gélas, I feel a sense of completeness. When I return to “civilisation”, the benefits of being in nature and at altitude stay with me for a while. Whenever mental or physical fatigue reappears, I simply head for the mountains again!Escapade – Les Guides du Mercantour, in Saint-Martin-Vésubie, offers accompanied walking tours as well as canyoning, trekking, climbing and via ferrata trips. Stay Chalet de la Madone de Fenestre (adult €20.20 a night, child over 8, €16.15) has 62 dorm beds and provides hot showers and meals, including a fine blueberry tart. Online booking required.Interview by Jon BryantVilly Rodopoulou, 52, from AthensWhenever I need a break from my job as a plastic surgeon in Athens, I head straight for the mountains. I started going to Mount Oiti with my father when I was younger, and now make the pilgrimage with my husband and son. Although it’s one of Greece’s largest national parks, it remains fairly off the radar – even to many Greeks.We usually stay in the village of Pavliani, about a 2½-hour drive north-west of Athens. The first thing I do when we arrive is go to a river and simply sit a while. There’s something about the sound of water trickling down a mountain that really brings me peace of mind. It’s a stark contrast to the chaotic beach scenes you get on the islands.The activities we like to do are quite simple: hike the trails, go mushroom picking or explore the mountain villages by car. Often we are the only visitors here.According to mythology, Oiti was where Heracles (Hercules to Romans) came to die. After being poisoned, the Greek hero trekked to the top of the mountain and built himself a funeral pyre, intending to die by self-immolation. The story enraptured the ancient Greeks, who built a temple to him on the same spot in the third century BC, and which remained in use until the late Roman period.The ruins of the temple, which are reached by a challenging hike from Pavliani or an equally challenging drive up dirt roads, are breathtaking. Whenever I need to disconnect, I come here. It may sound a bit strange, but there’s something about sitting by an ancient temple on a mountain, contemplating all that has happened on these lands, that really relaxes me. I feel a deep connection to my country’s ancient history. It’s a kind of meditation that takes me away and makes me forget about the chaos of modern life.Stay Vasilikia Mountain Farm offers comfortable mountain lodging in Pavliani, (doubles from £135).Interview by Alex SakalisEveliis Kund Zujev, 38, from TallinnI fell in love with the island of Prangli the moment my husband and I first arrived at Kelnase harbour nine years ago and were welcomed by our host, who drove us to our weekend holiday home on the back of an all-terrain vehicle. Local transportation is limited to ATVs, a fleet of rusty Ladas and a couple of army-green Soviet Kamaz trucks, and most roads are sand, rock and smashed corrugated roofing sheets. One of my favourite activities is to take an excursion through the forest on the back of a Kamaz.The island is home to just 63 people in the winter but is much busier in midsummer, when we build a huge bonfire and dance late into the night. It is traditional to make garlands for young girls out of wild flowers, which they then put under their pillows before bed. We also search the forest for glow-worms. It is said that if you find one you will be able to speak with birds and animals.I worked as an export sales manager until recently, which involved a lot of communication and travelling. But on Prangli I can shut out life on the mainland, and relax in the saunas, or by taking a walk along the beach at night, admiring the lights of Tallinn over the shore.From Tallinn, it is a 30-minute drive to Leppneeme harbour, where the Wrangö ferry departs two to three times a day on the hour-long trip to the island.On our first visit we picked the Praaga holiday house at random, and found that Iivar, the captain of the old mail boat Helge, which until recently was the only connection to the mainland, was the owner. It seems wrong to call it a holiday house now, as for the past nine years my family have visited at least two to three times a year, even in winter, when there are almost no tourists.When we discovered that my husband’s grandfather, who once worked as the island’s doctor, delivered Iivar, we felt a deep connection to the island.Stay Praaga Farmstay (doubles from £34 B\u0026ampB) is on the tip of the island and includes access to a traditional Estonian sauna. Iivar sometimes takes guests out into the Baltic Sea fishing and watching for seals. Interview by Daryl MersomPavel Šimek, 35, from PragueBeing a civil engineer can be both busy and stressful, so I like to get outdoors at weekends. I cycle all over but my absolute favourite spot is the Bohemian Switzerland national park. The mountains here are very exotic, different from the rest of the Czech Republic on account of the spectacular sandstone towers. The scenery blows my mind every time – it was here that The Chronicles of Narnia was filmed. There are lots of cycle routes in the region, and it’s one I took recently that I’d recommend.Start at Děčín (regular trains go there from Prague) and cycle north towards Hřensko – a rocky village with gorges offering impressive views over the River Labe (or Elbe in German). Nearby is Pravčická brána: the biggest sandstone arch in Europe. Although you can’t cycle to it, it’s definitely worth locking up your bike and walking the two miles to it on foot.Once you’re back on the bikes, pedal west towards the village of Jetřichovice, where there are several great viewpoints. It’s a good place to camp, or stay the night in the Bellevue Hotel (see below).The next day, head through the tree-lined valley of Doubice, which boasts five different rock types, and finish your route in Krásná Lípa. It’s a tree-filled town in the north-west of Czech Switzerland – the name translates as “beautiful linden”, referring to the country’s national tree.As any cyclist will tell you, one of the best things about cycling is the beer at the end of it! This route is perfect for that because in Krásná Lípa is one of the best small breweries in the country, Falkenštejn. They have loads of good beers on tap, but I especially like their bottled APA, Svižnej Emil (Speedy Emil). It’s named after the Czech long-distance runner Emil Zátopek, who won three gold medals at the 1952 Olympics. It’s lower in alcohol – which is definitely a plus when you have to get back on the bike!I love cycling because you can see way more than on foot, and you can pedal away from other people to find your own quiet, peaceful spot. This region is perfect for that. The air is fresh, the views are incredible and I can clear my mind in preparation for another week at work.Stay The Bellevue Hotel (doubles from €30) in Jetřichovice has a great swimming pool (open in summer), perfect for resting your body after all the cycling.Interview by Mark PickeringJonathan Moskovic, 29, from BrusselsEvery two to three months I visit my in-laws in Engreux, a small village 100 miles south-west of Brussels. This hidden village, near the confluence of the east and west Ourthe rivers, is a haven of peace and nature.In winter, snowfall transforms the scenery into a postcard. There’s sledging and skiing at Baraque Fraiture, one of the highest points of Belgium (652 metres), where there are three alpine ski slopes and several cross-country ski trails.In summer, I go kayaking on the river or swim in Lake Nisramont. Sometimes I walk in the forest and never meet anyone. I’ve seen deer several times but never wild boars – although I’m told they are there. One of the reasons for Engreux’s secrecy is that it is difficult to access by public transport. From Brussels, you have to take a train for two hours to Libramont and then take two buses. I don’t have a car so I opt for carpooling. I like meeting new people and chatting on the way.Stay My in-laws’ neighbours rent a farmhouse with sauna called Le Tunnel De Saule , sleeps nine, from around £400 for three nights.Interview by Aubry TourielDick Noordhoek, 64, from The HagueFor me, the most relaxing thing to do is to go cycling in Frisia, a green and peaceful province in the north of the Netherlands. My favourite area is De Wouden, in the east of the province, which is totally untainted by tourism. There are quiet bicycle lanes everywhere and while I listen to the meadow birds and the spinning of my wheels, I feel all tension falling away.De Wouden means “the woods”, but you actually come across a lot of moorland and meadows in this region. It’s a simple and charming landscape. It’s also very flat, which makes cycling easy and allows you to gaze far into the distance. The Frisian people have their own traditions and language, of which they are extremely proud. They have a reputation for being stubborn, but they are very friendly and know all about slow living. Often, when you ask for directions, they start a lengthy conversation with you. It’s easy to forget the time in the Frisian countryside.My favourite destination for a bicycle trip is an old mansion called Fogelsanghstate (Bird’s Song Estate). It is a tranquil place, with an air of mystery. On weekdays you have a good chance of finding yourself alone in the park, apart from a colony of red deer.Cycling through Frisia you see animals everywhere. Frisian horses, for example, that look like mythical beasts with their shiny, jet black coats and long, wavy mane. Once I spotted two white deer – albino twins, which are very rare. She also said she didn’t put photos of the animals on her Facebook page for fear of attracting too many visitors. That’s what makes De Wouden such a relaxing place: people attach more value to living quietly than to doing business.Although Frisian bakeries sell delicious sugar loaves, ginger bread and dumkes (biscuits with aniseed), this is not an area where you will spot many exciting places to eat. Stay Het Volle Leven has rooms and serves excellent three-course vegetarian meals. In the summer you can eat in the garden, which borders a forest and has chickens mingling freely with the guests. The atmosphere is, of course, totally relaxed. Interview by Renate van der ZeeLooking for a holiday with a difference?

Tickets for the event – whose previous speakers have included the broadcaster Jeremy Vine and the Labour former cabinet minister Alan Johnson – cost up to £470 each.ADS represents BAE Systems, who supply parts for the Typhoon and Tornado jets that are playing a role in the Saudi-led coalition bombing of Houthi insurgents in Yemen, and Raytheon, whose UK-made Paveway IV bombs have been linked by Human Rights Watch to attacks on civilian infrastructure.Other members include MBDA, a missile company part-owned by BAE whose Brimstone and Storm Shadow missiles are being used by Saudi forces, and Lockheed Martin, the largest arms company in the world, whose bombs were used by Saudi forces in the destruction of a school bus in which dozens of children were killed.Campaign Against the Arms Trade (CAAT) approached Balding’s representatives urging her to rethink her decision, pointing out that in 2016 she hosted the Disasters Emergency Committee appeal to help the people of Yemen. In an email, the campaign group said: “It is clear why these companies want to be associated with positive causes, and why they want to work with respected personalities and role models.“We respect and admire all of the excellent advocacy work that you do, which is why we are asking you to reconsider your attendance and cancel your speech.”After being told that the Observer intended to write a story about Balding’s appearance at the dinner, a spokesman for her representatives, YMU Group, said: “I can confirm that Clare is in fact no longer attending the event due to various reasons and to clarify, this decision was made before we were made aware of the article.”The ADS website continued to promote Balding’s attendance. It carries a quote from her saying: “I’m looking forward to meeting the ADS members and sharing a great evening together.”Sarah Waldron, of CAAT, said: “We are glad that Clare Balding has withdrawn her support for the ADS dinner and encourage any other public figures that are approached to do the same. This dinner is a major networking opportunity for the arms companies, and the deals being discussed and furthered over dinner could have devastating consequences for years to come.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33bc211c50929b12ae64ce4938efbeeb2929328e/804_493_2696_1618/master/2696.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e608f07bc5efa9c0b8389ef6a02ccfc5","title":"pete buttigieg iowa conservative election 2020","story":"His campaign feared hostility in Iowa’s most conservative county. But the local response told a different storyPete Buttigieg knew he was foraying into unfriendly confines when he was en route to Orange City, the seat of Iowa’s most conservative county.The gay ex-mayor of South Bend, Indiana, may be in the top tier of Democratic presidential candidates seeking to win this vital first voting state next month, but his sexuality was seen as likely to be a major issue in this corner of the state, Sioux county.The campaign braced for protesters in light of public burnings of library books depicting gay relationships and vociferous opposition to the town’s annual gay Pride festival, said Ben Halle, Buttigieg’s Iowa communications director, to the .Halle said didn’t know what to expect as far as a crowd, but he said it was fair to expect opposition as Buttigieg’s campaign rolled into town.“What you need to realize with Sioux county is there’s a very strong religious flavor there, from their courts to their public squares,” said Ned Bjornstad, a former elected prosecutor in north-west Iowa turned veteran defense attorney who practices regularly in Orange City. “For a candidate like Buttigieg, I’d expect protesters.”As Buttigieg entered the Prairie Winds Events Center in downtown Orange City, a crowd of around 200 instead roared in a standing ovation.Regan Harms, a 22-year-old senior majoring in biblical studies at Northwestern College in Orange City, said she wasn’t at all surprised with the turnout. As she introduced Buttigieg, she described him as a neighbor and fellow midwesterner, one who understands life in rural America.“Iowans long for someone who understands them,” Harms said. “The second you meet him, you get that impression that he almost knows you. Of course he can come into Orange City, and people will like him. There’s that common bond among midwesterners.”In nearby Sioux Center in September, the Sioux County Conservatives alleged a restaurant was “celebrating sin” by hosting Pride brunch on a Sunday.When asked whether people in Orange City cared about whether Buttigieg was gay, Harms said she wouldn’t answer that question.“It’s a isive topic here in town, of course,” she said. “Obviously, some people care, but look at this crowd. Others don’t.”Buttigieg maintains he’s the candidate who can blaze the trail. After he announced he was gay, he won a second term in South Bend with a greater share of the vote.While the Orange City crowd wasn’t roaring when Buttigieg announced his socially progressive platforms, only one crowd member asked him whether the country was ready for its first gay president. Buttigieg replied that it had taken a leap of faith to run as a gay man in South Bend, and it would take another to win the presidency.“In the last 50 years, every Democratic president has a perspective outside Washington, is new on the national scene, and is of a new generation,” he said. “I check all those boxes.”With less than three weeks to go before the Iowa caucuses, Buttigieg’s chances are as good as any, said Brad Best, professor of political science at Buena Vista University in Storm Lake, Iowa. Buttigieg has consistently polled in the top four in Iowa and New Hampshire since the late summer, but has suffered a slide as of late as the campaign enters a frenetic final period.“I can’t think of anyone more anathema to the seat of Sioux county, but a packed house there suggests there’s broad appeal, for whatever reason,” Best said.Some Democrats believe that Trump’s behavior in office and scandal-plagued personal and political life may be hurting him even in this Republican stronghold and opening an unlikely door to candidates like Buttigieg – who himself confesses a deep religious faith.“Look at it this way: the red wall has begun to crack,” said the former state senator David Johnson, who used to represent the area. Johnson left the Republican party and declared himself an independent after it declared Trump its nominee.“Think about it: there were over 200 people in Orange City to see Pete Buttigieg and there aren’t even 2,000 registered Democrats in that county. That means there are independents and Republicans in that crowd,” Price said.Corrie Hayes, a 21-year-old senior at Northwestern College, said she was impressed particularly with his response to a question about abortion rights, when he said that in the Book of Genesis, life begins with breath. She wouldn’t get into her positions on policy – she said she was deeply religious and her faith guided her every day – but she said she could tell Buttigieg was sincere about his faith.Hayes feels it isn’t fair to question whether Buttigieg is “electable” simply because he’s gay."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c4935ee25ceb7148b486731e3094b701b45d6d1/0_294_3300_1980/master/3300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c36c1ba36c718f34e94c91c0cf2abe0","title":"tennessee governor nathan bedford forrest ku klux klan","story":"Tennesse governor Bill Lee will introduce legislation to amend a law requiring the state to honor Nathan Bedford Forrest, a Confederate general who went on to lead the Ku Klux Klan.Lee’s office confirmed the Republican was working on the bill but did not provide further details.According to state law, governors of Tennessee must sign six proclamations throughout the year designating days of special observance: Robert E Lee Day (19 January), Abraham Lincoln Day (12 February), Andrew Jackson Day (15 March), Confederate Decoration Day (3 June), Nathan Bedford Forrest Day (13 July) and Veterans’ Day (11 November).The law encourages the governor to invite the public to observe each day in schools and churches. It does not outline a penalty should the governor choose not to sign the proclamation.As of Saturday, the Tennessee secretary of state’s website did not show Lee had signed the Robert E Lee Day proclamation. His office did not respond to questions about whether Lee wanted to change the day celebrating that Confederate general, which falls the day before Martin Luther King Jr Day, a federal holiday named for a hero of the civil rights movement.Previous proclamations have called Robert E Lee, who turned down a chance to lead the federal armies in the civil war and fought to secure secession and preserve slavery, “one of the outstanding Americans of the 19th century”.Forrest, a cavalry general, amassed a fortune as a plantation owner and slave trader in Memphis before the civil war. The civil war historian Shelby Foote considered him one of two geniuses who shaped the conflict, Lincoln being the other.But Forrest was in charge of Confederate troops during the battle of Fort Pillow, where an estimated 300 African American soldiers were massacred after surrendering in Tennessee in April 1864. The massacre provoked outrage in the north and was one of the most bitterly disputed incidents of the civil war.Just 62 black soldiers survived what Union troops called a “massacre”. Forrest was questioned by Congress for war crimes.After the war he was the first grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, a paramilitary terrorist group dedicated to suppressing the vote among African Americans.The display of Confederate statues and symbols and the place of the Confederacy in southern culture has been increasingly at issue since summer 2015, when a white supremacist who posed with a Confederate battle flag killed nine churchgoers at a bible study group in an African American church in Charleston, South Carolina.Statues, memorials and flags have been removed from government buildings and public places.In Memphis, Tennessee, parks named for Confederate leaders including Forrest have been renamed and statues, including one of Forrest, removed. The holiday named for Forrest has been questioned for some time.In Tennessee, state senator Raumesh Akbari, a Democrat from Memphis, said: “I know that it’s hard to renegotiate history but at the end of the day we need to celebrate folks that bring people together and not necessarily tear people apart.“I hope that we will consider that and reexamine all of these proclamations for state holidays.”London Lamar, a Democratic state representative also from Memphis, is sponsoring a bill to remove the Forrest Day designation. Previous attempts to change the law have been unsuccessful.Governor Lee was the subject national backlash last July when he not only signed the Nathan Bedford Forrest proclamation but also declined to answer reporters asking if he thought the law should change. He later said he did not like signing the proclamation and would prefer to see the law changed.“While it is my job as governor to enforce the law, I want Tennesseans to know where my heart is on this issue,“ Lee said. “Our state’s history is rich, complex and in some cases painful. With this in mind, I will be working to change this law.”Lawmakers have debated moving a bust of Forrest that has sat inside the Tennessee statehouse for decades. A state commission is scheduled to meet in February, months after Lee appointed two new members to the panel."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/969271b354f46f74b62e871a58284da6853e15c4/0_99_2979_1787/master/2979.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f6b4135d6b6c035b2af8983ca3ce4116","title":"no airport screening for new sars like virus yet china","story":"Experts decide no need for checks as member of Coronavirus family infects up to 1,700 in ChinaHealth officials have ruled out introducing screening for passengers at UK airports, despite mounting fears over a deadly new virus from China. Three big US airports yesterday announced they would introduce screening. Experts warned that the outbreak of the Sars-like virus is likely to be on a larger scale than officially admitted. But Public Health England and the country’s chief medical officer decided that such measures were not yet required in the UK.The risk to the country is described as “very low”, although officials stressed that they were monitoring events in Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the disease has killed at least two and infected a further 45. However, scientists at the Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis in London believe the number of cases in Wuhan could be closer to 1,700.Jeremy Farrar, an expert on emerging diseases, said: “We are starting to hear of more cases in China and other countries, and it is likely that there will be many more.”Scientists say the virus is a member of the coronavirus family, six members of which are known to infect humans this would be the seventh.Mild coronaviruses cause the common cold, but more deadly strains can trigger severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars), which killed nearly 800 of the 8,000 people infected in an outbreak in 2002. Fears this virus could spread similarly have risen as China prepares to celebrate its new year, with hundreds of millions of people moving around the country and visiting family overseas. Farrar said: “Wuhan is a major hub, and with travel a huge part of Chinese new year, the concern must remain high.” New York’s JFK airport, and San Francisco and Los Angeles international airports have started to screen passengers arriving from Wuhan. Chinese authorities introduced exit-screening on flights leaving Wuhan, and authorities in Hong Kong are running temperature checks for travellers from the mainland.Thailand – which has confirmed cases of the virus – announced that it was already screening passengers arriving in Bangkok, Chiang Mai and Phuket, and would soon introduce controls in the beach resort of Krabi. Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Indonesia and the Philippines have all stepped up screening as well.The outbreak was still spreading, said Mike Turner of the Wellcome Trust, adding: “We are more concerned than three days ago. One consequence of a more connected world is that outbreaks have the potential to spread internationally much more rapidly.” But Farrar said that global measures to fight emerging diseases have improved significantly. “The speed with which this virus has been identified, and the sharing of that information by China, has been amazing – a testament to the changes in public health in China since Sars, and the global coordination through the World Health Organisation. That has meant that the world is much better prepared to identify and treat patients.”The Foreign Office said it had updated its travel advice for the Wuhan region, but guidance on visiting China remains unchanged. Most people with the infection are believed to have contracted it at a market that sells seafood and meat in Wuhan. “It is probable that we are looking at patients being affected over a number of days from multiple animal sources and with some degree of human-to-human transmission,” said Farrar."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7ba21eef007d9ad8d2f79eb530bd8eed4288752/3_150_2259_1355/master/2259.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=487ba723fd415b22858f9bd077bb0449","title":"varadkar insists ireland is safe country after week of violent","story":"Ireland’s taoiseach defends record as crime takes centre stage in election campaignLeo Varadkar has insisted Ireland is a safe country following the murder of a teenager and a number of violent crimes in recent days.There has been a renewed focus on crime in the Irish general election campaign after the murder of 17-year-old Keane Mulready-Woods. The teenager was murdered and his body was dismembered and left in various locations in Dublin.Student Cameron Blair was stabbed at a house party in Cork city on Thursday night and two men were injured following a shooting in Dublin on Friday.In a separate incident, two men were injured following a shooting outside a pub in County Clare in the early hours of Saturday.Micheál Martin, leader of opposition party Fianna Fáil, claimed on Friday that the government was losing control of crime in Ireland.The taoiseach defended Fine Gael’s record on tackling crime and insisted Ireland was safe.He said: “Ireland is a country that is safe. Ireland is a country that thankfully relative to other countries has a relatively low crime rate and a relatively low murder rate.“That doesn’t detract in any way from the seriousness of the crimes that we have witnessed in the last number of days, which are unspeakable and are appalling.“Our responsibility as a government is working with the gardaí and others to bring those people who have committed those crimes to justice.“It’s why we’ve put such investment into the gardaí and resources in recent years and why we focused on reducing poverty, reducing disadvantage. And poverty is now down five years in a row.”When asked if Fine Gael had lost control of law and order, he said: “We will have periods where there is a spate of violence as we have seen in the past week but that does not mean that law and order has broken down.“I was talking to a lot of people on the campaign trail in Offaly and Dublin yesterday and there is a real concern and worry in our country at the moment at the spate of violent killings we have seen in recent days – particularly parents are worried about their kids getting caught up in drugs or becoming victims of violence in some way.“I remember back in 2007, we had nearly 70 or 80 murders that year – we are certainly not in that category that we were 12 or 13 years ago but the spate of murders we have had in recent days has worried absolutely everyone and it is our job as a government to get on top of that by supporting the gardaí, by bringing unprecedented resources into the gardaí, reforming our courts service.“I want to assure the people of Ireland that we will get on top of this just as we did with gang related violence in Europe and the north-east inner city. We will get on top of this and the gardaí are getting unprecedented resources from government to do that,” he said.Varadkar said it was not possible for any party to eradicate crime, adding: “Unfortunately we are never going to be in a situation where there is never any murders or never any violence in our society. In 2007 we had 70 or 80 murders that year alone. I couldn’t tell you the figure for last year but it was only about half that.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4144297.1579364427!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"election 2020 kerry constituency profile","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBoth Michael Healy-Rae and his brother Danny are likely to hold their seats.

File photograph: Lorraine O’SullivanWaterford is one of the few constituencies where several of the incumbent TDs and previous strong contenders will not be standing in the upcoming general election, leaving the race wide open for a surprise result. Fine Gael TD John Deasy confirmed last year he would retire from politics after nearly two decades in the Dáil. Minister of State John Halligan, a member of the Independent Alliance, has also confirmed he will not seek re-election. The two sitting TDs in the four-seat constituency running again are Sinn Féin’s David Cullinane and Fianna Fáil’s Mary Butler. Senator Paudie Coffey, who narrowly lost out on the final seat in the 2016 general election to his parliamentary colleague Deasy, announced last December he would not be contesting the upcoming election. Grace O’Sullivan, the previous Green Party candidate in Waterford, was elected to the European parliament last May in the Ireland South constituency. The exodus of incumbents and other well-known candidates from the field will shore up the positions of the two sitting TDs seeking to retain their seats. David Cullinane’s victory last time out was the first time Sinn Féin won a seat in Waterford in more than 90 years. Once elected, he had a high profile as a member of the Dáil Public Accounts Committee. Opposed introduction of abortionButler was also a first-time TD in the 32nd Dáil, and had been one of several parliamentarians in Fianna Fáil to oppose the introduction of abortion.Fine Gael is running Cllr Damien Geoghegan, who polled well in the west of the constituency in the local elections, and Cllr John Cummins. Cllr Geoghegan is the party’s main hope of retaining the Fine Gael seat. The status of University Hospital Waterford (UHW) has been a major political issue in previous elections in the constituency, and will likely heavily feature in the coming campaign alongside wider concerns from voters of a perceived lack of investment in the south east. Independent councillor Matt Shanahan, who is heavily involved in the local campaign for 247 cardiac care at UHW, is seen as the single-issue “hospital candidate”. He topped the poll with more than 1,700 first preferences in a Waterford city ward in the local elections, and is a dark horse in the open contest. Labour Party councillor and current Waterford mayor John Pratt and Green Party councillor Marc O’Cathasaigh also hope to be in contention for the final seat. Whichever candidate can stay ahead of the other as the counts progress would hope to pick up a sizable portion of transfers from the first of the two eliminated. If either candidate were to win a seat, it would represent a big win for Labour or the Greens.

Photograph: Will OliverEPAAn online fundraising campaign seeking to have Big Ben ring to welcome in Brexit at 11pm on January 31st has raised more than £150,000 (€175,000).Stand Up 4 Brexit’s “Big Ben must bong for Brexit” campaign had raised £152,470 of its £500,000 target from almost 10,000 donors on the GofFundMe website by Friday morning.Those who wish to celebrate Britain leaving the EU will want to do so in the same manner as New Year’s Eve – by looking at a clock, the campaign’s organisers wrote online.“The natural choice for this would be Big Ben but because it is currently undergoing refurbishment, special measures would have to be put in place, which could cost up to £500,000,” a statement by StandUp4Brexit founder Rebecca Ryan and Mark Francois MP added.“However, because there is a lead time to make the necessary preparations, we would need to raise this amount by this weekend.”Mr Francois had earlier accused the House of Commons authorities of exaggerating the cost of bringing the bell, which has been silent since 2017, back into operation.In a video posted on the fundraising site, Mr Francois said he was “delighted to announce that our Eurosceptic colleagues from StandUp4Brexit have agreed to host a crowdfunding campaign to help raise half a million pounds so that Big Ben can chime at 11pm on the 31st of January”.He added that the campaign hoped to get contributions “from across the four nations of the United Kingdom, what the prime minister likes to call the ‘awesome foursome’”.Mr Francois said it was “inconceivable” that the clock used to mark the UK’s departure from the EU “could be any other than the most iconic timepiece on Earth, which is Big Ben”.He finished his appeal by saying “please give an amount on this website now so we can properly celebrate becoming a free country again”.They added that “Britons are currently donating more than £80 a minute to the campaign, with an average donation of £16”.British prime minister Boris Johnson had said on BBC Breakfast on Tuesday that the government was “working up a plan so people can bung a bob for a Big Ben bong”.Donations to the campaign include £1,000 from Mr Francois, while business secretary Andrea Leadsom promised £10.There were also small donations from “Dominic Grieve”, “Jeremy Corbyn” and “John Bercow” but these were all thought likely to be fake names.Restoring the bell was discussed at a meeting of the House of Commons Commission on Monday, but it was ruled out after it was revealed it could cost £500,000.Commons speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle, who is chairman of the commission, said: “You are talking about £50,000 a bong.”Whether Big Ben bongs or not, Brexiteers intend to gather outside parliament to mark the UK’s departure from the EU.Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said the Leave Means Leave campaign group had been been given approval to hold an event in Parliament Square on January 31st. “It is a big moment in the history of this nation to celebrate,” he said. – PA"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4142827.1579260255!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk labour party leadership race the five contenders","story":"The five candidates to succeed Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader will face off on Saturday in the first hustings of a three-month campaign that will produce a winner on April 4th. The five MPs – Keir Starmer, Rebecca Long Bailey, Lisa Nandy, Jess Phillips and Emily Thornberry – this week won the nominations of enough MPs and MEPs to get through to the second round of the three-stage contest.The leader will be chosen by all Labour members and registered supporters but candidates must win the support of enough unions and other affiliated organisations or of constituency parties to secure a place on the ballot. They need the backing of two unions and one other affiliated organisation (such as the Fabian Society or the Jewish Labour Movement) making up at least 5 per cent of the total affiliate membership. Or they can make the cut by winning the support of 33 constituency parties, which is 5 per cent of the total.The candidates have until February 14th to win enough support to get onto the ballot paper, which will be sent to about half a million Labour members and anyone who signed up this week as a registered supporter at a cost of £25.The election is carried out under the “alternative vote” system, with voters ranking the candidates in order of preference. If no candidate reaches 50 per cent on the first count, lower preferences are distributed until one of them does.Parallel to the leadership contest, Labour is also choosing a deputy leader under the same rules and procedure.Keir StarmerThe shadow Brexit secretary won the nominations of almost half the MPs who voted in the first round of the leadership contest and is viewed at Westminster as the candidate to beat. At 57, he has been in Parliament since 2015, succeeding the late Frank Dobson as MP for the London seat of Holborn and St Pancras.Before entering politics, he was a barrister and he served as a human rights advisor to the Northern Ireland Policing Board between 2002 and 2007. He became director of public prosecutions and head of the Crown Prosecution Service in 2008, a position he held until 2013.Starmer backed Andy Burnham in the 2015 leadership election but Jeremy Corbyn made him a shadow home office minister. Starmer resigned along with many other shadow cabinet members after the 2016 Brexit referendum and backed Owen Smith’s unsuccessful challenge against Corbyn.As shadow Brexit secretary, Starmer was loyal to the leadership in public, working behind the scenes to shift Corbyn and the Labour membership towards a more overtly pro-Remain position. He is presenting himself as a unity candidate in the leadership contest, calling for Corbyn’s left-wing economic policies to be retained but promising more openness and competence.With the support of Unison, Britain’s biggest union, and of Labour’s environmental affiliate SERA, Starmer is already most of the way towards a place on the members’ ballot and remains favourite to win.What could get in his way is that he is perceived as dull fears that his association with Labour’s opposition to Brexit could be an impediment in the Midlands and the North of England and the eagerness of many party members to elect their first woman leader.Rebecca Long-BaileyThe shadow business secretary is the anointed candidate of most of those around Corbyn, although the leader himself will not publicly support anyone in the contest. After a slow start, her campaign has picked up pace in the past few days and a Survation poll of Labour members this week put her ahead of Starmer.She already has the backing of Momentum, the campaigning group founded to support Corbyn’s leadership, following a poll of its members in which hers was the only name on the ballot. Long-Bailey is also expected to win the support of Unite, the union that is Labour’s biggest paymaster, and her place on the members’ ballot is assured.Aged 40, Long-Bailey was born in Manchester to Irish parents and worked as a solicitor before becoming MP for Salford and Eccles in 2015. An early supporter of Corbyn, she joined his front bench immediately after his election and was also appointed to the National Executive Committee (NEC), Labour’s governing body.The backing of Momentum and Unite will help Long-Bailey steal a march on her rivals in contacting Labour members, whose contact details will not be shared with candidates until a few days before ballot papers are sent out next month. Both Momentum and Unite have extensive databases of their own, as well as the infrastructure and volunteers to make sure that her message reaches the membership early and often.That message is one of unswerving loyalty to the Corbyn project (Long-Bailey gave his leadership 10 out of 10 in an interview last week) and to the idea of Labour as a radical, progressive party.“The British state needs a seismic shock, to prise it open at all levels to the people – their knowledge, their skills, their demands. Proper democracy takes power away from the offshore bank account and places it on the ballot paper, so workers can have more and chief executives less, and we can tackle the climate crisis with a Green New Deal that unites all of Labour’s heartlands,” she says.Lisa NandyThe MP for Wigan has been the breakout star of the first weeks of the campaign, grabbing attention with her analysis of Labour’s estrangement from its old industrial heartland and holding her own in a 22-minute interview with Andrew Neil on Wednesday.At 40, Nandy has been in Parliament since 2010 and has been a backbencher since 2016 when she resigned from Corbyn’s shadow cabinet where she served as shadow energy secretary. She has won the backing of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) and is expected to win the support of at least one other union next week, making her place on the ballot paper almost certain.Her father was a Marxist academic from India and her grandfather was a Liberal MP who became a peer. Before entering parliament, Nandy worked for a homelessness charity and as a policy adviser to the Children’s Commission and the Independent Asylum Commission.Although she campaigned against Brexit in the 2016 referendum, Nandy has consistently argued that the vote should be respected. She was one of a number of Labour MPs who flirted with supporting Theresa May’s Brexit deal, negotiating with the prime minister for hours and making agonised speeches in the Commons but never actually voting for the deal.In 2018, she set up the Centre for Towns, a think tank focused on improving life in Britain’s towns, and she argues that Labour’s route back to power runs through the places the party lost last month to the Conservatives and others it lost long before.“The next Labour leader will have to be up for a scrap – willing to run to the places where we are loathed, take the anger on the chin, and make and win the argument,” she wrote in the .Nandy’s best hope of winning the leadership could lie in winning enough second preferences to put her in the running if neither Starmer nor Long-Bailey wins more than 50 per cent of the votes in the first round.Jess PhillipsThe 38-year-old MP for Birmingham Yardley is one of the most high-profile backbenchers in any party at Westminster after appearances on BBC Question Time and Have I Got News for You and some highly effective and unorthodox interventions in the Commons. Phillips’s high profile has helped to make her a target for abuse on social media, including rape threats.Before entering parliament, she worked for Women’s Aid, which supports victims of domestic abuse, and women’s rights remain at the centre of her politics. A critic of Corbyn’s leadership, Phillips has been outspoken in condemning Labour’s handling of allegations of anti-Semitism.Her campaign slogan is “Speak Truth. Win Power”, and Phillips is presenting herself as a straight talker who does not respect the niceties of political discourse but could discombobulate Boris Johnson at the dispatch box. She will probably need the support of 33 constituency parties to get on to the ballot, and as a figure to the right of most Labour members she is a long shot to win the leadership.Emily ThornberryLong regarded as the favourite to succeed Corbyn, the 59-year-old shadow foreign secretary scraped through the first round with the bare minimum of nominations from MPs. Thornberry nominated Corbyn for the leadership in 2015 and remained loyal to him during the shadow cabinet resignations and Owen Smith’s leadership challenge.But some in Corbyn’s inner circle viewed her with suspicion, and she was sidelined over the past two years as she pressed the party to back calls for a second Brexit referendum. An effective performer at the dispatch box, she was last year pushed out of her role as Corbyn’s stand-in at prime minister’s questions.MP for Islington South and Finsbury since 2005, Thornberry is the most experienced of the leadership candidates, but she cannot expect union support and may struggle to win the backing of enough constituency parties to appear on the ballot."},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons january 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Meghan kept clothes in Canada when she moved to Britain to start new lifeBoris Johnson must have  courage to cut losses on HS2, say ex-head of civil service and retail tycoonMiddle-class high achievers will miss out on Oxbridge places as colleges are under pressure to meet ersity targets, whistleblowers warnChina could harvest UK data if Boris Johnson allows Huawei access, ex Trump adviser claimsBoris Johnson on collision course with big business groups as aides plan to ditch two-year hiatus before new immigration rulesLive band to lead crowds in chorus of national anthem booked for Brexit Day celebrationsThe deal that cuts ties between Royal family and Harry and Meghan - explained in fullDuchess of Sussex: After 72 days of royal duties, will we ever see Meghan at an official engagement in the UK again?Fewer overseas missions could be behind rise in drug taking among army soldiers, say retired military chiefsDivorcee sues top law firm after taking out \u0026#39crippling\u0026#39 loan to pay for legal fight with husbandPearson pulls GCSE textbook following claims that it \u0026#39whitewashed\u0026#39 Jewish historyDavos 2020: Experts to warn of five-fold increase in referrals to psychiatric clinics as bipolar becomes \u0026#39CEO disease\u0026#39More than half of secondary school children served poor quality mealsTavistock is \u0026#39silencing debate\u0026#39 critics say after book removed from libraryTalented university student becomes latest \u0026#39stranded\u0026#39 smart motorway death - two others in comasQueen delivers hardest possible \u0026#39Megxit\u0026#39 as cost of Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s decision becomes clearDuke and Duchess of Sussex unlikely to find respite from paparazzi in North America, media experts warnLegal loophole exposed after activist not prosecuted for \u0026#39planting\u0026#39 tracker on hunt vehicleK-pop dance classes oversubscribed in Britain amid growing popularityJulian Lloyd Webber sounds note of dischord on music charity grantsComment: Wake up Britain – Huawei is a national threatWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sheffields racism classes orwellian attempt silence free speech","story":"I and other silenced students nationwide are setting up free speech societies on campus to re-platform the no-platformedDo you like sushi? Stop touching my hair! Why are you frying a banana? These are just some of the phrases we’re not allowed to utter at Sheffield University anymore. They’re “micro-aggressions” (subtly racist remarks), apparently. This Russell Group university is paying 20 students £9.34 an hour to be “race equality champions” and police their peers’ thoughts. They will teach classes that explain how to lead healthy conversations so we are not at risk of saying something that might offend. I began my politics degree at Sheffield hoping to find reasoned debate, and the embrace of opposing views. Instead, I entered an atmosphere rife with woke, intolerant, censorious anti-intellectualism.Vice-chancellor Koen Lamberts and the students’ union leaders behind these “micro-aggressions” classes are too immersed in virtue-signalling to realise their absurdity. I’m not a racist, but because I’m white, on campus I’m told I must need education to counteract my allegedly innate racist tendencies. But of course, by this flawed logic I’m unable ever to encounter racism because only discrimination against BME people is deemed legitimate.Offence is in the eye of the beholder, but Sheffield University sees it as a rule. It is as yet unclear how “micro-aggressors” will be identified or whether such allegations will warrant a disciplinary investigation, or indeed, which department will house the gulag. It’s a clever tactic by the commissars, sorry, university officials, to whip up a false sense of victimhood, then bring in Soviet-esque policies under the cloak of a knowledge hierarchy. The extent to which these students’ unions are really “anti-racist”, as they claim, was revealed when they wailed and protested over the EHRC report including a finding that nine per cent of White British students have experienced racism. That doesn’t fit the script.It is the latest in the march towards a toxic “cancel culture” at Sheffield University. When I unloaded my bags in freshers week three years ago, I sported a Jeremy Corbyn T-shirt. Now, that thought repels me. The campus zealots have put me off the Left for life. Shortly after writing in the  about my lecturers blocking students from crossing picket lines to attend classes in March 2018, I was hauled before senior staff members in my department and shouted at, told I had shamed the department. They later apologised, but it was a foretaste of things to come.My university announced compulsory climate change lectures for all students in September, the same month that bosses brought in gender-neutral toilets on SU club nights, without telling anyone the single-sex toilets had vanished. The students’ union organised meetings to shift from being “simply non-racist to actively anti-racist” in October - and banned white students from attending. I dared to challenge this screeching paradox and the mob pounced on me online. I expect pronoun lectures to pop up on my timetable next week.It’s a culture of compliance on campus where your voice is only permitted if you’re a self-identified minority, or politically correct. Most students can see the madness of the race equality champions and how pathetic this notion of needing a “safe space” really is, but are too afraid to speak out. A teaching assistant confided in me recently that he was being bullied by Marxist lecturers who had complained to senior staff that his views were offensive to them, and had rejected his “Tory” PhD thesis. He said he’s scared here on campus, but would never say so publicly. Our universities may still be revered the world over, but they’ve fallen into the clutches of mob rule. There is a glimmer of hope. Myself and other silenced students nationwide are setting up free speech societies on campus to re-platform the no-platformed the accused “transphobes” and “racists”.I accept my university has cancelled me. But the prospect of the last vestiges of academic freedom crumbling in our seats of learning scares me more than Sheffield’s thought police will ever stifle us.University of SheffieldThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

light artist sues florida based botanic garden copying","story":"An internationally-acclaimed British artist is suing a major American botanical garden for copying exhibitions of his work previously featured at the Eden Project and other locations.Bruce Munro, a Wiltshire-based artist specialising in large-scale light installations, regularly sees his artworks sold and exhibited at prestigious institutions across the globe. But he says a major American botanical garden has now brazenly imitated displays of his work, including those featured at the Eden Project, for an exhibition of its own.The artist has now launched a copyright infringement lawsuit, accusing the Fairchild Tropical Botanic Gardens, near Miami, Florida, of importing and displaying knock-off versions of his lights purchased from a Chinese company, G-Light, in its winter light exhibition, The NightGarden.The lawsuit was filed in a Miami court earlier this month and names Fairchild, its chief operating officer Nanette Zapata, two Los Angeles companies that produced the display and G-Light as defendants in the suit.Bruce Munro\u0026#39s fibre optic \u0026#39Light Shower\u0026#39 installation in the Spire Crossing of Salisbury Cathedral Munro said he was taking legal action to stand up to unsavoury business people for the sake of artists who are unable to protect themselves.Like so many artists, my heart and soul goes into each piece I create, so it deeply troubles me that others would duplicate and diminish my work in this way, he told The .I hope that by standing up against this sort of rampant exploitation, it will dissuade unsavory business people from continuing to very blatantly copy an artist’s work and also help protect those artists who may be unable to readily protect themselves. Munro\u0026#39s \u0026#34Field of Light\u0026#34 display has been drawing tens of thousands of visitors to Paso Robles, CaliforniaPreviously described as something of a rock star in the art world, Munro\u0027s previous light displays have drawn crowds of hundreds of thousands.In the lawsuit, Munro\u0027s legal team compared the artist\u0027s popularity to that of the rock band The Rolling Stones, as they seek $150,000 (£115,000) in damages, in addition to any profits generated by the NightGarden display and the payment of his legal fees.The lawyers argued that Fairchild’s NightGarden display shares “substantial” similarities to his exhibitions at the Eden Project in Cornwall, Waddesdon Manor in Buckinghamshire and Longwood Gardens in Pennsylvania, among others.Bruce Munro demonstrates his \u0026#39Star-Turn\u0026#39 installation in front of the Holburne Museum in BathMunro\u0027s legal team added that they sent the botanical garden a cease and desist notice, but the organisation ploughed ahead with the event, which was open to the public from November 15 to January 12.The filing stated that there is no doubt Fairchild was familiar with Munro\u0027s work, since it had previously contacted the artist to express an interest in hosting one of his exhibitions. Munro\u0027s legal team also accused G-Light of commercial exploitation in the filing, saying the company even advertises its products as Bruce Munro style, despite the fact the replicas were unauthorised.The court filing included images of G-Light\u0027s replicas of Munro\u0027s works, including the Water Towers previously on display at Salisbury Cathedral, available for purchase on the online retail platform Alibaba.Fairchild, The NightGarden, G-Light and Kilburn Live all declined to comment

sunnis fought americans now begging us stay","story":"Iraqi demonstrators shout slogans during an anti-government protest outside the Sunni Abu Hanifa mosque in Baghdad\u0026#39s Adhamiyah district following Friday prayers As a proud resident of the Baghdad district of Adhamiyah, Mahmoud Obeidi used to revel in its reputation as a hotbed of resistance to Iraq\u0027s US occupation.A wealthy Sunni enclave on the banks of the Tigris, his neigbhourhood was once home to the elite of Saddam Hussein\u0027s Ba\u0027ath Party, and when America invaded in 2003, it was the first district of the capital to rebel.Soon it styled itself the Graveyard of the Americans, with disgruntled ex-Ba\u0027athists mounting daily street battles against US patrols.  When we all lost our jobs after Saddam\u0027s fall, life became very hard for us, said Mr Obeidi, 55, who, like many Adhamiyah residents, was employed in Saddam\u0027s intelligence service. We supported the fight against the US with all our hearts.A decade on, however, Mr Obeidi has become an unlikely voice for Iraq\u0027s US military presence to remain. Pressure on America to leave has grown after the assassination of Iran\u0027s top general Qassem Solaimani, who was killed by a US drone strike in Baghdad two weeks ago. Youths read a newspaper as they sit by graffiti murals drawn by anti-government protesters along the walls of a traffic tunnel at the anti-government protest sit-in in the capital Baghdad\u0026#39s central Tahrir SquareBut a withdrawal is regarded with horror by many Sunnis, who, for all their past quarrels with the US, see it as very much the lesser of two evils compared to Tehran.If the US leaves, we will be an even easier bite for the Iranians, Mr Obeidi, who now scrapes a living running a food stand, told The .We are no big fans of the US, but they should not leave until such time as the Iranians leave us alone.Mr Obeidi spoke out amid a looming showdown over the 5,000-strong US troop presence, whose main base west of Baghdad was targeted by Iranian missiles 11 days ago.Officially, the troops are only in Iraq to help in the ongoing fight against Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil), but in retaliation for Mr Soleimani\u0027s death, Tehran has pressured Baghdad to expel them.Already, pro-Iranian factions in Iraq\u0027s Shia-dominated government have passed a non-binding vote in parliament urging the troops\u0027 expulsion.A mourner walk back from a funeral ceremony for Iranian general Qassem Soleimani, passing graffiti on the wall of the former US embassy in Tehran, IranPrivately, however, Iraqi officials fear a pull-out by Washington will hand Tehran even greater influence over the country\u0027s affairs. That fear is expressed rather more openly in Sunni communities, who make up a third of Iraq\u0027s 38 million population.Having ruled the roost in Saddam\u0027s time, they now claim to be treated like second-class citizens by the Shia majority government. Nowhere is that truer than in Adhamiyah, a once-prosperous district of Beverley Hills-style mansions that used to be nicknamed Chelsea-on-Tigris.During the height of the anti-US insurgency, it also became a sectarian battleground, as local Sunni fighters, backed by extremists from al-Qaeda, waged a savage war of tit-for-tat killings against Shia militias bankrolled by Tehran.By 2007, as the Shia militias began to get the upper hand, the US military built a Belfast-style Peace Wall to keep Adhamiyah separate from neighbouring Shia districts. But while the 12 foot-high barrier has since been dismantled, the memories of that time have stayed.    Nearly everybody in Adhamiyah, for example, has a story about losing a friend or relative to the Shia militias, which were trained and bankrolled by Soleimani\u0027s Revolutionary Guards force.While some parts of Iraq staged public mourning ceremonies for Mr Soleimani\u0027s death, here in Adhamiyah, there was private celebration.Qassem Soleimani helped destroy this country, and turned it into the tail of Iran, said Ayad Salman, who owns a shop in a square in Adhamiyah where Saddam made his final public appearance during the invasion.Saddam looked after us and made Iraq respected by its neighbours - now they are all eating away at us. The US has to stay, as the Iraqi government is now on the side of Iran.It is not just grizzled ex-Ba\u0027athists who rejoiced at Mr Soleimani\u0027s passing. So too did protesters in Baghdad\u0027s Tahrir Square, who have been demonstrating since October for better public services and an end to corruption in government.While the crowds are mainly Shia, more than 450 have been shot dead during clashes with security forces. Washington has blamed some of the deaths on Shia militia snipers, allegedly acting on Tehran\u0027s orders to stop an Arab Spring style uprising.An elderly Iraqi woman, her face covered with a national flag, cries as she watches anti-government demonstrators protesting in BaghdadEverybody was happy about Soleimani being killed, although it would have been nicer if we Iraqis could have done it ourselves, said Salim Sadeq Muassim, a retired soldier.When I heard the news I ran to the shop to buy chocolates to give to everyone in the street. My neighbour even grabbed his Kalashnikov and started firing in the air in celebration. We need US troops to stay because they preserving our soul from militia control - if they left now, the militias would shoot us all here.On Friday night violence in Tahrir Square flared again for the first time since Soleimani\u0027s death, with two protesters shot dead. On a bridge over the Tigris, groups of masked youths hurled petrol bombs at police, who responded with tear gas and stun grenades.They were using live ammunition against us, one demonstrator told the  at a makeshift hospital at Tahrir Square.Sunnis in majority-Sunni cities, such as Anbar and Mosul, have largely been reluctant to take to the streets in huge numbers as Shia Muslims have for fear of being accused of extremism or sympathy with Isil.Some have feared it may send the message they are somehow ungrateful to Iraqi forces, backed by Shia militias, which only two years ago suffered huge casualties liberating the two cities from the jihadists.As of yet, no time frame has been set for any final decision on the US deployment. So far, US officials have rejected the move, pointing out that it could damage the fight against Isis.Iraq\u0027s caretaker prime minister, Adel Abdul Mahdi, who took up his post after his predecessor resigned over the shooting of protesters, said last week that the decision should be made by his successor, who may not be in place for months.Many see that as a simply a way of kicking the matter into the long grass - a fudge that could anger Tehran, but will be welcome in America\u0027s former graveyard in Adhamiyah.We need the US here until we get a leader who can rule Iraq without interference from others, said Abu Mustafa, a cigarette vendor. By that criteria, however, America could be here for many more years to come.Live band to lead crowds in chorus of national anthem booked for Brexit Day celebrationsThe deal that cuts ties between Royal family and Harry and Meghan - explained in fullDuchess of Sussex: After 72 days of royal duties, will we ever see Meghan at an official engagement in the UK again?Fewer overseas missions could be behind rise in drug taking among army soldiers, say retired military chiefsDivorcee sues top law firm after taking out \u0026#39crippling\u0026#39 loan to pay for legal fight with husbandPearson pulls GCSE textbook following claims that it \u0026#39whitewashed\u0026#39 Jewish historyDavos 2020: Experts to warn of five-fold increase in referrals to psychiatric clinics as bipolar becomes \u0026#39CEO disease\u0026#39More than half of secondary school children served poor quality mealsTavistock is \u0026#39silencing debate\u0026#39 critics say after book removed from libraryTalented university student becomes latest \u0026#39stranded\u0026#39 smart motorway death - two others in comasQueen delivers hardest possible \u0026#39Megxit\u0026#39 as cost of Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s decision becomes clearDuke and Duchess of Sussex unlikely to find respite from paparazzi in North America, media experts warnLegal loophole exposed after activist not prosecuted for \u0026#39planting\u0026#39 tracker on hunt vehicleK-pop dance classes oversubscribed in Britain amid growing popularityJulian Lloyd Webber sounds note of dischord on music charity grantsComment: Wake up Britain – Huawei is a national threatMeghan and Harry will need taxpayer funded security \u0026#39for years to come\u0026#39Keyless car drivers face higher insurance premiums if they lack security features amid rise in theft Time for action at school where 13-year-olds couldn\u0026#39t read a clockComment: Race relations must not hinder the warRepublican senators consider turning on Trump as impeachment trial set to startWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/12/16/15/woman-shopping-bag.jpg","title":"sustainability consumption environment fashion production factory","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.From shoes and bags to\u0026nbsphomewares\u0026nbspand electronics, it\u0027s time to start thinking about the environmental impact of all of our purchases, says Esra TurkI have been toying with the idea of giving up new clothes and only going for charity or vintage shop options for some time in order to reduce my carbon footprint.When I heard about the 20 Pledges for 2020 idea, I decided to go for it - and to try something even more challenging.

Extreme downpours in Carlisle in the winter of 2015 saw the previous record flood level being eclipsed by two feetHebden Bridge in West Yorkshire has flooded repeatedly in the past decade, with the worst coming on Christmas Day 2015. Toby Smith of Climate Visuals, an organisation focused on improving how climate change is depicted in the media, says: Extreme weather and flooding, has and will become more frequent due to climate change. An increase in the severity and distribution of press images, reports and media coverage across the nation has localised the issue. It has raised our emotions, perception and personalised the effects and hazards of climate change.Out west in Somerset, floods in 2013 led to entire villages being cut off and isolated for weeksIn summer 2012, intense rain flooded over 8000 properties. In 2013, storms and coastal surges combined catastrophically with elevated sea levels whilst December 2015, was the wettest month ever recorded. Major flooding events continued through the decade with the UK government declaring flooding as one of the nation\u0027s major threats in 2017,  says Mr Smith of Climate VisualsWeather has been more extreme in Britain in recent years. The \u0027Beast from the East\u0027 which arrived in February 2018 brought extraordinarily cold temperatures and high snowfall. Central London (pictured), where the city bustle tends to mean that snow doesn\u0027t even settle, was covered in inches of snow for dayMonths after the cold snap, a heatwave struck Britain, rendering the normally plush green of England\u0027s parks in Summer a parched brown for weeksWorsening droughts in many countries have been disastrous for crop yields and have threatened livestock. In Australia, where a brutal drought persisted for months last year, farmers have suffered from mental health problems because of the threat to their livelihoodEven dedicated climate skeptic Jeremy Clarkson has come to recognise the threat of climate change after visiting the Tonle Sap lake system in Cambodia. Over a million people rely on the water of Tonle Sap for work and sustinence but, as Mr Clarkson witnessed, a drought has severley depleted the water levelIn reaction to these harbingers of climate obliteration, some humans have taken measures to counter the impending disaster. Ethiopia recently planted a reported 350 million trees in a single day Morocco has undertaken the most ambitious solar power scheme in the world, recently completing a solar plant the size of San FranciscoElectric cars are taking off as a viable alternative to fossil fuel burning vehicles and major cities across the world are adding charging points to accomodateCities around the world are embracing cycling too, as a clean (and healthy) mode of transport. The Netherlands continues to lead the way with bikes far outnumbering peopleCycling infrastructure is taking over cities the world over, in the hope of reducing society\u0027s dependency on polluting vehiclesDespite positive steps being taken, humans continue to have a wildly adverse effect on the climate. There have been numerous major oil spills this decade, the most notable being the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010More recently, large swathes of the Amazon rainforest were set alight by people to clear land for agricultureThis decade may have seen horrors but it has led to an understanding that the next decade must see change if human life is to continueIn this decade, humans have become ever more aware of climate change.

Central London (pictured), where the city bustle tends to mean that snow doesn\u0027t even settle, was covered in inches of snow for dayMonths after the cold snap, a heatwave struck Britain, rendering the normally plush green of England\u0027s parks in Summer a parched brown for weeksWorsening droughts in many countries have been disastrous for crop yields and have threatened livestock. In Australia, where a brutal drought persisted for months last year, farmers have suffered from mental health problems because of the threat to their livelihoodEven dedicated climate skeptic Jeremy Clarkson has come to recognise the threat of climate change after visiting the Tonle Sap lake system in Cambodia. Over a million people rely on the water of Tonle Sap for work and sustinence but, as Mr Clarkson witnessed, a drought has severley depleted the water levelIn reaction to these harbingers of climate obliteration, some humans have taken measures to counter the impending disaster. Ethiopia recently planted a reported 350 million trees in a single day Morocco has undertaken the most ambitious solar power scheme in the world, recently completing a solar plant the size of San FranciscoElectric cars are taking off as a viable alternative to fossil fuel burning vehicles and major cities across the world are adding charging points to accomodateCities around the world are embracing cycling too, as a clean (and healthy) mode of transport. The Netherlands continues to lead the way with bikes far outnumbering peopleCycling infrastructure is taking over cities the world over, in the hope of reducing society\u0027s dependency on polluting vehiclesDespite positive steps being taken, humans continue to have a wildly adverse effect on the climate. There have been numerous major oil spills this decade, the most notable being the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010More recently, large swathes of the Amazon rainforest were set alight by people to clear land for agricultureThis decade may have seen horrors but it has led to an understanding that the next decade must see change if human life is to continueThe ethics of production is another reason why I want to think about my choices. Most people have known about child labour in factories for decades. After learning about it, as a small form of personal protest I have refused to own anything Nike since I was a teenager. The factory fire in Bangladesh again brought the horrifying conditions of garment workers to light, however the conditions in factories- as well as our consumer habits - to a large extent, remain unchanged.In terms of the environmental impact of fashion and production, the argument is clear cut: produce less waste less. However, aside from the conditions and pay of workers, I find the ethics a bit more complicated. Businesses provide livelihoods for millions of people around the world, so what impact would a decline have on these communities? I will also try to explore these sorts of contradictions (if that is what they are).I know it will not be easy as I can already anticipate challenges such as buying (and receiving) gifts, socks and underwear, home renovation, cosmetics and many others, but I will try my best.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Great. I mean, it would be nice if they notified me. Forewarned is forearmed. They can do anything now. This could be a deep fake interview for all we know.”Created with Sketch.Marvel films – ranked worst to best Show all 23Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke).

November\u0027s dismal weather will finally change, with drier and colder conditions coming for the start of December, forecasters have saidThere are currently 76 balance transfer deals available, compared to 122 in January 2017, while the longest interest-free period on the market has dropped from 43 months to 29 months. The fees lenders charge to move debt have also increased.“Those consumers who used a credit card to pay for some of the festive season may be looking to acquire a 0 per cent balance transfer card, but if they do then they would be wise to make fixed repayments,” said Rachel Springall, a finance expert at Moneyfacts.“For instance, someone with a £3,000 debt that paid £150 back as a minimum per month would clear the debt in 20 months, but there are cards that can default to a repayment of just 1 per cent plus monthly interest – so their debt would hang overhead for much longer on this basis.”The changes have come partly in response to a crackdown by the Financial Conduct Authority on lenders profiting from customers who are in\u0026nbsppersistent debt and have no plan in place to pay it off.Credit card gambling ban does not go far enough, say campaignersUnder rules announced in 2017, the watchdog required credit card companies\u0026nbspto take steps to help customers repay their balances more quickly and offer further assistance to those who cannot.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailSarah Coles, a personal finance analyst with Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “If you’re a committed ‘rate tart’, regularly shifting balances when the 0 per cent introductory period runs out, you might fall foul of these tightened criteria and struggle to get another deal.“If you apply for cards and get turned down\u0026nbspthis will damage your credit score further, so it’s worth using an online eligibility calculator, which only does a soft search of your credit record so won’t affect your score.\u0026nbsp“If you can’t get a long 0 per cent introductory period, you may want to consider a card that targets borrowers with less impressive scores – which tend to offer less than six months interest-free.\u0026nbsp“However, it pays to take stock more generally. Shifting from one 0 per cent deal to another risks racking up transfer fees, and unless you’re very disciplined it can tempt to you keep building more and more debt. If instead of gradually paying the debt down\u0026nbspyou’re seeing the balances increase, you need to make a change\u0026nbspand reconsider your spending habits so you can start paying it back before your debt becomes a problem.\u0026nbspFather in credit card debt jumps off roof with daughter, wife followsBritish Airways fined £183m for data breachSales surge as shoppers defy Brexit woes but credit card defaults soar“Once you’ve drawn up a budget, you can tinker with the spending figures to free up cash to pay down your debts each month. Don’t rely on being committed to manually making the payments, though – it tends to be much more effective to set up a direct debit to repay it straight after payday so you don’t get a chance to spend it.“While you’re repaying your debts, you should try to pay as little interest on your debts as possible. One option is to find a low-interest loan. This has the advantage of being for a fixed sum, so you’re not tempted to dip in over and over again when you’re meant to be paying it off.”The latest figures come\u0026nbspas the government was urged to tackle a sharp rise in the use of expensive consumer\u0026nbspcredit among lower-income households.The Resolution Foundation thinktank found that low income households have racked up borrowing on loans, credit cards and other consumer debt faster than any other group since the financial crisis, leaving them over-exposed to another economic shock.Much of the rise in consumer credit since the financial crash has been on high interest products including store cards and overdrafts charging rates averaging 20 per cent.There were some signs earlier this month that the boom in consumer lending may be drawing to a close, as separate research by the Bank of England showed that UK borrowers made net repayments on their credit cards for the first time since July 2013. The total amount borrowed on credit cards dropped by £600m to £72.1bn. Overall consumer lending is at £225bn.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

New enquires from potential buyers increased, while the number of sellers putting their homes on the market also rose.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“The signals from the latest survey provide\u0026nbspfurther evidence that the housing market is seeing some benefit from the greater clarity provided by the decisive election outcome,” said Simon Rubinsohn, the chief economist at RICS.But he warned that because affordability remained a key issue in many parts of the country, the shift in “mood music” on prices was a concern, particularly with signs of a revival of optimism in London after a period of falling prices.Created with Sketch.UK Housing Crisis: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Members of ‘generation rent’, as the younger generation is often known, are finding it far more difficult to get on the housing market than previous generationsThen chancellor George Osborne visits a Help to Buy housing development in Lewisham in 2014.

It held numerous government construction and maintenance contracts, for many of which the future is still uncertain“This highlights the critical importance of the government addressing the challenge around housing supply, particularly with the gradual phasing out of the Help to Buy incentive,” he added.The RICS survey, based on the opinions of surveyors up and down the country, found that 17 per cent more respondents saw a rise rather than a fall in enquiries from new buyers last month, up from minus 5 per cent in the previous month.Most regions saw interest from new buyers increase, with respondents in Wales and the north east reporting solid growth while enquiries rose in London and the south east after negative results in November.The housing get-rich-quick scheme is dead. And not a moment too soonThe number of transactions also increased, with 9 per cent more respondents seeing a rise than a fall. While a net balance of 9 per cent also reported an increase in new instructions offering some relief from the price pressure, this was concentrated in London and the south, while the rest of the country was flat.A net balance of 61 per cent said they expected prices to increase over the coming 12 months, almost double the 33 per cent balance a month earlier.The upbeat tone will add to the dilemma the Bank of England faces when it decides on interest rates at the end of the month.Earlier this week,\u0026nbspHalifax said house prices rose sharply in December, increasing by 1.7 per cent from the previous month to push the annual increase to 4 per cent. Official figures released on Wednesday showed that prices rose by 2.2 per cent in the year to November, up from 1.3 per cent in October.However, this has been offset by a slew of downbeat data, including a drop in the annual inflation rate to 1.3 per cent from 1.5 per cent last month, taking it further below the bank’s 2 per cent target. The economy contracted by 0.3 per cent in November to leave annual growth at zero.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

November\u0027s dismal weather will finally change, with drier and colder conditions coming for the start of December, forecasters have saidThere are currently 76 balance transfer deals available, compared to 122 in January 2017, while the longest interest-free period on the market has dropped from 43 months to 29 months. The fees lenders charge to move debt have also increased.“Those consumers who used a credit card to pay for some of the festive season may be looking to acquire a 0 per cent balance transfer card, but if they do then they would be wise to make fixed repayments,” said Rachel Springall, a finance expert at Moneyfacts.“For instance, someone with a £3,000 debt that paid £150 back as a minimum per month would clear the debt in 20 months, but there are cards that can default to a repayment of just 1 per cent plus monthly interest – so their debt would hang overhead for much longer on this basis.”The changes have come partly in response to a crackdown by the Financial Conduct Authority on lenders profiting from customers who are in\u0026nbsppersistent debt and have no plan in place to pay it off.Credit card gambling ban does not go far enough, say campaignersUnder rules announced in 2017, the watchdog required credit card companies\u0026nbspto take steps to help customers repay their balances more quickly and offer further assistance to those who cannot.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Shifting from one 0 per cent deal to another risks racking up transfer fees, and unless you’re very disciplined it can tempt to you keep building more and more debt. If instead of gradually paying the debt down\u0026nbspyou’re seeing the balances increase, you need to make a change\u0026nbspand reconsider your spending habits so you can start paying it back before your debt becomes a problem.\u0026nbspFather in credit card debt jumps off roof with daughter, wife followsBritish Airways fined £183m for data breachSales surge as shoppers defy Brexit woes but credit card defaults soar“Once you’ve drawn up a budget, you can tinker with the spending figures to free up cash to pay down your debts each month. Don’t rely on being committed to manually making the payments, though – it tends to be much more effective to set up a direct debit to repay it straight after payday so you don’t get a chance to spend it.“While you’re repaying your debts, you should try to pay as little interest on your debts as possible. One option is to find a low-interest loan. This has the advantage of being for a fixed sum, so you’re not tempted to dip in over and over again when you’re meant to be paying it off.”The latest figures come\u0026nbspas the government was urged to tackle a sharp rise in the use of expensive consumer\u0026nbspcredit among lower-income households.The Resolution Foundation thinktank found that low income households have racked up borrowing on loans, credit cards and other consumer debt faster than any other group since the financial crisis, leaving them over-exposed to another economic shock.Much of the rise in consumer credit since the financial crash has been on high interest products including store cards and overdrafts charging rates averaging 20 per cent.There were some signs earlier this month that the boom in consumer lending may be drawing to a close, as separate research by the Bank of England showed that UK borrowers made net repayments on their credit cards for the first time since July 2013. The total amount borrowed on credit cards dropped by £600m to £72.1bn. Overall consumer lending is at £225bn.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

St Anne’s College must reconsider their decision to mark Annie Rogers’ legacy with an unpaid fellowship, and award the recipients a living wage for the role.”A statement from St Anne’s College said: “Many Oxford and Cambridge colleges offer these fellowships in order to enable early career researchers to benefit from the intellectual and social life of a college.\u0026nbsp“All applicants will already be expected to have a funded post at the university.They added: “The post-holder is not required to undertake any teaching – if they do wish to take up an opportunity to teach, this will be paid at the normal rate. “They will continue in their full-time university research role with no expectation of additional research responsibilities within the college.”University of Oxford\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

One of the tracks on the new record, “Unaccommodating”, includes the lyric: “I’m contemplating yelling ‘bombs away’ on the game like I’m outside an Ariana Grande concert.”The line is followed by the sound of an explosion and Eminem continues to make references to suicide attacks and terrorism.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesEminem was referencing the attack on 22 May 2017, when a suicide bomber detonated an explosive device at an Ariana Grande concert at Manchester Arena, killing 23 people and injuring hundreds.In a statement to BBC News, Burnham said: This is unnecessarily hurtful and deeply disrespectful to the families and all those affected.Created with Sketch.The 50 best albums of 2019 Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The debut solo album of the art-punk pioneer was never going to be predictable, easy-listening. No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”. Death still looms – often in the form of a black dog that follows Callahan around various tracks – but its inevitability seems more of a comfort than something to be feared: “Everybody must walk the lonesome valley,” he sings firmly. “Yeah, they must walk it by themselves.” (RO)Arriving three years after the release of her debut, Nothing’s Real, Shura’s excellent second record is camp and theatrical, pivoting between a big, poppy sensibility and a minimalist, lo-fi one – sometimes on the same track. Lead single “Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands On Me)” is a slinky shoulder roll of a song, laden with passionate blasphemy: “I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine, I know you’re thinking about kissing, too.” It’s laced, too, with piano – an instrument she’d always been “allergic to” before this record – and opulent orchestral strings. (AP)2350 28) Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date. Single “Ready to let Go” is by far the most explicit – a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending orce. He bares his soul on Social Cues, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (RO)Howard listened to Brazilian artist Jorge Ben – “where there’s literally, like, 18 different things happening in the song” – while she was making the album, and it shows. “13th Century Metal” builds like an alarm, while “Baby” is scatty and scattered, like something off The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Sometimes, there is one instrument too many, but usually the components crash together well. (AP)Written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Remind Me Tomorrow shows Van Etten dimming her spotlight on toxicity and instead casting a warm glow behind the record’s psychic overview. As well as expectations of confessional singers, she subverts folk music’s focus on bare-bones songwriting. But the daintiest composition “Stay” is her most perfectly realised yet, over music box chimes and heel-clicking percussion she coos: “You won’t let me go astray You will let me find my way.” After years of making peace with drift and uncertainty, she’s never sounded more sure of anything. (JM)Inspired by the improvisations he was creating while on tour with The xx in 2017, Sam Shepherd found himself making “some of the most obtuse and aggressive music I’ve ever made”. This newfound drive can be heard in singles such as “LesAlpx”, a mind-melting track that climbs breathlessly towards its summit with a pounding bass beat and high, whistling chirps that punctuate the tension. It’s an insight into his brilliant mind and – such is the sheer variety of the album – a way to inspire one’s own imagination. (RO)2750 24) Stormzy – Heavy is the HeadThere are three themes that run through the record: his defiance in the face of doubt the pressure of high expectations and his efforts to lift others up as his success continues to grow. He reminds himself constantly of who he is beneath the gloss that fame has brought: he’s “Rachael’s Little Brother”, “Big Michael”, a guy who likes to watch Avengers and Game of Thrones. All of his best traits are present and correct: sincerity, a smooth flow and forensic-like analysis of societal ills, laced with pathos and humour. The lasting impression is of an artist whose only way is up. (RO)A blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals. Songs such as “All Night” are so candidly carnal it feels inappropriate to listen to them in public notes of riot grrrl, pop and rock come together throughout the record to create something that is, at times, quite striking. (AP)2950 22) Solange – When I Get HomeThe decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)For her fifth studio album, Cate Le Bon went to live in a secluded cottage in the Lake District, where she sang to an empty house and took lessons in wood-carving. Yet her compositions on Reward are lush, warm and whimsical opener “Miami” is resplendent with stately horns and percussion that reminds you of childhood. There’s a fantastic sense of space, too, spun from diaphanous arrangements such as “The Light”, where she meanders delightfully from a clear, lilting call to a deep vocal rumble. It’s an album by an artist intent on readdressing her relationship with her own existence. (RO)Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (RO)Swift’s sixth album Reputation was camp and melodramatic, killing off “the old Taylor” and waging war on anyone and everyone who dared to criticise her. It was sincerity veiled as self-parody, insecurity veiled as breeziness – and all the better for that uneasy paradox. But Lover, her new, seventh album, feels like a partial resurrection of the Swift of old: moony romance and earnest earworms abound. It’s the sound of a singer excited to be earnest again. Taylor Swift is dead. Long live Taylor Swift. (AP)The record is an introspective mix of psychey soul, blues, rock and funk, which skips and strolls and swaggers through its 13 tracks – but it is not simply an exercise in nostalgia. Its influences  decades Gil Scott-Heron, Fela Kuti, Kendrick Lamar and Bobby Womack are all recalled. “I’m not going to have an alter ego, or becomes Sasha Fierce or Ziggy Stardust,” says Kiwanuka. “I can just be Michael Kiwanuka.” With an album this good, it’s hard to argue with that. (AP)On his sixth album, Kano’s powers of observation are at their peak. Home has always been at the heart of his music, so he maintains the close-quarters perspective of his 2005 debut Home Sweet Home the swaggering confidence of that record, though, is replaced by a more thoughtful gravitas. He’s an elder statesman of grime, and you can almost see his furrowed brow and shake of his head on “Trouble”, while the frenetic “Class of Deja”, starring fellow veterans D Double E and Ghetts, reminds the listener how he lit the path for future generations. (RO)3550 16) Hot Chip – A Bath Full of EcstasyLyrically, the band offer up some of their most poignant phrases to date on this – their seventh and best record. Second single “Hungry Child”, a trance-y floor-filler, contains the plaintive, “Dreaming never felt so bad Lonely never felt so wrong before” while, over the shuffling beats of “Echo”, Alexis Taylor sings of leaving your regrets behind while seeming to understand the effort required to achieve this. For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor’s idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul. (RO)3650 15) MUNA – Saves the WorldSaves the World should see MUNA joining the ranks of those who have brazenly borrowed their sound. Lead single “Number One Fan” banishes intrusive thoughts – “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die” – just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek. Elsewhere, they are downright defeatist, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex (“Stayaway”) or reflecting on a lover’s similarity to an adulterous father (“Taken”). “Hands Off”, meanwhile, toys with temptation before slamming the door shut. It is fierce and forthright. (AP)Fans have already drawn comparisons between We Are Not Your Kind and Slipknot’s seminal 2001 album Iowa. While the latter was even heavier (it would be difficult if not impossible to outdo), the sheer ambition on We Are Not Your Kind is just as staggering. If anything, the dynamic created by placing a bigger emphasis on melody allows you to consider everything without being engulfed by noise. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them – this may be one of the band’s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (RO)Each song is titled after a black woman Rapsody admires: Serena Williams, Sojourner Truth, Maya Angelou, Aaliyah, Oprah Winfrey… and for each one she explores these women’s traits, successes and strife. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as “Afeni”, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist’s duty, “as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times”. This is precisely what Rapsody has done, in the most resonant way possible. (RO)There’s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Julia Jacklin’s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum on “Pressure to Party” keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, while “Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You” nails a depth of intimacy while acknowledging relationship ennui. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an’ all: Crushing is a triumph. (HB)Philippakis’s voice is shrouded in the smoke from society’s wreckage. Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in. The debut solo album of the art-punk pioneer was never going to be predictable, easy-listening. No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry.

On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”. Death still looms – often in the form of a black dog that follows Callahan around various tracks – but its inevitability seems more of a comfort than something to be feared: “Everybody must walk the lonesome valley,” he sings firmly. “Yeah, they must walk it by themselves.” (RO)Arriving three years after the release of her debut, Nothing’s Real, Shura’s excellent second record is camp and theatrical, pivoting between a big, poppy sensibility and a minimalist, lo-fi one – sometimes on the same track. Lead single “Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands On Me)” is a slinky shoulder roll of a song, laden with passionate blasphemy: “I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine, I know you’re thinking about kissing, too.” It’s laced, too, with piano – an instrument she’d always been “allergic to” before this record – and opulent orchestral strings. (AP)2350 28) Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date. Single “Ready to let Go” is by far the most explicit – a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending orce. He bares his soul on Social Cues, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (RO)Howard listened to Brazilian artist Jorge Ben – “where there’s literally, like, 18 different things happening in the song” – while she was making the album, and it shows. “13th Century Metal” builds like an alarm, while “Baby” is scatty and scattered, like something off The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Sometimes, there is one instrument too many, but usually the components crash together well. (AP)Written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Remind Me Tomorrow shows Van Etten dimming her spotlight on toxicity and instead casting a warm glow behind the record’s psychic overview. As well as expectations of confessional singers, she subverts folk music’s focus on bare-bones songwriting. But the daintiest composition “Stay” is her most perfectly realised yet, over music box chimes and heel-clicking percussion she coos: “You won’t let me go astray You will let me find my way.” After years of making peace with drift and uncertainty, she’s never sounded more sure of anything. (JM)Inspired by the improvisations he was creating while on tour with The xx in 2017, Sam Shepherd found himself making “some of the most obtuse and aggressive music I’ve ever made”. This newfound drive can be heard in singles such as “LesAlpx”, a mind-melting track that climbs breathlessly towards its summit with a pounding bass beat and high, whistling chirps that punctuate the tension. It’s an insight into his brilliant mind and – such is the sheer variety of the album – a way to inspire one’s own imagination. (RO)2750 24) Stormzy – Heavy is the HeadThere are three themes that run through the record: his defiance in the face of doubt the pressure of high expectations and his efforts to lift others up as his success continues to grow. He reminds himself constantly of who he is beneath the gloss that fame has brought: he’s “Rachael’s Little Brother”, “Big Michael”, a guy who likes to watch Avengers and Game of Thrones. All of his best traits are present and correct: sincerity, a smooth flow and forensic-like analysis of societal ills, laced with pathos and humour. The lasting impression is of an artist whose only way is up. (RO)A blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals. Songs such as “All Night” are so candidly carnal it feels inappropriate to listen to them in public notes of riot grrrl, pop and rock come together throughout the record to create something that is, at times, quite striking. (AP)2950 22) Solange – When I Get HomeThe decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)For her fifth studio album, Cate Le Bon went to live in a secluded cottage in the Lake District, where she sang to an empty house and took lessons in wood-carving. Yet her compositions on Reward are lush, warm and whimsical opener “Miami” is resplendent with stately horns and percussion that reminds you of childhood. There’s a fantastic sense of space, too, spun from diaphanous arrangements such as “The Light”, where she meanders delightfully from a clear, lilting call to a deep vocal rumble. It’s an album by an artist intent on readdressing her relationship with her own existence. (RO)Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (RO)Swift’s sixth album Reputation was camp and melodramatic, killing off “the old Taylor” and waging war on anyone and everyone who dared to criticise her. It was sincerity veiled as self-parody, insecurity veiled as breeziness – and all the better for that uneasy paradox. But Lover, her new, seventh album, feels like a partial resurrection of the Swift of old: moony romance and earnest earworms abound. It’s the sound of a singer excited to be earnest again. Taylor Swift is dead. Long live Taylor Swift. (AP)The record is an introspective mix of psychey soul, blues, rock and funk, which skips and strolls and swaggers through its 13 tracks – but it is not simply an exercise in nostalgia. Its influences  decades Gil Scott-Heron, Fela Kuti, Kendrick Lamar and Bobby Womack are all recalled. “I’m not going to have an alter ego, or becomes Sasha Fierce or Ziggy Stardust,” says Kiwanuka. “I can just be Michael Kiwanuka.” With an album this good, it’s hard to argue with that. (AP)On his sixth album, Kano’s powers of observation are at their peak. Home has always been at the heart of his music, so he maintains the close-quarters perspective of his 2005 debut Home Sweet Home the swaggering confidence of that record, though, is replaced by a more thoughtful gravitas. He’s an elder statesman of grime, and you can almost see his furrowed brow and shake of his head on “Trouble”, while the frenetic “Class of Deja”, starring fellow veterans D Double E and Ghetts, reminds the listener how he lit the path for future generations. (RO)3550 16) Hot Chip – A Bath Full of EcstasyLyrically, the band offer up some of their most poignant phrases to date on this – their seventh and best record. Second single “Hungry Child”, a trance-y floor-filler, contains the plaintive, “Dreaming never felt so bad Lonely never felt so wrong before” while, over the shuffling beats of “Echo”, Alexis Taylor sings of leaving your regrets behind while seeming to understand the effort required to achieve this. For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor’s idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul. (RO)3650 15) MUNA – Saves the WorldSaves the World should see MUNA joining the ranks of those who have brazenly borrowed their sound. Lead single “Number One Fan” banishes intrusive thoughts – “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die” – just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek. Elsewhere, they are downright defeatist, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex (“Stayaway”) or reflecting on a lover’s similarity to an adulterous father (“Taken”). “Hands Off”, meanwhile, toys with temptation before slamming the door shut. It is fierce and forthright. (AP)Fans have already drawn comparisons between We Are Not Your Kind and Slipknot’s seminal 2001 album Iowa. While the latter was even heavier (it would be difficult if not impossible to outdo), the sheer ambition on We Are Not Your Kind is just as staggering. If anything, the dynamic created by placing a bigger emphasis on melody allows you to consider everything without being engulfed by noise. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them – this may be one of the band’s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (RO)Each song is titled after a black woman Rapsody admires: Serena Williams, Sojourner Truth, Maya Angelou, Aaliyah, Oprah Winfrey… and for each one she explores these women’s traits, successes and strife. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as “Afeni”, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist’s duty, “as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times”. This is precisely what Rapsody has done, in the most resonant way possible. (RO)There’s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Julia Jacklin’s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum on “Pressure to Party” keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, while “Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You” nails a depth of intimacy while acknowledging relationship ennui. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an’ all: Crushing is a triumph. (HB)Philippakis’s voice is shrouded in the smoke from society’s wreckage. Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in. Figen Murray, whose son Martyn Hett died in the attack,\u0026nbspcriticised the rapper’s new album, too.Feels like he is piggybacking on the fame of Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber and says distasteful things about other celebrities,\u0026nbspshe wrote on Twitter.Not clever. Totally pointless. And before all Eminem fans pounce on me, I am not interested and will not engage.Grande’s fans also took to social media to call out the rapper.Eminem previously pledged his support to victims of the bombing, urging his fans to donate money to families whose loved ones had died in the attack.Music to be Murdered By is Eminem’s 11th studio album and his first since 2018’s Kamikaze. It is also the rapper’s third consecutive “surprise” album, and features collaborations with Anderson .Paak, Skylar Grey,\u0026nbspEd Sheeran, and the late rapper\u0026nbspJuice Wrld.\u0026nbspThe album was awarded two stars by The Independent’s critic Roisin O’Connor, who said its “bitter diatribes show he is incapable of moving on”.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

New enquires from potential buyers increased, while the number of sellers putting their homes on the market also rose.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“The signals from the latest survey provide\u0026nbspfurther evidence that the housing market is seeing some benefit from the greater clarity provided by the decisive election outcome,” said Simon Rubinsohn, the chief economist at RICS.But he warned that because affordability remained a key issue in many parts of the country, the shift in “mood music” on prices was a concern, particularly with signs of a revival of optimism in London after a period of falling prices.Created with Sketch.UK Housing Crisis: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Members of ‘generation rent’, as the younger generation is often known, are finding it far more difficult to get on the housing market than previous generationsThen chancellor George Osborne visits a Help to Buy housing development in Lewisham in 2014.

And not a moment too soonThe number of transactions also increased, with 9 per cent more respondents seeing a rise than a fall. While a net balance of 9 per cent also reported an increase in new instructions offering some relief from the price pressure, this was concentrated in London and the south, while the rest of the country was flat.A net balance of 61 per cent said they expected prices to increase over the coming 12 months, almost double the 33 per cent balance a month earlier.The upbeat tone will add to the dilemma the Bank of England faces when it decides on interest rates at the end of the month.Earlier this week,\u0026nbspHalifax said house prices rose sharply in December, increasing by 1.7 per cent from the previous month to push the annual increase to 4 per cent.

astronauts to the moon during the Apollo program.SpaceX\u0026nbspis carrying out the procedure in conjunction with Nasa, with both organisations using the data to evaluate whether the spacecraft can

there to be some sort of ignition, and probably a fireball of some kind,” Benji Reed,\u0026nbspSpaceX’s\u0026nbspdirector of crew mission management, said during a press briefing on Friday.“Whether I would call it an explosion that you see from the ground, I don’t know.

will see temperatures drop,” he said.“Tonight will be the coldest night and prone spots such as Benson, Oxfordshire, will likely see the lowest temperatures of -7C – but it will be a widely cold and

Admittedly, they didn’t know the exact terms.”Senior EU figures\u0026nbsphave warned that Mr Johnson’s timetable for trade talks is too short, as the prime minister has ruled out\u0026nbspextending the transition period beyond December 2020.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They’re letting down renters who need their help.”EHS figures show that around 150,000 children are living in homes classed as non-decent in London, another 150,000 in the north, 160,000 in the midlands and 220,000 in the south of England outside the capital.Mr Healey said: “Some of the worst conditions are in areas in the north and the midlands where voters who lent their votes to the Tories will end up bitterly disappointed by a Conservative party unwilling to act on bad landlords.“I’ll keep fighting to drive up housing standards and give all kids a decent start in life.”Licensing for private sector landlords in designated areas was introduced under the Housing Act of 2004, but changes introduced in 2015 mean that councils require ministers’ approval to institute larger schemes.The schemes allow local authorities to inspect properties in the area and enforce compliance with the conditions of the licence, with costs covered by a fee charged on landlords.With the decline of council housing and the increasing unaffordability of home ownership, the private rented sector has doubled in size since 2002 and now covers around one-fifth of households. Councils have reported that the growth of the sector has been accompanied by an increase in problems including poor property conditions, according to the independent review of the licensing system conducted last year for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG).The review\u0026nbspfound that more than 90 per cent of councils operating schemes believed that they were effective in dealing with bad landlords. It called for the licensing system to be retained, and proposed new powers to enforce action where hazards such as excessive cold or faulty electrics made a home unfit for human habitation.But the government has yet to respond to the report, published last June.And Mr Jenrick last week rejected an application by Liverpool to continue with its licensing scheme, the largest in the country, covering 55,000 properties across the whole city.The Mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, said he was “gravely concerned” by the decision.Mr Anderson told The Independent: “A third of children in Liverpool are living in poverty and welfare reforms such as the bedroom tax are pushing more and more families into cheaper rented accommodation.“Landlord licensing has been a foot in the door, giving us the power to get inside properties.“Some of the things we have uncovered have been shocking. It is not uncommon to find unsafe electrics and gas supply, no fire doors and issues with damp and heating. We need more powers to tackle this type of issue and bring landlords to book, not less.“It is not just about raising housing standards, it is about protecting and saving lives. I am gravely concerned about the decision to turn down our application. We simply will not have the resources to proactively protect the most vulnerable in the same way.”In August last year, the MHCLG blocked plans for a licensing scheme to cover 3,000 privately rented properties in Conservative-led Stoke Council, saying it did not meet the “statutory criteria”.\u0026nbsp An application by Newham to renew its scheme covering the whole east London borough was restricted in 2017 to exclude certain postcodes. A scheme in the east London borough of Redbridge was refused in 2015.The ministry said it was considering the recommendations of last year’s review and would respond to them in due course. The department pointed to figures from the English Housing Survey showing numbers of non-decent homes in the private rented sector were down by 15 per cent since 2010.An MHCLG spokesperson said: “Children deserve the best possible start in life, which includes having a safe and decent home – that is why we are committed to driving up standards across the rented sector.“Local authorities have strong powers to enforce against criminal landlords, including civil penalties of up to £30,000 and banning orders for the worst offenders.”David Smith, the policy director of the Residential Landlords Association, said there was “no evidence” that council licensing schemes improve standards.“Licensing is not linked to any kind of inspection of a property and even if it was, very few councils have the resources to do so,” Mr Smith said. “All that happens is that good landlords come forward to be licensed whilst the criminals continue to operate under the radar.“Councils should instead focus on rooting out the crooks who provide sub-standard housing and bring the sector into disrepute. This should include ensuring they use the wide range of data they can already access to find landlords, such as asking tenants to identify them on their council tax returns.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

For how much did they really know about each other before walking down the aisle Prince William apparently advised his more impetuous brother to wait so he could really get to know his American bride first, but Harry took umbrage and didn’t listen.Perhapshe had, he might have worked out in advance that an independent spirit joining such a restrictive institution wasn’t going to end well.Instead, they leapt before they looked and, with the “-month bride” having packed her bags already, have saddled the -year-old Queen with yet another constitutional crisis.Back in , I wrote a piece defending Meghan after she was criticised by old school friend Ninaki Priddy for being “calculated in the way she handled people and relationships” and a “curator of a beautul le”.But following the lavish baby shower, the jet-setting with A-listers and the swt jettisoning of inconveniently outspoken family members, the latter sentiment now rings true.And, of course, becoming a member of the most famous royal family in the world was the cherry on the top of that beautul le.But Meghan soon discovered it was nothing like the membership of her beloved Soho House.The rooms are draughty, the decor chintzy and, instead of reading the morning papers in your cashmere loungewear, you have to rise early, put on a frock and make your way to some rain-lashed outpost to open the new wing of a community centre where “live your best le” sentiments, however well-meaning, aren’t required.Here’s what is required as a member of the British Royal Family: Turn up on time, shake hands, smile, say little more than “have you come far ” Repeat.Not because the royals don’t have anything to say. They do, and air their views in private.But in public, their job is to shine a light on whatever project they’re visiting, not themselves. To show — via action, not virtue-signalling statements — a strong sense of duty.And inthey get to keep their ious mansions, hundreds of staff, personal bodyguards etc without any whf of civil unrest.That’s the deal.But those still in Meghan’s social circle glowingly describe her as organised, focused, and opinionated — very much an independent woman used to having her voice heard.As Prince Harry told courtiers just before their wedding: “What Meghan wants, Meghan gets.”An admirable quality when it comes to breaking through the glass ceiling of corporate le or securing the best table in the best restaurant, perhaps.But the monarchy is an institution steeped in hundreds of years of tradition, and Meghan — who claimed she “didn’t know much” about Harry when they first met — clearly thought she’d mould it to her way of thinking . . . then rapidly discovered that it ain’t for turning.Not that The Queen didn’t try very hard to accommodate the wants and needs of the newly anointed Duke and Duchess of Sussex.Contrary to royal tradition, they were permitted to keep the christening of baby Archie as a private affair and, despite there being a perfectly nice home at Kensington Palace they could have used, a publicly funded, £.million renovation of Frogmore Cottage was authorised.A “cottage” I might add, that used to be five homes but has now been knocked in to one because they managed to dodge the usual ban that prevents such moves because of the UK’s housing crisis.Shortly after, Prince Charles launched his blueprint to try to solve the dilemma faced by millions of young people struggling to find a home of their own. Oh the irony. And after all that, they now want to use it part-time as they flit back and forth across the Atlantic.Meghan is feeling disillusioned and homesick. We get it, and sympathise.But let’s not pretend, as some claim, that she’s been practically pitchforked off this island by racist bigots.This is not a racist country and, besides, the British public initially greeted her engagement and later marriage to Harry with unbridled joy.We love Harry. He’s a thoroughly decent person and deserves particular praise for the work he’s done with the Armed Forces, both while serving and afterwards.No, the disconnect has come from the fact that Meghan is still a Hollywood celebrity at heart and, consequently, never truly settled in her often boring and restrictive new role.She misses the relative freedom of her old le, not to mention her family and friends.Again, we get it. But was it really necessary to flee these shores asescaping for her le Clearly besotted with her, Harry faces the stark decision of giving her what she wants or losing her for ever. Or perhaps he’s genuinely sick of royal le and wants out too.If so, let’s wave goodbye and wish them luck.But. The have-cake-and-eat-it plan to stop being a “senior royal” and just dip in and out of duties that suit them simply isn’t going to work.SussexRoyal — which Harry and Meghan have registered as an official trademark for everything from “emotional support services” to clothing and magazines — is a title and privilege that comes with duties and conditions attached, not a brand, be it charitable or otherwise.The future of the monarchy depends on the goodwill, support and interest level of the public, and a recent survey showed that, while the majority have no issue with their decision to go, they were strongly against any continued taxpayer funding of their lavish lestyle.So— as early indicators go — The Queen allows Harry and Meghan to call the shots while keeping their royal titles, their taxpayer-funded security and an allowance from the Duchy of Cornwall, then one suspects this will be discussed by students for centuries to come as the turning point at which the British monarchy began its steady decline to irrelevance and, ultimately, abolition.MOVIE mega-star Will Smith popped in to the retirement party of a woman he last met  years ago.Anita Scipio was the receptionist at a US radio station when Will arrived for one of his first interviews as a young actor and he’s never forgotten how nice she was to him.“My favorite moments on the road are the ones where I can connect with people like @anitascipio,” -year-old Will told his Instagram followers before he walked in to the station to give her a hug.In the days before social media, someone who worked at his record company Sony told me that whenever he was in town, Will would tour the building, from post room to boardroom, giving time to everyone.He’s that rare creature, a star on screen and off.Some of today’s petulant slebs should watch and learn.FORMER psychiatric nurse Susan Evans is launching a landmark legal case to challenge consent issues around the provision of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones for under-s.She argues that children should be protected from “experimental” and “invasive medical treatment”, not least because “some children are referred despite having autism, being homosexual or suffering some form of trauma or sexual abuse”.Speaking on Radio , she added that children as young as nine were being asked to consent “to a completely experimental treatment for which long-term consequences are not known”.But gender ersity advocates warn that “a loss to trans youth is a loss to all”.Time will tell the outcome of her case but, meanwhile, in unrelated comments, I note that the actor Rupert Everett says he spent most of his early childhood wanting “to be a girl”.He adored his mother, aunt and grandmother, didn’t like men, and adds: “I loved necklaces and bras and all those kinds of things.”Then, when he reached , he “didn’t want to be a girl any more. I really enjoyed being a homosexual”.The case in point, perhaps, for treading very carefully indeed with pre-teens.POLICE officers will be required to have degrees from this year – a move that could remove , recruits from the front line while they complete their studies.Sigh. Really When it comes to tackling crime on our streets, the majority of us want someone on our side who possesses instinct, courage and common sense.Which you either have or don’t regardless of qualications.NATURISTS John and Donna Price have moved from Kent to Lincolnshire for more privacy because they like to barbecue in the nude.“I love a flambeed banana,” says Donna, .Oooer.Aren’t our AEs under enough pressure Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

While I have bought several mobile phones, I have never gone shopping for an entire telecoms network.But surely there must be other potential contractors. Don’t we have a telecoms industry of our own It doesn’t say much for the Government’s privatisation of BTit is not in the running for this sort of work.What about our own Vodafone, which I thought was one of the world leaders in mobile phone technology Evendepriving Huawei of the work meant we had to wait a little longer or pay a little extra to download a movie to our phones, that would surely be a reasonable price to pay for protecting national security.And national security policy really is at stake.Yesterday the US reaffirmed that allowing Huawei to build our G network — even parts of it which are deemed to be low- risk — would be “madness” and could compromise the willingness of the US to share vital intelligence with Britain in future.This didn’t come in one of Donald Trump’s notorious am tweets but from officials working for Matt Pottinger, the US deputy national security adviser, and Robert Blair, special representative for international telecommunications policy.That they took the trouble to visit London to warn of the dangers we could be getting ourselves into ought to be seen as a red flag on Huawei’s involvement in our G network.Surely, the importance of being able to share intelligence with our most important ally should rank above pure considerations of cost.Australia has already blocked the Chinese firm from its G network.Yet here, the head of MI Sir Andrew Parker said he had “no reason” to think Britain’s intelligence partnership with the US would sufferinvolvement from the Chinese firm was given the green light.But Defence Secretary Ben Wallace underlined at the weekend that the US administration has threatened to cut off some intelligenceBritain approves Huawei’s involvement in G.He said: “Those things will be taken into account when the Government collectively decides to make a decision on it.”Our own Government — as it has been doing since Theresa May’s day — insists that only parts of the G contract would be awarded to Huawei.It would not be allowed to work on security-critical areas.But that isn’t good enough. Such is the complexity of modern telecommunications networks that it would be impossible to be sure that systems installed in one part of the network were not enabling data to be obtained from another.Whoever designs and builds a telecommunications system gains the power to interfere with it, or even switch it off, should it feel inclined.Of course, with modern communications a huge amount of damage can be done from afar.Evenwe are confident our broadband network is secure now, we can’t be certain that would remain the case.A company which installs a telecommunications network will necessarily continue to be involved in maintaining and upgrading the network it had designed and installed.We have to be absolutely sure the network is not being used for some underhand purpose.Huawei denies that it is controlled by the Chinese state, and has threatened to sue commentators in France whom it alleges have made that claim.But the precise relationship between Huawei and the Chinese state is hardly the point.What is certain is that China is not a democracy and there is always going to be a security issue when it comes to involving its industrial giants in sensitive work here.We would not allow a Chinese company, say, to build fighter jets for the RAF or to construct our radar defence system.This kind of work is rightly the preserve of contractors on whom we can rely totally, even in times of international conflict.Such is the importance of telecommunications in military and civil defence that we now have to think of mobile networks in the same light.The Government has been warning for years that cyber warfare is the big coming threat.In  it published a Strategic Defence Review which defined cyber attack as a “Tier One” threat alongside terrorism.Last November, the US and Taiwanese held a joint exercise in fending off a major cyber attack on Taiwan.At the time the Taiwanese Cyber Security Agency said it was the subject of an astonishing million cyber attacks every month, half of which came from the Chinese mainland.So why, then, is our own Government even considering commissioning a Chinese company to install a telecommunications network Of course, Boris Johnson is right to make it clear he is not Donald Trump’s poodle.We don’t have to take notice of everything the Americans say, on defence, trade or anything .But when it comes to our closest ally warning us that it might not want to share intelligence with us in futurewe let a Chinese company build our G network, we very much do need to take notice.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He agrees with the broad sentiment which Harry has put forward.It comes just days after the Home Secretary, Priti Patel, said she did not believe the Duchess was a victim of media racism.The Home Secretary said Britain is a “great country full of opportunity” for people whatever their race or background.Ms Patel – Britain’s first female ethnic minority Home Secretary – said she does not think there has been any “racism”.She told BBC Radio  Live: “I am not in that category at all where I believe there has been racism.“I think we live in a great country, a great society, full of opportunity where people of every background can get on in le.”Askedthe media had been racist, she replied: “I don’t think so, no.“I certainly haven’t seen that through any debates or commentary or things of that nature.”Ms Patel, who was born in London to a Ugandan-Indian family, added: “As someone brought up in Britain, as someone from an immigrant background I think Britain is a country of tremendous opportunity.“Everyone has a perception of what they read in the press, but I certainly don’t see that.”"},{"url":null,"title":"harry wake up think what have i done liddle","story":"But that should surely be a fairly simple matter. Harry and Meghan have said they wish to be “independent”. A lot of time has been spent working out how that independence can be achieved.Well, here’s the thing. I have a cunning plan for the Sussexes as to how they might be “independent”.What you need to do is get something called a “job”.If you get one of those they give you money which you can use to buy things — a house, some Pot Noodles, a Hot Wheels car racing set — anything, really, within reason.  Remarkable, isn’t it It probably wouldn’t pay for the £million Canadian mansion Meghan is holed up in right now — but they can always ponce a few freebies off their mega-rich friends.It might not quite cover the legal costs Meghan may incur from her upcoming court case. She’s suing a newspaper and her dad is set to testy AGAINST her.You have to say she has a knack, this lass, of getting on the wrong side of quite a few people.I think it’s fair to guess that the Royal Family are not entirely happy with her right now. So she’s hacked off her new family much as she’s hacked off her own one.It’s no huge surprise they’re both heading off to “Canada” .Meghan seems not to like the UK very much. She doesn’t spend much time in it and my suspicion is that the local people haven’t entirely taken to her.We had a bit of time for Harry, once. He seemed an amiably thick rugger-bugger with a mischievous sense of humour. Not any more, sadly.He seems to spend half of his time crying. And he also seems to have swallowed whole the air-headed, ultra-woke, touchy-feely drivel his we has imported from the United States.Still, we were happy to spend an extortionate sum doing up their “cottage” with the most expensive materials money could buy. And we were delighted to see photographs of young Archie — once we were allowed to by madam.For someone who dislikes the starchy formality of the Royal Family, Meghan displays quite a few airs and graces, doesn’t she Hates being photographed and gets her bullying minders to stop people taking snaps. Loves being photographed when she’s promoting herself or her vacuous ideas.But hey, they love each other and that’s the important thing.Let them move to Canada or LA, where they can jabber to each other about climate change and how everyone who doesn’t like her is racist, until the cows come home.But let them do it entirely independently. No money from the Duchy of Cornwall Estate. No royal stipend. No security staff paid for by the taxpayers, either here or there.Let them be truly independent, which is what they seem to wish for.Maybe they’ll find it liberating. Or maybe in a year or two Prince Harry will wake up and think: Crikey, what have I done.DO you remember when you first had a McDonald’s  I remember very well. I was  and had just come down to London from Middlesbrough.My girlfriend told me about these wonderful things called Big Macs. I tried one – couldn’t believe how delicious it was. So I bought another, and then another.Stood there, stuffing my fat face, eyes wide with delight.As the years go by, the pleasure diminishes a little – there’s nothing better than tasting something delicious for the first time.So lucky, lucky people of Rutland. The UK’s smallest county is to have its first ever McDonald’s.A lot of poncey residents opposed this happening because they said it would “lower the tone” of the county.Now the snobs can find out what they’ve been missing all these years.RIVETED with excitement by the Labour leadership contest  It’s a real humdinger, isn’t it I had rather hoped David Lammy would stand, just to give us all a laugh. Sadly, he’s not going to.Ultra Trot Clive Lewis has pulled out. But Emily Thornberry, above – Lady Nugee to you, you lowly serf – is through to the next round.If she wins it will be the final nail in the coffin of this once-great party.SO, Manchester City’s underperforming stars hired a whole bunch of Instagram “models” to attend a party at some posh place in Cheshire.Flew them over from Italy, shoved them in a hotel, Bob’s yer uncle.The wives and girlfriends of the players were not invited to this party. Lovely bunch, footballers, aren’t they And was all of this sanctioned by the supposedly progressive and right-on manager, Pep Guardiola “That was not what I meant, Senor Aguero, when I said you had to get in the box more often.” HERE is yet another Re-moaner head case for you. Liberal Democrat peer Lord Greaves.He has said he fears Britain will be reminiscent of Nazi Germany when we finally leave the European Union. Yup, that’s a sane and rational judgment, you bearded loon.He added: “People are crying when they go to sleep at night and when they wake up in the morning, and all they get from the unfeeling, hard-headed Tories is moans.“They are feeling a sense of loss which is akin to bereavement, and a grieving process has only just begun.“In these circumstances, triumphalistic behaviour, festivals of Brexit and all the rest will simply make things worse.”Who is crying  What bereavement process  What kind of drugs is Lord Greaves taking Let’s all go round to his gaff on January  with a few cans of Stella and try to cheer him up.A BRITISH mum is leading a fightback against the drive to make our children cretins.The unnamed woman went on Mumsnet to explain that she turns the house wi off at .pm every night.And tells her three kids – the oldest is  – to read a book instead. Good for her. Children seem to use the internet for just three things.Bitching about thots in their school. And sending snap-shots of their genitals to -year-old men who are pretending to be teenagers.THERE was a rather cheering plan to ring out the church bells across the land to mark our escape from the European Union at the end of the month.But a bunch of bishops have said we shouldn’t do that because the bells should only be used to summon the faithful to worship.With the greatest of respect, your reverend, b*****ks. You can tell it’s nothing to do with that by their comments.One said: “Two thirds of the population never voted for Brexit in the first place. It’s deeply isive to ring church bells for something like this.”Yeah, Bish – we have a habit in this country of only counting the votes of people who voted, you mimsy frock-wearing halfwit.Another said: “I think we should be ringing bells on February , not to celebrate Brexit but to call people together to pray for our nation at this critical time.”Ah, go shove your bells up your cassock, you miserable Remoaner God-bothering bores.A UKRAINIAN bloke woke up one morning to discover a large metal nut around his old fella.His we had placed it there during the night to stop him shagging other women. And presumably her.It seems to have worked. He couldn’t get the thing off. So he went to hospital where they removed it with a circular saw which spat out sparks as it tore through the metal.I don’t think his todger will be doing very much at all for the foreseeable future.He should have kept the thing on.

The distinctive peal from its massive, .-ton bell is a part of the soundtrack of our public le.But sadly, it now seems likely that the advent of Brexit will be met by silence from Big Ben.If the parliamentary authorities have their way, no sound will echo from the clock tower on that momentous night.Since , the building has been undergoing a major renovation programme, including the installation of a lt, resurfacing of the dials, and restoration of the clock mechanism.According to the House of Commons Commission, which oversees the Westminster estate, the cost of interrupting this work to enable Big Ben to chime for Brexit would be more than £,.We are told this huge bill arises because of the need to install a temporary floor in the belfry to support the chiming equipment — as well as the impact of delays, for up to four weeks, in the renovation project.In the view of pessimistic officialdom, the whole idea of the Brexit chimes is just too expensive.As Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the new Speaker of the Commons, put it this week, “You are talking about £, a bong.”The arch-Remainers have, predictably, seized on the problem with glee.For them, the entire business is just like Brexit itself — a pointless, costly distraction.That negativity is shared by large parts of the civil service and Westminster establishment.Viewing Brexit with horror, they seek to prevent any inspirational commemoration of the event.So the supposed heavy costs give them the perfect excuse to do nothing, just as they used bureaucratic stalemate to thwart Brexit for years.Indeed, the Big Ben dficulty can be seen as ato Project Fear, once more, where dire financial warnings are deployed to frighten the public into inaction.But the British people did not give in to Project Fear , and they should not be cowered by more alarmism this time.The shrill negative voice of Remainers had dominated for too long.After the decisive General Election last month, that is the noise that should be hushed, not the chimes of Big Ben.Expressions of national pride are a force for benevolence and unity, as we witnessed in the recent cricket World Cup triumph.Despite all the Remainer gloom, there is a tremendous yearning to celebrate British-ness.That spirit can also be seen in the broad popular support for the idea of a new Festival of Britain, in , to extol the values of our nation.Once again, just as with their negativity over Big Ben, the pro-EU brigade sneered at the concept as nothing more than a Festival of Brexit, which could only enshrine entrenched isions.But in reality, just like the successful post-war Festival of Britain in , the  Festival could achieve the very opposite, by enabling us to reconnect with our identity, heritage and future.The same can be true of the Brexit chimes on January . It can be an occasion for joy and openness, not misery and fearfulness.Boris Johnson’s suggestion that the £, bill could be met by an appeal to the public is being scuppered by senior officials.In his usual inimitable style, Boris had asked for crowd-funding citizens to “bung a bob for a Big Ben bong”. There were signs the campaign could be taking off.The passionate Euro-sceptic MP Mark Francois pledged £,, while there was also speculation that millionaires such as Lord Ashcroft and Wetherspoon pub chain boss Tim Martin could make large donations.Officials yesterday said there was “no legal basis” for using public donations. So why shouldn’t the Government chip in  After all, the state is used to bankrolling exceptional national events, often at a far bigger cost.A reported £million went on Meghan and Harry’s wedding in .Most of that was swallowed up by security, but £, alone went on her bridal dress — which is not far off the cost of the Big Ben bongs.Similarly, the bill for the chimes is barely a quarter of the more than £million estimated to be spent on the official London fireworks display on New Year’s Eve.But before any money is handed over by the public or Treasury, the huge potential bill — £, to get the bell to chime, plus the £, cost of delays to the tower’s repair — must be challenged.In all kinds of major projects, because of weak management, contractors and consultants often expand the budgets for their own interests.We have seen that process with the HS rail link, now on course to cost over £billion, while even with the renovation of Big Ben the project’s bill has risen from an original £million to £million.On Tuesday night, one former project manager in Parliament said the estimate for the chimes had been absurdly inflated.“I cannot believe the costs you’re talking about,” he told LBC radio.The can-do, anti-establishment outlook ensured the victory of Brexit. With the same imagination and drive, the campaign for the Big Ben chimes can succeed.In fact, it could be the cue for a string of other celeb-rations across our land on January , like bonfires, fire-work displays or big screen-ings in city squares.But at the centre of it all has to be the Westminster clock tower. As Nigel Farage put it, “If Big Ben doesn’t sound, our country looks like a joke.”The miserabilists and pessimists must not get their way.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We will not dilute our high standards of food safety and animal welfare.“In our forthcoming trade negotiations, this Government will be prepared to walk away from those negotiationsthat is in the national interest.”No added last night: “We have made this commitment a number of times. There will be no reduction in food standards after Brexit”.Meanwhile, Europe’s Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan yesterday tore in to the PM’s hopes of getting a full trade deal with the EU in place by the end of the year, dubbing it “just not possible”.Irish politician Mr Hogan insisted: “Certainly by the end of the year we are not going to get everything that’s in the -page document on the future relationship agreed, because Prime Minister Johnson decided we are going to have everything concluded by the end of the year.”Calling on Mr Johnson to change his mind and agree to extend the transition period for longer talks, he added: “I think we’ve seen that putting ourselves into timelines in the last few years have not been that helpful, especially in the way it played out in the House of Commons”.The skirmish came as German leader Angela Merkel warned Brussels that Brexit is “a wake up call” for the EU.The German Chancellor said she was worried the UK could pose a serious economic threat to the EU, and the bloc has to lt its game to stay relevant.Remainers’ scaremongering over America’s “chlorinated chicken” was a ruse to obstruct Brexit. The left piled in for another chance to attack Trump.But it is simply not a “lower standard” of food, as .million Brits who visit the US each year will attest. US chicken treated with an extremely dilute chlorine solution has a far lower rate of ­salmonella infection than EU chicken.Nor is it credible to complain that the practice disguises unacceptable cruelty in the mass production of poultry, given how blithely we accept our own.Brexit Britain must be open to deals with America and everywhere . That involves importing their produce.Of course consumers must not be exposed to inferior or unsafe grub.But let’s deal in facts, not politically driven hysteria. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There was an almighty crash, it sounded like Armageddon was going on outside.It went very quickly from just normal storm and wind noise to sounding like a freight train was hitting our window.There was a loud crack and the whole house felt like it was buffering.Our bedroom windows have been pushed in, the UPVC support structures are broken and we have fence and roof damage.Well have to pay to for a new fence and we have people from the insurance company coming round later about the other damage.The main thing is that nobody was injured as far as we know but it was really scary while it was going on.Just last month a family feared for their lives as a freak tornado smashed into  homes in Surrey.A spokesman for the Met Office said: We cannot say definitelya tornado formed or not. The weather conditions at this time were conducive to the formation of funnel clouds or tornadoes.Around  tornadoes a year are reported in the UK. These are typically small and short-lived, but can cause structural damagethey pass over built-up areas.The strength of the winds of up to mph shook numerous houses, sending roof tiles smashing to the ground.A ft long brick wall collapsed under the strength of the gusts while fence  were flung through the air.Part of a garden shed that had been picked up by the tornado smashed a hole through the windscreen of a car.Radar images taken at the time suggest the damage was caused by a tornado, and it has been reported to Torro - The UKs leading tornado and storm research group.Among their ranks is weather forecaster Paul Knightley, who works for DTN Weather - the organisation behind the BBCs forecasts.Mr Knightley said: There were big and heavy showers at the time in question and the damage reported does tie up.When damage is in a clear track - as appears to be the case here - it is more often than not the result of a tornado.I would say it is probable there was one here and the the type of damage reported is consistent with weak, low level tornadoes.Its impossible to say what the exact wind speeds were at the time but my guess would be between mph and mph.Annette OFlynn said: Our garden shed was totally demolished in Seaward Avenue. It felt like the whole house moved and it was very scary.Stephen Maskell said: We were woken by something which sounded like an express train thundering past the house and gravel hitting the windows.It bought down our front fence including snapping a concrete post in half, breaking ridge tiles on the roof and dislodging tiles.

As well as frosty mornings, a spot of fog is expected but otherwise Sunday is set to be a beautul day.A cold weather alert was issued by Public Health Englandfrom pm on Sunday to pm on Tuesday and the organisation is urging people to prepare for cold weather conditions and look out for those most at risk.Dr Owen Landeg, principal environmental public health scientist at PHE, said: Below  degrees, changes to the body mean that the risk of strokes, heart attacks and chest infections increase so heating homes to this temperature is particularly important to stay well.Mr Wilson said that northern and western Scotland will see brief showers on Saturday morning before sunnier conditions on Monday morning with temperatures of around C.The top temperatures in south-east England and the West and East Midlands will be around C on Monday, he said.The cold snap comes after Storm Brendan swept across parts of the UK last weekend causing road closures and rail disruption, as well as gales of up to mph.It also marks a change from last month when meteorologists confirmed that a new UK maximum temperature record for late December was set in the Highlands.A temperature of .Cwas recorded at Achfary in Sutherland on December .The reading was validated following a rigorous verication process, the Met Office said.Asked why temperatures have dropped, Mr Wilson said: Its all to do with the pressure pattern and it also depends on how high or low the pressure is.Right now there is cold air sitting directly on top of the UK and there is high pressure coming from the north and the east.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It would be perfect for her, Harry and little Archie.“The neighbourhood is known a haven for wealthy people and has a very laid-back atmosphere. I’m sure they would be very happy there, and they would be welcomed with open arms.”A Vancouver-based property source said: “The house is a real gem in Kitsilano - one of the most desirable neighbourhoods in Vancouver.“The area is particularly sought after by super-rich and image conscious young achievers.“It’s close to Kitsilano beach, which is a very cool spot that does stuff like beach yoga in the summer.“But best of all for Harry and Meghan, it’s quiet and locals respect each other and value their privacy.“They’d fit in very well.”The huge -year-old residence is at the heart of a prized billionaire’s row dubbed “Golden Miles”.Its estate agency description boasts “luxurious living on four expansive levels” and “a sensational indoor outdoor lestyle like no other with incredible walk-out view-side terraces.”A private guest suite has been created on the upper level offering more floor-to-ceiling window views across the bay towards Vancouver’s downtown.Harry, , and -year-old Meghan are set to snap up the property for a knockdown price after new tax rules on top-end homes sparked a  per cent drop in value in the area over two years.Their near neighbours would include Canadian billionaire founder of the uber-trendy Lululemon Athletica yoga gear brand, Chip Wilson, whose mansion is worth £ million.Yoga and pilates fan Meg is known to be a fan of the Lululemon brand.Kitsilano - full of rich and famous “movers and shakers” and particularly popular with trendy tech entrepreneurs - is seen as a perfect setting for her new le.The mansion is far cry from sedate, Grade II listed Frogmore Cottage in the grounds of Home Park, Windsor.The Queen is said to be privately furious at the money spent on Frogmore Cottage renovations following Prince Harry and Meghans announcement they are moving abroad.The royal couple have lived there since their publicly-funded £.million wedding.Taxpayers also shelled out another £.million to fully modernise the historic -year-old property installing luxuries including organic gender neutral paint for Archie’s nursery.Sources claim Her Majesty is angry at the amount spent, now that the couple intend to start a new le in Canada.The couple will lose the £million-a-year from the taxpayer-funded Sovereign Grant as they are stepping down from senior roles.But they are set to bring in millions from lucrative commercial deals, which will be added to their already staggering £million fortune.This comes as they said how they wanted to become financially independent.Despite breaking ties with the royals, its believed they will still be entitled to security, paid for by the taxpayer to the tune of around £,.And its thought theyll keep receiving £million-a-year from Prince Charles through his private Duchy of Cornwall estate.Prince Harry is believed to be worth around £.million and Meghan an estimated £.million thanks to her acting career.On their new website, they talk about their new working model and have hinted at setting up a charity.The website said: The Duke and Duchess of Sussex take great pride in their work and are committed to continuing their charitable endeavours as well as establishing new ones.In addition, they value the ability to earn a professional income, which in the current structure they are prohibited from doing.For this reason they have made the choice to become members of the royal family with financial independence.Their Royal Highnesses feel this new approach will enable them to continue to carry out their duties for Her Majesty the Queen, while having the future financial autonomy to work externally.The duchess is reported to have never been happy at the luxurious home where she has spent only around six months since it was painstakingly refurbished to her taste.And she expected never toto it once her longed-for Megxit deal is finalised after The Sun revealed its staff were being axed.Prospective neighbours of the Sussexes offered words of welcome last night.Local Stephanie Carros, , told The Sun: “I’d be good with it!

It seems like such a waste for them to walk away.This week, Harry launched his Invictus Games with suitably stirring music and a passionate voiceover that showed how much he cares about this terric project, which helps wounded servicemen and women from all over the world.It is such a positive and effective way to give these heroes real purpose. Harry has been the driving force since it was little more than an idea on the back of a fag packet.The next day she made a low-key visit to young girls campaigning to combat climate change.Meghan was relaxed, caring and didn’t look for special treatment.Her visits were without pomp and fuss. You can tell it meant the world to everyone she encountered.She could easily have stayed in her mansion on Vancouver Island, closed the curtains and spent her days being pampered.Instead, she got up off her bottom and tried to do a bit of good for causes she cares about.It is admirable — but would the world have been as interestedthey were just plain old Harry and Meghan, without the aura of royalty And will the world’s Press still give such deserving causes the same level of attention this time next yearHarry and Meghan are no longer members of the Firm I’m not so sure. That’s why I would love them to slam on the brakes and reconsider their position.They can always rehire the staff axed from Frogmore House, especially as a move to Canada as “quasi royals” doesn’t look as welcoming as they first thought.Bedazzled PM Justin Trudeau at first promised that the famed Mounties would provide security and protection, but he has had to embarrassingly roll back on his offer and, while the extremely polite Canadians are happy to have Harry and Meghan as guests, they aren’t so keen on footing the bill to have them there permanently.The Queen would be thrilled to have her grandson back and the chance to get to know her great-grandson Archie properly.She would want to buy him his first pony and watch him learn to ride. He could grow up with his cousins George, Charlotte and Louis and be a proper part of the family.There are obviously tensions, hurt feelings and resentments within this clan. But surely the terribly British passive-aggressive arguments and niggles could be ironed out.It can’t really be too late to wipe the slate clean and start afresh.The first thing to be done is for Harry and Meghan to drop that daft court case against a British newspaper which printed a letter she had written to her dad, after he ­voluntarily handed it over.No one is going to come out of that fight with any dignity, and we don’t want to see Thomas Markle forced to give evidence against his daughter in court. They should concentrate their energies instead on trying to salvage their relationship, though I fear that ship has sailed.And brothers William and Harry need to go for a beer and sort out their gripes.Harry also needs to get back in touch with his old pals, who have been fiercely loyal and deeply hurt at being airbrushed out of his le.Surely an agreement can be hammered out which sees Harry and Meghan able to pursue their own causes without being stled by the Palace hierarchy, but also with everyone singing from the same song sheet and not constantly upstaging each other.I know the Queen wants Harry and Meghan’s new roles to be cut and dried as quickly as possible, with minimum fuss. But maybe what is needed is a bit of breathing space. Harry is due to go back to Canada in a couple of days to be reunited with Meghan and their young son.It might be a forlorn hope, but I would dearly like to see them having a rethink about their future and come back in from the Canadian cold.It would be a shamepride and stubbornness on both sides stopped them as I believe they would still get a warm welcome from the vast majority of us. It’s not too late.CAN we all just take a minute to salute the absolute force of nature that is Sun Online columnist and BBC presenter Deborah James Deborah has just been declared cancer-free – three years after a diagnosis of incurable bowel cancer and being given an EIGHT per cent chance of survival.Deborah is a walking miracle who has rewritten the textbooks and is giving hope to others living with the disease.She is also one of the kindest, sunniest, most decent women I know.She co-hosts the unmissable podcast You, Me And The Big C and is a regular on my TV show, where her funny, honest appearances have saved lives.Deborah takes every chance to spell out the symptoms of bowel cancer and encourage people not to be embarrassed about seeing a doctorthey notice any changes in their bowel movements.She has even laughingly nicknamed herself “Bowel Babe” to sht the silly stigma Brits feel about bums.As a result, people have had cancer detected early enough to get effective treatment, extending their lives.Sadly, Deborah’s heady news does not mean she is cured.This disease can rear its ugly head again, as Deborah knows all too well.But I hope she spends this weekend celebrating with friends, family and a large glass of wine, or by buying herself a sassy outfit and handbag.She’s a true inspiration. I’m proud to know her.She lost st after realising she was too heavy and wanted to be healthier for her son.Being overweight subjects you to all kinds of health problems. It is not about fat-shaming.You need to be sensible and take care of yourself.Adele has grafted to provide for her child and now has literally worked her ar*e off to make sure she is around for as long as possible. Good on her.THE new James Bond film is still a long way off, but speculation about who will succeed pouty Daniel Craig as  is reaching fever pitch.It seems that any cute actor to ever wear a tuxedo could be up for the part. My favourites for the role include Britain’s most handsome man Idris Elba, right – obviously – as well as Scotsman Richard Madden and the delectable Andrew Scott.Andrew was a villain in Bond’s previous big-screen outing, ’s Spectre, but let’s not hold that against him.If EastEnders’ Ben Mitchell can have SIX dferent heads over the years, we can surely ignore the slight inconvenience of Andrew’s scheming tech-terrorist trying to bump off all of MI.James Norton is another contender, but I have taken issue with him since catching up with The Trial Of Christine Keeler on BBC.It’s a slightly schlocky take on the infamous Sixties scandal involving the Tory cabinet minister John Profumo, who had a sexual relationship with Christine when she was just  – at the same time that she was “romantically linked” with Russian spy Yevgeny Ivanov.James plays society osteopath Stephen Ward, who acted as a sort of posh pimp and introduced Christine to Profumo in the first place. He is super-creepy in the series, with an intensely irritating habit of calling Christine “little baby” in almost every sentence.If you watch the show and sink a drink every time he utters those annoying words, you will be sloshed about ten minutes into each episode.It has taken the shine off Mr Norton for me, so I’m afraid he has to go to the back of the Bond queue.I AM convinced that when The Masked Singer’s Octopus character takes off its head, it will be revealed as model actress singer Caprice.I have absolutely no insider knowledge and only say this because Caprice actually released a single in the late Nineties.While doing the promotion rounds, on GMTV she very gamely warbled her song on a freezing beach while wearing not very much – in one of that show’s many fabulously surreal segments.If Caprice could cope with all that, then dressing up as a giant, eight-tentacled creature that can squirt black ink from its bottom would be a breeze.HUGH GRANT, who was absolutely brilliant in Paddington , is entitled to his opinion, like everyone . But I take real issue with him perpetuating the myth that tragic Princess Diana was “effectively killed” by British tabloid newspapers.Diana died in an accident because she was being driven by a drunk and didn’t have her seatbelt fastened. She had been stripped of her HRH title, which meant she didn’t have proper security, while the car was being driven too fast in a bid to elude bottom-feeding French paparazzi.To say the British Press were purely to blame is outrageous. And as Hugh Grant’s accusation went unchallenged during his appearance on US TV, most Americans will take it as gospel.They tend to believe posh actors who speak with cut-glass, upper-class accents.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They had tothey wanted any viewers at all.Without Auntie, I reckoned that naked commercialism would take over and, soon, we’d end up with television like they had in Italy or Spain.Hours of incomprehensible game shows followed by a shouty weathergirl in not much of a bikini.But then along came Volvo sponsors Sky Atlantic with a host of dramas in which a Swedish detective in a jumper would solve crimes by staring into a lake for six weeks. We loved them.And then there was Amazon and Netflix, who realised thatwe were going to give them our money, they’d better bloody well give us some brilliant, intelligent shows in . So they did.All of this meant thatwe had the cash, we could get home after work and watch Breaking Bad or Ray Donovan or Dexter, or The Man In The High Castle or The Last Ship, or Ozark, or a Swedish woman staring into another lake, or Game Of Thrones, or The Sopranos or The Wire or  or ­Billions, or True Detective.Or we could watch a skateboarding duck on The One Show.Then there’s football. Right now,you’re a fan, you must pay BT, Sky and Amazon to stay in touch.That’s expensive, especially as you are also forced to pay your licence fee for a service that offers almost no live football at all. Or decent sport of any kind.To fight back against the onslaught of choice, the BBC has announced that by  . . . ready . . . drum roll . . . two-thirds of its staff will be based outside London.So what  Sure, you can have a technology hub in Newcastle and locate your Sounds app in Salford butall the decisions are still being made in Islington, over a plate of nuclear-free, vegetarian peace kale, it won’t make any dference.The fact is that the BBC is effectively governed by the monoculture that is social media. It’s ­terried of offending Twitter, so it abides by the rules.Far-right politics are bad. Far-left politics are fine. Veganism is good. Donald Trump is not.You get the impression thatthe BBC made The Crown, the Queen would be played by that guy in a wheelchair from Countryfile and Prince Philip by Idris Elba.And all they’d ever talk about, because all anyone ever talks about on any BBC show, is bloody climate change.I know it’s very noble but after a while, it becomes wearing. And I find myself sitting there ­thinking: “Oh for God’s sake, can’t they just have sex ”No. Obviously, no one can have sex on the BBC because a baby might result. And babies need food which, of course, causes global warming.The BBC was set up to “inform, educate and entertain”. Not “lecture, bombard and lecture again”.It’s got to the point now where the only BBC programmes I regularly watch are Pointless and Match Of The Day.I can’t even bring myself to listen to Attenborough any more. In the past, it was: “Look at this amazing fish which can breathe through its anus.”Now, it is: “Look at this amazing fish that can breathe through its anus and which is threatened by climate change.”Soon, it’s entirely possible the licence fee will become voluntary and when it does, the BBC will quickly learn that to ­survive it must make shows people want to watch.That’s people everywhere, not just ­Twitter people in a Shoreditch juice bar.Killing Eve. Fleabag. Earth’s Tropical Islands. More of that.And less of everything .So it’s good to see Meghan’s still working hard on behalf of those with mental-health issues.I’LL be honest. When it seemed likely that Mr Corbyn would win the General Election, I briefly entertained the idea of emigrating.I figured that there’d be no point living in the UKthe Government was going to take all my earnings and savings in tax.I even went so far as to go online and look at properties for sale in Italy. They all looked lovely – old stone farmhouses with pools – and all for less than a one-bedroom flat in Harpenden.But then I started to think: “Hang on. I don’t have any friends or family in Italy, so in about two hours I’d be lonely.”Then, the next day I’d drown my loneliness with a lunchtime drink, and then another.I’d make a rule that there’d be no drinking before , but soon I’d make that am.And within a month, I’d be pouring red wine on my cornflakes. Within a year, I’d be in a hospital trying to say, in Italian, to a doctor: “Please can I have a new liver ”I’m telling you all this because Harry and Meghan probably think le will be peachy by the sea in Canada.But home is where your friends are.And Harry’s friends, at least, are in the UK. He’s going to miss them. A lot. I guarantee it.WE have learned from American news footage that when there’s a small flood or some wind, we must go on the news and wail like stuck pigs about the injustice of it all.It makes me so angry that even my hair starts to itch.So I was delighted this week to see that when some floods came to the area where Jodie Kidd lives, she simply rolled up her trousers and carried on as normal.It does help, mind you, that she’s taller than The Shard.FOR reasons known only to a lunatic, it would cost £, to ring the bell in Big Ben to celebrate our departure from the EU.Hmmm. Seeing as the tower is currently hidden behind a million tons of scaffolding, why doesn’t someone go up there with a CD player and some big speakers We’d never know.THERE was further proof this week that the stock market is mad and everyone involved with it is Wolf Of Wall Street bonkers.Because apparently, City types now give Tesla a higher valuation than Ford and General Motors combined.Even though the electric minnow takes three months to produce what the big boys produce in a week.And is run by a dope enthusiast who calls random strangers “pedos” on social media. And gets away with it.A FRIEND of mine was driving along a dual carriageway this week when his super-green hybrid BMW i decided to have an electric duck fit.The power steering and power brakes both failed and it was only by using Herculean force he was able to coast, eventually, to a halt on the grass verge.He tells me that BMW hopes to have the car back to him very soon.But he’s not sure he wants it.

Not only is Brexit now sailing through Parliament, the Northern Ireland Assembly is back up and running after years in abeyance.Number  is now keen to get on with delivery.Ministers and advisers have been personally reminded that running their departments is far more important than appearing on television or ­talking to the media.Boris wants to restore the kind of Cabinet discipline we haven’t seen since the early Blair years. But moving forward also offers a chance to BRING THE COUNTRY BACK TOGETHER.As Boris’s great hero Winston Churchill used to say: “In ­victory, magnanimity.”At Prime Minister’s Questions this week, he took a much less confrontational style than usual.With everyone apart from the Labour and Scottish National Party leaders, he went out of his way to be generous and not score party-political points.Given that Boris likes to be liked, this is a more natural approach for him than being confrontational with every opposition MP.Boris wants to occupy the common ground. His approach to Brexit night on January  reflects that.Rather than being out with Nigel Farage and Co in Parliament Square, he will address the nation on this momentous moment from Downing Street.I am told the message will be upbeat but he will also try to reach out and reassure those who voted Remain. It would be tempting for Boris to join in some full New Year’s Eve-style celebration. And there are undoubtedly Leave voters who would love him to do just that.The danger is that this might alienate those who voted Remain but who have now reconciled themselves to the result and want to help the country pull together.What is key is that in the coming weeks, the Government shows it knows what it wants to do to improve voters’ lives. Boris must put meat on the bones of his plan to “level-up” infrastructure and opportunity across the country.He must show he knows not only how to keep the ­economy growing but how to get it out of second gear, which it has been stuck in — along with most of the West — since the financial crisis of .The next few months present a remarkable opportunity for the PM. He has a sizeable ­parliamentary majority and a united government, while both Labour and the Lib Dems are absorbed by their own leadership contests.This is his moment to really crack on.THIS week, the European Union Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan said it is “just not possible” to conclude everything on the UK’s future relationship with the EU by the December  deadline for the end of the transition period.But the UK and the EU both agreed to that timeframe in the political declaration.The EU shouldn’t have signed up to itthey didn’t think it was possible to agree things by that date.Boris Johnson is determined not to extend this transition period.He feels the whole process has gone on too long already. So there needs to be some compromise to keep things moving.What is key is that at the end of this year the UK is no longer sending millions to the EU every day the UK determines its own immigration policy and the role of the European Court of Justice in the UK ends on all matters other than the rights of EU citizens.THE Royal Family is in its worst crisis since the death of Diana.By contrast, Boris Johnson is determined to stay out of the current drama.BORIS JOHNSON’S refusal of Nicola ­Sturgeon’s demands for a second Scottish independence ­referendum was definitive.But it will become very hard to ­continue to refuse those callsthe SNP wins a majority at next year’s Scottish Parliament elections, in a campaign dominated by the ­question of whether or not there should be a second referendum.On a list of things that could derail this Government, Scotland is very high up the list.The best way to stop that happening is for the Tories, along with the other unionist parties, to deny the SNP an absolute majority at Holyrood in .That will require the Government to pay more attention to ­Scotland and be more prepared to call out the SNP on its ­domestic policy failures.THE first public hustings of the Labour leadership contest take place today – and the race looks set to be hard fought.A survey this week putting Shadow ­Business Secretary Rebecca Long Bailey ­narrowly ahead has dented the idea that Shadow Brexit ­Secretary Keir Starmer has it in the bag. It doesn’t look like the contest is going to be a particularly comradely affair.The personal jabs are already coming and the election isn’t over until April. Starmer and Long Bailey are the two front- runners. The Tories believe both candidates provide them with opportunities.Long Bailey wants to continue the Corbyn project. She will not bring Labour back towards the mainstream of British politics. Starmer, though, is the architect of the parliamentary manoeuvring on Brexit and the second ­referendum policy that hurt Labour so badly in those Red Wall constituencies lost in the election.As one Tory grandee puts it: “If they go for Keir, they’re locking in a problem with those Leave-voting seats.”The dark horse is Lisa Nandy. She performed best in the hustings for Labour MPs, put in a far better performance with interviewer Andrew Neil than Jeremy Corbyn did and is picking up some interesting endorsements.The longer this contest goes on, the better she will do. But even Nandy is making missteps and ­providing the Tories with ammunition in the event she becomes leader.This week, she defended free movement. She claimed voters in towns of the North and Midlands weren’t really opposed to it.This flies in the face of the fact that so many of these places voted Leave in , then flipped to the Tories in last month’s “Brexit election”.Nandy won’t pay an immediate price for this misstep, as most Labour members are pro-free movement themselves.But her decision to speak out shows how focused the contest is on Labour’s “selectorate” and not the broader electorate.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He wouldn’t have known anything about it.”An ambulance person’s job isn’t just to treat the injured and sick. It is also to bring calm and dignity and counsel the bereaved.A MESSAGE comes though: Seven-week-old child, not breathing. cardiac arrest.I switch on the blue lights and floor it. We can only drive an ambulance mph over the limit, and it’s not a rule that’s usually flouted. But this particular job is a case of b******s to the rules.The baby is seven-weeks-old. It is white, floppy and bleeding from the nose.From arriving at the house to arriving at the hospital takes no more than three minutes.The dad had fallen asleep on his bed next to the baby, rolled over and suffocated it. The mum had been out with friends for the first time since her baby was born.After an hour of treatment, the decision is made to cease CPR. The mum screams again, “No! You can’t stop!” But the baby is dead. There is nothing more we can do.In my  years on the frontline, I’ve seen so many lives lost, but so many lives saved.THERE is a superstition in the ambulance service thatanyone says the word “quiet”, the s**t will ­suddenly hit the fan. So we call it “the Q word”, just as actors refer to Macbeth as “the Scottish play”.But there must have been a lot of ambulance workers forgetting ­themselves of late, because the s**t’s hitting the fan every day.Suffice to say that the state of the ambulance service scares me.When that ambulance arrives, I guarantee you will get the best treatment possible.But will it arrive too late  When I started there was a snooker table in the ambulance ­station.Now the calls wait for us and we don’t have time to go to the toilet, let alone make sure our ambulances are ship-shape.It’s not uncommon to be on a job, open a bag and discover something is missing.A JOB comes on our screen: Child fallen over in shower. Unconscious. I try the door and it’s locked. Suddenly, we hear the thud, thud, thud of big feet thundering down stairs. The door swings open to reveal a burly lad with a limp child in his arms.He says, “There you go, mate”, and shoves the child into my chest, asshe is nothing more precious than a pile of dirty washing. I can tell immediately that the girl, who is about two-years-old, has horrendous injuries.Her face is black and blue, as are her legs. Her eyes are half-closed, her pupils dilated and her breathing is noisy and slow. I hand the patient to my crewmate Paul, who can feel her body clicking, which suggests she also has broken bones. We both know something is seriously amiss, but we can’t say that.The doctors agree with us that the girl’s injuries are non-accidental. A short while later, the man is arrested. At home, I can’t shake the image of the little girl in my arms, covered in bruises, wheezing and gasping for breath. Several days later I heard that the girl had died and the man had been charged with murder.This pushed me further towards breaking point. I became more withdrawn at work. I stopped playing with my kids. I started drinking heavily to combat my anxiety and help me sleep. My doctor was so understanding and supportive. She signed me off work and referred me for counselling.The man changed his plea to guilty of manslaughter. The Crown Prosecution Service accepted he’d lost his temper and violently shaken her. He was sentenced to nine years in prison. It felt like this guy had got away with murder.IT wasn’t until I was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder PTSD that I realised I was vulnerable — and that everyone was. I wrote and posted the first of many blogs, detailing my crash and subsequent road to recovery.I’d been back on the job for a few weeks when my blogs went viral, which was a bit embarrassing. But those blogs, and the responses to them, changed my le forever.Ambulance workers from all over the country sent me emails, thanking me for sharing my story.A COUPLE of months after ing to work, I’m in the ambulance with Paul and a job appears on our screen: Female Bleeding PV .Sprawled in the bath is a woman. There is blood everywhere. My initial thought is that it could be a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. Or maybe it’s a miscarriage.But when I ask the guythere was a risk of pregnancy, he replies that there wasn’t. During his examination, the consultant has discovered a severed umbilical cord and delivered a nearly full-term placenta.Later, I learn that the police did find a baby, in a plastic bag in the hallway. Sadly, it was already dead. I didn’t really discuss the job with Paul.He seemed happy just plodding along and I took that to mean he was a stronger person than me. One evening I received a phone call from my manager.The whole time I’d been pouring my heart and soul into raising awareness of mental illness in the ambulance service, my mate had been sinking into an abyss.I’M tremendously proud to say I work for the service and I have a deep love for the job. It might not be the sexiest occupation, but it’s one of the most rewarding.How many people can say they arrived home late from work or missed their child’s sports day because they were saving someone’s le It’s a tough gig, but someone has to do it. And I’m glad it’s me. I feel like the luckiest man in the world.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The officers kept telling me: ‘We’ll find him, he can’t have gone far, we’ll find him for you.’“They were very reassuring and comforting. I was worried because it was so cold and he didn’t have thick clothing on and I thought he may be scared and tired and hungry.But the police made me feel better. Then suddenly he just appeared in front of me.A helicopter overhead had spotted him sitting near a big block beside some roadworks on the motorway after wandering up and down.”“It was about  am and he was with some officers and he just walked towards me, back to his father, asnothing really had happened and I gave him the biggest hug. I didn’t want to let him go.”The tearful dad added: “That was the best feeling.

The wide-ranging -minute debate in Liverpool was the first of a string of events before nominations from local parties and affiliates close mid-February. Members will then vote for a winner declared on April . Rebecca Long-Bailey, Keir Starmer, Lisa Nandy, Jess Phillips and Emily Thornberry all pleaded for party unity as they stand to replace Jeremy Corbyn. But they clashed on key issues including the anti-Semitism crisis. Here are the  things we learned as they faced off.  Labour leadership candidates issued a plea for party unity.Left-wing candidate Rebecca Long-Bailey told the audience ided parties do not win elections. She said members must not call other members a cult or tell them to F- off and join the Tories. We have to be honest that over the last four years we havenapost been united, she added. Jess Phillips, a prominent critic of outgoing leader Jeremy Corbyn , said the name calling within the party has been horrendous and called for Labour to build a broad team.“Sometimes the membership felt they were not being included and in fact that’s been the case for a long time, she said. Emily Thornberry said Labour members should stop fighting each other and concentrate on fighting the Tories. We need to be in power. The country is crying out for an alternative government and it will not happen unless we are united, she said. Sir Keir Starmer agreed there had been too much ision, adding: We are unstoppable when we are united. Drawing repeatedly on his time as Director of Public Prosecutions he said: “Stop asking the question which bit of the party are you from and start asking - what are you saying. “If we can do it for an election campaign we can do it as a party. I’ve run an organisation where I’ve changed values and culture. You have to model it from the top.” . But they clashed fiercely on anti-Semitism  All five leadership candidates signed the Board of Deputies of British Jewsapos  pledges to deal with anti-Semitism. But the hustings was hit by a row after Jess Phillips took a furious swipe at rivalsapos alleged silence over the issue. The bookiesapos long-shot slammed fellow candidates who she accused of failing to speak up about the partyaposs crisis while they were in the shadow cabinet. Three rivals - Rebecca Long-Bailey, Emily Thornberry and Keir Starmer - are in Jeremy Corbynaposs top team. The fth candidate Lisa Nandy is a backbencher.The Labour Party needs a leader who has spoken out against anti-Semitism, and other forms of harassment in fact, when others were keeping quiet, she said.I donapost remember some of the people here being in that particular room or being in those particular fights. Emily Thornberry and Keir Starmer hit back at Ms Phillips - both insisting they spoke out about the problem. Ms Long-Bailey had already given her answer but has previously said the partyaposs response was not good enough. Ms Phillips also took a swipe at left-wing favourite Rebecca Long-Bailey - who recent polls suggest is in a two-horse race with Sir Keir Starmer. She said she was literally laughed at on the school run about Labouraposs broadband policy - overseen by Shadow Business Secretary Ms Long-Bailey. And she hit out at Ms Long-Baileyaposs plan to replace the Lords with an elected Senate based outside London. Ms Phillips said: Weaposve got to speak the language people speak on the doorstep. No one talks about federalism or wanting this Senate or that Senate. Weaposve got to start talking like people talk, about the things they actually talk about.Deputy leader candidate Richard Burgon declared I have not signed and won’t be signing the  pledges from the Board of Deputies on dealing with anti-Semitism. He said heaposs concerned about outsourcing our complaints procedure and claimed the approach could be marginalising black and LGBT Jewish voices. Fellow deputy candidate Dawn Butler has also not signed the  pledges. She said she wants to see the Equalities and Human Rights Commission report and deal with that first. I don’t want to rush this. It’s too important to rush it - we have to get it right, she said, to huge cheers. . They staked out their positions on Brexit The candidates also clashed on Brexit .Remainer and second referendum backer Ms Thornberry demanded a candidate who had frankly been on the right side all along, while Ms Phillips said Labour could not turn away from Europe. But Ms Nandy said nuance on Brexit had been “airbrushed” out of the debate. Remainer Sir Keir added: We can’t now let Brexit tear our party apart for the next  or  years.” . They all want to take on the media instead of aposwading through s***apos...  Candidates vowed to take on media coverage of Labour - with Sir Keir committing he would not be interviewed by The Sun newspaper. Ms Long-Bailey said she was a victim of smears over her position on abortion and would talk to fair journalists but not others. Ms Thornberry said: The Daily Mail have been employing people full time trying to cut me off at knees. I’ve had a whole van load of Sun journalists turn up at my house at one stage. I’m afraid I have a boring le, there’s nothing  they can do. Ms Thornberry added: Being leader of the Labour Party in opposition is, quite frankly, the worst job in the world.. we have to wade through an awful lot of s***. ... Which asked Jess Phillips to pose with bacon  Jess Phillips had perhaps the strangest interaction with the media so far - when someone asked her to recreate Ed Milibandaposs most famous moment. She revealed: I was asked to hold a bacon sandwich in a photo the other day. I refused.”  Keir Starmer -   Rebecca Long-Bailey -   Lisa Nandy -   Jess Phillips -   Emily Thornberry -   OUT: Clive LewisOdds Jan  from Ladbrokes.

Deputy leadership candidates  Angela Rayner Richard Burgon Rosena Allin Khan Dawn Butler Ian Murray OUT: Khalid Mahmood The final question was what keeps candidates awake at night. And apart from the snoring of Rebecca Long-Baileyaposs husband, the answers were deadly serious.What keeps me awake at night is where this country is going, said Lisa Nandy. She lamented the “collapse of our public services” and the future of her young son: Everything is just so achingly heartbreakingly familiar. I do not want him to be  like I was before he sees his first Labour government. Rebecca Long-Bailey highlighted inequality and the climate crisis, while Ms Thornberry said Labour had to be a “fighting machine”. Keir Starmer said he was troubled by the “frustrations of opposition” adding: I’ve never known a time when we’ve so radically needed a Labour governmentAnd Jess Phillips revealed she was kept awake by an abuse victim who fled to a refuge turned to her before the election to say: I like that Boris Johnson .I think I’ll vote for him. . Jess Phillips and apostough old birdapos Emily Thornberry both think they have the personality to beat Boris Johnson Ms Phillips said she could give no reassurance to people until  now Boris Johnson has a majority - but insisted she was the big personality to take on the PM.Labour could not have “an intellectual argument when Tories are talking about bells, not NHS waiting times, she said. We’ve got to do something bold. And Boris Johnson would be terried to face me. Boris Johnson is scared of what he doesn’t understand, she added. He literally can’t understand what I’m saying sometimes. Ms Thornberry also claimed she had the tough old bird personality to face off against the Old Etonian PM. He is in the end a liar, he is callous, he doesn’t care, he plays at politics, he plays with people’s lives, she said. He has a woman problem - he certainly has a problem with me.But Sir Keir, the architect of parliamentary opposition to Brexit , said: We have got to be a very very effective opposition on this.We’ve got to be seen to be winning the argument.

Richard Burgon was criticised by some members after telling a hustings why he has not signed and wonapost be signing the document. Rival Dawn Butler - Labouraposs Shadow Women and Equalities Secretary - also said she would not sign the pledges, which are backed by all five leadership candidates. The  requests include making an independent provider responsible for complaints, engaging more with main representative groups and not fringe bodies, and banning those expelled over anti-Semitism for le. They also include adopting the full IHRA definition of anti-Semitism without qualication. Left-wing leadership hopeful Rebecca Long-Bailey said today I donapost have a problem with the  requests. Rival Lisa Nandy added the rebuilding of trust starts with these pledges and that starts right now. But Mr Burgon told a hustings in Liverpool: I will support the leader in fighting anti-Semitism in our party and fighting anti-Semitism in society. I do believe, obviously, in working with the Board of Deputies in the fight against anti-Semitism. I have not signed and wonapost be signing the  pledges however, because of some concerns I have. Firstly, Iaposm concerned about outsourcing our complaints procedure and how that would work in practice, so I think that needs clarfiying. But secondly I want to work with the Board of Deputies and all Jewish organisations against discrimination.  Iaposm concerned that the minorities within a minority, whether it be LGBT Jewish people, black Jewish people, Jewish people who are religious minority within that minority, their voices need to be heard as well. We need to listen and act with the whole Jewish community. Mr Burgon added there was no place for anti-Semitism or anti-Semites in our party. Fellow candidate Dawn Butler took a similar view, saying: The EHRCare investigating us at the moment. Itaposs nothing to be proud of. And I donapost want to jump the gun on whatever they come out with. So I havenapost signed the  pledges because I want the EHRC report to be implemented in the party. And then we sit down with the Board of Deputies, JLM, the other Jewish groups, and we have a discussion about where we go next. I don’t want to rush this. It’s too important to rush it and we have to get it right. She added I hate racism and it has to be eradicated and those who are responsible should be booted out.

And racism is the prime suspect. The Royal Family couldn’t get more white and there is no doubt Meghan had some horrible racist stuff thrown her way. Harry spoke of the racial undertones and “outright racism” on social media and online article comments. All that talk of her “exotic DNA” and chimp photos. Many royalists seem to think Meghan should be grateful she was allowed to join in the first place. I have had to deal with my share of racism. I know I’ve had to work harder than others to get the same rewards. But I refused to be a victim. I was born in the s and grew up in the s and s. Racism was in your face – it was acceptable to call me a “p***” to my face, even at work. But I didn’t quit, run away and just drop my responsibilities. I had bills to pay. The best way to deal with ­ignorant people is to stick it out, not run, show them your ability and change their opinion. But it is hard. I also have to accept that as a woman of colour, someone may not like me because I’m a woman and opinionated. Nothing to do with the colour of my skin. Not all Meghan’s critics are racist. If Harry’s new we had been a Kate clone, but had dared to be dferent in other ways, she would be stirring up a hornet’s nest too. But I have been called a racist for daring to say this might not be a race issue. I’ve been labelled “flaky” and “naive” and I am saying it to keep my “white masters happy”. That because I’m not black, I cannot understand what a mixed- race woman like Meghan would be going through. Really  I’d call that racist. And firing back that because someone is “white and privileged” they don’t get it, well that’s racist too.  That’s what happened to actor Laurence Fox on Question Time this week when he waded into the Sussex debate. He claims we are the most “tolerant, lovely country” in Europe. But I say this generation is facing a dferent kind of prejudice – more subtle than when I grew up. It’s called microaggression and it has crept into our lives and conversations – everyday offensive comments directed at a minority group. I get it all the time. The “where are you really from ” awkward stuff.   "},{"url":null,"title":"brave 18 stone landlord wrestled","story":"NewsBrave  stone landlord wrestled burglar to ground and sat on him as we called Darren McKechnie said he acted on instinct when he found a burglar in the Chequers Inn, in Chilwell, Nottingham.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA British rescuer has kept a harrowing diary of efforts to save animals amid Australia’s desperate bushfire crisis. Charity worker Georgie Dolphin joined teams scouring blackened woodland for injured, starving ­creatures to bring to safety. In one gruelling -hour day alone they found  koalas, a wallaby, a kangaroo and a possum and took them to an emergency centre. Georgie, , was spurred into ­action as the world watched in horror while the worst-ever bushfires Down Under killed at least  people and an estimated billion animals. The mum of one was particularly shocked by images of dead animals and torched properties on South Australia’s huge Kangaroo Island, which has been likened to Noah’s Ark for its unique range of wildle. It has been one of the worst ­affected areas and was the scene of a family tragedy when popular Dick Lang, , and his son Clayton, , died fleeing flames. Georgie, normally a Sydney-based campaign manager for the charity Humane Society International, put her le at risk to join relief efforts on the ground for the first time. She is spending two weeks on the island, on which huge plumes of smoke could be seen from space. Georgie, who grew up on a farm in Kintbury, Berks, said: “It’s rewarding but devastating. I know it’s dangerous here but I just had to help. “Those animals are waiting to die, their habitat has been destroyed and they have no food or water. Each creature brings a precious moment as they might be rehabilitated or, with severe injuries, humanely put down.” Georgie is working with disaster relief ­experts Adam Parascandola, Kelly Donithan and five other brave colleagues.  Here, she shares her log from last Thursday giving an insight into their incredible efforts..am We grab breakfast then collect rescue supplies – towels for catching and calming species, washing baskets to transport them, bungee cords to secure them safely in the basket, huge water bottles and tubs to build water stations and a walkie-talkie to keep in touch while scanning the area.am I drive us  minutes to a rescue hotspot our team has come to refer to as “hell” deep within the fire-ravaged plantations. The further we drive, the more devastation we ­witness. Sightings of charred wildle corpses are regular, and smouldering areas still smoking along the roadside remind us of the extent of this disaster. The smell of carcasses is unbearable..am We hit our first destination and navigate a dirt track, winding left and right to avoid the blackened animal bodies dotted along our path. Five minutes later we spot a koala on the ground next to a fallen tree branch in a desperate state. Kelly approaches the koala from behind with a towel. We transfer her to a washing basket carrier, secured with a bungee cord. .am Kelly spots a baby koala on the ground with no mum to be seen. She scoops her up with ease. The baby is completely lost, dazed and starving. .am Another young koala is spotted sitting alone on the forest floor. Kelly passes her to me to hold close. It is the highlight of my day. Another ­precious le saved with high hopes of a future back in the wild one day. She peeps up at me from under the towel with melt-your-heart brown eyes. I feel a duty for us to do all we can for her and her species.  .am Rescue efforts continue and we soon have six koalas plus one wallaby secured in baskets or towels. There’s very little vegetation but some surviving koalas can be spotted perched up trees. If we approach too quickly they are spooked and climb up higher, evading rescue. .am We head to Kangaroo Island Wildle Park where an ­animal triage centre has been set up. In the car we stay silent to ­minimise stress for our rescues. On ­arrival they are gently transferred into ­carriers, noted as HSI rescues, and await their turn for a full medical. There are dozens of staff here, flown in to respond to the huge emergency.pm Back on the trail we spot a ­kangaroo lying still on the ground and think she must be dead, then she tries to get up. We manage to contain her. She has very bad sores and ­injuries on her feet from burns. .pm We find another koala sitting out of reach in a tree in an alarmingly poor state clinging on to a tiny baby. Frustratingly unable to reach her, we note her location and set up a water station nearby, hoping that will help to give her a better chance, alleviating some suffering. We are using time-lapse cameras on the stations and it’s rewarding to see many koalas are accessing them in our absence.  .pm We find a final few casualties and by the end of the day our tally totals  rescues delivered to the Wildle Park. Sadly, the kangaroo could not be saved and had to be euthanised. But there is comfort in her s­uffering being over. Although we are exhausted we feel genuinely ­rewarded at being able to make a dference.

Then police searching for previous owners Patricia and William Wycherley, both missing, arrived to dig up the slabs. And they unearthed the couple’s corpses in a ft-deep grave.

He seems like he was just a normal guy enjoying a few beers and a meal with his pals. The Brook House overlooks Eel Brook Common and is not far from Cha. Harry has been previously spotted sipping pints in London pubs, including the Jam Tree and The Cross Keys in Cha. Last week, Prince Harry and his we Meghan Markle announced their intention to step back from their senior roles in the Royal Family and work to become financially independent.They added they intend to split their time between the UK and Canada. This geographic balance will enable us to raise our son with an appreciation for the royal tradition into which he was born, while also providing our family with the space to focus on the next chapter, including the launch of our new charitable entity, the royal couple said in their official statement.  “We look forward to sharing the full details of this exciting next step in due course, as we continue to collaborate with Her Majesty The Queen, The Prince of Wales, The Duke of Cambridge and all relevant parties.” Meghan, who is currently in Canada without her husband, was spotted driving in a dark SUV and picking up a friend from the Victoria International Airport yesterday afternoon.

But behind the scenes, talks on his and Meghan’s future outside The Firm stalled on their ability to strike big-money deals. A source said their breakaway bid “will take up to six months to get over the line”.  Harry’s breakaway plans stalled – as a video of his final royal outing played a Stone Roses song featuring the line: “I’d like to leave the country for a month of Sundays.” A deal allowing Harry and we Meghan to leave their royal roles and strike commercial contracts worth millions could take “up to six months” to finalise, say sources close to the round-the-clock negotiations. The Queen’s senior advisors have urged a “forensic examination” of any corporate deals for the Sussexes, which sources say will “be carefully considered on their merits and in an agreed framework”.  That framework, sources say, is the sticking point of the talks. After committing to turning down public funds in a move to becoming financially independent, Harry and Meghan could be free to sign deals with global corporations.

I’d get hauled up before the Witchfinder General who’d strip me, searching for the third nipple on which I suckled my animal familiar. Any mole or freckle would damn me so then I’d be trussed up and thrown in a river with a rope around my waist. If I floated, I was a witch and they’d burn me If I sank, I was innocent... though probably drowned. Yet there was still a tiny chance they’d haul me out alive, reputation restored. But this week, when called “a racist witch” I realised there was no way to prove I’m not. A racist, I mean. Because I am a white, privileged woman andI criticise or question a woman of colour – whatever the reason – that is blatant, or at the very least unconscious, racism. And, as a white, privileged, woman and tabloid ­journalist I am doubly damned. This has, of course, been prompted by my opinions about the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and the “abdication” crisis. I’ve had a belly-full of this PAIR of petulant, selfish, ­hypocritical whingers and wrote that they can “bugger off to Canada for all I care” as long as we taxpayers don’t have to pay for it. But that was racial abuse, apparently. I was “bullying a black woman and telling her to get back to her own country”. Some people told me I need to check my privilege. That I’m moulded by ingrained, institutional prejudice, working in a racist media in a totally racist country. How can I NOT be a racist  I am shocked, baffled and utterly outraged at the stream of re-parroted rot being spouted about the supposed ­vilication of Meghan by the media.

At .pm this evening statements from Buckingham Palace and The Queen gave details of the deal struck between the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and the Queen. The victorious central point from Harry and Meghanaposs perspective is that they have been granted permission to step back from their royal duties. They have also been given the green light to spend a majority of their time away from the UK, most likely in Canada. In winning these freedoms however, Harry has had to shed large parts of the royal le he has lived for the past  years. A big change is the way the coupleaposs finances will work. While Harry will still have the multi-million pound inheritance he received from his mother Princess Diana, as well as an undisclosed annual sum from the Duchy of Cornwall, his outgoings will increase signicantly. Not only will they be paying back the £.million of Sovereign Grant that was spent to refurbish Frogmore Cottage , the couple will pay commercial rent on the home when they are abroad. As well as relieving himself of a fair chunk of his fortune, Harry will no longer be able to use the His Royal Highness title that has adjourned him since he was a young boy. Although he will remain a Duke, he will be HRH in name only.  Another key dference for Harry are the patronages that he will be keeping. Both he and Meghan will retain their personal patronages of charities, but the Prince will lose his official association to the military organisations he currently represents. From the Spring he will no longer be a patron of the Royal Marines, the Royal Naval Commandaposs Small Ships and Diving nor the Royal Air Force Honington.  The couple will also no longer go on royal tours. Most recently they went together to South Africa, Malawi, Angola and Botswana. Harry will also spend a lot more time away from his core group of friends and his family when he sets up shop in North America.While the changes announced today signal the start of a new chapter for the royal family, the Queen suggested her affections were unlikely to waver. She said: Following many months of conversations and more recent discussions, I am pleased that together we have found a constructive and supportive way forward for my grandson and his family, The Queen wrote in a statement released at .pm on Saturday.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailThe gym is an ­intimidating place for a lot of us – but paying to join one is not the only fitness option. Statistics show that  per cent of women feel apprehensive about working out in public ­– because of what other people might think. But there’s no need to let your gym fear stop you making healthy habits. Research has shown that exercise can combat mild to ­moderate depression, improve body composition, decrease stress and manage a multitude of blood markers, such as ­cholesterol and AC. It will also reduce your risk of falls, lessen pain and allow you to remain active throughout your le. Here we have put together some top tips on how to get fitter without a costly gym membership.  Use your phone For a gentle ­introduction to exercise, a tracking app such as MyFitnessPal could help. You can set it up with a step target and then, as you walk around, it counts your steps. It is satisfying to see how many calories you burn. And as your fitness levels go up, you can ­increase your step target. Another app, Freeletics, has workouts that require no ­equipment, oryou fancy ­something more gentle, Yoga Wake Up guides you through ­meditations and yoga exercises. The NHS-approved Couch to K podcast is also free to ­download. It guides you through runs, increasing in speed and distance up to km. Dive into the pool As exercises go, you can’t beat a gentle swim to start off your ­fitness regime. It gets your heart rate and ­fitness levels up, but at the same time is low impact, so you are less likely to get injured or pull muscles. Swimming helps to tone, build strength and keeps your heart healthy. As you use so much of your body, it’s very effective at burning calories for weight-loss too. Most pools or leisure ­centres have adult only or ladies only swimming ­sessions so you can feel more comfortable. Clean your house It is a task many of us want to avoid – but by energetically cleaning the house you will ­improve fitness levels.According to experts, ­cleaning can burn  cals per hour. Hoovering, mopping, ­dusting the kitchen cabinets and hauling shopping in from the carall count towards improving your fitness, evenit is only in a small way. And that is far better than no exercise at all.Try ten-minute workouts The NHS has a handy guide on a range of ten-minute workouts you can do from the comfort of your own home. They have put together six workouts to do once a day, each focussing on a dferent area of the body. All of are free of charge, as well as equipment-free. They are available online at nhs.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA police chief has called for an urgent meeting with the commander of an RAF base after incidents of two more cars driving on the wrong side of the road emerged. Footage reported to Northamptonshire Police on Saturday and shows a blue BMW having to brake very sharply on a country road close to RAF Croughton where Mr Dunn was killed. And a separate incident last October involving a driver crashing into a police car near the RAF base where Harry Dunn was killed has prompted the Northamptonshire Police Chief Constable to intervene. The latest footage has now prompted police discussions at the highest level in light of Harry Dunnaposs death. In a statement, the chief constable said: I do not underestimate how much of a concerning incident this was and how much worse it could have been, especially considering the circumstances in which -year-old Harry Dunn tragically died.This is compounded by the fact that yesterday, myself and Police, Fire and Crime Commissioner Stephen Mold were made aware of another incident in Northampton in which a police vehicle was struck in early October by a vehicle also driving on the wrong side of the road. Thankfully there were no injuries. I want to be absolutely clear on the fact that these incidents just cannot keep happening. We know all too well in the case of young Harry just how devastating they can be. Therefore the PFCC and I have requested an urgent meeting with the base commander at RAF Croughton to discuss safety on the roads around the base and I expect this meeting to take place next week. The RAF base became the focus of an international controversy after Mr Dunn died in a head-on collision with a car yards away on August  last year. Harry Dunn, , died after being hit by a car allegedly driven by Anne Sacoolas, who left the country for the US claiming diplomatic immunity. The US State Department said a UK extradition request for Mrs Sacoolas was highly inappropriate and would be an abuse. Mr Dunn was driving a motorcycle outside the RAF base Croughton where Mrs Sacoolasapos husband Jonathan worked as an intelligence officer. Boris Johnson has said the chances of Mrs Sacoolas being extradited to the UK are very low. Before reports of the latest incident surfaced, Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom, the constituency MP for Mr Dunnaposs family, wrote to the commander of the base to ask for an invitation to visit. Mr Dunnaposs mother Charlotte Charles and father Tim Dunn are looking for assurances that safety measures are in place to make sure there are no similar incidents in the future.  Confirming the force had been given the footage, a spokesman said: We can confirm we have received a report of this incident. It falls in the Thames Valley area, but the Chief Constablehas seen the footage. The incident is currently being discussed at the highest level in light of the ongoing investigation in Northamptonshire. Dunn family spokesman Radd Seiger said: Seeing this footage has sent shivers down my spine and made me feel sick. No harm done on this occasion fortunately but that is not the point. I have been urging everyone in authority to take the matter seriously, not only in terms of safety and how we can improve it in relation to helping American drivers adjust to the dferent side of the road, but also ensuring that no one who breaks the law coming off the base is allowed to hop on the next plane home and evade justice as Anne Sacoolas did. Enough is enough. This near miss brings both issues sharply into focus and I now call on the UK Government to take immediate action to ensure the safety of their citizens living in and around these bases but also to make sure that never again will a so-called aposdiplomatapos be allowed to evade justice.

Many of us will remember the daunting feeling of waiting for the examiner to reveal your fate as they counted the tally marks on your test report. In the UK,  per cent of people fail their driving test on the first attempt and more than a million people don’t pass until the sixth try. Where you take your driving test is usually down to where you live but according to new data provided by car company Peter Vardy, anyone taking their driving test in London, Manchester, Liverpool or Birmingham face slim odds of passing. Using the pass rate of each test centre, the study reports that learner drivers trying their chances at winning their license at the Erith Test Centre in London face the worst odds in the country and have just a . per cent chance of passing.  This means that one in seven hopeful drivers fail according to statistics.  Erith is closely followed by test centres in other areas such as Sutton Coldfield, Rochdale, Speke, South Yardley and Wanstead which all have less than an  per cent pass rate for drivers desperate to ditch their L-plates.  Those taking their tests in more rural areas of the UK fare much better and experts suggest that it might be due to the likelihood of driving on quieter roads than the ones found in larger metropolitan areas. Anyone struggling to pass in London or Manchester should perhaps try their fate in Yeovil in Somerset where the local test centre boasts a pass rate of . per cent.  Test centres in Ipswich, Dundee, Ashfield and Durham all have high pass rates too, with each passing well over half of test takers.  Why drivers fail their practical tests is down to a number of dferent factors which y from nerves, to lack of practice, lack of confidence and lack of skill. In a report published by the DVSA, the most popular reason for failing a test is poor observation at junctions and unsatisfactory use of mirrors.  This led , learner drivers to fail between December  and December .  Peter Vardy found that . per cent of Brits found parallel parking the most dficult element of the practical test and this was confirmed by the DVSA who have revealed that the failure to complete a parallel park is one of the top  reasons why learners fail.  The practical exam is not the only element of learning to drive though the theory test is just as important as the practical but unfortunately, . million of us needed three attempts to pass."},{"url":null,"title":"plane 208 board including 27","story":"NewsPlane with  on board including  kids aborts take-off as engine catches fireThe crew aborted the flight to Vietnam at the start of the runway as  people, including  children, were evacuated at Tolmachevo Airport in the Russian city of NovosibirskShareCommentsByWill StewartChiara Fiorillo:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video terried-plane-passengers-saw-engine-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news world-news plane--board-including--\"\" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

However, the best chance of the opening half hour was the Jags#.A lung-busting run from Dario Zanatta nearly paid idends for the hosts but Siegrist#s legs foiled the Canadian inside the penalty area.Paul Watson saw a header drt wide from a Clark delivery before Shankland teed up Glass, only for the -year-old to fire wide once again.Zanatta once more came close on  minutes, this time glancing a Joe Cardle delivery towards goal but into the grateful arms of Siegrist.Just a minute later, the Tangerines No  was again the thorn in Thistle#s side.On his own in the six-yard box, Kenny Miller picked up on Zanatta#s cross only for the big Swiss keeper to pull off a wonder save to deny Miller from close range.Clark forced Fox into action with an audacious effort from some  yards before the former Dundee keeper halted Shankland close in.However, moments later, Shanks wasn#t to be denied his nd United goal of the season.From a Clark corner, the Scotland star had the freedom of the Thistle box to guide a header beyond a helpless Fox for - on  minutes.And Shankland was at the heart of United#s second. Picking up on the ball in the middle of the Partick half, he drove forward and slipped in Glass.The United kid#s cross-cum-shot found Adrian Sporle with the simplest of tasks to tap home unopposed for his first league goal for the club.After a frenetic first period, the second  took a while to get going but it was Ian McCall#s side on the front foot.Just before the hour-mark, the impressive Reece Cole made a powerful run into the box before his effort won the Jags a corner.However, it was United who got the scoring under way in the second half and took control with the first chance of note in the period.And it was that man Shankland again as he went on a terric -yard solo run into the Partick box before calmly slotting beyond Fox for his second of the afternoon and the Terrors# third.Peter Pawlett completed his comeback from injury on  minutes when he replaced Paul Watson.And, just a minute later, his first involvement in the game was to tee up Shankland for his third, completing a perfect hat-trick by thundering a left-foot drive into the top corner to send the ,-strong visiting support wild.One of few worries for United on the afternoon came on  minutes when Clark had to limp off injured, to be replaced by Adam King.Miller netted a late consolation for Thistle on  minutes but Robbie Neilson#s men took all the points and another step towards sealing the title.Partick Thistle XI : FoxWilliamson , Saunders, O#Ware , Penrice Cardle , Bannigan, Cole, Zanatta Jones , Miller.Subs not used: Sneddon , Harkins, Slater and Mansell.Dundee United XI : SiegristSmith, Watson , Connolly, ReynoldsPowers Appere, Glass , Clark , Sporle Shankland.Subs not used: Deniz , Sow, Stanton and Freeman.Referee: Willie Collum.Att: , ."},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey -

Not only that, but we believe we can win it.“Hopefully the players will have the same motivation that I do to win the Scottish Cup.“I am sure they will be fired up for the Scottish Cup this season.“We will face some tough hurdles but we have to make sure we are smart enough with our work on Saturday to get ourselves into the next round.”McInnes has already won the League Cup, having led Aberdeen to the trophy with a penalty shoot-out win over Inverness Caley Thistle in .He has led Aberdeen to the Scottish Cup final but narrowly lost out - to Celtic in the  showpiece at Hampden.It remains an unfulfilled ambition for McInnes to lead the Dons to the trophy that has eluded every Dons gaffer since .Aberdeen spent a week at a warm-weather training camp in Dubai in preparation for facing League One Dumbarton.They ended the camp with a - defeat to Jordanian top-flight side Al Wehdat SC in the United Arab Emirates. The Dons jetted out to Dubai last January to prepare for a cup tie but were held - by lower-league Stenhousemuir at Pittodrie.That forced an unwanted midweek replay away from home that Aberdeen won -.McInnes is well aware of the potential pitfalls against lower-league opposition and will not underestimate the threat of Jim Duffy’s Dumbarton.He is desperate to prevent lightning striking twice against part-time opponents and is determined Pittodrie will not host the shock of the round.The manager said: “We have watched Dumbarton over the last few weeks.“Obviously we are firm favourites, being at home against a lower-league team, but there will be a shock somewhere. We have to do all that we can to make sure that it is not at Pittodrie.“We will give them every respect. We need to bring a performance that we are capable of.”McInnes will come up against experienced gaffer Jim Duffy, the former manager of Hibs, Morton, Falkirk and Dundee.Dumbarton will face the Dons at Pittodrie on the back of a - League One defeat to Falkirk.McInnes said: “We are up against an experienced manager who has been round the block. I am sure he will have no fear coming to us.“I have come up against Jim Duffy’s teams many a time in my managerial career.“He is a manager I have a very high regard for and his teams are always very well organised.”“You can see Jim coaches his teams very well and he gets performances out of them.”"},{"url":null,"title":"a mid argyll rugby blast from the past","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTayvallich reader Donald Carmichael handed in this black and white photograph of a Mid Argyll Rugby Club team of many decades ago.But can our readers name the players  And what background can you give us about this photograph and Mid Argyll Rugby club at the time Contact the Argyllshire Advertiser by email: editor@argyllshireadvertiser with any information."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 27 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLooking back over the last  months, no single story has dominated the headlines in these pages, but there have been important themes.There are the negative trends, of course.

Three events all within a stones throw of Mid Argyll.Jamie Miller was the only local to enter this event, starting his Scottish Tarmac Rally Championshipcampaign for the year in the rapid  Citroen CR. Paul Hunter, swapping his pacenotes for spanners, was on hand to assist Jamie throughout the season. Conditions were said to have been tricky as Knockhill has its own micro-climate, which consists purely of rain, wind, snow, ice, wind and wind. Sadly it wasn#t to be at Knockhill for the team with mechanical failure ending their day after stage two.The first closed road event to take place in England, after the approval of closed road rallying for the UK, was the first event for the famousGTi. Unfortunately for Kirsty Mochrie her licence can only be upgraded to stage events from single venue use when she turns , so it was theof the pairing of Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter to represent Mid Argyll south of the border. The pair, finding the conditions tricky in the narrow lanes after the top seed cars had been pulling mud from verges and ditches, managed to bounce the wee metro over the first loop of four stages until the gearbox had enough on the fth test.Following the cancelling of Inverness# Snowman Rally earlier in the year, this was now first round of the Scottish Rally Championshipfor Dougie Watt and Ian Parker, and it was interesting to say the least. A glance outside in the morning to see about four inches of snow lying on the roof of the MK Escort was a surprise for a start. A very wet and muddy day saw the pair make it to the finish in one piece which is more than can be said for the clutch cable that snapped about one mile into the final stage, however clinching their first class win of the season was the best start to the championship.With Kirsty #Wee Mo# Mochrie in the co-drivers seat in the rapid Corsa of Steven Hay , a fair pace was set by the pair throughout the day sitting as high as th until they unfortunately had to take a split early to save damaging the car. Back out the next stage and still setting a blistering top  pace in the Corsa, including some hang time on both the jumps.Jamie, back out in the fit C, had bad luck once again. This time an overshoot on a square right and a struggle to get the car started again after a stall sadly earned him a stage max on stage two. Still setting top  times on the day he ended nd which was a fair effort when you include a stage maximum time.Ian was out this time with Fraser #Flat oot Fraz# Smithafter winning an entry to the rally at the STRC Awards in January. Flying out the gates and onto their second lap on the first stage then pop, driveshaft burst. Towed in and sorted, both covered in CV Grease, they made it back out for a skid around and on a mission to tear up some old tarmac tyres.The Granite Stages, now held at RAF Leuchars would see Eoghan Anderson make ato the passenger seat for a hurl in the immaculate MK Escort of Martin Murray. Smiling ear to ear all day, with Bill eagerly awaiting histo the service area for the stage report, they finished th overall.Ian was out with Greg Inglisin his fluorescent Orange Lotus Exige and it was eyes on the prize for STRC points for Greg. A clean day saw Greg really getting to grips with the car on some surprisingly fast stages including a tickle of the limiter in fth saw the pair finish third overall.Back together and with the small repairs from the Speyside done it was time for the Furnace MK toto the woods. A steady run over the opening two stages, Dougie and Ian found their feet after the #off# at the Speyside sent them into service lying th. From seeing their overall position they knew they had to get back into it on the next stage, however on the road section to start stage three there was issues selecting gear and the pair decided to call it a day # damage limitation was the right call, as the input shaft was on its last legs.Jamie was back on the pace for this one, setting a th fastest stage time on the opening test. Sitting th overall heading into stage five was impressive given the competition on the day. Bad luck unfortunately, however, was to .Eoghan was again out with Martin in the MK for a blast. Sadly it was an early bath, retired after stage two but again, as always, enjoying every minute while it lasted.The Argyll rally had been known to have rough and challenging stages the previous two years. Not this time. Ian and Dougie couldn#t believe how good the stages were in comparison to previous years, an absolute joy of an event with the Escort not missing a beat all day on its #shakedown# for the big one. Valuable class points added to the scorecard too, with them ending the event nd overall. The rally had struggled with entries this year and will now run in  as a closed road rally, run by Mull Car Club.Team Mochrie were back together for this one in the Mightyagain and Innes was cutting some questionable shapes in the garage, performing his annual Mach rain dance. Taking chunks of time from his first passes of the stages would see them ring the #s neck and clinch th.Jamie#s luck had finally turned, the C singing all weekend and netting him a topper of th overall and th fastest over the final stage too.Duncan Maclean was back in the driving seat with Ian alongside, giving himself and the car a shakedown before Mull. The freshly rebuilt #blue bullet# was looking superb and managed to finish looking just as sweet. A couple of small teething problems were sorted on the day and the new main focus was to have power steering fitted before Mull # poor Dochy lost about a stone over two days with the effort needed to swing the wee pug around the #s and chicanes.In August Dougie and Ian competed on the Vetomies Rally. A national grade event run alongside the WRC Rally Finland event. Three other crews from Scotland also headed over to sample #the fastest rally in the world#. The stages were unbelievable. Fast, cresty, wide, flowing with a brilliantly smooth surface. The whole event was just surreal. The duo finished the event th overall and more importantly the fastest Scottish crew.Once the car had ed from Finland it was quickly jacked up, checked and loaded onto the trailer the same day for the journey north. Due to two DNFson the Speyside and Scottish, Dougie and Ian had to make the trip to be in with any chance of regaining their class lead in the SRC. Ending the day first in the class meant they were heading into the final round with the lead.Jamie was back out for another counting round of the STRC. Enjoying his day and pushing the wee C on in the blistering heat netted Jamie and co-driver Ian Mccullochrd overall. He must have been relaxed in the heat as in between stages he was off with the overalls and on with the baby lotion, topping up the tan.Ian was back out with Greg in the Lotus. Another fantastic drive from Greg, finishing ninth with the championship title race firmly the primary goal.The final round for the MK and an important one # a DNF here could see Dougie and Ian losing the class lead in the championship. A battle with their rival who they had been chasing all season, Paddy Munro, would come down to the last stage, as the pair were six seconds down on Paddy heading into the final test. Probably one of the duo#s best stages all year, the final push to claim the class honours came down to the finish of the last stage on the last rally of the year. One second! They had taken the class win and the championship.The first event this year for Craig Callander and son Ross would see them prepare Craig#s gravel spec Subaru Impreza at the last minute to take on their favourite event. The #Japanese Tractor# was a fair handful, a light steering alignment issue and a boost problem gave the pair some trouble although finishing th overall made up for the hassle. A fair result given Craig#s absence from tarmac for four years.Returning from the shed with his freshly painted Sunbeam was Alister Macarthur, this time with Claire Tilleyalongside. The freshly fettled #beam was looking and sounding good # crossing the finish th overall after two years out of the seat.Dochy and Ian were back out in the #blue bullet.# All was going well until they had a spin coming over a crest into a square left, losing the bumper and damaging the gear linkage. They managed to get the car back to the end of the Saturday afternoon leg to repair the gear linkage and almost stole the yellow bumper from the recce car until some legends appeared with the duo#s bumper in the back of their Land Rover. Back out onto the  mile #long one# on Saturday night and they had an issue # after a heavy landing over a crest the rear shocker bolt broke, making the car a handful to keep in a straight line. They had to finish another two stages before they could make it back to service, so a finish was all they wanted at this point # th overall and Dochys fourth finish in a row on Mull.Without doubt the driver to watch was Innes and his newly acquired co-driver Lewis Grfiths . The Mightywas spotted airborne at any chance, with the hydro can suspension screaming for a break at each service halt. It was almost all over as the nearside cv joint sheared and the car took a wild turn to the left # both Innes and Lewis thought they would end up IN the Belachroy pub. They managed to make it over the Lochs to the end of the final stage, claiming st overall.Eoghan was back out with Martin to settle the score from the DNF at the summer stages. Sadly a stage maximum time on stage two scuppered their chances of the overall result they were hoping for, however they did set some impressive times, clocking a th fastest time on the final stage.Jamie, back out for the final round of the STRC, was looking to continue his good run from the Pendragon and set a seventh fastest time on stage three in the extremely wet and tricky conditions. Trying to get his money#s worth from his entry fee Jamie, however, decided to take an extra couple of miles on the penultimate stage. Still, the C ran well all day and the conditions suited the car perfectly.Ian was back out with Greg and this time he was aiming to become the Scottish Tarmac Rally Champion for . They set off with five cars in the same class and they had to win the class to get Greg the honours. Setting the pace early they were leading throughout the event. Finishing the event first in their class and third overall meant the job was done # Greg claimed the championship win.The last event of the year saw Kirsty back in the co-drivers seat, gaining even more experience on her path to upgrading her licence. Some typical Knockhill weather was in store as Kirsty had her first taste of RWD rallying in the Mazda MX of Paul Sheard. Kirsty guided Paul around the very wet stages to claim th overall and some valuable points on the board for Paul#s Motorsport News Championship campaign.Special thanks to Alasdair MacConnell who has travelled many miles to don an orange bib and stand in the rain, wind and heat, all to show his support and play a vital part in any event.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 3 2020 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThis week#s photograph whas been submitted by Tom Cullen of Ardfern.The serene scene was taken overlooking the Crinan estuary at about .am on Friday January ."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead bowls into 2020","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Bowling Club launched into the new year with the first of its indoor singles competitions.Some  members played for the Argyll Arms Ardrishaig trophy on Saturday January  and after some great matches throughout the afternoon it was Alan Guy and Neil Ward that progressed to the final.In a closely fought final, Neil Ward edged the victory in the last end, winning -."},{"url":null,"title":"storm brendan the movie","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowA compilation of clips from ious points on the Mid Argyll coastline showing the impact of Storm Brendan on Monday January , .Even with less-than-Hollywood editing it#s pretty dramatic stuff."},{"url":null,"title":"tarberts senior citizens party the night away","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWet and windy weather failed to dampen the spirits of Tarbert’s seniors as they gathered in the village hall for the senior citizens# Christmas dinner.A large number of willing volunteers had organised a sumptuous meal and decked the hall with multi-coloured fairy lights and balloons to provide a warm welcome for their guests.The familiar venue quickly came alive with smiles, hugs and the happy chatter of friends gathering for this much-loved annual event which has been going for more than  years.Elma McGougan and Jean Johnston, who had served on the original organising committee, reminisced about their experiences, explaining they ran fund-raising events and that many in the village donated money and goods so the dinner could be provided free of charge.The event, held this year on Friday January , is still organised by a committee and continues to be generously supported by businesses and iniduals in the village and surrounding area.Elma said: #In the s, the women on the committee made soup and brought it along.

Back then, we had ice-cream and jelly for dessert.#Jean added: #It was all good fun and we had loads of laughs.#Elma continued: #We used to have sales to raise money for the dinner. Santa was on the stage and Jean’s children were his elves. They were only little then.#We modelled the clothes and the older women loved the bargains. We thought they were old, but they were probably the age we are now,# Elma said laughing. #We would shout #Roll up, roll up# to get them to come and see what we had on offer.#After a warm welcome from compère Martin Jefferies and a prayer of thanks for the food, the five-course meal was expertly served by members of the organising committee and their youthful helpers.A raffle, again free of charge, saw a large number of guests receive prizes and no-one was left disappointed as the remainder of the guests received selection boxes.Tarbert’s seniors showed they know how to party as dancers left their seats and enthusiastically took to the floor as soon as the musical entertainment began.A stunned Margaret Henderson was named #Citizen of the Year#, confessing she never expected to win the award.For more than  years, Margaret has collected money to support the Tarbert Sea Food Festival and Music Festival. Later, Margaret dressed up as Mrs Brown from Mrs Brown’s Boys to entertain the audience, something for which she is well-known.Martin Jefferies thanked everyone who had helped make the evening such a success with the happy gathering agreeing with loud applause.By Joan Crooks"},{"url":null,"title":"winning start to new year for star youths","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe Now kicked off with a flying start for both Red Star s and s.The s headed to Glasgow in a top of the table clash against Glasgow Boys.

Scotlandrsquos train operator, Abellio, has posted losses for a third consecutive year. Prior to Christmas, I made it clear in Holyrood that delays and cancellations on the Borders Railway were unacceptable and I questioned the Scottish Governmentrsquos decision to terminate Abellio ScotRailrsquos contract early in .I believe the move will cause disruption to passengers and puts into question job security for current employees. Even Dominic Booth, Abellio UKrsquos managing director, said: lsquoScotlandrsquos railway needs stability, not the upheaval a change in the franchise would bring aboutrsquo. I completely agree, and I hope that investment in our railway isnrsquot halted as a result.More fuel to the fire came over Christmas, when it was revealed that Abellio ScotRail said it had ended the past financial year pound million in the red, owing pound million to its owner, the nationalised railway of the Netherlands. It now seems that Dutch taxpayers are subsidising our failing train services. This is on top of the Scottish Government subsidies, which make up about half of its pound billion revenues.We need a viable solution to ScotRailrsquos woes, and terminating franchises early or nationalisation is not the answer. We need better accountability and long-term planning to ensure we see the fortunes of ScotRail turn around.The Borders tourism can offer a more peaceful alternative to bustling CapitalI was not surprised to see that Edinburgh was revealed as having the fourth highest ratio of tourists to locals in the world.

Statistics show there are nearly  tourists for every  residents in Edinburgh, and it begs the question, are we really managing the impact of tourism well Annually our Capital city is influxed with tourists for the Hogmanay celebrations and the Fringe. Whilst it great to see tourism booming in Edinburgh, we need to see more affirmative action to encourage tourists to see more of Scotland, including the Borders. We are located only an hour south of Edinburgh, yet we see very little of the footfall.We need to see incentives and drivers for visitors to explore outside of Edinburgh. Encouraging rural tourism is at the top of my list, and I believe the Scottish Government need to make it a priority to ensure that our overcrowded capital does not suffer, when rural areas have a more peaceful and less stressful visitor experience on offer."},{"url":null,"title":"polar-bear-expert-deliver-talk-galashiels","story":"THE Arctic is ground-zero for climate change, and polar bears are on the front line.Yet, therersquos still a whole lot to learn about these magnicent animals.

Tracey Logan, it is the only way forward for Peebles High.Although it is yet to be officially endorsed by the local authority, Ms Logan says her view is that apart from the Sports Complex and Millennium Wing, the entire school will be demolished and rebuilt.And that Peebles High will jump to the head of the queue in the rebuilding programme of schools - ahead of Galashiels, Hawick and Selkirk.But the Chief Executive told the towns Community Council she thinks Peebles should now be first on the priority list for a new school.Ms Logan explained: ldquoAt the moment my view is, and this is only my view, this has not even endorsed by the Council as yet, is that given the constraints that we have around what will be available financially, the Scottish Government have been really helpful in that they are offering their full support and we will make a bid late spring for funding through the schools programme.ldquoThere will obviously be a financial settlement from the insurance.\"But we need to find the best way forward, so my expectation is that we will retain the Sports Complex because it is undamaged and pretty new, we will also retain the Millennium Wing because again itrsquos not that old and is entirely usable.ldquoI would imagine that we will probably end up taking away everything  and replace it with something new.\"What that will look like, I have no idea. But what it will be is something that is modular that we can add ontowe need to for capacity and we will want to talk to the community about what  we might want to put into that site.A consultation will take place asking for local feedback on community space and the possible provision of health and social care.She added: ldquoSome people have said to me that they want to knock all of the school down including the fairly new bits, realistically that wonrsquot happen and itrsquos not the right thing to do. I think itrsquos important that we make sure people understand the parameters within which we are working so we can have some sensible conversations and that we try and accommodate as much as we can in there.Meanwhile, a major operation is underway to get the students back to their classrooms at the beginning of February.The Chief Executive said: ldquoWe put in arrangements for  plus pupils to be accommodated at locations in Peebles, Galashiels Academy and the Langlee complex.ldquoThat has been generally very successfully and the feedback from that has been positive.

planning to introduce new traffic regulations which will stop people from parking outside spaces in the packed car park.A spokesperson said: ldquoA report will be presented to our cabinet meeting in

This is a fascinating and picturesque structure from the th century, which lies semi-hidden amongst the trees that cling onto the steep sides of the slope.Dunglass is such a beautul area, and the ancient Dunglass Collegiate Church, dating from the th century, is one of its architectural jewels. Itrsquos open to the elements now, but well preserved and a popular place for weddings.The castle that once stood nearby is long gone. A more modern house sits on the spot where a mansion once stood, and before that the castle. Being on the main route south, the castle inevitably saw action during the ious times of war with England, being burned and damaged on a number of occasions in the s.But in August , the castle was effectively blown up in a huge explosion, and a version of events emerged which placed the blame on a vengeful servant called Edward Paris.It was a time of war and religious rage. Thomas the nd Earl of Haddington was leading a Covenanting force charged with defending this important route from the south, as the Covenanting army had entered England a few days earlier. He had established his force at Dunglass Castle, an obvious strategic location, to defend the armyrsquos rear.On that fateful day, August , , he was said to be in conversation with some fellow nobles when a huge explosion erupted from the vaults, instantly demolishing the central part of the castle which became little more than a pile of debris.Thomas and many others were killed, their bodies pulled from the rubble. They had been crushed by the collapse of the walls in the explosion.History has repeatedly recorded the names of the nobles killed on that day, but there were many others, as the castle was busy and full of people. Fty-four unnamed lsquocommon servantsrsquo were killed, and more than  other people badly injured, some later dying of their injuries.Edward Paris was Thomasrsquos servant and he has been blamed for this tragedy. The th-century writer Andrew Stevenson claimed Edward had the keys to the vault in which huge amounts of gunpowder had been stored, and he had been ldquoseduced by the enemies of the covenant to commit this act. He was an Englishman and another account says he was incensed at derogatory remarks made by Thomas about his countrymen.Irsquove always thought this explanation never really had the ring of truth. It was initially deemed an accident, and the story of Edwardrsquos role emerged later, instigated by a writer called William Lithgow, a man who had certain axes to grind. In one account, Edward is said to have thrust a hot poker into the gunpowder or set fire to it. The detail of this is suspect in itself, for who survived as a witness to this act  I suspect that a dreadful accident, possibly caused by incompetence and carelessness, was turned into a deliberate act of vengeance as it made a more useful explanation.Of course, it is very possible that Edward was offended or annoyed at things said by his master, and perhaps he mentioned this at some stage, later to be used as evidence of his guilt. But in truth, most servants will have seen or heard things which will have offended them, it was a part of their job.Imagineservants had been able to write and publish the things they had overheard and seen, what dferent historical narratives we would have!Motives for wanting to interpret the cause of the explosion in this way can be guessed at. It was a time of atrocity and massacre, with religious, political and national hatreds. Who was responsible for the dangerous stockpiling of the gunpowder in such a manner  It seems just too easy to blame a disgruntled servant. Even later, when writing up this period, religious and political loyalties influenced interpretation.If Edward Paris really did venture down to the vaults of Dunglass Castle on that fateful day, with the intention of committing suicide in order to kill his master, along with dozens of others, then he must have been infected with a deep hatred, as well as a total disregard for the lives of his fellow servants and his own.The truth is we will never know what really happened. But Edward Paris is a servant whose name we know. Countless numbers of so-called lsquocommon servantsrsquo whose lives and fates are deemed unimportant by history remain unrecorded just as the things they witnessed remain absent from our history books.Irsquove often thought it would be fascinating to meet Edwardrsquos ghost and ask him what really happened on that day.Silly idea, of course, but you never know."},{"url":null,"title":"public-exhibition-held-plans-revive-dunbars-east-beach","story":"Dunbarrsquos East Beach, which hosts the townrsquos annual Loony Dook, was once a magnet for tourists but the disappearance of its golden sands over the years due to coastal erosion has led to fewer visitors.East Lothian Council has already been given permission for the first phase of work on the beach, which it is hoped will help sandwhile also protecting the shore.A public exhibition detailing plans for a second phase of work ndash and the project overall ndash takes place in Dunbarrsquos Bleachingfield Centre on Monday afternoon.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, explained the desire to see the beach restored to how it was previously.She said: ldquoIt has been a long-held ambition.ldquoPeople reminisce about how wonderful the beach was and there has been a lot of disappointment that it has been so rocky for so long.Dave Northcott, East Lothian Council structural engineer and project leader, visited the community council shortly before Christmas to outline the plans.Consent is already in place for the construction of a breakwater at the southern end of East Beach.Refurbishment of the existing groyne at the same end of the beach has also been approved, alongside the placement of rock armour at the toe of the seawall.

He was said to have been martyred at sea with an anchor round his neck and was therefore regarded as the patron saint of sailors. The cult of Clement spread to Scandinavia in about the th century and then to Britain.ldquoSt Clements Wells were probably named by Scandinavians living in the Tranent area.ldquoWe know they were here because of the presence of a powerful landholder of likely Scandinavian descent, Thor of Tranent, son of Swain, who is mentioned in many th-century charters. He held extensive lands in the area and granted the church of Tranent to Holyrood Abbey.Mr Hadden said: ldquoI am sure the new stone sculptures will add another piece of culture to our area when in place to the east and west sides of Wallyford alongside those we have already.ldquoThese include the mining memorial stone and coal hutches located at St Clements Housing estate just off Salters Road, the  mining stones at the Wallyford Bing, a community woodland depicting dferent mining scenes, and also the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh memorial at the west side of Wallyford.The shapes and patterns proposed relate to the themes of the wells, water, ripples, distilling, agriculture and the sense of space and open skies of the site as it is now. The overall idea is that the artwork reflects past, present and future heritages of the area.There will also be two St Clements Wells name  per entrance in stone, either hand carved or sandblasted.The idea for a stone village sign for Wallyford is also being explored in a design reflecting the ideas of crossing a river or burn by a ford.A spokesman for East Lothian Developments said: ldquoEast Lothian Developments are delighted to be working with Susheila and James to deliver ious artworks at St Clements Wells.ldquoThey have shown real enthusiasm and creativity with the ideas they have brought forward to capture something of the history of St Clements Wells and design pieces which we hope will do justice to the entrances of the development, and spark interest from all those who will pass them.ldquoWe were very grateful to the community council for their comments and input to the designs.Elaine Di Troia was appointed vice-chairman at the AGM, Sharon Jamieson secretary and Beryl Stevenson treasurer.

Labour is all for multiculturalism, but finds it hard in practice, even with racial identity. As the Labour leadership candidates lined up in all their glory yesterday, I was tempted to say, as Jon Snow of Channel  News said of that Brexit march last year: ldquoIrsquove never seen so many white faces.Only Lisa Nandy can legitimately claim ethnic descent from her father. Such a visual contrast to all those United Colours of Corbyn photo ops during the election.A party which has made a religion of ersity seems set to hand the leadership to Sir Keir Starmer, a wealthy North London barrister, who looks the very image of ldquowhite male privilege that Labour supporters on Twitter love to loathe.For a party that lectures the media, business and academia on gender, the leadership is turning into an intersectional embarrassment. Labour has never had a woman leader, and doesnrsquot seem likely to get one this time. Four out of the five candidates to replace Jeremy Corbyn are female, but the straight white guy is ahead by a mile.Mind you, Mr Starmer, as he would like us to call him, has been given a free pass by some feminists on the grounds that he is the ldquohot ticket. According to commentators like Zoe Williams in the , Sir Keir bears a striking resemblance to Marc Drsquoarcy, the austere-but-sexy human rights lawyer played by Colin Firth in the Bridget Jonesrsquos Diary film franchise.In the salons of North London, this apparently makes the Labour MP less pale, male and stale, and more pale, male and phooar. Mind you, I donrsquot think his looks will set many hearts a-throbbing in the pubs and clubs of Workington and Bolsover.As Shadow Brexit Secretary, Sir Keir was largely responsible for turning Labour into the Remain Party before the General Election. He made clear he would never support even a Labour Brexit. That convinced tens of thousands of le-long Labour voters to turn to Mr Johnson on the grounds that only the Tories were listening to them.But thatrsquos all water under the bridge now. Itrsquos time to ldquomove on. Forget Brexit. After all, Labour won the argument, didnrsquot they Aware of the Islington millionaire tag, Sir Keir has been trying to burnish his working class image. He is of relatively humble origins, stood on Wapping picket lines and has advised the National Union of Mineworkers.

Labour should be choosing the candidate best able to lead the party to victory, on merit, rather than someone who fits a hackneyed image of proletarian virtue. Race should be irrelevant in a party that believes in equality.But of course in the Labour Party of today it so obviously does matter. Labour has been hypnotised by identity politics and sees everything through racial and gender eyeglasses. It requires of other organisations that ious minority and gender boxes are ticked. But when it comes to their own leader, well, itrsquos complicated. And when it comes to Scotland, itrsquos more complicated still.Ms Phillips is essentially standing as the only leadership candidate who speaks the language of the working class. ldquoI love the people I grew up among, she says, ldquoand I think that they can tell.

Large enough to knock the Olympics and the Commonwealth Games into a cocked hat.Yet the backlash against COP , the United Nations Climate Change Summit, has already begun.It was revealed on Wednesday that the event, to be held in Glasgow at the SEC Campus on the banks of the River Clyde, is expected to cost hundreds of millions of pounds in policing costs. It was a wonder that anyone was surprised.Glasgow will host up to  world leaders and , delegates.Its due to be the largest policing operation the UK has seen - this sort of thing doesnt come cheap.Calum Steele, the General Secretary of the Scottish Police Federation, spoke positively about the event on BBC Radio Scotland on Wednesday morning, saying there had been nothing like it in Scotland or even the UK before.Mr Steele described it asmore signicant than the Olympic Games or Commonwealth Games and would require the largest mass mobilisation of UK police the country has seen.The G summits, he said, \"will pale into insignicance.\"He went into further details. Police Scotland will be unable to manage the event alone. The country will host leaders from the US, Russia, China and Israel, all of whom will demand their own safety and security considerations.Alongside leaders, delegates and guests, the police service has to accommodate hundreds of protestors. Economic opportunities must be leapt on, he added. Scotland will be in the \"spotlight of the world for those two weeks.\"He pointed to the very clear potential economic benefits for Glasgow and for Scotland.Yet even Mr Steele, after these positive sentiments, yesterday on Twitter shared a video of buckets collecting water pouring through the roof of Paisley Police Office. \"Itrsquos not unreasonable to ask,\" he posted alongside the image, \"If we canrsquot even fix a roof how the hell will [COP] be paid for \"Nicola Sturgeon has called for Westminster to honour a pledge made to fund the event, given the UK is the host.Conversely, GMB Scotland called for Glasgow to reject the chance to host the summit. Its secretary, Gary Smith, said the costs would \"sicken frontline council staff and struggling local communities.\"\"The best thing government could do for Glasgow,\" he said, \"Is to ditch hosting the COP and instead invest the money in dealing with the state of the city.\"Its hardly the London Garden Bridge project, which, in case weve forgotten, saw poundm wasted, including pound, on a gala for the abandoned scheme. If nothing , it all served to show the strength of positive feeling towards Joanna Lumley, a vocal campaigner for this extraordinary white elephant, as she should surely have lost her national treasure status over the shameful incident.There is a string of other grossly wasteful examples of public funds. In  it emerged the frequently delayed NHS  new telecommunication and patient information system was going to cost poundm more than originally forecast.The HS railway plans have been described as at risk of becoming \"a bottomless pit for taxpayersrsquo money\". Finance Secretary Derek Mackay told MSPs last year that taxpayers were picking a bill of an poundm for two CalMac ferries, which look likely to be delivered four years late, due to \"disastrous\" previous management at Ferguson Marine in Port Glasgow.There was much back and forth over whether the legacy of Glasgows Commonwealth Games was all it was cracked up to be. The taxpayer spent pound. million on Glasgow  and all anyone remembers is the dancing teacake, it goes.There lies part of the problem. The public is used to politicians chucking its money away - whether on good faith projects such as the Games or ludicrous Boris Johnson vanity projects.Its important that the spending of taxpayers money is carefully scrutinised and those responsible for the mismanagement of publicly funded projects held to account.The public is protective of its taxes, people work hard and want afor their investment, and they do not automatically trust politicians to use their money wisely. Hence the almighty stooshie over Glasgows Lord Provost spending her civic allowance on shoes.Hence repeated grumbles when politicians head off on so-called junkets abroad.

In fact, it was two SNP victories against the Tories that pushed up the privately-educated numbers in Scotland.Alyn Smith and John Nicolson, former pupils of fee-paying Hutchesonsrsquo Grammar in Glasgow, defeated one-time comprehensive candidates in Stirling and Ochil, and Perthshire South, respectively.Hutchesonsrsquo now has five politicians at a national level from its former pupils - the two MPs and three MSPs.No other school is so well represented.Two re-elected SNP MPs were also privately educated.

The Diary has always viewed itself as a modern-day equivalent of that very mag, bringing you the best of the bizarre. As the world grows increasingly strange, it becomes more dficult for us to stand out from the crowd of crackpots and cranks scattered throughout the rest of your newspaper. This week, for instance, it was discovered that Gwyneth Paltrow was selling a certain candle with a most distinctive and, ahem, personal scent.

The creation of Holyrood in  wasnrsquot just an organic, grassroots response to Thatcherism aimed at reviving Scotlandrsquos lost democratic structures, he argues. It was the product of a much grubbier process of institutional horse-trading, whereby British politicians mdash mostly associated with the Labour Party mdash ldquomanaged demands for Scottish autonomy in order to shore up the UK constitution and ward off a growing electoral threat from the SNP.Hames builds his argument around two distinct but routinely conflated concepts: ldquoThe Dream and ldquoThe Grind. The former, he says, represents the commonly accepted biography of Scottish self-government: ldquoA story of cultural vanguardism in which writers and artists play the starring role in the recuperation of [Scottish] national identity, cultural confidence, and democratic agency.The Grind is much more prosaic. It explains ldquothe longer, thinner history of devolution as a shrewd saga of electoral expediency and legislative manoeuvring, starting with Harold Wilsonrsquos  Royal Commission on the Constitution and ending with the  Scotland Act.Hames charts the interplay between Scottish literary culture and the national movement in the last century, from Hugh MacDiarmidrsquos ldquoneurotic self-construction in the s and s through to James Kelmanrsquos experiments with ldquoauthentic Scottish vernacular in the s and s.The key moment of convergence occurred at the height of Thatcherrsquos reign, he argues, when Scots voted consistently against the Tories but remained powerless to block her sweeping social and economic reforms. In the absence of effective political leadership, the responsibility for articulating a distinctive democratic landscape, liberated from Conservative rule at Westminster, fell to writers and artists like Alasdair Gray, William McIlvanney, and Liz Lochhead, all of whom were influential supporters of devolution in .Hames thinks this is how and why The Dream took root and The Grind mdash the thankless procedural slog that ultimately made Holyrood possible mdash drted from public view. Indeed, the idea that constitutional change was driven exclusively by cultural factors, and not by the less glamorous reality of Westminster machine politics, became the core foundational myth of devolution mdash a myth that is quite literally embedded in the north-facing wall of the Edinburgh parliament building, in the form of  decorative  bearing quotes from Burns, Scott, MacDiarmid, Gray, and other Scottish literary greats.Intriguingly, according to Hames, this myth was cultivated by a small group of left-nationalist thinkers centred around Radical Scotland magazine in the late s and early s. Through their writing and activism, journalists and academics like Chris Harvie and James Robertson sought to promote the belief that Scottish culture was inherently anti-Conservative, with the aim of permanently dislocating Scottish opinion from the Anglo-British right.Their efforts paid off. The Radical Scotland strategy was ldquohighly effective in prying Scottish politics away from Westminster and [constructing] a political space in which Tories would have no choice but to concede devolution or be seen to lsquorepressrsquo Scottishness, Hames writes. ldquoThis went as far as openly ldquoothering Toryism as incompatible with the authentic national desire for self-determination.By the end of the s, the ldquolanguage of class politics had elided with a more traditional, nationalist emphasis on cultural dferentiation and the image of a supposedly ldquoproletarianised Scotland hellip dispossessed by Thatcherism now central to the Home Rule cause.This book does two things extremely well. It demonstrates how close the relationship between Scottish nationalism and Scottish literary culture has been since at least . Writing shortly before the  independence referendum, the novelist Alan Warner even suggested a No vote would signal ldquothe death knell for the whole Scottish literature lsquoprojectrsquo mdash a crushing denial of an identity that writers have been meticulously accumulating for decades.And, against the romanticising tendencies of the Scottish left, it convincingly argues that Holyrood is in many respects a deeply conservative institution, built to regulate Scotlandrsquos democratic instincts rather than unleash them. ldquoIt was the densely networked and overlapping professional circles of lsquoCivic Scotlandrsquo who were directly empowered by devolution, Hames concludes.Those circles might be good at ldquoextracting political rent from the parliamentrsquos ldquocollective symbolic capital, but theyrsquove never run it radically or imaginatively.On the downside, Hamesrsquo analysis is frustratingly incomplete. He doesnrsquot offer a detailed picture of Scottish society beyond Scotlandrsquos political classes or cultural elite, nor does he place the campaign for devolution in a clear economic context.The combined influence of the trade union movement, the voluntary sector, the Church of Scotland and wider Scottish public opinion itself in sustaining calls for a Scottish parliament over three decades, in the face of prolonged Westminster neglect, is thus largely overlooked.Moreover, the strategic debates that took place during the s over how best to achieve Home Rule are almost completely orced from the dramatic economic trends mdash rising unemployment, rampant inflation, and rapid deindustrialisation mdash that characterised the decade and, arguably, made such debates necessary in the first place. This feels like a serious omission, not least because Literary Politics is billed as a major new critical account of Scotlandrsquos devolutionary history.Hames also overstates his otherwise persuasive critique of the post- ldquoScottish consensus. Hersquos right to say that Scotlandrsquos current political leadership has ldquosuccessfully turned a rhetoric of mongrel resistance to [British] non-democracy into a ldquocorporatist governing ethic at Holyrood, based on vacuous ldquoTeam Scotland sloganeering. But that slightly misses the point.A standoff between Nicola Sturgeon and Boris Johnson is brewing and another independence referendum is on the way. Politically speaking, Scotland is more unsettled today than it was before Holyrood was established two decades ago: devolution has undermined, not reinforced, the long-term stability of the British state.But none of that should detract too much from what Hames ndash a Canadian ndash has achieved. The Literary Politics Of Scottish Devolution is one of the most original and arresting studies of our political culture written for  years.It is a powerful deconstruction of the political myths that made modern Scotland and a compelling reassessment of Holyroodrsquos mdash frequently miscast mdash institutional origins.Hames challenges the mainstream chronology of Home Rule just as the Edinburgh parliament enters its third decade. The book is disillusioning, but in a good way.

I think I finally wore him out!”Sharon was tasked with cleaning out cages, the floors and vans.“They gave me all the dirty jobs to try put me off, but it didn’t work,” she said.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.stornowaygazette webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Heros welcome...family and friends met Mark Calder at the Forth Bridges to celebrate his achievement, on the final leg of his mammoth Running Home  challenge.\"  Scottish charity worker surpasses his £, Running Home target viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"STOR | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"STOR | Article Teaser\"A year later, she worked at the centre every weekend and during the school holidays, earning her first wage of £ per fortnight in February .She has remained with the SSPCA ever since, albeit moving up the ranks!But Sharon never ever wanted to become an inspector for her the job was all about working with the animals in their care.She said: “I’ve always had a love and passion for animals but didn’t just want to have a pet I wanted to work with and help look after them.“Originally, I thought of becoming a vet but when you start having boyfriends, that goes out the window!“I already had a job with the SSPCA which I loved anyway so I just decided to work there instead.“I never wanted to be an inspector, though, because to me the best bit of the job is helping animals that come in to us and then seeing them rehomed. “That to me has always been more fulfilling than dealing with what the inspectors have to tackle.“They don’t have much contact with the animals once they take them to the centres so that was never going to be my job.”After leaving school, Sharon became a kennel maid at the Rosebank Centre.In , she became the manager and three years later she oversaw the move to bigger premises at Petterden where she remained at the helm until .She then moved to the SSPCA’s HQ in Dunfermline as the superintendent.She now oversees all the centres across Scotland which, while involving a lot of paperwork and staffing issues, still enables her to build relationships with the animals in their care.For it is a love of animals that has led Sharonto devote the last  years to the SSPCA – and she plans to continue for a few years yet.She joked: “I’ve told my husband David that I’m going to retire in three years’ time, once I’ve worked with the SSPCA for  years. If I get to  that will be it. “ButI still have my health, I might just carry on for another few years...”It’s clear that leaving the SSPCA would be a huge wrench for Sharon so I wouldn’t put bets on her leaving in three years!During her time with the society, Sharon and David have had two boys, Ronnieand Greg . They also have a grandson, Ronnie jnr who is now .But Sharon also brought her work home with her and the couple are now also “mum and dad” to three dogs, two of which Sharon hand-reared, and three cats.“There’s always one or two that pull at your heart-strings,” she said, by way of explanation for their very own menagerie!However, there’s one dog which she didn’t adopt which also brings a tear to her eye.“A wee puppy came in with PAVO virus whom we called Paddy,” she recalled.“He was a wee black and white lurcher type who was at death’s door.“I stayed in the kennels with him for three or four nights and, at one point, he did actually die.“We resuscitated him though and after about eight weeks we got him back on his feet and rehomed.“Seven years later, I was doing my shopping in Dundee when I heard this commotion.“This dog squeezed itself out of a passenger window, ran across the road and jumped right into my arms.“It was Paddy the police officer who rehomed him was on the opposite side of the street from me but the dog saw me, remembered me and was determined to come and say hello.“It was amazing that he remembered me after all that time – they don’t forget the kindness you show them.“A lot of the animals we care for are more than happy to come back for visits with us. They realise its a sanctuary for them so they are more than happy to come back and say hello.“I’ll always remember that day with Paddy though in . He’s now long gone but I’ll never forget him.”Sharon has witnessed many changes over the years and longs for the day when people finally stop being cruel to their animals.However, she knows that, until that day, the SSPCA will be there to help them.She added: “Behind every animal, there’s a human story too.“The biggest problem, other than cruelty cases, that we see is people with mental health issues.“They love their animals but maybe start with a pregnant cat, keep all the kittens and then end up with  or  in their home.“They can’t bear to be parted with them and end up in a dficult situation.“It’s heart-breaking to hear some of those human stories but, at the end of the day, we are here to look after the animals.“Over the years, I’ve seen thousands and thousands of animals who have been nursed back to good health and rehomed.“I’m really, really lucky. Not many people can say they’ve worked in their dream job for  years but I still wake up every day and feel blessed.”SSPCA could not operate without generosity of the publicToday, the SSPCA has nine animal rescue and rehoming centres and a world-leading wildle rescue centre at Fishcross in Clackmannanshire.The charity receives no government funding and relies on donations and grants to continue its work. The public funds the SSPCA’s £ million budget annually.That covers the cost of  employees, including  inspectors,  ambulance drivers and the -strong team at its centres across Scotland and its wildle sanctuary. The SSPCA is the only animal charity in the UK able to report animal cruelty cases to the Crown, with reports sent to the Procurator Fiscal Service.In , it found homes for  rescued animals, helped more than  wildle casualties and spoke to more than , children through its educational programmes.For every pound it receives, p is spent on animal welfare, p on fundraising and promotion and p on administration.So you can rest assured that the bulk of any donation you make will make a huge dference to the animals in the SSPCA’s care.Last year, its animal helpline received almost a quarter of a million calls, the inspectorate attended more than , incidents and more than , animals were cared for across its nine rescue and rehoming centres and at the national wildle rescue centre.To find out more or donate, visit www.scottishspca.org."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish charity worker surpasses his 50 000 running home target","story":"Even Mark Calder wasn#t surehe#d be able to pull off his mammoth  challenge. In January last year, we featured his incredible aim to run  ultramarathons along some of Scotland’s ancient pilgrim routes.The Running Home  challenge combined his two passions – running and his work with charity Embrace the Middle East, for which he is regional manager for Scotland and the north of England.He hoped to raise £, to rebuild war-torn areas of Iraq while covering the  miles, gathering support and funds along the way.While there were times when Mark didn’t think he’d see the finish line, he successfully completed the challenge.He also surpassed his fundraising tally – with £, currently banked.And he’s hopeful that even more funds will be amassed before he travels to Iraq this spring to see it put to good use.Marksaid: “There were occasions when I wanted to go home.“I knew,I was to quit, I was going home to a nice, comfortable house. The people I was running for don’t have that option.“That was a monumental reason to keep going.”Mark had extraordinary support along the way, not least from his crew – Gareth Brocklebank and Andrew Clarke – who followed him in a camper van, which also acted as shelter in areas where overnight BB stays were not an option.Mark’s we Karen and his two daughters also cheered him every step of the way as did many strangers.“People welcomed me into their churches and communities and generously donated large sums of money,” he said.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fetoday webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Zimeng with piano teacher Sister Avril and trustee Maggie Picken.\"  Fe charity marks  years helping blind people viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"FFPL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FFPL | Article Teaser\"“I was invited to speak in venues I would never have been able to reach in my day job, Iona Abbey being one.“It was a fantastic way to spread the word about Embrace the Middle East.“I look back on it not with a sense of pride, but rather relief – and gratitude for the people and places I encountered along the way.”Divine inspiration also came from a meeting with Father Emanuel Youkhana, a Christian minister who works in Dohuk in Iraq to bring Christians, Muslims and Yazidis together.Mark said: “To see his energy and enthusiasm for what we were doing was a massive inspiration.“That was at the end of Run , the St Ninian run, when I was at my most tired.“To have that intervention made a really big dference.”That particular run had loomed large in Mark’s mind it was the equivalent of running three marathons each day for seven days.Remarkably, though, he only lost one day to ill-health throughout the year.“I’ve learned that your body can adapt to whatever is thrown at it,” said Mark.“I wasn’t sureI’d be able to make it to the end of that run but when I hobbled over the finish line, that’s when I knew I could do it.”The darkest day of the challenge was undoubtedly in June during the St Columba run from Inchcolm Abbey to Iona Abbey.“It was one of the most interesting runs in terms of scenery, with just about every landscape Scotland has to offer,” he said.“There was a long, unsupported section just north of Oban. I was feeling great but, within ten minutes, a niggle turned into barely being able to walk.“I had to find a couple of sticks from the woods to use as shin splints.”However, it was an earlier, shorter run – St Cuthbert’s in March – which cost Mark a full day and also taught him a very valuable lesson.“I wanted to run from Melrose to Lindisfarne, where I planned to stay overnight, but I had to be there for a certain time due to the tide restrictions.“I got lost early on and was chasing my tail for the rest of the day. I started pushing really hard and ended up lost in the hills for  minutes, with no water, torchlight or phone charge.“I rushed checkpoints and didn’t take the time to check my kit properly.“I was dehydrated, didn’t stay on Lindisfarne and lost a whole day because of it.“It taught me a very good lesson – that I couldn’t do it alone and that these runs were pilgrimages, not races.“I had my tail between my legs the next couple of days but the reception at Durham Cathedral reminded me of what I was doing and why.”Mark enjoyed a similar reception at the Forth Bridges, where supporters and family joined forces to cheer him on before he reached the finish line in St Andrews on November .The following day, he addressed parishioners in St Leonard’s Church.It was the perfect place to end Running Home as St Andrews was once such a centre of pilgrimage.Mark took a breather to enjoy Christmas and New Year but has a busy  planned.He added: “I’m heading to Iraq in the spring to see how the money is being spent.“I also plan to revisit some of the places and people I met this year, by car though!“I passed through a lot of villages that were torched in the Highland Clearances.“People were forced out of their homes, and in some cases country, so there’s a sense of solidarity there with today’s refugees.“I was conscious of not being able to spend much time in places where I got a great deal of support.“So I’m hoping to revisit some of those communities, combining storytelling and traditional folk music to consolidate the friendships I made this year.”Karen is not keen for Mark to pull his running shoes back on too soon, but he will be taking on the York Marathon in October.

While the Government continues to dither, local people will feel the impact as we move from being rule makers to rule takers.“Last week I spoke in the house about the risks that new tarfs and trade barriers could have for businesses in the Northern Isles. Food and drink production are a staple part of the isles economy. The impact that continued and intensied tarfs could have on rural communities is signicant and organisations such as the SWA are understandably concerned.“This could be just a taste of what is to come as we leave the EU and our economic clout is reduced. If there were any doubt about the limits of our leverage in future trade negotiations with the US, this is a reminder of the precarious position that the Government is putting us in.“I will be writing to the Secretary of State for International Trade to explain what efforts they are making on these tarfs as a matter of urgency. With the UK losing our seat at the table in these trade talks at the end of this month, the next two weeks are crucial.

With this technology being unmanned, the union representing staff, Prospect, has said  jobs could be at risk.HIAL#s plans, which it says will be phased in, would see control centralised to a #Combined Surveillance Centre# at New Century House in InvernessHIAL has said the changes, which come as part of the latest phase of its controversial air traffic management programme, are aimed at ensuring the long-term sustainability of its operations in Scotland. HIAL has also said there are no planned reductions in staff numbers as a result of the project.The union representing staff at the airports, Prospect, says the proposals are #poorly thought-through, have not been consulted on, and will put the long-term future of vital services at risk.The union has said the plans could take £.m of direct employment away from rural and island economies.Further proposals would also see a review of air traffic services at At Benbecula and Wick John O’Groats, with a new system put in place there, which Prospect says would likely result in a further ten redundancies.HIAL managing director Inglis Lyon, said: “The strategic programme decisions made by the Board will move us into the implementation phase of the project and allow detailed operational decisions to be made. “The acquisition of a base for the new Combined Surveillance Centre marks a signicant next step in the project.“It will allow us to move forward with planning and procurement of the relevant systems to safely deliver a state of the art air traffic control management system and give additional clarity to colleagues and stakeholders as we deliver this complex and challenging programme.“Our focus continues to be on aviation service delivery and providing a safe, modern and efficient means of handling aircraft for the regions and the islands in the future.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Orkney has the highest incidence of MS anywhere in Scotland and indeed worldwide.Commenting on the announcement, Mr McArthur said: “MS is a devastating condition that can cause serious pain and discomfort to those affected, seriously impacting upon their lives and those around them.“This decision by the Scottish Medicines Consortium to allow Ocrelizumab to be used in the treatment of early primary progressive MS is therefore excellent news. It is something I know that many constituents, as well as the MS Society, have been calling for over many month. Hopefully, it will help improve treatment and provide a signicant step forward in the fight against this debilitating condition.“Scotland is currently home to world class research that is looking into more ways that people can manage the symptoms of MS, with a view to eventually finding a cure. By sanctioning the use of Ocrelizumab, the SMC is helping encourage further breakthroughs in this research.“Meantime, organisations such as MS Society Orkney do extraordinary work to support those with MS and their families. I would encourage anyone affected by MS to contact them and find out how they can benefit from their invaluable services and support.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Nine miles I tell you – that’s a Sunday School trip with juice and crisps in your packed lunch box before you even think about running along the West Sands to the strains of Vangelis.: General election: Why I’m scunnered with politics these days – Kevan Christie: After  years, I can finally say it: I hate golf – Kevan ChristieThis carry-on, which is straying into ‘a piece of nonsense’ territory, came to the picturesque Fe mining village of Crossgates where I live the other day.No sooner had I left the grounds of the estate in the Toyota Auris,  plate, than I ran into three sets of temporary traffic lightsthat had turned Main Street into a scene reminiscent of the final hours of the Battle of Stalingrad.Humbug Park, Divito’s and Crystal CornerPanic-stricken white van drivers had abandoned their vehicles in the middle of the road as they rushed to the takeaway to get their daily fix of Lorne sausage on a roll.Squads of workers in high-vis jackets crowded round a small transistor radio eagerly waiting to hear what song Ken Bruce had chosen to kick-off his .am Radio  show with before gathering again to listen to the PopMaster quiz at half-ten. Doing anything but working as they let their young hearts run free.Motorists had time to run into the chemist and pick up a prescription in the time it took for the TTLs to change colour. Utter carnage.The cause of all this consternation was the arrival of a fleet, well two... OK one, articulated lorry dropping off building materials at a new development called Crossgates, Dunfermline.This got the old tether up as, to my knowledge, Crossgates has never been in Dunfermline – although I’m sure some parish boundary pedant will be digging out the ancient scrolls in an attempt to justy the unjustiable.We’re a self-proclaimed People’s Republic in ‘The Gates’ with our own shop selling crystals – Crystal Corner – and we’re also home to The Crystal Bar, a target shooting shop, a hairdresser called Kutz for U and the best ice-cream shop in the world – Divito’s.Our football team are Crossgates Primrose who play at the beautully named Humbug Park where Scotland legend Jim Baxter first graced the turf.So you can keep Dunfermline with their Pars, fancy Abbey, Robert the Bruce and his Spiders from Mars.I may add that none of the above have paid me in cash for the shameless plugs and the four boxes of Caramel Wafers I received are on the cusp of their sell-by date, give or take a day or two,No plug for property developersBut the property developers – who shall remain nameless – have felt compelled to attach the name of the nearest big toon to the new houses in the hope this attracts the aspirational . children brigade and their funny wee yappy dugs. “Be gone with your toonie ways – there’ll be no avocado on toast in my backyard.”The area around Dunfermline has doubled in the last few years with no end of new builds springing up in the Duloch Park suburb – which is handyyou’re looking for next-day deliveries from the Amazon warehouse just off the M and a manageable commute to Edinburgh. They also have their own giant Tesco for the milk and maltesers. “Come to Duloch, where dreams are made.”It sometimes takes a while for things like medical practices and schools to catch up when developers decide to create a small town in a field in the middle of nowhere but residents will be spoiled for choice when the inevitable fast-food outlets arrive ahead of the game.All of these shenanigans remind me of a friend from the old country over there in Embra, where this kind of stuff really matters, who told everyone he was from posh Ravelston as he shared the same EH postcode as them.The fact that he lived a stone’s throw from his local The Doo’Cot Pub in sunny Drylaw mattered not a jot as he fancied a better class of pigeon that hung around the “bought hooses” up the road.Upper DuddingstonMy friend and I also like to tell people “we’re old Academy boys” and enjoy watching the confused look on their faces as they try to work out how you can talk like that after going to Edinburgh Academy when we really mean the Leith version.Duddingston and Corstorphine are just two of many ‘desirable’ areas of the Capital that are rapidly expanding with estate agents quick to crowbar anywhere within a five-mile radius into their listings.So, the perfectly decent housing estate of Magdalene becomes Upper Duddingston and similarly Clermiston is incorporated into Corstorphine in the minds of the deluded to whom these things matter.I recently heard the Bellevue area described as North New Town which is a bit of a leap in terms of increasing property values.We can all laugh at this status anxiety and I’m sure everyone can name an area from their part of the country where this exists – a network of spam valleys.Conversely, hipster types look to the more edgy parts of town like Leith in the hope of gaining a bit of street cred and I’m starting a campaign to make Piershill trendy.My last bit of advice folks is to keep your eyes peeled for this type of shenanigans andyou see a sign for new builds that’s been vandalised with marker pen changing “near” to “nowhere near”, it wisnae me.

While it is widely accepted that modernisation of air traffic control infrastructure is needed across the region, Ms Wishart says Hial’s own consultants have acknowledged that the ‘remote tower’ model was the most ‘costly’ and ‘risky’ of the options available.The Liberal Democrat MSP has now lodged a motion in parliament that will see a debate on the issue take place later this month.“It now appears clear that Hial’s management is intent on pressing ahead with their plans to centralise air traffic control services.#This is deeply worrying given the serious questions that still hang over these proposals and the level of concern amongst ATC staff.“Hial has been intent on pursuing this option from the outset, despite its own consultants identying the ‘remote tower’ model as the most costly and risky option. Since then, there has been a desperate attempt to get the evidence to fit the desired outcome.“That is simply not acceptable, particularly given the leline nature of these air services. No-one disputes the need to modernise and invest in the current infrastructure. However, this must be balanced with the safety of passengers, reliability of services and the benefits of sustaining high-skilled jobs in our island communities.“To date, the Scottish government has been happy to wave through Hial’s proposals with little evidence of robust scrutiny. I hope this debate will force the Transport Minister to think again and begin asking serious questions about these latest centralisation plans.”Highlands and Islands MSP Jamie Halcro Johnston has added his voice to calls for a debate in Parliament on HIAL’s plans to centralise air traffic control in the region.Mr Halcro Johnston, an Orkney resident and regular user of Hial services, said: “I share the concern of many people over Hial’s plans to centralise air traffic control services in Inverness.“There is real concern amongst Hial employees that they don’t feel that they have been properly consulted, particularly amongst those living in the islands. Hial should reflect on the feedback they are receiving and review their options before they commit to the approach they are advocating.“I am yet to be convinced that these proposals from Hial aren’t more about saving money than providing a better service. Given how important our vital leline air-links are, that would focusing on the wrong priority from Hial. “I would welcome the opportunity to see the issue debated at Holyrood and, with Hial entirely owned by the Scottish government, to hear the Minister’s justication for Hial’s plans.# It is understood that Hial is planning to update staff and stakeholders on the air traffic controllers issue later this week. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"man handed payback order and told to pay compensation ","story":"A man was ordered to carry out  hours of unpaid work and told to pay £ in compensation after he admitted taking a backpack from a pub which did not belong to him.Richard Oswald Layfield, , of Horseshoe Close, Virkie, was in the Douglas Arms pub in December  when he took the pack, believing it to belong to a friend he was with at the time.But when he got outside he realised the bag, in fact, belonged to somebody .Instead of putting it back, however, he held onto it – and its contents, which included a £ i-phone, £ in cash and a set of car keys.Layfield admitted a charge of reset when he appeared in the dock before Sherf Ian Cruickshank yesterday.Procurator fiscal Duncan MacKenzie said it would have been simple for Layfield to have rectied his mistake.“It was not the case that he was in a drunken state.

Established in January , the six week project has witnessed a record  participants sign up for this year’s programme. Those taking part are teamed with fellow Slimmers in a bid to be crowned overall Saints  Slimmers Champions, .With health and well-being at its heart, Saints  Slimmers provides opportunities for regular team exercise, promotion of positive mental health, development of teamwork skills, dance and many social activities. Participants have been assigned to a team and are following a six week programme of activity. Those involved will be spin cycling in the early morning before winding down with a brisk walk that evening.Circuit training, aerobic workouts and the all important team challenges will keep everyone entertained, while the finale dance-off in the splendour of the Tullyglass House Hotel will provide a fitting celebration of the participants efforts.But don’t let the “Slimmers” reference mislead you. This programme is about far more than that as Club Chairman Jim Brady elaborates: “Our annual programme places its emphasis clearly on the achievement of personal goals for all involved. “For some that might be simply getting out of the house for an activity at a time of the year when the long nights and inclement weather may put you off leaving home. “For others it may be an opportunity to meet new people, to try something new or indeed … to lose some weight.“Whatever the goal, the programme seems to have captured the imagination of local people in great numbers since it started four years ago with some  people in total taking part. “As well as providing the participants with a range of activities to undertake we offer mental wellness sessions, a range of social events to attend and many opportunities to step outside of their comfort zone. “All of our fitness tutors are locally based and that means that as well as channelling funding towards them during the programme they also get a chance to show off their product and attract spin-off business as a result throughout the remainder of the year”.In  the programme was recognised at the Irish News Club  Volunteer Awards when it was awarded the prestigious award for best Club Health  Well Being initiative. This years programme sees participants range in age from  to  years of age and activities are tailored to inidual need and fitness.Charity features as an integral part of the programme and last year the organisers at All Saints designated the McMillan Unit at Antrim Area Hospital as the beneficiaries of their efforts. A sum of over poundk was raised principally through the team “Spinathon” at the Harmony Hub in the centre of Ballymena in February. This year a similar event on Saturday, February  will raise funds to benefit the Children’s Hospice.The club would like to thank those local sponsors who have supported inidual teams and events. They include Ballymena Running  Athletic Club, McKillop’s Spar Frys Road, Connolly’s Spar Dunclug, Tullyglass House Hotel and the overall programme sponsor Galgorm Resort and Spa. The theme for the teams this year are flowers and they are appropriately named as: The Teamkit Tulips, The Do-Jo Daffodils, The Doherty Meats Marigolds, The Fitzsimons Opticians Foxgloves, The Pizza Parlour Pansies, The Knockdene Healthcare Heathers, The Flamingo Forget Me Nots, The Sitting Room Snowdrops, the Studio  Sunflowers, The Steele Physio Primroses, the Prime Fitness Ponsettias and the Rafferty Property Roses.So over the next few weeksyou happen to see a group of Roses or Pansies jogging past you on the street give them a shout of encouragement and help them to bloom!

I am still weak but you can imagine what it is going to do for me when I fully recover.“I want to thank so many people, including my amazing CF team at Belfast City Hospital who pushed behind the scenes without me knowing, and the amazing staff on Level  South Transplant Ward who have become my second family. I have spent more time with them this year than my own family.“Then there is the team in ICU. What these guys do is amazing.

As British citizens living in the United Kingdom, we have a complex and multi-layered identity which in many areas is wider than simply Ulster-Scots. We remain unconvinced that the cultural traditions and identity of the Orange family will be meaningfully promoted or safeguarded by these proposal.#Earlier Conradh na Gaeilge had branded the proposals an #historic advancement# for the Irish language but ones which fell #far short# of previous government commitments by the Irish and British governments.The deal includes a number of provisions for the language including the appointment of a Irish Language Commissioner.Dr Niall Comer, President of Conradh na Gaeilge, said that deal was #undoubtedly historic#, however, the organisation highlighted the absence of an Irish Language Act as promised in the  St Andrew#s Agreement. #This legislation is undoubtedly an historic advancement for our community, and for those who wish to use the language, by providing historic official status, legal protection and an Irish language Commissioner for the first time in the history of the state,# Dr Comer said.#This has only come about as the result of a tireless, inspirational and bottom up campaign which has transformed how people here now view the language and ultimately how the state will interact with our community and shared language moving forward.#Ciarán Mac Giolla Bhéin of Conradh na Gaeilge added: #This protection comes in the form of an Irish language Bill being pasted into the GFA, independent from the other language legislation, as new, separate parts of that agreement. If passed, we will hold any new power-sharing executive fully to account on the full implementation of these proposals and will tirelessly test and expose the weaknesses and glaring omissions in the coming days, weeks and months. #There are some huge question marks here. These proposals fall far short of the commitments made in the  St Andrew’s Agreement, which promised an Irish language Act based on the Welsh legislation and does not contain provisions that are made for language in Wales or in the south, as was explicitly committed to by both Governments. #The complete omission of visibility and signage is hugely frustrating and will undoubtedly be a source of tension and will expose major fault-lines on contested cases of signage in the coming period. However, the possibility of the delivery of signage through language standards will be rigorously and immediately tested by our community. #The role and remit of the commissioner being left to the sign-off of OFMDFM leaves us at the whim of a veto being used against core components of the legislation and drafting and delivery of services. The use of any veto to limit, obstruct or frustrate delivery of services and rights would undoubtedly erode trust and could be potentially catastrophic for any incoming Executive.#We welcome the adoption of recommendations included in our consultation document for the centuries long overdue repeal of the final remaining  Penal Law, that will now facilitate the use of Irish in Courts the new central translations hub the right to use Irish in the Assembly, where it was previously sneered at and belittled, which includes a provision for simultaneous translation. Finally, the commitment to an Irish language Strategy has the potential to transform our community in the coming years. #We will now work diligently towards testing the glaring gaps in the legislation that prevent us from playing a fair and equal role in our society. Legal advice is being sought on several of the provisions, including the ‘official status’ provision. The devil is not only in the detail of the legislation, but in the implementation of that legislation.#"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"o theanga leipreachain go dti acht ghaeilge","story":"I , caitheadh amach as mo chéad chruinniú den Chomhairle i mBéal Feirste mé as Gaeilge a labhairt.Nó “teanga leipreacháin” mar bhaist Sammy Wilson uirthi.Mhuscail mé inniu agus Acht Ghaeilge ar an táirseach againn.Moill ró-fhada ach d’éirigh linn mar phobal Gaeilge ó Thuaidh tabhairt ar na húdaráis an tAcht a bhí geallta ó  a ghéillstin.Tá na heilimintí tábhachtacha atá de dhíth in aon Acht ansin:Stádas oigiúil.Coimisinéir Teanga.Caighdeáin seachas scéimeanna.Agus ar ndóighe tá ríméad ar leith orm go bhfuil aistriúchán comhuaineach le bheith curtha ar fáil sa Tionól féin agus comhaltaí ag caint Gaeilge.

There will be a lot more activity from the unusually quiet four piece I’m assured. Very little other craic at the minute. .Squakdon’t have anything organised yet man..Rebecca Mulhernhas nothing on except uni stuff. googletag.cmd.push .Paddy Nashis hinting a vinyl compilation of all his material later in the year. He also describes a few releases and some solo tours as nothing much. Luckily for them Paddy doesn’t compare himself to other artists. .Basorkhave an announcement to make soon. .Fast Thursdayare flat out recording an album at the minuteandhave very few gigs planned so far. .Ryan Vailhas new music lined up and loads of live shows. .George Huttontells me “Two next gigs coming up are the Ulster Hall in Belfast, th Feb. I’ll be releasing my new album in Feb also and on the th Feb I’ve a gig in St Columb’s Cathedral with Ruth McGinley and the Priests. I’ve been asked to be a judge on BBC School Choir of the year, and they want me to perform live on the BBC in the Guildhall before the final, but I haven’t been given a green light to put that out there yet! Hopefully will today or tomorrow! Man, the new album is a big step up, it’s very much down that Irish channel but it also really showcases what I do best”. googletag.cmd.push .Nazirtold me “Working on my next release which I’m hoping to have out in the next month or so, I’d love to playCeltronic again but I guess I won’t know about that for a while, some technical things with involve are holding us back but as soon as we get that sorted I’ll let u know!” .Caitlin Nashsaid, “I have no clue at the minute because I’m heading back to uni soon but I’m hoping to get a few projects done over there and here when I’m back in the summer”. . At some point we’ll work out why  People don’t get paid for playing gigs. . In April Reevahwill be releasing “A Dferent Light” and she’ll also be heading out on a UK Irish tour as well as putting the finishing touches on her debut album which will be out either by the end of this year or the start of next year. .Declan McLaughlinis feeling nostalgic and will be celebrating his entire career this year, from The Screaming Bin Lids to The Whole Tribe Sings to Central Drive to The Hi Flats, share the love on his Facebook page. . If you’re not really a fan of music then mrk my words, there’s plenty of bland music going live this year. .Roewill be releasing a couple of singles this year with an e.p. on its way after the summer.  Noella Hutton has a new album coming out soon.  .Noella Huttonhas a new album coming very soon called “Love  Liars” and you can check out the video for her video for “I’m Going Crazy” from that album on her Facebook page. .Bloodhaven’t gone away you know. . There will most likely be the same old same old from all the usual quarters but hopefully there’ll also be some of the usual standard of innovative stuff from the likes of Celtronic andOscillations  Modulations.

It was tough on a St Louis team who brought so much to the table, notched some fine scores and had a stoppage time goal ruled out before the game went to extra-time. Throw-in was delayed  minutes, such was the attendance. After playing second fiddle to a dominant but wasteful St Louis for much of the first-half, Maghera were still in touch and only trailed - to - at the break. googletag.cmd.push Ballymena had their exceptional goalkeeper Orlagh Convery to thank for some vital first-half interventions including a breath-taking reflex save to deny Aimee Lennon after Clare Gunnings rasper came off the bar. Caitlin Crawford extended the St Louis lead from a free but with Ceaacutet McEldowney and Bronagh McCullagh grabbing the game by the scruff of the neck, Maghera began to dominate. A fine Caoimhe Molloy point on the break looked like it would inspire St Louis but when Maghera substitute Niamh McCullaghs shot went all the way to the net to open a - to - lead, the game changed. Molloy, like her younger sister Katie, excelled for St Louis. Her thundering nd minute shot to the roof of the Maghera net put them ahead. googletag.cmd.push - POLL Who was player of the match  Vote here... It looked to have captured a first title for the Ballymena school in  years but there was still more drama to follow. First, Clare Gunning leveled the game before yet another twist. Caoimhe Molloy raced goalwards before dispatching a shot that dipped into the top corner with virtually the last puck of the game, but it was ruled out by referee ONeill for too many steps. For much of the second-half, players from both teams went down with cramp. However, following an agreement between both schools earlier in the day, extra-time was played. The games hammer blow was delivered by Clare Gunning, who sank St Louis with her goal in the first attack. It was followed by a third Maghera goal from Blathnaid McLaughlin at the start of the second period of extra-time. Magheras defence, in which Aimee Lennon played a pivotal role in extra-time, kept St Louis to a Molloy point and the cup was on its way back to Maghera.

John Dallats introduction to politics came quite by chance.An invitation to join a new branch of the SDLP was sent to his brother, but John went instead and almost got selected to run for council.He declined, pleading that he was living and teaching in Donegal.Four years later, after ing to Kilrea to take up a teaching post at St Paul’s College, he was chosen to run and so began a letime of council work which culminated in John becoming the first ever nationalist mayor in Coleraine.This period also represented his involvement in rejuvenating the local Credit Union which was in danger of closingA new Conference of Saint Vincent de Paulwas also being set up in Kilrea which would do amazing things for people.Around the same time, the man who was about to become one of Ulsters most hated sectarian killers, was placed by the Probation Service in the very town John lived, and worked in.Just before committing the Castlerock and Greysteel atrocities, UFF murdererTorrens Knight was placed on a local community employment scheme in Kilrea.He left without completing the year of work he was ordered to do by the courts.“The rest is, of course history,” said John. “He and his cronies murdered my friend Gerry Dalrymple, who was in my house the night before the Castlerock murder of four workmen.“His last advice to me was to pull my curtains.“The following morning, he was dead and so too were three of his workmates.“These were dark and dangerous times with armed cops sitting outside the council chamber.“In the beginning I thought they were protecting unionists but when I complained that they could be better used other places I was told by the Divisional Commander it was me they were looking after because I had no control over my mouth!“Yes, Ulster Resistance had brought in guns which were ided among the UDA and UVF and in the future innocent people would die at Castlerock, Greysteel and where.“Among those in the security forces to die was Bertie Gilmore who lived in the same lane as me.“We played together, grew up together and Bertie joined the UDR and I the SDLP. googletag.cmd.push  John Dallat ready for the road in his beloved Morris Minor car. Photo: Mary K Burke “He had retired three years and was recovering from a severe heart attack when he and his we were riddled with gunfire beside the retirement site he was going to build.“Today his daughter is among those who have helped me in challenging times.”Johnwas born and bred in Rasharkin, Co Antrim.“On reflectionI was asked to be born into a dferent house in a dferent place I would turn it down.“I was happy growing up by a Tilley Lamp, carrying water from the well and waking up in the morning with ice on the inside of the windows.“Later on I loved the ‘put-put’ of our ‘Start-o-matic’ generator and Peeke my pet pigeon was never from my side.“She had fallen out of the nest and my mother nursed her back to le while she grew the most beautul brown and white feathers.“An amazing creature of God. I knew why we couldn’t get a council house and I know it was more than just because we were Catholics. “Poor Protestants didn’t get council houses either because they might also be unable to pay the council rent.“Anyway, we kept a goat for the milk which was good for my wee brother Gerard who was special needs both physically and mentally.“He died when he was  and part of my mother and father died too.”John said that being the “underdog” was second nature to him growing up.And it was something he carried with him into his politics career.“It just seemed right and at times didn’t go down well, especially when I sided with the travellers when they came to town but the travellers were good people and attitudes changed,” he said.“When a young girl from a dferent part of the world suffered horric le-changing injuries after losing her job and was left homeless, it seemed right to have her for Christmas in our home and it was one of our best and happiest times ever.“Today she and her family are our best friends and we love them to bits.“When an African student was going to be deported because her visa ran out and her sponsor died suddenly it seemed only right to bring her home and set about stopping her going back to a country where she had only a blind grandmother and no one .“Luck had it I met the head of the Border Agency in Stormont on the corridor and he extended her stay for two years.“In the meantime, she met an amazing husband, married and is among our best friends.“Brian Kennedy played at the wedding and we dressed up in African traditional dress!There is one battle, not yet won, which has had the most impact on John in his role as a public representative.He said: “Perhaps the one story which doesn’t have a good ending just yet is the dreadful murder of Inga-Maria Hauser whose mutilated body was found in Ballypatrick Forest  days after her neck was broken in an attempted rape.“Early next year I will meet her only sister Frederika at a special conference in Queen’s University.“That will be an amazing occasion and hopefully the prelude to her murderer being brought before the courts for one of the most brutal killings I have ever read about.”At the heart of it all has been one thing, John’s family.“Politics had its mixed blessings. I got to see places in the world that I could never have been but it also brought its problems – searching under the car for booby traps, bullet-proof windows and doors and a gun that I know I would never have used.“But politics also gave me the most incredible family.“My poor we Anne was parachuted into the north at the height of the Troubles to a small town which was bombed from one end to the other.“Our daughter, Helena, now a councillor, became the youngest detainee when we were arrested by the British army in Derry shortly after crossing the border.“She was ten days old and our mission was simply showing her off to her Donegal grandparents.“Sixteen years later as a member of the Foyle Harp School she played for President Bill Clinton when he first made that history-making appearance in Mackey’s Foundry.“Later, she would entertain other leaders including President Robinson and McAleese as well as John Major and member of the Royal Family.“I felt honoured when she was invited to play in the Russian Embassy in Washington on Saint Patrick’s Day.“Today the same harp is never out of sight but not played in public anymore.”John added: “Our two sons, Ronan and Diarmuid have been amazing and in one dficult and dangerous year we were on the Aran Islands three times for our safety.“For  years Inishmore, the largest of the three Aran Islands has been our refuge, our safety valve and our friend.“Two weeks ago when I was in hospital after breaking my arm while canvassing, Vincent Mc Carron, one of our friends, left the island during a storm, drove to Kilrea to collect Anne, go to Derry to collect me from hospital and bring me home. He stayed for several days helping with my recovery.”In , one week after his mother sadly passed away, John became Deputy Speaker, a post he held for ten years.“I found it a strange place and certainly not reflecting my background where the term ’Mister’ was hardly order of the day.“In time I persuaded the doorkeepers and others to call me by my first name and I felt comfortable about that.“I felt I was dismantling a bit of the old Stormont that was in danger of being rejuvenated!“All these people were my friends by simply showing them a bit of respect, nothing more and I have missed them dearly over the last three years when I see little of them anymore.”Reflecting on challenges and achievements in his political career, Mr Dallat spoke about stopping the closure or the Belfast-Derry railway north of Ballymena.”The twenty-year project nearly went off the rails several times,” he said.“The Civil Service had a plan to save money by closing the railway north of Ballymena and use the savings to make a start on the A roadway though Toome.“Today the Belfast-Derry railway carries many more passengers than the Belfast-Dublin Enterprise service, but still needs connected to the Irish Rail network and that is a priority for me.John added: “Stopping the closure of the Irish Coastguard Radio Station at Malin Head, announced by Leo Varadkar when he was Minister for Transport.“I gave evidence to a Dail committee with two of my councillors and told the TD’s this was one of the best examples of cross-border bodies, seamless, transcending partition and two world wars, costing very little and actually working! Varadkar had to back down.”As vice-chair of the Public Accounts Committee I exposed wanton waste of public money and brought about important changes which the civil service didn’t like.“Effort to cover up who was responsible for bad mistakes and neglect were strenuously resisted.“Later I was invited to Georgia and Armenia to share my experiences and I felt so honoured and privileged.“I just couldn’t believe that a boy that grew up in a house with no electricity, no running water could be involved in helping democracy grow in two of Russia’s former territories.”With the Assembly back up and running, John says he has great hope for the future.“I have been through the best and the worst of times and see an amazing future for this part of Ireland.“I see wonderful people all around me in both communities and I want to be part of that community for the sake of future generations that will create a new Ireland and one we can all celebrate.“I would encourage every young person to do likewise.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

BumpAlongtheWay premiered at the stGalway Film Fleadh last July, where it won the award for Best First Irish Feature, and had its international premiere at the prestigious Toronto International Film Festival. Speaking at the Derry premiere last October Bronagh said it was very much a Derry womans story. googletag.cmd.push Its about a woman in her s who goes on a night out and gets pregnant, much to the disgust of her -year-old daughter.She thought she couldnt have anymore kids and she finds herself about to have another one. Its a bitter sweet comedy because its about serious subject matters that women have to deal with like fertility, menstruation, endometriosis and menopause.They are heavy subject matters that can impact peoples lives and cause a lot of unhappiness. But theres also humour and a lot of jokes about down below so I think we got the balance right anditsvery much a Derry womans story. googletag.cmd.push Bronagh says it was a pleasure to work with her sister Louise and shehopes to do so again in the future. Wevedone a couple of bits and piecestogether but this is the first major feature film together. Im so proud of her because she is so professional and she really, really cares for the people she is working with.Im also very proud that we made the film in Derry and I look forward to working with the next young generation of film makershere in the city because there is so much talent and the sky is the limit.  ABumpAlongtheWaywas funded byNorthern Ireland Screen and Yellowmoon and distributed by Element Distribution.

The Bangor attacker played in Kurtis Bell, who slotted the ball into the inside side-netting after Saintfield were dispossessed at the edge of their own box.Saintfield raised it a few gears and struck three times in the  minutes before half-time.The first came from Andrew Clarke after James Sofley was played down the line. After beating two defenders, James played in Andrew, who passed the ball into the bottom right-hand corner past the lsquokeeper.It took less than five minutes for left back Oliver Duff to score Saintfieldrsquos third. A long ball found Adam Childs on the left wing.He played it back to the edge of the box for Duff. He took one touch to set himself before striking a powerful left-footed shot into the bottom right corner.The Saints scored one more goal before the break with Andrew Clarke playing the ball across the face of goal for Tony Liken to finish at the back post. Saintfield went into half-time in the driving seat and - up.The second half started much like the first ended with Saintfield scoring an early goal.Ryan Sofley was the supplier of an own goal after bombing into the box and fizzing a cross into the near post which ricocheted off the Bangor defender into the net.At - up, the Saints took their foot off the gas and conceded just over five minutes after scoring.Bangor gained possession from a loose ball in midfield and played it into Matty Hall, who turned well to beat the Saintfield defender before striking the ball low and hard into the bottom corner.The Saints were again quick to respond with Andrew Clarke getting his hat-trick with half an hour still to go.Clarke started the move in midfield and finished it expertly after James Sofleyrsquos effort was parried by the lsquokeeper.Saintfield had a penalty and rebound saved less than two minutes later after James Sofley was brought down in the box.However, the Saints werenrsquot finished yet and Clarke had one more goal left in them with  minutes left to go. Possibly the best goal of the game, as he showed real determination and skill to score his fourth. Another counter-attacking goal from the Saints as they broke fast from a Bangor corner.Clarke received the ball just inside the Bangor half and stood tall after several attempts to bring him down. He beat three defenders before slotting home a cool finish into the bottom corner.This goal also signalled the end of the goalkeeperrsquos game after he strongly disagreed with the refereersquos decision to allow the goal to stand. Bangor had one more chance before the end of the game when they were also awarded a penalty, but David Harper kept the Saintsrsquo five-goal lead intact and made it a penalty saved for both teams.A great performance for Saintfield who progress to the next round of the cup and a fantastic performance from  year-old Andrew Clarke who relished his role as an attacking midfielder.Saintfield United Bangor Young Men CLARENCE CUP ND ROUND.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th January 2020 Call.jpg","title":"Call to begin work on Ballynahinch bypass  ","story":"THE re-establishment of the Stormont Executive has led to fresh calls for work to start on Ballynahinchrsquos proposed multi-million pound bypass.Newly appointed Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon is being urged to signal the start of construction work on the scheme which is estimated to cost in excess of poundm.South Down MP Chris Hazzard mdash a former roads minister in a previous Executive who signed off the eagerly-awaited bypass in December  mdash has written to Ms Mallon seeking an assurance that the Ballynahinch scheme remains a priority for her department and that construction work will start as soon as possible.In addition, Rowallane councillor Billy Walker is tabling a notice of motion at the February meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council seeking across-the-board political support to seek an urgent meeting with Ms Mallon discuss the next step in the construction of the bypass.He also confirmed that Strangford MP, Jim Shannon, has written to Ms Mallon on the issue and is seeking a meeting with her to discuss the issue.There has been major progress on work on the near two-mile scheme to link the Newcastle and Saintfield roads, with work already completed on a major archaeological investigation along parts of the route.Work was due to complete on the schemersquos economic appraisal before the end of last year, with roads engineers confirming recently that in order to advance the bypass schemersquos state of readiness, preparatory work on contract documents was ongoing to ldquominimise the time required to initiate a procurement competition, should funding become available for construction.The by-pass, which would be the single biggest road scheme ever constructed in the district, is expected to take in excess of  months to build, with roads officials insisting that it will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety.They are also confident that the schemersquos economic assessment demonstrates the by-pass would provide a good economic .The scheme is designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town.Major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road, with a new bridge constructed over the Moss Road.It is also proposed that a section of the bypass will pass under part of the Crossgar Road with a  metre long bridge constructed to take traffic over Ballynahinch River.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the bypass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.Mr Hazzard said that following his decision to formally sign off the scheme at the end of , the government department had been working through ious legal stages to ensure the scheme could commence as soon as possible.ldquoA programme of geotechnical investigation works on lands along theof the scheme was completed in  with advanced archeological investigation works completed last year, he confirmed.ldquoThis allowed the Department to move ahead with the final stage of preparing contract documentation in readiness of funding becoming available to construct the scheme.Mr Hazzard added: ldquoWith an Infrastructure Minister now in place following the restoration of Stormont this week, funding should now be signed off and construction allowed to commence as soon as possible.Cllr Walker said it was the view of many, including senior roads engineers, that the multi-million pound scheme was vital to the survival of Ballynahinch town centre and will play a signicant role in helping boost the wider South Down economy.He said given that the project is shovel ready, it is essential that the cash is earmarked to allow construction work to start this year is forthcoming.ldquoMoving forward what is now required is the finance to build this scheme, continued Cllr Walker.ldquoIt is clear to me that when you look at other parts of Northern Ireland that Down District has consistently missed out on major roads funding.

The cabinet was later found along the side of the Carrickmannon Road, near Ballygowan.The drugs taken included heroin and cocaine, both of which are dangerous even in small doses. They are types of hard drug in big demand on the black market. Additives like glucose are used by drug pushers to multiply the volume and increase profits. Other drugs, including morphine and strychnine, were also taken.The raid was the latest in a spate across the province and police fear that the addiction problem could be more serious than previously realised.Police chiefs have backed chemists pressing for an urgent review of the Home Office regulations about the keeping of prescribed drugs in steel cabinets.The present procedure is making things too easy for the thieves. It has meant that the hard drugs are all kept in the same place and the professional thief knows that.Before  regulations, chemists had better safeguards, evenit meant hiding the hard drugs on the general drugs shelves.

The Ballynahinch venture was unique in having a large amount of surviving documentation.Mr Reid says it is clear from these papers that the scheme organised by the First Presbyterian Church was sophisticated, comprehensive, self-funded, and cradle-to-grave in scope. It included widowsrsquo and old age pensions, end of le and burial grants, and support for orphans.Finance allocated to the project was known as lsquoThe Poorrsquos Moneyrsquo. The scheme operated late in the reign of William III and was continued into the time of Queen Anne, George I and George II.Nowadays benefit claimants unable to work through illness or injury, are paid Employment Support Allowance, .In  a similar scheme was obviously operating in Ballynahinch. The church carpenter at that time was John Gough, and that year he suffered a signicant injury, perhaps a broken arm or leg. He was unable to work or to earn a living for over a year.John had been married six years earlier in , in his home congregation by Rev James McAlpine. His we was Elizabeth, neacutee Ferguson. Their children soon followed mdash Christine, who was five in  Rebecca, who was four, and their twin boys, George and James, who were just one year and one month.With four young children and no income, John and Elizabeth were soon struggling financially. But in April the church stepped in immediately, with payments for an initial three-month period, at six shillings per instalment. In August John tried to resume work, but couldnrsquot. The church continued payments, but now at a reduced rate of d. Another attempt at work in October  failed again, and again payments resumed.John eventually recovered and ed to work permanently in August , having received a total of  support payments from First Presbyterian. He resumed his valuable role in maintenance of the fabric, receiving church contracts in ,  and .The problem of unwed mothers and absent fathers is one that troubles every age and every generation. Back in the early s, the Ballynahinch Session took a stern approach to fire-and-forget fatherhood.Their starting point was an interview with the expectant mother to ascertain the identity of her co-responsible male partner. If she proved uncompliant, exclusion from church attendance was then threatened. Faced with resultant near-total social ostracism, the mother-to-be soon cooperated.The next stage involved the errant couple appearing some Sunday morning before the entire congregation, kneeling on the Stool of Repentance and confessing their extramarital transgression. After that they were received back into the congregation. Their child was baptised and recognised as a church member.In a -year period the Ballynahinch Session dealt with  such cases. In six, they identied both parents. In six other cases only the mother was identied in seven, only the father. In one case the origins and surname of a lsquofoundlingrsquo child were known, but neither parent actually came forward.By st century standards, these church procedures sound draconian. But they had the purpose of protecting the rights of the child and of offering an opportunity to the parents for their reputations to be salvaged,possible.The alternatives were a lot worse. It was common in the s for the sexton at Magheradroll Parish Church to discover live newborns abandoned overnight on his church doorstep, ordead through neglect or infanticide, to find their bodies surreptitiously concealed in adjacent graves.In Ireland such surviving infants were sent in large numbers to the Foundling Hospital in Dublin, which who received between ,-, orphans annually. The hospitalrsquos mortality rate was some %.In Ballynahinch, under Presbyterian auspices, some such infants were spared this grisly fate. The lives of a number of potential orphans were actively protected by the church in their home town.Under the Welfare Reform Act of , Disabled Living Allowance was controversially replaced with Personal Independence Payment. DLA payments were made to claimants who often had long term medical conditions. The amount of the award ied according to the degree of disability.Interestingly, in Ballynahinch in the early s, First Presbyterian made a number of long-term DLA-type awards to some lsquosupplicantsrsquo.Ms Grissel Foreman was on such a benefit from -. Some financial records of the Poorrsquos Money still exist. But all its other documentation is lost, so we donrsquot know what Grisselrsquos ailment actually was. It was obviously slow and progressive, perhaps something like tuberculosis, or multiple sclerosis, or Parkinsonrsquos.As her condition deteriorated, the church increased its amount of financial support. In  she received seven payments totalling s d. By  this had escalated to  payments totalling pound s d.She died in  and was buried at church expense. Over  years, amounts paid to her totalled pound s d. This was an enormous sum, considering the church ministerrsquos annual stipend at the time was pound.These and many other such stories will be outlined on Monday night at Down Museum.

Rail chiefs, who had been hoping for investment after the railways had proved so crucial to the war effort a few years earlier and that the buses would be barred from competing with the trains and instead provide a feeder service to stations, were devastated at the outcome.ldquoThe recommendation, accepted by Stormont, was that the entire Belfast and County Down Railway main line from Belfast to Newcastle, including the branches to Donaghadee, Ballynahinch and Ardglass, should be closed.The only route to be saved was the Belfast to Bangor connection, which continues operating successfully to this day.Mr Gardiner continued: ldquoThe attitude of Stormont was that it would be cheaper to move everything to the roads than to invest in railways that had been run down during the Second World War. People would use the buses instead. They developed huge road building schemes mdash most were never completed mdash but closed the railways first before these were even started. It seems incredible today.ldquoThe most puzzling element of the decision was the axing of the Belfast to Newtownards line, which served the east of the city mdash Dundonald, Knock and Comber areas in which the suburbs were developing and likely to provide increased commuter traffic had they been spared.ldquoIndeed, there were more than enough new diesel trains ordered to operate both the Bangor and Newtownards lines mdash and evidence suggests that the Transport Tribunal expected Stormont to spare the Comber line as a compromise option and as late as , before the tracks were lted, they were calling on the minister responsible to reverse the decision and trial these new diesel trains on this section of track mdash a call that fell on deaf ears.The  closures were the first steps in a plan which was to see the reduction of the Northern Irelandrsquos railway network from  miles to  miles mdash a decrease of  per cent.A decade later, the Great Northern Railway was ided between the UTA and its counterpart in the Republic, CIE, and further closures to lines to Armagh, Dungannon, Omagh and Strabane occurred.Willie Watterson and James Magill, who were porters and ticket clerks at Newcastle and Tullymurry stations, recalled their memories of the last train in an interview recorded for the BBC documentary lsquoRaising Steamrsquo in ldquoThe last train was a Sunday night. It was a cold winter night, January , , said Willie. There was twelve coaches, and two engines and two guards. She was packed. Packed to the doors. So I lit all the lamps, and put detonators on the line to give her a send-off.James added: ldquoI think every station did the same thing, so when the train came in there was a salute of bangs.

He was also part of Eamon Colemanrsquos team that famously won the Sam Maguire Cup in .Dferent spells at Sligo and Leitrim followed before he masterminded Mayorsquos journey to the All-Ireland final in , but they lost out to Kerry.Taking Slaughtneil to two All-Ireland club finals followed before he assumed control of the Magpies last year and the rest is history.The much-loved Moran has the complete backing of every single one of the  players in the  and selector and coach Conleith Gilligan, who is also a former Derry player, believes Moran has the Midas touch.ldquoHis record speaks for itself and has the players eating out of the palm of his hands mdash they would do anything for him, he revealed at the clubrsquos press night last Thursday.ldquoI just canrsquot put it into words what Mickey has about him. Maybe its just a bit of magic dust, but itrsquos definitely a unique ability to get players to play for him.ldquoIt doesnrsquot matter what age you are. If you are good enough, he will give you a chance, he added.ldquoDonrsquot forget we won the Ulster League last season with five or six minors starting regularly every week.ldquoThat injection of youth sure helped the lads get a great start to the season and everything fell into place after that, he continued.Gilligan also believes that Moranrsquos love for the game and the way it should be played has rubbed off on the players.ldquoMickey is extremely keen on discipline. He insists the players play the game and let the referee do his thing without being shouted at.ldquoHe doesnrsquot rant or rave from the sidelines and expects that same response from the players and gets it, he added.Dedication and team structure are what he has instilled at Eoghan Rua Parc and a love for the game along with a winning environment.Kilcoo have been the benchmark in Down football for the past decade, but Moran has taken them a stage further in just  months.Corofin may be blessed with several players who have turned out regularly for Galway and in Kieran Fitzgerald, Liam Silke, Kieran McGrath, Gary Sice and Ian and Daithi Burke they have the nucleus of a talented outfit.However, Kilcoo believe they bigger they are, the harder they fall..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th January 2020 Minister.jpg","title":"Minister vows to end strikes with pay deal  ","story":"HEALTH staff across the district were yesterday digesting the news that new Stormont Health Minister Robin Swann had confirmed that pay parity with their colleagues in England can now be restored.He told the Assembly that it would cost an extra poundm that would come from within existing Stormont finances.Mr Swann met with representatives from a number of leading health trade unions to brief them on the decision, describing the talks as ldquoconstructive.The new man in charge of the Provincersquos health portfolio said the ldquobreakthrough that we all wanted has been achieved this isa good day after some very dficult days.Mr Swann announced that the Department of Health had already gathered together poundm to increase pay for health workers, with an extra poundm being pulled from existing finances at Stormont.His decision to address the pay issue came after a series of strikes involving staff across the health and social services sector over pay and staffing levels.Nurses and other health workers in Northern Ireland have been taking industrial action over pay and staffing levels, with Mr Swann confirming that his officials would work with the unions on the issue of safe staffing levels in the health service and hopes a plan can be drawn up to establish such levels ldquowithin a reasonable period of time.Today, representatives from trade unions representing nurses and all health and social services staff will meet with Department of Health officials, with Mr Swann hoping for a ldquoswt end to their industrial action.He added: ldquoOur nurses and great social care workers can come off the picket-line.Prior to yesterdayrsquos announcement, local nurses said that they hoped that theof Stormont would pave the way for the pay parity and staffing issues to be finally addressed.Ahead of yesterdayrsquos meeting, the RCN said while welcoming the restoration of the Stormont administration, nurses had been made many promises.The RCNrsquos Northern Ireland Director, Pat Cullen, said nurses wanted to see those promises converted into action.Last Wednesday and Friday, nurses based at the Downpatrick hospitals took part in the latest round of stoppages and were buoyed by the support of passing motorists and others as they manned the picket-line at the entrance to the Downshire Civic Centre.Braving bitterly cold conditions last Friday morning, nurses were hoping for positive news from Stormont, hours after Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney had published the New Decade New Approach document.Nurses, who had sacriced another dayrsquos pay, were joined at one stage on the picket-line by South Eastern Trust interim chief executive Seamus McGoran and Roisin Coulter, the organisationrsquos director of planning.Nurses said that they hoped that the political parties would go back into government and that their demands for pay parity and safe staffing levels would be met.ldquoWe believe that the collective pressure of health service staff has ensured that politicians know that they must get back to Stormont, said nurse Irene Murray.ldquoWe do not want to be used as political pawns and hope that there is cross-party agreement for politicians to get back to work. While pay parity and safe services are key issues for us, the key thing is that there are enough recurrent resources in place to deliver this now and in the future.Irene said the RCN is about putting patients first, describing the scale of the hospital waiting list issue as ldquounacceptable.She added: ldquoEmploying more nurses can help bring waiting lists down. This is not a new phenomena. It is tough to work as a nurse and it is not an easy job. But we currently have a situation where some nurses are taking on extra shts to earn more money, but that is just an unacceptable way to live.Alison Megarry said patients are nursesrsquo primary concern and at the heart of what they do, highlighting the need to keep staff working in Northern Ireland to ensure they donrsquot go across the water and donrsquot come back.She revealed that she was talking to a nursing sister last week who was working on international recruitment for nurses in Mumbai to work in Northern Ireland.ldquoThe nurses in India said why would they come here when the pay is less than it is in England, Scotland and Wales. I believe thatwe can keep our nurses here, it will help to tackle the waiting list issue, she said. ldquoThe big issue we have is that the population is ageing and people are living longer which therefore impacts on waiting lists.Nurse Sonia McCoubrey said that while pay parity is one issue, additional nurses are also required. She said many newly qualied nurses are choosing to go to England, Scotland or Wales because the money is better.She also said she worries about the safety of newly qualied nurses managing dficult situations and the patients they are caring for.ldquoYou have trolley waits and people lying in corridors. There is no privacy, no dignity and the situation is appalling. You go home at night after a sht burnt out and worried about what you have seen, the nurse added.Nurse Donna Boyd also expressed concern about waiting lists and said she fears that the situation is going to get worse, forcing many people to go private.ldquoIf more money is put into the system nurses are quite happy to do even more to help reduce waiting lists. All nurses go and above what is required of them when they are working, often staying after their scheduled quitting time which is unpaid work, she said.ldquoWith more people going private because of y waiting lists, a lot of the doctors and consultants are taking on private lists which then impacts on the NHS list. I have friends who were nurses who have left the profession to work in supermarkets because they have burnt themselves out. They canrsquot cope with the demands being made on them, she added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th January 2020 Now.jpg","title":"Now is the time for delivery – McGrath  ","story":"THE restoration of the Assembly and Northern Ireland Executive should herald delivery for people at the start of a new decade, according to South Down SDLP MLA Colin McGrath.Mr McGrath was able to take his seat in the Assembly chamber for the first time in three years last Saturday, an occasion which he described as a ldquomomentous day for Northern Ireland and its future.He said that with so many issues staring people in the face including Brexit, y hospital waiting times, workersrsquo rights and wages, welfare issues and an education system in crisis, Northern Ireland needed a restored and fully ing Assembly and Executive to deal with these mammoth issues.The Assemblyman described his partyrsquos decision to re-enter the Executive as an act of ldquotrust and goodwill.He continued: ldquoWe all know the reasons why the last Executive failed and these have been well covered.

Across the resort,  street lights are not working.The figures are available on the NI Direct website under the reporting fault problems menu with other districthot-spots including Ballynahinch where  street lights are currently out of order.Elsewhere,  faults have been reported in Killyleagh, with  brought to the government departmentrsquos attention in Castlewellan and Crossgar. In Saintfield,  faults have been reported.In Ballygowan,  street lights are currently out of order with  and  faults reported in Ardglass and Killough respectively.Sixteen street lights are out of order in Dundrum with  faults reported in Drumaness. The figures for the Spa and Clough are  and nine respectively.Last month, the Department for Infrastructure confirmed that its current budget for street lighting repairs was approximately poundm, explaining that the figure was much lower than the pound.m needed to provide a full street lighting repair service.It also revealed that repairs are now generally limited to those that can be carried out by the departmentrsquos internal street lighting workforce which only consists of five full and three part time electricians.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran described the number of reported street light faults across large parts of East Down as ldquoalarming and hopes that the money to expedite much-needed repairs will be earmarked by the new Stormont Executive.He said broken street lights in many areas represent a health and safety issue, explaining that an examination of every town and village across the district will reveal a signicant number of faults.Cllr Curran described faulty street lights as a ldquohot topic with politicians being contacted about the issue on all almost daily basis. He said the legacy of underfunding the roads department has experienced is now clear for all to see.The politician said many will be concerned that the Department for Infrastructure does not have the money it requires to carry out much-needed repairs.ldquoWhile I understand the decision to prioritise emergency repairs, there is no doubt that the alarming figure of almost  faulty street lights across East Down is simply going to increase. Clearly the issue is going to get a lot worse before it gets better, he said.ldquoStreet lights which are not working in areas where elderly people and indeed young families live poses a major problem. A fully working street lighting system provides residents with a sense of security and helps deter would-be criminals.Cllr Curran said that while the new Stormont Executive will inevitably face calls for investment in many key areas including health and education, the Department of Infrastructure also required an injection of funding.He added: ldquoWhile the focus for some will be on major new roads schemes which is understandable, it is clear that the creaking infrastructure the government department is responsible for, including street lighting, requires major cash injection.ldquoThe street lighting issues requires immediate attention. We are still in the grip of winter and several months away from the clearer evenings. Now that we have a local minister in place, I hope to meet her on this issue and other matters of local importance.A spokeswoman for the Department for Infrastructure said that in common with many other parts of the public service, the Department continued to face budget challenges and resources were currently not available to provide for a full street lighting repair service.She added: ldquoDue to this restricted service, outages are taking longer than usual to be repaired.

Some protests descended into thuggery.But for many years, into the s, the full spectrum of unionism – even a moderate, non protesting wing –made clear its contempt for the fact that a formal say in NI had been given to a state that had done little to stop its territory being a base for decades of IRA terrorism.Contrast that with the unionist reaction to the even greater concessions London has given nationalist Ireland in the last three months.The DUP directed little invective towards Boris Johnson, after his second betrayal of them.His first betrayal was last March when he voted for Theresa May’s Brexit deal, months after he came to the DUP conference and explained to the party faithful in explicit terms why the then prime minister’s plan ided the UK.His betrayal of the party this year was even more rapid. At the Tory conference he had toured the membership of the three non English home nations, reaffirming his commitment to the Union. Then he did the same at the DUP reception. At each event, he was cheered by chants of ‘Boris, Boris, Boris’. The next day Mr Johnson’s first offer to Brussels emerged, of a full regulatory borderin the Irish Sea. The DUP backed this on the basis of a Stormont lock, and because NI would remain fully in UK customs territory , which implied a land frontier for the latter .Weeks later, the prime minister not only moved all customs enforcement to the Irish Sea, thus a full internal UK trade barrier, he abandoned the Stormont lock. Worse, he humiliated Nigel Dodds in a packed House of Commons Saturday sitting, implying that he wanted a veto .Stormont deal is yet another shambolic and embarassing  dawn for NI Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Mr Johnson, the man who talked the toughest on Brexit and the Union, acted the weakest. And what did some high profile pro unionist Brexiteers, people who have a UK-wide , do  Apart from angry words in Westminster they never explained the betrayal to people in Great Britain. In an influential Tory inclined publication, just after the PM’s brutal conduct, one friend of unionism wrote complacently that “there can be no doubt of the strength of Boris Johnson’s sincere unionism”.A pro Brexit, pro unionist politician on TV recently welcomed the election victory of Mr Johnson and his ability to progress his Brexit plan but said that he just needed to sort out the Northern Ireland part, ashis Irish Sea border pledge to the EU was easily removed.Another politician said Boris could win back the trust of unionists with a bridge to Scotland.It is understandable that people who have made Brexit as central to their ideology as their unionism find it hard to admit that Mr Johnson, their saviour on the first constitutional goal, has betrayed them on their other one, their unionism. But by suggesting that the PM’s abandonment of his explicit pledges to unionists is a minor, manageable matter sends out a message to influential Conservatives that something almost all top Tories said they would never accept — the economic ide of the UK — is OK.Then, within weeks of this signal of unionist weakness, the unionist response to the worst aspects of this Stormont deal is even worse.On Radio Ulster Talkback this week an Ulster Unionist MLA praised Simon Coveney’s role in the deal —the most interventionist and partisan Irish minister in decades, who told us we must have an Irish language actand who presided over the trashing of the three strands.Another UUP MLA seemed to back the De Souza citizenship case, which has been seized on by nationalists in their latest assault on the Belfast Agreement.But in fairness to those two UUP MLAs, the DUP has most to explain. Their support for the deal was critical to it, and seems to have been secured with little internal dissent.Does that party dispute Jim Allister’s analysis in this newspaper  of the likely scope of the Irish language legislation  If it has its own analysis by a QC of the implications of the coming commissioner’s powers, we will be happy to publish it. The DUP had sight of the deal before smaller parties, so presumably the appearance of a commitment to introduce the Stormont House legacy bodies within  days surprised them as much as everyone .This week Doug Beattie said  he heard Julian Smith tell Sinn Fein’s Gerry Kelly in the talks: ‘We need to discuss the specics on legacy.’After the deal was done, the Sinn Fein finance minister Conor Murphy criticised the extra £ millionallocated for legacy bodies as inadequate.Sinn Fein has for a while demanded the legacy structures be implemented. It suggests that a party once seen as inextricably linked to the IRA believes a mooted Historical Investigations Unitwill damage the security forces, as critics on these pages have warned.Far from Boris Johnson helping unionists after his betrayal of them, as some people close to Tory leaders thought he would, he has let Julian Smith turn the screw.There is not even a clause to stop Sinn Fein toppling Stormont again.After all that, and his Brexit u-turn, Mr Johnson nonchalantly turned up in Stormont on Monday and made an unfunny play on Tony Blair’s ‘hand of history’ remark. He was met by a beaming DUP leader.With the UUP now in the executive, that party’s opposition to legacy and the Irish language act will be ignored. The two governments will say all five parties backed the deal.London and Dublin must think that unionism, apart from Jim Allister, will resist barely anything.Perhaps this is all due to a defeatist mindset — that continual concessions to nationalism are needed to stay in the Union.For now, executive positions and Stormont patronage are back — until the next republican demands.When that happens, their demands might be backed by non unionist parties. They will be backed by the full weight of the Irish state. And London, pushed by the NIO, will be ‘neutral’ but in fact do all it can to facilitate the said demands.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editor• Jim Allister: Irish language legislation could facilitate aggressive agenda that DUP won’t be able to veto• Ben Lowry: A major political row is brewing over legacy©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"coi minister has set himself against the word of god over gay pride  ","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Publishing Ltd#s standard Terms and Conditions.

It is understood that several councils have already received registrations.While the Mid and East Antrim council meeting was held in private, the News Letter understands that some members were strongly opposed to accepting a policy which would compel staff to carry out same sex marriages against their wishes.Alderman Paul Reid, pictured, who is also a church minister in Larne, said: “I can’t go into the specics of the meeting or the discussions that took place in closed council.“However, speaking generally this is an issue affecting the whole of Northern Ireland and each of our  council areas. This has everything to do with same-sex marriage, and at the same time nothing to do with same-sex marriage.“This is an issue of conscience. Just because legal advice says something is ok, doesn’t mean it is right for councils to enforce on staff. Religious beliefs don’t come into it.“While the General Registrars’ Office believes there to be no issue legally, it is absolutely wrong to force people to carry out duties which are at odds with their conscience.”Because couples have to indicate their intention to marry  days before doing so, the first same sex weddings are expected to be held next month.Last year MPs backed amendments which required the government to extend same-sex marriage here.Sam McBride: Ignoring an elegant solution, petition of concern reform undermines Belfast Agreement Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingPassengers were sobbing and making calls to loved ones - Aer Lingus pilot hailed miraculous after landing plane during Storm BrendanStorm Brendan NI BLOG: Widespread disruption, roads closed, coastal flooding and power outagesWill it snow in February   Northern Ireland weather forecast as widespread frost and cooler temperatures expectedBelfast Celtic defend Jay Donnelly signingThis time its tears of happiness - Cate Conway shares hilarious Stephen Clements prank video involving leopard print leggings        v.. -  applyImgSrcs\" i sb  for   sb* sb u  o.dataset.srcu  u.replaceo.setAttributeo.setAttributedocumentwindowapplyImgSrcs JP  JP  JP  \"NA-BELFNEWS-\"JP  \"Politics\"      Follow Us On       Explore News Sport Irish League Football Whats On Lestyle   Farming Le   More from the Belfast News Letter  Announcements Buy a Photo  Directory Jobs Homes Cars Local Guide  Public Notices  Reader Shop Must Read Read This Events   Useful Links Contact Us   Place your Ad Advertise a Job Subscribe  Readers Charter        ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"traffic and travel","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Publishing Ltd#s standard Terms and Conditions.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Sadly, these ldquowins have not been quick, yet to become a reality.Penarth commuters are still being shuttled into work each morning on overcrowded pacers, and this is simply not good enough. The new rolling stock we were promised seems many years away, when the reality is we need it now. Welsh Government need to pull their finger out and sort this out. Transport is their responsibility and they need to get a grip of the situation.The controversial Barry incinerator is a saga that seems to be rumbling on and on. I have long held deep concerns about the site, with the minister responsible for making the decision indicating almost two years ago she was ldquominded to insist an Environmental Impact Assessment be carried out.This week in the Assembly, I raised these concerns yet again, and the minister confirmed that an Environmental Statement has been submitted by the developer and is currently being reviewed. She claimed NRW are monitoring compliance throughout the testing phase, and that this is the latest position.Locally, there have been several apparently unconfirmed rumours that the site will be up and running in a matter of days, and I was disappointed the minister failed to give a categorical answer on this. I have always said the site is wholly unsuitable, and the Welsh Assembly have let local people down in their handling of this.I was very pleased last week to see a statement from Cardf and the Vale Health Board dropping controversial plans to close the Sam Davies ward at Barry Hospital. Under the proposals, the  bed ward was to close, with services transferred to the Heath and Llandough. While I welcome the announcement, they also confirmed new proposals will be brought forward this week. Given the statement did not include explicit commitment to keep the ward open, I fear we will see a rehashed version of the same plans in the near future.

Sadly, these ldquowins have not been quick, yet to become a reality.Penarth commuters are still being shuttled into work each morning on overcrowded pacers, and this is simply not good enough. The new rolling stock we were promised seems many years away, when the reality is we need it now. Welsh Government need to pull their finger out and sort this out. Transport is their responsibility and they need to get a grip of the situation.The controversial Barry incinerator is a saga that seems to be rumbling on and on. I have long held deep concerns about the site, with the minister responsible for making the decision indicating almost two years ago she was ldquominded to insist an Environmental Impact Assessment be carried out.This week in the Assembly, I raised these concerns yet again, and the minister confirmed that an Environmental Statement has been submitted by the developer and is currently being reviewed. She claimed NRW are monitoring compliance throughout the testing phase, and that this is the latest position.Locally, there have been several apparently unconfirmed rumours that the site will be up and running in a matter of days, and I was disappointed the minister failed to give a categorical answer on this. I have always said the site is wholly unsuitable, and the Welsh Assembly have let local people down in their handling of this.I was very pleased last week to see a statement from Cardf and the Vale Health Board dropping controversial plans to close the Sam Davies ward at Barry Hospital. Under the proposals, the  bed ward was to close, with services transferred to the Heath and Llandough. While I welcome the announcement, they also confirmed new proposals will be brought forward this week. Given the statement did not include explicit commitment to keep the ward open, I fear we will see a rehashed version of the same plans in the near future. It has not been a good month for the Welsh NHS, with recent figures confirming wait times were joint worst on record. Irsquom calling for a cast iron guarantee from them that under the revised plans, the ward will remain open. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

While policy decisions have yet to be made, heat pumps are the indicated preference.ldquoOver % of oil heated homes in Great Britain fall into EPC bands D to G ndash meaning they are poorly insulated and so unsuited for heat pumps without costly insulation work.ldquoFinancial support to help the poorest families switch heating systems would most likely be made available but many households will be expected to fund the work themselves.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Diverging substantiallywill bring in the requirement for inspections at the border for customs. “That hasn’t been agreed formally. That is quite a lot for UK and NI operators to deal with – haulage and freight movers, to get to grips with that. There are major operational challenges.“Northern Ireland also leave the customs union with GB, but there will be a customs border will between GB and NI to continue to essentially allow freight and good to travel.”Since Boris Johnson’s deal was floated, it’s understood the shipping industry is now drawing up plans for EU border checks in Britain for trade bound for Northern Ireland.According to the BBC, freight could be erted through ports with space for inspections at areas such as Liverpool and Stranraer.Richard says checks are likely to be carried out at the ports. The issue  He says backlogs, queues and congestion. “ to queueing back on to ferries and ships, which may miss or mess up timetables,” he says. He says while “many wouldn’t welcome new formalities”, a lot of cargo – such as dry bulk, fuel, aggregates and containerised products –  will find it reasonably easy to deal with. The main concern is around ‘roll on, roll off’, where the containers or lorries are driven on board a ship.“Those modes are where it could be the most problematic, as it’s based on a fluid process,” he says.“I think there is a definite concern from ports and shipping industries that businesses may be impacted negatively, and may reassess business operations.“I wouldn’t say it’s a doomsday scenario but it’s a real challenge for the sector to overcome. Politicians will have to make sure that with any kind of arrangements, there will be a good solution. This is a new proposal, so we are unsure what the details will be.”Brexit aside, Richard says the industry as a whole is that while the largely commercial and independent ports aren’t in need of ‘hand outs’ from the public sector, areas such as connectivity, roads and planning are key to their success.“It’s about making sure the planning system works, and is swt, and responsive,” he said. “They can be agile, for example, building a new shed, terminal or quay, or new developments in the water.“Where there are environmental sensitivities it can sometimes slow down the planning regimes so we are keen to see them not slow down. We welcome environmental policies but we want a scheme that will work and doesn’t have unintended consequences.“Shipping, although not perfect, is one of the most clean and efficient methods of transport. It’s a balance between environmental protection, but enabling ports and regions to grow.“If there are schemes, ports can find there are investors willing to come in, but they do rely on government – local or national – to finance road and rail connectivity.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/year1.jpg","title":"yearbook a look back at ","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business It was another year shaped by political turmoil and the loss of some giants of industry, but it was also a period which saw great opportunity and growth.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/234234343334.jpg","title":"stormont deal business back new assembly","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith and Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Pic Kelvin Boyes Northern Ireland’s business community has given its support for a deal which has seen the Assembly up-and-running after a three year stasis. The Northern Ireland Assembly couldon Fridaypolitical parties back a deal tabled by the UK and Irish Governments. DUP leader Arlene Foster has indicated that her party will back the deal, while Sinn Fein said its leadership will meet to discuss it on Friday. The UUP has said they will consider the deal, but are willing to attend the Assemblyit sits. In a joint statement urging politicians to accept the ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal, NI Chamber president John Healy, vice president Ian Henry, and chief executive Ann McGregor, said: “After three years of paralysis, we now have a workable deal that will allow an Executive to start addressing the problems within our health service and education system. They will also be able to take action to grow our economy and support the community and voluntary sector. “We therefore encourage the five main political parties to progress it urgently. Business, health and education cannot wait any longer - failure is not an option. “Now is the time for our politicians to show mature leadership and help navigate a path to the future by accepting this deal.” Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney published the New Decade, New Approach deal on Thursday evening and urged parties to back it andto Stormont on Friday. Reacting to the news, Trade NI – the alliance of Retail NI, Manufacturing NI and Hospitality Ulster – said: “We welcome the draft deal published by the British and Irish Governments in the final round of talks to restore devolution. We strongly encourage all the main parties of Northern Ireland to sign the deal today and get the Assembly back up and running.” “As our three organisations represent the majority of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland, we are cautiously hopeful that the deal and aof the Assembly will see the development of policies and legislation at devolved level and the kick start that our economy desperately needs. The clear prioritisation of the Northern Ireland economy highlights the many challenges that businesses have faced over the past three years and our message to the parties is that we support you in your endeavours to secure this deal.” “While this is a good start, improvements are still needed to drive the economy forward and support the growth of business across Northern Ireland. As stated in our Vision  document, Northern Ireland’s potential is signicant but reform and growth is needed to create the modern economy we are capable of and deserve.” FSB NI policy chair, Tina McKenzie, said: “Businesses will welcome the agreement published last night as a step forward towards restoring devolved government, something for which FSB has been calling since the collapse of the institutions three years ago. “The draft agreement contains some positive commitments to bolster the local economy, on issues like skills, infrastructure and Brexit. However, theof devolution is by no means a panacea it just means that at long last we have elected representatives in place to tackle a very dficult task. “The next Executive must move quickly to deliver on the myriad issues which have been left unaddressed for far too long. While the health service will be high on the agenda, we must not lose sight of the need to bolster our SME economy, which is the absolute bedrock on which the first-class public services to which we all aspire are built. “Ministers must move swtly to support our economy at one of the most turbulent times for many decades, starting by lowering the rates burden on small businesses, whilst also moving forward rapidly with key infrastructure projects which have stalled and ensuring that our schools, colleges, and universities are providing students with the skills they need for the jobs of the future. “In order to begin to address these issues, the parties must put pragmatism first and get back round the Executive table.” Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster, said: “We encourage all parties to seize this opportunity and sign up to the deal published late last night to get the Assembly and Executive back as quickly as possible.” “This is the best chance to bring the devolved government back to le. Our message to the party leaders is clear, we support you in your endeavours and encourage you to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line today. Redmond McFadden, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce said: “The Londonderry Chamber as well as other representatives of business, education, health, trade unions and civic organisations, held a meeting with the five main political parties at Stormont last night. “At that meeting we pressed the urgent need for the parties to agree the draft deal which was published by the British and Irish Governments. Three years without Ministers making local decisions has had an enormous impact on our economy and wider society. A lack of effective and meaningful representation here is curtailing investment in our region, stling job creation and driving our young people away. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, said: “Belfast Chamber welcomes progress towards the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and encourages the local political parties to reach agreement. For the last three years, our members have seen how an absence of decision making has stunted growth and stled investment. The proposed priorities for the Executive contain some issues which Belfast Chamber has been supportive of for some time. “Other policies which could boost our economy are noticeably missing but we look forward to joining with our colleagues across the business community to ensure that the new Executive pursues an agenda that grows jobs and boosts our economy.” Northern Ireland Local Government Association chief executive, Derek McCallan said: “I am very pleased that the British and Irish governments have tabled a draft deal on restoring the NI Executive. I hope that an agreement can be reached quickly to get the Stormont institutions back up and running immediately. For three years, our eleven local councils have been the only ing form of democratically elected government in Northern Ireland. Local government has been a vital democratic anchor during this period and ensured the provision of crucial public services for local citizens. “It’s time to bridge the democratic deficit and unlock the potential of local government in Northern Ireland by investing in our local councils. An Executive commitment to a devolution bill and greater financial powers and resources will drive a transformation in Northern Ireland’s democratic governance and help create a more sustainable democracy, environment and economy for Northern Ireland.” Kirsty McManus, national director, IoD NI, said: “The ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal is to be welcomed, filled with ambition that,fulfilled, can deliver real improvements for the people and businesses of Northern Ireland. “We would therefore urge all parties to get behind the deal to enable the speedy restoration of the Executive. “Commitments from the British and Irish governments for some crucial pieces of infrastructure such as the York Street Interchange, upgrades to the A and A road and Northern Ireland’s wastewater network are particularly pleasing. “The expansion of university provision at the Magee campus in Derry meanwhile will go some way to rebalancing the regional economy. “Plans for multi-year budgets and increased civic engagement will also improve overall governance. “From a business perspective however, we would have liked to have seen more around a new skills agenda, which urgently require focus alongside a renewed look at the Apprenticeship Levy which is not included in this deal. “On behalf of our members, we will also monitor closely commitments to bring forward legislation that will allow unfettered access to the Great Britain market for local business following Brexit.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_Abacus-Grand-Central-1--1-.jpg","title":"belfastforlife expo bringing together ni diaspora","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by Ulster Business A new event will bring together the Northern Ireland diaspora and business community in a bid to promote and develop the region.
