Ghost gear can be limited by making boats register their equipment, and return with it or be fined: if it is broken it can be recycled. Tagging it with GPS locators would also discourage dumping.Sustainable fishing is possible, though the film goes out of its way to decry it, and stocks can bounce back. Take the Patagonian toothfish, known as ‘white gold’ in the trade — since it can fetch $100 a gram — and marketed as the more appealing ‘Chilean sea bass’. Once close to collapse, its fishery has been returned to health.Closer to home, stopping trawling and dredging in favour of less destructive fishing in Lyme Bay, agreed between local fisherman and the Blue Marine Foundation, has brought an almost fourfold increase in the abundance of commercially valuable fish. In the last weeks, ministers banned trawling in over 304 sq km off Sussex.Marine reserves can also make a big difference. Even ones that allow some fishing have, one study found, doubled fish biomass, while ‘no-take zones’ where fishing is banned have multiplied it more than sixfold. This even benefits fishermen by increasing their catches, as life spills out of the protected areas into waters where fishing continues.Lobsters and king scallops have increased fourfold in a once devastated ‘no-take’ zone, established by local demand, off the Scottish Isle of Arran in 2008.So far, less than 5 per cent of the world’s oceans are protected. This needs to increase to 30 per cent over the next decade.A Global Ocean Treaty — to be discussed at a UN meeting in August — offers an opportunity, if done well enough, to tackle the fishing industry globally, and to protect the oceans by 2030.The Government is alive to the crisis of the oceans. It, and its predecessors, have done well in establishing giant reserves in all of the world’s main oceans.Now it needs to do much more in increasing reserves, promoting truly sustainable fishing worldwide, and ending pollution by discarded fishing gear.It is a shame that Seaspiracy is failing to use its enormous impact to help bring about such changes.But maybe now that it has sensitised so many to the problems, others can come in with the real solutions."},{"url":null,"title":"UK set damp dreary weekend lockdown sun shine Monday","story":"Share this article   As for providing music to try and create a convivial atmosphere, there\u0027s more regulations for publicans to wade through. Only a limited number of live performers can perform, they must remain two metres apart, singers must not be too loud in case it encourages patrons to raise their voices (chance would be a fine thing), they can only perform for a limited amount of time. As for that old idea of \u0027having a knees up and a sing-a-long\u0027 to celebrate the end of lockdown - forget it.

Pubs can\u0027t survive at half capacity and by only serving cheap beer. These rules favour the big chains like Wetherspoons and so a special part of British culture will be stamped out by the health and safety brigade.In the meantime, are we that starved of human contact that we\u0027ll settle for lukewarm food in arctic conditions? The government has two choices - make a trip to the pub a decent experience, one that accepts the limitations of our weather - or admit that most pubs (in their present format) are like the British High Street and have had their day."},{"url":null,"title":"British political leaders pay tribute Prince Philip","story":"Share this article Buckingham Palace said in a statement: \u0027It is with deep sorrow that Her Majesty The Queen announces the death of her beloved husband, His Royal Highness The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.\u0027His Royal Highness passed away peacefully this morning at Windsor Castle.\u0027Further announcements will made in due course.\u0027The Royal Family join with people around the world in mourning his loss.\u0027The death of the duke comes in the midst of the worst public health crisis for generations as the UK and countries around the globe reel from the devastating impact of the coronavirus pandemic.It has also taken place in the aftermath of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u0027s bombshell Oprah interview which left the monarchy in crisis after Meghan accused an unnamed royal of racism and the institution of failing to help her when she was suicidal.Philip had returned to Windsor Castle on March 16 to be reunited with the Queen after spending a month in hospital – his longest ever stay.He initially received care for an infection but then underwent heart surgery for a pre-existing condition.The duke had looked gaunt as he was driven away from King Edward VII\u0027s Hospital in central London, having been pushed in a wheelchair to the waiting car.Philip – father to the Prince of Wales, the Princess Royal, the Duke of York and the Earl of Wessex – was just two months away from his 100th birthday in June.He spent much of the Covid-19 crisis staying with the Queen at Windsor in HMS Bubble – the nickname given to the couple\u0027s reduced household of devoted staff during lockdown."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70dc35f1a64aea683cd66b3edea144d7de60cfd9/0_557_3672_2202/master/3672.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=c8cf432cdcbd120e98fcdaa64eac6c4d","title":"stocks markets wall street record ftse 100 travel airlines holidays coronavirus covid 19 business live","story":"Today the pound came within a whisker of a two-month low, before recovering slightly.

Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets, an investment platform, said: Across Europe things have brightened somewhat. The Dax in Germany is in positive territory, despite meagre industrial production data and signs of further movement restrictions ahead. France’s Cac 40 is also ticking along smoothly. As Jet2’s chief executive noted today, there is a lot of uncertainty over what exactly will be allowed and when. Airlines prospects are essentially in the hands of ministers. James Martin, the British Chambers of Commerce director of policy, gave the government’s plan a very qualified thumbs-up:  On the broadcast rounds this morning Grant Shapps, the transport minister, said he would work with private companies to cut the costs of tests. The tests are “too expensive”, Shapps said. However, action to cut the cost before 17 May would have to be brought in very quickly indeed.Facebook has removed 16,000 groups that traded misleading or fake product reviews after the UK’s competition regulator intervened. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it was the second time it had taken action against the US tech company, after it and eBay, the auction website, agreed in January 2020 to take action against fake reviews. Andrea Coscelli, chief Executive of the CMA, said:  He said the Leeds-headquartered airline, which focuses on serving British holidaymakers with flights to the likes of Alicante, Mallorca and Tenerife, had suspended flights up to 23 June “because of the continued uncertainty that the framework provides”. He was referring to the UK government’s plans to reopen travel, with confirmation of destinations not expected until early May before a restart on 17 May at the earliest. Jet2 will automatically cancel and refund affected passengers. Jet2 will suspend all of its flights and holidays up to and including 23 June due to uncertainty over the the UK government’s travel proposals, its chief executive has said, according to Reuters. Jet2 chief executive Steve Heapy said in a statement on Friday: The UK government has said it will give more clarity at the start of May over whether holidays to certain destinations will be allowed.

You can read the full story here: Jonathan Hopper, chief executive of Garrington Property Finders, said that “many estate agents are now talking of a boom rather than a bounceback”. He said the chancellor’s extension of the stamp duty holiday has given a boost to people who were already planning to buy - but adds that in some parts of the country the rapid pace of price growth has already wiped out the advantage of the tax cut. That is a well known phenomenon for stamp duty cuts. On 19 April the market will receive yet another helping hand in the form of a new mortgage guarantee scheme. Record prices do raise the question of whether the government really needs to be intervening so actively to sustain prices - even before the consideration of house purchases being out of reach for many. Guy Harrington, chief executive of residential lender Glenhawk, said: Is it really true that the housing market can emerge essentially unscathed from a recession of this magnitude? Russell Galley from Halifax appears to think not, in the longer term at least: The average price hit £254,606, according to Halifax, which tracks the prices of house on which it offers mortgages. March was the first house price rise since November, said Russell Galley, Halifax’s managing director. He said: Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING, an investment bank, said: The Liberty Steel owner Sanjeev Gupta has criticised creditors pushing to wind up his business, saying they are risking “tens of thousands” of jobs with “dangerous and cavalier behaviour”. Gupta’s GFG Alliance, the parent company of Liberty Steel, is being pursued in court in the UK and Australia by Credit Suisse. Credit Suisse is trying to recoup money from the collapsed Greensill Capital, the financial firm that extended as much as $5bn (£3.6bn) in loans to GFG. Although Credit Suisse was not named in the article, Gupta said he was prepared to defend claims against his businesses in court if necessary. GFG’s collection of steel, aluminium and energy businesses employ 35,000 people worldwide, with 5,000 in the UK - about 3,000 of which are in Liberty Steel.  Gupta said the business’s greatest challenges were in the UK because of its reliance on the aerospace and automotive markets, where demand has fallen during the pandemic. He also pledged to overhaul the way his businesses are financed. Gupta has been scrambling to find new lenders since Greensill collapsed, but has so far not secured any backing. Credit Suisse declined to comment.Stock markets around the world have continued their push into uncharted territory in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic shock. The MSCI World index, the US benchmark S\u0026ampP 500 and the large-cap European index, the Stoxx 600, all hit record highs on Thursday. European stock markets are (for the most part) expected to follow up this morning, albeit with gentle gains. The Federal Reserve’s loose stance on monetary policy, the pace of vaccine rollouts and hopes for a spending blowout from consumers with big savings are all helping. Concerns about variants of the coronavirus do not appear to be getting much of a look-in. Deutsche Bank analysts led by Henry Allen and Jim Reid said: There’s more feeling of what JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon described as a Goldilocks economy (comments that just beg for bear metaphors to counteract them). Ian Williams, an analyst at Peel Hunt, a stockbroker, said: Looking ahead for today, in the UK the travel industry is eagerly awaiting the government’s new plan to allow holidays abroad this summer. Airlines have been hammering home their desire to get Britons flying again soon, and their complaint that mandatory testing for travellers will price families out.

The three clubs have encouraged their players to do the same and feel not enough is being done by social media companies to stamp out racist and abusive messages.  On Tavernier: “I’d say he’s got an outside chance, James, of being involved against Celtic. He is still outside in a one-v-one capacity with the physio but he is progressing pretty well.” On Ryan Jack: “In terms of Ryan (calf), we are waiting on some news today, we have been back and forth with a couple of specialists over the last couple of days.

Myself and Jack were quite optimistic to get him back a bit sooner than he probably should and he’s had a setback that will probably put him back a couple of weeks.”Bad, bad news for Villa, despite that win last week over Fulham. Good news for Liverpool. Bavarian premier Markus Söder on Munich: “It’s been shown that players get infected again and again. Therefore in a big stadium, Europe-wide with a lot of mobility. Whether that’s a good idea, I would have to doubt.”The Spanish FA (RFEF) on Bilbao: “Yesterday we received the requirements the Basque government imposed in order to have crowds at the European Championship and from the first instance one could see they would be impossible for the federation to accept.”And also, clubs are now taking a stand against social media companies’ refusal to stop the flow of abuse that players have to deal with. Swansea and Rangers are leading the way, with others sure to follow.  And of course, there’s a weekend of red-hot Premier League action after what has been a red-hot week of Euro action. How might Liverpool and Arsenal lick their wounds after chastening experiences? It was a better midweek for Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United, with the middle of that trio able to take another inexorable step towards the title when they face Leeds on Saturday lunchtime. Expect the phrase “wow, guys, Stuart Dallas” come from Pep Guardiola’s lips as he blushes in the presence of Marcelo Bielsa. Also on Saturday, there’s also the latest riddle of Jack Grealish’s shin, as Liverpool play Aston Villa at Anfield. Then it’s Crystal Palace v Chelsea, where Tactics Tom Tuchel will hope to make up for last week’s pumping by West Brom. Sunday sees football as the winner as Burnley face Newcastle, before West Ham’s push for the top four sees them against one of their rivals in Leicester.  The biggest game - though only on paper - looks to be Tottenham welcoming Manchester United on Sunday. There is bad blood there, and that’s just José Mourinho and his Spurs players (or so it has been reported). After that, Arsenal can try and make up for their Slavia Prague wobble by winning at Sheffield United. There’s two games on Monday, too, as seems to be the way these days. Can Big Sam really pull West Brom out of the mire? They will have to beat Southampton. And it’s a another blue Monday as Everton, gunning for seventh once more, travel to Brighton.  What else?

For Mandira Sarkar, owner of Mandira’s Kitchen, and deluxe doughnut makers Project D, pivoting quickly has become almost as much of an art form as their products. Sarkar’s business, launched in 2016, is based in a converted 16th-century barn outbuilding overlooking the picturesque Silent Pool lake near Guildford, Surrey. With an all-female (“except for one very brave man”) staff of 20, it produces home-style freezer meals – authentic, healthy dishes such as watercress dal and chicken xacuti, plus a range of samosas and biryanis. The business has a catering service, an onsite cafe and shop, and a cookery school. Pre-pandemic, it also offered spice tours for groups keen to learn about Indian flavours, followed by a meal in the cafe. But Mandira’s Kitchen has had to adapt almost every component of its operations. When they had to close their kiosks, the team had to completely rethink their business model. “We initially furloughed our 26 members of staff,” says Poynton. A few weeks later, though, as public demand for baking essentials skyrocketed, they brought them all back – Project D’s access to local farms had put them in a good position to sell eggs, flour and yeast. “We got our gazebo out and we were popping up in village car parks and town square car parks. We had hour-long queues for eggs. Looking back, it was really insane,” Poynton says. Once given council permission to sell doughnuts alongside the other staple essentials, they also started a doughnut delivery service, which has continued to attract high demand. Sarkar, too, remembers panicking “for about two days”, but then she and her team quickly got to work. Farm shops – the main customers of their freezer meals – were themselves struggling, so she began to market to inidual customers instead. Launching a brand new website, Sarkar pushed out the message that their tasty, healthy meals were perfect to have at home, and available at the click of a button. Local orders were soon followed by UK-wide demand. Sarkar kept innovating. First she enhanced her click-and-collect service, offering weekend thali feasts, a three-course meal complete with a Bollywood playlist, a quiz on India, and takeaway picnic baskets. They began to collaborate with a nearby vineyard and gin distillery, offering meals with accompanying wine, and jointly marketing to customers against the backdrop of the growing consumer movement to buy locally. Sarkar is also leading a weekly free cooking lesson that people can follow on Instagram Live. A special kit of six spice blends can be ordered beforehand to ensure the outcome is authentic. All these adaptations, says Sarkar, have resulted in their pandemic-era sales far outstripping the previous year’s. Both Sarkar and Project D mention the importance of persevering even when the going gets tough. “We’ve always had the attitude of never giving up,” says Bond. “We have this dream, this project, which we hold so dearly. And when that was nearly taken away from us, with everything that we put in, we weren’t ready to give up.” Strong branding was also key to Project D, who sold eggs using trays in their signature bubblegum pink. Their scooter, mini pickup truck, forklift and even the floors of their new bakery are all painted in the same shade. Although difficult in a pandemic, planning ahead as best as they can has also been an important element of their success. As the end of the Brexit transition period loomed, the team stockpiled some of their ingredients. “And we were right to do that, because some of our wholesalers actually ran out of some of our key ingredients,” says Poynton. For both of these independent food businesses, the past year has been hectic, often stressful, but in the end, hugely rewarding. For Sarkar, it has sometimes meant 18- or 19-hour days at work. “You can probably see the bags under our eyes,” she says. “But we’ve constantly, every day, innovated, adapted and been flexible at every single stage.” "},{"url":null,"title":"from diy kits to sustainable bespoke furniture meet the businesses reshaping interior design","story":"Given this, the digital video meetings we’ve all become used to can only take a designer so far. Nonetheless, the sector itself is proving resilient eight out of 10 people, according to a survey conducted by the Royal Institute of British Architects (Riba) in October, wanted to change their homes as soon as it was safe to do so. “The impact of Covid-19 will affect how and where we choose to live for years to come,” says Riba president Alan Jones. “For many of us, our homes are our sanctuaries, and this research indicates that many people are keener than ever to adapt and improve their homes.” Many interior designers across the UK report an increase in the number of new clients they have taken on. But as the process relies so heavily on being physically present in a space, they have had to adapt. Zoe Hewett is no stranger to finding creative ways around problems. When she first started her interior design business, Stylemongers of Bristol, the former set designer for theatre and TV productions lacked the funds to make over her own home to serve as a showcase – so instead she built a doll’s house to demonstrate her style. As a result of the pandemic, Hewett scaled back her face-to-face work, but has still found ways of expanding her business – one of which is a range of interior design kits to help people design their own homes. “At first, I was thinking about making my services accessible,” she says. “A one-to-one design consultation is worth doing for a bespoke service, but it’s always going to be out of reach for some people, so I wanted to offer something affordable, at a price point more people could afford.” The pandemic meant the project became a priority for her business, and the packs became a reality. “I may have created an envelope-stuffing role for myself,” she says. “But I love that people are getting something physical and tangible to work with.” The packs are made of recycled card and paper and are delivered in letterbox-sized packages. Hewett sees them as a way of sharing the information and techniques that she previously discussed in face-to-face workshops, where she would guide groups through the principles of interior design – from creating moodboards to where to place furniture. They contain, among other things, quizzes to help buyers explore design choices, advice on using colour and materials to create 2D-scale layouts of rooms, plus a link to an ebook with further information. Hewett says the take-up of the £50 kits has been “pretty good. I hope people find them fun as well as useful. One lady who bought one said she’s using it again with her seven-year-old to reimagine their shed. Her daughter’s got really into it, apparently.” From each commission, Hewett makes a donation to the homeless charity Crisis. “Creating nice places is what drives me,” she says. “So it makes sense to me to also help people who haven’t got anywhere to live yet.” The community focus is also important to Liselle Milner of Zenterior Design, based in St Austell, Cornwall. She works with 12 others, including builders, carpenters and upholsterers, to create indoor and outdoor spaces and bespoke furniture, all with a focus on using sustainable materials. Much of her work involves second homes or holiday lets, so the owners have not been able to travel to meet her. “We’ve always focused on the relationship with the client, getting an idea of exactly what it is they want and then making that happen, so to never meet someone face-to-face has been very odd,” she says. “Although, if you are talking to someone via Zoom, there is the advantage of seeing their house in the background, so it’s a very quick way of seeing what they already like.” Milner uses a lot of secondhand or upcycled furniture – “I want the space to look as amazing as possible for the budget we have” – but her pre-pandemic visits to charity shops and auctions have been replaced by Facebook Marketplace, and ever-greater resourcefulness as a team. “We’re looking at things we would usually outsource, like quilting, for example, and thinking: ‘Can we do that ourselves?’” she says. “It’s good creatively, and it also means we can keep to a schedule. Big furniture retailers have set specifics they work to. If a piece is made of oak, and if the oak isn’t there, then that sofa won’t be with you in 12 weeks’ time. But if we are making it, then we can use beech or another suitable wood that we can actually get hold of.” Besides changing their ways of working to comply with pandemic-related restrictions, such as visiting sites inidually instead of together, the Zenterior team have also adapted some of the other physical parts of their jobs, finding ways to keep to social distancing rules, and have stopped working on occupied domestic properties. Milner has also doubled down on Zenterior’s commitment to using local suppliers, not only to avoid delays with supply chains but also from a sense of local responsibility, as the regional tourism sector has been hit especially hard by restrictions on movement. “And there’s also the fact that Cornwall has always been a hub for artists and creative people. It makes sense to work with people who are here,” says Milner. The pandemic may have affected their traditional ways of working for now, but both Milner and Hewett are determined that its lasting effects on our homes are sustainably positive.

Wedding receptions outdoors for up to 30 people will be allowed from 26 April, also moving forward a week.  The changes have been prompted by a fall in Covid cases, according to the Welsh government.This will be reviewed regularly, taking into account factors such as Covid infection rates, the prevalence of variants, and the extent of vaccination programmes.  The restrictions for each tier of the system will be looked at for potential changes on 28 June, 31 July and 1 October.

People arriving in England from green-list countries will have to take a pre-departure virus test and a PCR test on the day after their return, but will not need to self-isolate or take any other tests. While doing the media rounds this morning, Shapps, who said he wants to drive down the cost of Covid tests required for international travel to resume, told Sky News: Many in the travel industry have reacted with disappointment to the need to test, even from green-list countries, with warnings the requirements could make holidays unaffordable for many. People coming from amber-list countries will have to take a pre-departure test, isolate for 10 days at home, and get tested on days two and eight after their journey.  From red-listed destinations, passengers will have to pay for a 10-day stay in a managed quarantine hotel, as well as a pre-departure test and two PCR tests  Criticising the government’s double testing requirement for returning travellers, the Heathrow chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, told BBC Breakfast: The government has not yet said which countries will be green, amber or red - but said it would do by early May.

Since then, over 200,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,000 people have died.Globally, over 100 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.NEWS AND UPDATES: - How many have been vaccinated here?Scientists have been racing to develop a vaccine that would bring an end to the pandemic, and there are now 64 different vaccines in clinical development, with another 173 in preclinical development, according to the World Health Organisation.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspis also in talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva. 282,043 had received their second dose.Some 189,808 of these vaccines had gone to people in long term residential care facilities, while 339,617 had gone to frontline healthcare workers and 380,650 had gone to people over the age of 70. Some\u0026nbsp51,483 people in Cohort 4 - those\u0026nbspaged between 16 and 69 at very high risk of severe Covid-19 disease - received a dose.\u0026nbspGlobally, over 700 million doses of a Covid-19 vaccine have been administered.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 5.4 million doses by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc. While talks continue on how to increase production, the company has now committed to a total of 40 million doses for the EU in the first quarter of 2021.While the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab, resulting in a significant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.On March 11th Norwegian health authorities said three health workers in Norway who had recently received the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine were being treated in hospital for bleeding, blood clots and a low count of blood platelets.Norway halted the rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine, following a similar move by Denmark. Iceland later followed suit.On Thursday, March 18th, the EMA announced it had found\u0026nbspno causal link between the vaccine and blood-clotting events and use of the vaccine\u0026nbspresumed on Saturday March 20th in Ireland.How many will Ireland get? 190,000 doses in February and a further 95,000 in early March - supply after this is not confirmed.Storage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and expects to have its first results by April 2021. On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?In December the HSE published the provisional order in which people in Ireland will be vaccinated against Covid-19. After over-65s in care homes and frontline health workers, people aged 70 and older and other healthcare workers are next in line to receive the vaccine.\u0026nbspPeople aged 16-69 with very high risk conditions will then be\u0026nbspthe fourth cohort to be vaccinated.On March 30th, the Cabinet agreed to change the National Vaccination Programme to an age-based system, once those aged 70 years and older, people considered vulnerable and those with underlying conditions are immunised. The original programme involved 15 cohorts of people based on age and profession, with key workers prioritised.The vaccination of people aged over 85 began on Monday, February 15th. Those in the 70-84 age bracket began to receive their first dose on March 8th, alongside people aged 16-69 with very high risk conditions.The HSE has said everyone over the age of 70 should have received their second dose by mid-May.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4532347.1617910573!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"covid 19 shops most commonly visited places listed by people later infected","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSince March 31st, contact tracers investigating confirmed cases have been going back seven days instead of two days.  File photograph: Alan Betson The first comprehensive study of community transmission of Covid-19 in the State has identified shops as the most likely source of infection. Since March 31st, contact tracers investigating confirmed cases have been going back seven days instead of two days in an attempt to identify how people got infected. Of the 3,476 positive cases since then, 787 (22 per cent) were as a result of community transmission, where the source of infection is not known. More than 60 per cent of these community transmission cases were recorded in Dublin. Of those who did not know the source of their infection, 55.8 per cent mentioned shops as the most likely place they would have picked up the disease in the previous seven days. This was followed by workplaces (15.6 per cent), primary schools (3.8 per cent), public transport or car sharing (3.5 per cent), travel at home or abroad (2 per cent), outdoor gatherings (1.9 per cent), pre-school gatherings (1.8 per cent) and outdoor sports activities (1.7 per cent).Almost 9 per cent listed “other” as being a potential source not listed on the Health Service Executive (HSE) questionnaire and seven people said they knew no possible source of transmission.Niamh O’Beirne, the HSE’s national lead for track and trace, said the findings of the contract tracers do not mean that shops are necessarily unsafe environments. “All the list tells you is where people were. It does not tell you that you got it there. The high numbers from shops reflect where people have been,” she said.“Having identified possible sources, we have to then go further and identify the actual sources.” The number of those stating they tested positive after attending social gatherings such as funerals, birthday parties, hairdressers or salons was too small to be measured. Ms O’Beirne said if a person believed they were infected at a social gathering, that social gathering is investigated and it usually leads to other cases. As the source of infection is then known, it is not included among the community transmission cases. The Covid-19 walk-in test centres tested 25,413 people at 14 centres nationwide. Finglas and Blanchardstown had the highest positivity rate of more than 4 per cent, the average positivity rate was 2.6 per cent. To date, 635 Covid-19 cases have been identified through the centres. They were intended for those who were asymptomatic, but half of those who tested positive did have symptoms and 40 per cent have been subsequently identified as close contacts of confirmed cases.

Photograph: Getty ImagesFrance’s top health body is due to say on Friday that recipients of a first dose of AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine who are under 55 should get a second shot with a new-style messenger-RNA vaccine.“This should normally be confirmed today”, Health Minister Olivier Veran told RTL radio, adding he did not want to announce the move ahead of a news conference by the body - the Haute Autorite de la Sante (HAS) - later in the day.Mr Veran said this was a precautionary measure that could evolve in time, pending the gathering of further data on the AstraZeneca shot. France would continue to encourage the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine, he added.Two mRNA vaccines, one from Pfizer and BioNTech and another from Moderna , are approved for use in France.Meanwhile Australia has finalised a deal to buy an extra 20 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine as it rapidly pivots away from its earlier plan to rely mainly on the AstraZeneca jab.Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the deal just hours after saying Australia would stop using the AstraZeneca vaccine for people aged under 50.He said the deal means Australia will get a total of 40 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine by the end of the year, enough to inoculate 20 million people in the nation of 26 million.The pivot represents a significant shift in Australia’s overall approach and is likely to delay plans to have every person in the country inoculated by October.A major part of Australia’s strategy had been the ability to make its own vaccines at home and not rely on shipments from abroad.It had planned to manufacture some 50 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, enough for 25 million people. Australia had made no plans to make any other vaccines at home.These changes come after the European Medicines Agency concluded that there was a possible link between the AstraZeneca vaccine and rare blood clots in the brain in people who have received the vaccine.Despite this finding, the EU regulatory agency still concluded that the overall benefits of this “highly effective vaccine in protecting recipients from severe Covid-19 disease, hospitalisation and death outweigh the risks of this very rare event.”The first Irish case of a blood clot in a person after vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine was reported this week in a 40-year-old Dublin woman.The woman is being treated at the Mater Hospital for cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), the blood clot in the brain that the EMA concluded was possibly linked to the jab.The National Immunisation Advisory Committee met on Thursday to consider the EMA’s finding. It is consulting with EU colleagues and is considering whether any further advice on the use of the vaccine should be issued to the Department of Health if warranted.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"herd immunity within reach wont ministers talk","story":"Boris Johnson was vaccinated against his own optimism by the third lockdown – and the protection seems to be long lasting. He grumbles that there’s only one real certainty about Covid: when things go wrong, Britain tends to get hit worst. That certainly was the experience of last year – but the surprise, now, is that things are going badly right. He is now facing the very real prospect that his “scientific cavalry” has not only arrived but is fairly close to winning the battle against coronavirus.The vaccines have worked, better than anyone expected. More effective and more eagerly sought-after than any modeller dared to imagine. British Covid deaths are now the lowest in Europe, having fallen faster than even in Israel. There are no more “excess deaths” – in fact, fewer people are dying, now, than normal. The data has for some time, been unremittingly positive. Several parts of the country have been virtually Covid-free for several weeks.The idea that we might achieve herd immunity on Monday – as a model from UCL suggests – is unexpected. But entirely plausible. We heard about herd immunity quite a lot at the start of the pandemic, because this is how viruses die. Infections keep rising until a certain percentage of the population is protected – either by recovery, or vaccination. The figure of 60 per cent was mentioned at first. Other estimates go as high as 85 per cent: as ever, with Covid, no one is quite sure. But whatever the threshold is, Britain looks likely to hit it soon.Importantly, this is now Government policy: to achieve herd immunity by autumn through mass vaccination. The target may be reached earlier: a Bristol University model says August. Perhaps UCL is right and we will arrive at this promised land next week. After which there should – in theory – not be much need for restrictions. It ought to be impossible for Covid to overwhelm the health service again. It would be an incredible prize, one of the greatest scientific achievements of our times. It’s not just possible, but probable.But the timing? No one can know for sure. This takes us back to the debate about vaccine passports, the future of lockdown and a summer of travel restrictions. The current thinking inside No 10 is that lockdown ends on 21 June, with herd immunity by September 30. So what regime should exist in between these dates? How likely is the virus to stage a summer revival? What bridging measures, if any, should be in place? This is the basis of the reviews into social distancing, travel bans and the rest.It’s a perfectly sensible argument – but one not yet being made in public. In part, this is because “herd immunity” is seen as a politically toxic phrase. Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, used it once and was stunned to find himself accused of a secret plan to sacrifice the elderly. As he found out, social media helps hysteria spread faster than any virus. It was a brutal lesson in the new politics of pandemics: never mention the h-word.Another reason to keep quiet about this is the still-huge element of doubt. If a new variant escapes the vaccine, or if recovery immunity is found to be short-lived, the whole herd immunity argument collapses.Yet so far, the signs are encouraging. Pfizer claims to be 100 per cent effective in South Africa, home of the notorious variant, and the numbers of Covid reinfections worldwide are tiny. This gives ground for political optimism: herd immunity will (probably) arrive. Maybe not quite on Monday, but soon. And that ought to change everything.This takes us back to the case for candour. Would it be so bad, now, to admit to a herd immunity strategy? There have been discussions in government about renaming it “community immunity” or “collective immunity”. It seems odd to be working towards a goal that can’t be properly explained.But a lack of clarity causes problems, as we saw this week. The argument for young people being jabbed is to help achieve herd immunity, to protect others. But squeamishness about admitting this led to the bizarre situation where young people were told that vaccination is a matter of personal risk. One graph shown suggested that, given the low prevalence of the virus, the risk to under-30s from blood clots with AstraZeneca was almost the same as the risk from Covid. Both are very low risks, but it’s an unpersuasive message. As is dangling the threat of vaccine passports, as if to say: get the jab if you ever want to see the inside of a nightclub again.A more direct – and honest message – may work better: get the jab to stop the spread. The statistician David Spiegelhalter puts it well. For younger people, he says, “being vaccinated is as much a contribution to the community and their relatives and the people around them”. The last year has shown young people making all kinds of sacrifices to fend off a virus that they know will barely affect them. It’s hard to argue that they would not respond to plain arguments now. Matt Hancock is toying with a new soundbite: “do your bit.” But it’s no substitute for a broader discussion.Talking things through more openly may also improve the quality of decisions inside the Government. In one Whitehall meeting recently, there was serious discussion about new rules for hugging: should it be allowed outdoors, but not indoors? More worryingly, the taskforce setting the rules on international travel last week managed an entire strategy session without any serious discussion about the economic damage imposed by quarantines. In a country where over two million jobs depend on tourism, that’s quite an omission.We saw something else in this week’s AstraZeneca debate: blood clots discussed calmly, as a balance of risk. To hear Dr Alison Astles urge people to “keep saving lives” by taking the vaccine, after her brother died of side effects, has been one of the most moving moments of the pandemic. It would be quite something if this sparks a change in tone – where ministers move beyond podium slogans and start a more direct, transparent discussion about what now lies ahead.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"natural history museum urgesmeteorite hunters turn pieces may","story":"When a sonic boom was heard across swathes of south west England last month, scientists hoped it might herald the arrival of meteorite fragments from outer space, adding yet more to the sum of knowledge about the origins of the universe.Now experts have pinpointed the area where the fragments are likely to have fallen, raising the prospect of valuable material being recovered for analysis.By measuring the precise timings of the sonic boom caused by the meteorite as it hurtled across Devon, Somerset and Dorset they have identified the New Forest as the likely landing place.Scientists have said they think fragments could be on the ground between Verwood, in Dorset and Romsey, in Hampshire, prompting what is likely to be an excited search by meteorite hunters.But the amateur astronomers have been urged to treat any finds with care in order to preserve their scientific value - and not break Covid restrictions while doing so.The hunt was triggered when a fireball was seen flying across the sky at about 3pm on 20 March, setting off a sonic boom.The loud bang was most intense over Dorchester, with security cameras eight miles away at East Fleet Touring Park, near Weymouth, capturing the noise as it shook homes and windows.The sound was also recorded with accurate timing by OptaSense, a Fibre Optic sensing company based near Wool in Dorset, allowing experts from UK Fireball Alliance (UKFall) to plot the path of the fireball.That led researchers to conclude that the fireball may have dropped a meteorite in or near the northern part of the New Forest in Hampshire a few minutes later.Nick James, of the NEMETODE meteor network of cameras monitoring the skies across the British Isles, said “We were really lucky to have two good measurements of the timing of the sonic boom, along with many reports of its direction.  Combined with the dashcam footage, we have been able to estimate its path across Dorset.  We’ll keep refining the calculations, but we now know generally what happened.”Dr John Mason of the British Astronomical Association’s Meteor Section, added: “Triangulating using sonic boom reports isn’t something we’ve done before, but we’ve been lucky with our data this time so have quite a good idea of where this meteoroid went.”The landing follows one on February 28, when a 300g fragment of another meteorite plummeted onto the driveway of the Wilcock family in Winchcombe, Gloucestershire.Now UKFall, along with scientists at the universities of Glasgow and Manchester, and the Natural History Museum, have urged dog walkers, hikers and day-trippers in the New Forest to report any discoveries of the latest fragments.Dr Katherine Joy, of the University of Manchester, told The : said: “We want to alert people in the area to keep an eye out for any unusual rocks that they might come across, but are not encouraging people to travel there, given current UK government COVID guidelines about movement around the country.“It is a very challenging terrain in the New Forest area, with so much woodland and low vegetation scrub cover, so it would have to be pretty serendipitous that any meteorites are spotted. The best chance is if someone spots something landing on their driveway, local road or back garden, as happened in the recent Winchcombe meteor event.”She added: “If you do find a meteorite on the ground, ideally photograph it in place, note the location using your phone GPS, don\u0027t touch it with a magnet, and, if you can, avoid touching it with your hands.  “Please do exactly what the Wilcock family did so brilliantly in Winchcombe, and pick it up in a clean bag or clean aluminium foil if possible.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"eus disunity leaves impotent weak","story":"One of his frustrations at dealing with international crises, former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger once remarked, was that he knew who was making the decisions in Moscow or Beijing, but “who should I call if I want to call Europe?”The EU believes that it has answered his question. Brussels now has an embryonic common security and foreign policy. It has a foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, and its own diplomatic service and network of embassies. It even poses as a power equivalent to the United States or China, worthy of its own representation in international forums. But the humiliation of EU Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, at the hands of Turkey’s President Erdogan exposes the EU’s claims to foreign policy unity to be a sham.The episode was as ridiculous as it was telling. As if to celebrate Turkey’s withdrawal from the convention on violence against women, at a meeting in Ankara this week von der Leyen was relegated to a sofa on the sidelines as the President of the European Council, Charles Michel, was invited to take a chair next to Erdogan. Von der Leyen had to clear her throat to catch their attention.Michel has since explained that he was given the top seat because of the “strict interpretation by the Turkish services of protocol rules” under which he is senior to von der Leyen. But it is a poor excuse. The etiquette governing international meetings evolved because the symbolism of these events reflects real power balances. Allowing von der Leyen to take the sofa was a snub, and one made all the worse by the appearance it gave of Michel kowtowing to Erdogan’s antediluvian attitudes towards women.But the bigger question is surely: why were there even two presidents at one meeting? Indeed, what sort of organisation has so many presidents that it requires an order of seniority akin to those that govern members of an extended royal family?It’s not as if the EU is normally a model of effective diplomacy. Brussels’s grandly-titled “high representative of the Union for foreign affairs”, Mr Borrell, has blundered through a series of foreign policy of disasters in recent months. Most notoriously, he was humiliated during a visit to Moscow: the Russian foreign minister used their joint press conference to accuse the EU of lying about the poisoning of Alexei Navalny, absurd allegations to which Mr Borrell failed to respond.It’s also not as if the EU’s member states are themselves committed to a common front against the West’s enemies. The appearance of European disunity has only been compounded by Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron’s attempts to secure access to Vladimir Putin’s Sputnik V vaccine. The state of Bavaria this week even signed a preliminary contract for 2.5 million doses. Dependence on Russian gas for its heavy industrial producers and Sputnik V for public health gives the Kremlin a choke-hold in Berlin not seen since Merkel was a girl – but then it was only over East Germany. For Macron, this represents the lowest moment of a vaccine fiasco that has seen his diplomatic standing plumb new depths.Michel and von der Leyen should have stood up to President Erdogan. His slide into authoritarianism is troubling. The migrant crisis remains without a long-term resolution, no matter how many billions the European Union has handed over to Ankara. Erdogan has behaved in recent years more like an enemy than an ally of Nato and treated Greece, an EU member, with disdain. Meanwhile, Turkey’s economy is on its knees and its government desperately short of funds. The EU was in a position of enormous strength. Yet somehow it still walked away with appalling terms.Britain may be out of the European Union, but an impotent Europe is not a comfortable neighbour. Its blend of arrogance and incompetence invites predatory behaviour from the enemies of the West. Five decades after Kissinger asked his question, the fact that the EU’s multiple presidents have made answering it harder rather than easier presents grave headaches – and not just for the operator of the White House switchboard.Mark Almond is director of the Crisis Research Institute, OxfordMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"greta thunberg snub cop26 glasgow summit","story":"Greta Thunberg is to snub the COP26 summit in Glasgow as she has suggested it should be delayed due to Covid-19.The young climate change activist has said vaccine nationalism, meaning that many around the world have  not been jabbed and therefore cannot safely travel, means there will be unequal access to the November summit.Online replacement events would not be adequate, she added, as many countries do not have the same access to internet. Ministers were shocked by the news, and The  understands some involved in organising the conference found out from her tweets that she planned to snub the event.Ms Thunberg explained: Of course I would love to attend the Glasgow #COP26 But not unless everyone can take part on the same terms.

Importing and ExportingTo continue trading with the EU, businesses need to follow new rules for both importing goods into the UK and exporting goods from the UK, including changes to customs processes and licensing. Most businesses use a specialist such as a customs broker, freight forwarder or fast parcel operator to deal with import and export declarations. You should also make sure you have an EORI number starting with GB and,exporting, you’ll need to check that the EU business you’re exporting to is ready too. And donapost forget to check your goods meet the Rules of Origin. Unsure where to start  Alongside the in-depth guidance on gov.uk, businesses can access webinars and watch pre-recorded videos on areas such as Customs Import Declarations, Imports, Exports, and Trader responsibilities when using an intermediary. For further practical support, the government recently announced an additional £m to support small and medium businesses adjust to new customs, rules of origin and VAT rules when trading with the EU. You can find out more, including whether your business is eligible to apply here. VAT The UK has left the EU customs union and Single Market, meaning there are new rules and processes businesses need to follow. It’s a commercial matter for companies and parcel operators how they deal with any costs associated with trading goods between GB and EU, but there is no import VAT on goods under £ , so this shouldn’t be charged to customers.

A water cannon was used for the first time in six years to quell disorder in west Belfast on Thursday night, when stones and fireworks were hurled at police. Some  officers have been injured during more than a week of clashes, with petrol bombs, fireworks and bits of masonry fired at police on Wednesday. Crowds gathered on both sides of gates separating loyalist and republican areas in Belfast over two nights, with youth pelting petrol bombs and other missiles at each other. A bus was torched and a press photographer was also allegedly attacked on Wednesday night. Disorder has also taken place in Derry, Newtownabbey, Carrickfergus and Ballymena in recent days. PSNI Assistant Chief Constable Jonathan Roberts has described the disorder as at a scale we have not seen in recent years. Two arrests were made on Thursday night and a signicant criminal investigation is under way, he said. Boris Johnson and Taoiseach Micheal Martin issued a joint call for calm after speaking over the phone on Thursday.US President Joe Biden, who has Irish roots, is concerned by the violence and added his voice to calls for calm. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Thursday: We are concerned by the violence in Northern Ireland and we join the British, Irish and Northern Irish leaders in their calls for calm. We remain steadfast supporters of a secure and prosperous Northern Ireland in which all communities have a voice and enjoy the gains of the hard-won peace. In a statement, the Irish Government said Mr Johnson and Mr Martin had stressed that violence was unacceptable. The way forward is through dialogue and working the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement, the statement said. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis is holding crisis talks with Stormont parties aimed at calming tensions exacerbated by a toxic cocktail of Brexit and coronavirus. The Northern Ireland Assembly was recalled from the Easter recess for an emergency sitting on Thursday, where all parties condemned the violence. Here we look at the complex reasons for the disorder and why it matters. Brexit Changes to trade after the UK left the EU in January have played a role in exacerbating tensions in Northern Ireland. Boris Johnsonaposs Brexit deal effectively created a border down the Irish Sea, as goods passing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland must be subject to checks. A key part of the deal, known as the Northern Ireland Protocol, keeps Northern Ireland in the EUaposs single market for goods, which the rest of the UK left on January . The point of this idea was to prevent a land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which remains in the EU.  Avoiding a land border is a key part of the Good Friday Agreement, the landmark peace deal which brought an end to most of the violence suffered during the Troubles. However the plan to avoid inflaming tensions with infrastructure at the Irish border has instead seen anger sht to ports, where threats were made to staff and menacing graffiti emerged. The reality of post-Brexit le - which has included some disruption to food supplies and online deliveries - has angered some in loyalist communities, over the perception that it has undermined Northern Irelandaposs place in the UK. Coronavirus laws A row over the decision not to prosecute  Sinn Fein politicians for attending a large funeral during the pandemic has also ratcheted up anger. The funeral of former IRA leader Bobby Storey last June was attended by a number of senior republican politicians, including Deputy First Minister Michelle OaposNeill. Critics said the event broke coronavirus regulations, with large crowds appearing not to obey social distancing guidelines. However prosecutors decided last month not to take action over the event, partly due to lack of clarity in the Covid- rules and partly due to interaction between the organisers and police ahead of the funeral.  The decision sparked outrage among some loyalist communities over perceived preferential treatment for the republican community. Separately, months of living under strict lockdown rules may have also inflamed tensions. Paramilitary involvement There have been suggestions that paramilitary gangs have been stoking the violence in some areas, either directly or by encouraging young people to riot. PSNI Assistant Chief Constable Jonathan Roberts said police were investigating whether there was any paramilitary involvement in the scenes in Belfast on Wednesday. In Newtownabbey and Carrickfergus, the PSNI believes paramilitary involvement is partly to do with a rogue faction - the South East Antrim UDA - reacting to recent police operations targeting its criminal empire. What are politicians saying  In a joint statement, the five-party Executive said: While our political positions are very dferent on many issues, we are all united in our support for law and order and we collectively state our support for policing and for the police officers who have been putting themselves in harmaposs way to protect others. We, and our departments, will continue to work together to maximise the support we can give to communities and the PSNI to prevent further violence and unrest.

Foreign travel will definitely be allowed to resume, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps confirmed as he published a review on trips abroad. A “traffic light” system will ide nations into red, amber and green lists allowing dferent levels of travel, with testing and quarantine. There will also be a fourth category, a green watchlist, to alert travellers to countries that are at highest risk of moving from green to amber. There is now light at the end of the tunnel, Mr Shapps declared. But there are a string of uncertainties that could add cost and paperwork for families hoping for a taste of sun. Firstly, families are still in limbo as officials say it is too early to say which countries will be on which lists. Secondly, there is still no start date for foreign holidays - as Mr Shapps said they might begin from May , but the date might also be later. The top Tory suggested today holidays would only “primarily” open up for the summer season, July and August, rather than May and June. Thirdly, families visiting countries in all three categories will have to take gold-standard PCR tests costing around £ each. Officials are looking at ways to make PCR tests cheaper or potentially use less reliable lateral flow tests - but none of this is confirmed. And lastly, even once the green, amber and red lists are published, there will be nothing to stop countries switching lists at short notice.  Despite all the uncertainties, Mr Shapps today revealed the first green, amber and red lists will be published within two to three weeks. That could trigger an avalanche of bookings from pent-up Brits to go abroad for holidays and to see long-separated loved ones. The Transport Secretary told Sky News: “I’m not saying to people they shouldn’t book summer holidays, that’s the first time I’ve been able to say that for many months.“But I think everybody doing it understands there are risks with coronavirus and of course actually I think people would want to be clear about which countries are going to be in the dferent traffic light system.“And people predominantly of course will be looking to book in a green country. “There’s only two to three weeks to wait before we publish that list. “But yes, tentative progress, for the first time people can start to think about visiting loved ones abroad, or perhaps a summer holiday, but we’re doing it very, very cautiously because we don’t want to see anyof coronavirus in this country.” Mr Shapps - who was caught by his own travel corridor system last year - said he will hold off on booking his own break until the green, amber and red lists are published. Experts will allocate nations to green, amber or red categories depending on countriesapos vaccination rates, infection levels and whether mutant strains – dubbed “iants of concern” – are re. A countryaposs status will also depend on a fourth factor - how much sequencing it is doing as standard to identy any mutant strains.  Passengers landing from green nations will need to take a pre-departure test before flying back, as well as a PCR test on or before day two of their arrival in the UK. But they will not need to quarantine, unless they receive a positive result, or take any additional tests. Those ing from amber countries must self-isolate for  days and take a pre-departure test, a PCR test on day two and day eight, with the option for “test to release” on day five to end quarantine early. Brits ing from red countries must pay £, to quarantine for  days in a Government-approved hotel, undergo pre-departure testing and PCR testing on day two and eight - as they do now. Ministers are desperate not to jeopardise the success of the Covid- inoculation rollout by importing vaccine-resistant mutations from abroad. But figures yesterday revealed that for every arrival staying in a quarantine hotel since mid-February,  other travellers had been told they could just quarantine at home. And there are widespread concerns about the number of positive cases that are missed by cheaper lateral flow tests, which Mr Shapps indicated the government was looking at to cut travellersapos costs.  Prof Jeremy Brown, a member of the joint committee on vaccines and immunisation , warned it was vital not to import new strains of Covid-. He told Times Radio: The problem there is that itaposs a bit unclear at this point in time.I think knowing how effective the vaccine is against these iants is actually quite a crucial bit of information becausewe know itaposs effective, then the issue about travel and potentially bringing back iants from other countries becomes less of a problem. If the iants escape the vaccine then it can be a signicant problem.Iaposm afraid to say, at the moment, I donapost know enough about our immunity to iants and I donapost think many people do.

Mr Sunak revealed the ex-Premier contacted a third Treasury minister in his role as a lobbyist for a financial firm.As Whitehall chiefs were battling to get to grips with the unprecedented hit to businesses and the economy just  days into the first coronavirus lockdown, Mr Sunak texted the former PM to tell him he would contact him.He later told him he would “push the team” to find options that might work, but added there were “no guarantees”. The Government has faced mounting questions over Whitehall links with Greensill Capital, which filed for insolvency after failing to secure cash through the Bank of Englandaposs Covid Corporate Financing Facility. Its collapse last month plunged the future of Liberty Steel, for whom Greensill was the main lender, into jeopardy – leaving , workers at  British plants fearing for their jobs. The former PM was said to have share options in Greensill worth up to million and concerns were raised about his lobbying on the firmaposs behalf – including sending text messages to Mr Sunak. Mr Cameron messaged the Chancellor on his private phone to ask for help for Greensill. Those texts have not been published. But the first message from Mr Sunak to Mr Cameron, sent on April  last year read: Hi David, thanks for your message. “I am stuck back to back on calls but will try you later this evening andgets too late, first thing tomorrow. Best, Rishi. The second message from Mr Sunak sent on April  said: Hi David, apologies for the delay. “I think the proposals in the end did require a change to the market notice but I have pushed the team to explore an alternative with the Bank that might work. No guarantees, but the Bank are currently looking at it and Charles should be in touch. Best, Rishi. It is understood Charles refers to Charles Roxburgh, the second most senior civil servant at the Treasury. The Chancellor was forced to provide the messages following a Freedom of Information request. The Treasury said: We are withholding the communications sent by David Cameron to the Chancellor. “These communications were made by David Cameron in his capacity as an employee of Greensill, and with an expectation of confidence.  Mr Sunak also confirmed the ex-PM lobbied three ministers, including himself, over the matter of Greensill Capitalaposs access to a Covid support scheme. In a letter to Shadow Chancellor Anneliese Dodds last night, Mr Sunak wrote: I can confirm that David Cameron reached out informally by telephone to me, and to the Economic Secretary and the Financial Secretary, on the matter of Greensill Capitalaposs access to the CCFF . The matter was referred to the relevant officials and, following appropriate consultations as outlined in the previous requests, the request was turned down. During this process, this was communicated to Greensill Capital by officials and, in parallel, by me to David Cameron. Previously, it had only been disclosed that Mr Cameron contacted the Chancellor and Financial Secretary Jesse Norman, the former PMaposs fellow Old Etonian. But the revelation shows he went to a trio of finance ministers, including Economic Secretary John Glen. Ms Dodds said: These messages raise very serious questions about whether the Chancellor may have broken the Ministerial Code.

To prevent ato the dark days of the Troubles has required a concerted diplomatic and political effort. This week’s violence is a reminder of how fragile the situation remains. Northern Ireland’s leaders have not helped by stoking sectarian resentments. But blame also lies with Boris Johnson. He broke his word by imposing border checks with the rest of the UK.

Welby. , waded into the controversy by telling an Italian newspaper: “The legal wedding was on the Saturday.” But in his latest interview with the Financial Times, Welby said he had sympathy for Harry and Meghan over their decision to quit royal le, noting that being a member of the Firm is like serving “le without parole”. Welby spoke passionately about his experience volunteering as a chaplain at St Thomasaposs hospital, next door to his home Lambeth Palace. He said the experience had been le-changing, adding: What I’ve done for anyone , Iaposve no idea. But what it did for me, it brought me back close to God and close to people. That’s been one of the high points.  In another frank admission, The Archbishop also admitted he should have thought about attending the London vigil for Sarah Everard, the -year-old marketing executive who was killed in March.

In a more light hearted exchange, Welby was asked whether pets can go to heaven, remarking: “I have never been asked that question before.” After a pause, the Anglican remarked: “Given the fondness we have for our dog, our current dog and the previous one, I am quite prepared to believe that pets go to heaven.” In a frank admission of his failings in his role, the Holy man also admitted he got quite a few things wrong on the closure of churches during the first Covid lockdown, saying he was too risk-averse.

The bust occurred at .am on November , , after officers acted on a tip off. Officers found a Gucci handbag stuffed with cash, snap bags, weighing scales and list of people who owed money for drugs. A snap bag was also recovered from the glove compartment of their  plate Range Rover. At Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester Anderson wept as she admitted possessing cocaine with intent to supply.  She was given  months jail suspended for two years and was ordered to complete  hours unpaid work after insisting she played a lesser role in the racket. Mason was jailed for  months after he admitted possession of Class A drugs with intent.

She felt she had no control on the situation. “She still has access to the Tanning Salon and is planning to open on Monday when the restrictions have been eased. She has been educating herself further and has taken several online courses for tanning.  aposaposIf she was to go into custody, she would lose the salon and there would be no one  to run it in her absence. This is something which she begged him to stop, but he was wrapped up in the drug himself. He was unable to listen to her.aposapos For Mason, defence counsel Benjamin Knight said: “This man has placed his partner and two children in a very awkward position. But it was a modest drug dealing operation. He has not sourced new clients - rather he was dealing to his cocaine taking friends. It was a small group. aposaposThis has caused extreme damage on his mother and the rest of his family. He was shielding Miss Anderson from what he was up to by using the safe at the salon. His only concern has been the welfare of his two children and he knows he has jeopardised that with the position that Miss Anderson is now in.

Brian Robson was  years old when he became homesick while working for Victorian Railways in . Realising that a plane ticket home would cost him £ -  times his monthly salary - he cooked up a plan to get himself home. The now -year-old bought a small wooden crate and convinced two Irishmen he knew as Paul and John to stow him aboard a freight plane, he told the . The quite horric experience” took four days and saw Brian repeatedly stored upside down. Almost six decades on he is looking to reconnect with the men who helped him get home in a bid to thank them. “I’m % sure that they were called Paul and John,” he told the . “Paul really was % against it … but John said, ‘Don’t worry about it, I’ll persuade him.’ And so, they both went ahead and helped.” Ahead of his perilous journey back to Cardf, Wales, Brian packed a mini-fridge sized box with a pillow, a book of Beatles songs and a suitcase. One was for drinking in, the other urinating. He also took laxatives for three days before the big journey to make sure he wasnapost caught short.  His friends then nailed the package shut with Brian inside, labelled it as a computer and booked it onto a Qantas flight from Melbourne to London. The plan hit a slight ot in the road when Brian was transferred to a PanAm flight headed for Los Angeles because the original plane was full. There he was stored away in a freight shed where, having been stuck in the box for five days, he was too weak to hammer himself out. Luckily a man “looked through a hole in a wood knot in the chest and we caught each other eye to eye”, Brian told the BBC. “He jumped back a mile and said, ‘There’s a body in there.’”  After spending five days recovering in hospital he was questioned by the FBI before being released and allowed to fly on a passenger jet back to the UK. Australian MP Dan Mackinnon reacted strongly to news of the stowaway, demanding legal action against “this apparently useless young man”. The then-acting minister for immigration Leslie Bury said no action would be taken against him. When Brian got home he wrote to the two men, who he got got on famously with, but they never responded. Now he does not remember where they were from or what their surnames were.

Rapid tests give results in under  minutes and Brits are encouraged to take them as part of a regular testing system brought in to tackle the spread of Covid- and keep the infection rate low as the economy reopens. In particular, they are effective in spotting people who have no symptoms but could still spread the virus.But scientists have warned people to still be aware of the symptoms of coronavirus - as well as the less common ones - see a full list below as identied by the ZOE COVID Symptom Study app. Tim Spector OBE, lead scientist on the ZOE COVID Symptom Study app and Professor of Genetic Epidemiology at King’s College London, said: This week the government announced plans to make home-based lateral flow tests accessible as a tactic to catch more cases. According to our own data  in  of these tests give a  positive result, so we are encouraging people to take a lateral flow test at least twicepositive and confirm it with a full NHS PCR test.However, people also need to know all the  symptoms, including sore throat, headache and fatigue, not just the classic three. Soyou feel unwell with any of the symptoms of COVID, stay at home and get a test.”The ZOE COVID Symptom Study looked at daily health reports logged by more than  million contributors to come up with the list of  dferent symptoms of the disease. Of course, having one or more of these symptoms does not mean it’s definitely due to Covid-, as they can also occur with other illnesses, the research says. However, these symptoms have been reported more often by people who have a positive test than those testing negative. These are the  symptoms listed by the ZOE COVID Symptom Study and what the study says about them:. High temperatureThe Covid Symptom Study app found that around four in ten people reporting symptoms of Covid- have a high temperature . A high temperature is also one of the official NHS symptoms. It means you feel hot to touch on your chest or back .  . Chills or shivers When it does occur, fever usually happens in the first week of illness and tends to go quite quickly. However, some people with long-lasting symptomshave reported having recurring fever chills. . Persistent cough A persistent cough is widely known as one of the three ‘classic’ symptoms of Covid-, along with fever and loss of smell. Persistent is described as coughing many times a day, for half a day or more. This is usually a dry cough, unless you have an underlying lung condition that normally makes you cough up phlegm or mucus.  . Loss or change in smellSome people using the app have also reported that their sense of smell didn’t go completely, but changed with Covid- infection so that things smelled markedly dferently to before. If you have anosmia or a change in your sense of smell, you may notice that that you can’t smell strongly scented things like coffee or flowers.  . Loss or change in tasteYou may notice that food tastes dferent from normal or seems tasteless . . HeadacheEven though headaches are a less well-known symptom of Covid-, they are one of the earliest signs of the virus.But the researchers say that especially as many of us are staring at screens for so long each day, although many people with Covid- experience headaches, most people with a headache will not have the disease.  . Fatigue Fatigue in coronavirus is not just being tired or sleepy. It is described as a type of extreme tiredness or feeling ‘wiped out’ that persists despite getting a good nightaposs sleep. . Sore throat A sore throat could also be a symptom. . Sudden confusionThis especially relates to older people. The study identied two types of delirium. The first is hyperactive delirium, where someone abruptly changes in their character and starts acting strangely - including being agitated or distressed, or even aggressive. The second type is hypoactive delirium where people become withdrawn and less responsive or engaged in what’s going on around them, and sometimes drowsy. . Skin rash Covid rashes are usually itchy and this may lead to poor sleep. . Changes in the mouth or tongue People have been reporting that their tongue doesn’t look normal, particularly that it is white and patchy.  . Red and sore fingers and toes Fingers and toes can be sore but not itchy. For example, people could find it painful when typing on a keyboard or walking. . Shortness of breath Covid-related shortness of breath makes you feel like you need to catch your breath when doing simple tasks such as getting up, walking to a dferent room or using the bathroom. You should also look out for having to take extra breaths mid-sentence or during a normal conversation. . Chest pains A small proportion of people with coronavirus can experience chest pains, which can be brought on by breathing deeply, coughing or sneezing. This is thought to be caused by the virus affecting their muscles and lungs.

Boris Johnson said taking regular tests would be key to the continued easing of lockdown as he outlined plans for the next stage of the roadmap out of lockdown - which comes on Monday. All adults in England, even those without Covid symptoms, will be urged to check themselves twice a week.See below for all your questions answered on the new schemeWhat has Boris Johnson said  Boris Johnson said everyone in England will be able to take a Covid- test twice a week in a new drive to track the pandemic as society reopens and the vaccine rollout continues at its rapid rate. The Prime Minister said the new mass testing programme would break the chain of transmissions and spot cases without symptoms. As we continue to make good progress on our vaccine programme and with our roadmap to cautiously easing restrictions underway, regular rapid testing is even more important to make sure those efforts are not wasted, Mr Johnson said in a statement. Thataposs why weaposre now rolling out free rapid tests to everyone across England - helping us to stop outbreaks in their tracks, so we can get back to seeing the people we love and doing the things we enjoy. The Prime Minister said the scheme would help stop fresh outbreaks, enabling the authorities to identy and control new iants of the disease. Who is eligible for the tests  The tests should be available for every adult in England. When does this come into force  From April , anyone is able to order a test kit to their home, pick one up at a local site or through a ­workplace or school programme.  Where can I get the tests  The expanded regular testing offer for people without symptoms will be delivered through:a home ordering service, which allows people to order lateral flow tests online to be delivered to their home workplace testing programmes, on-site or at home community testing, offered by all local authorities collection at a local PCR test site during specic test collection time windows testing on-site at schools and collegesA new ‘Pharmacy Collect’ service is also launching which will provide an additional route to regular testing.People aged over  without symptoms will be able to visit a participating local pharmacy and collect a box of  rapid tests to use twice a week at home.  Who will be among the first to use them  Edward Argar said he expected those ing to work in the coming weeks to be among the first to use the lateral flow tests on offer. The health minister told BBC Breakfast: I suspect in the first instance, a lot of them will be used by people who are starting to go back into their workplace again, as the economy starts opening up again, as pubs start opening for outside drinks and shops start opening again and as people start going back to their offices and businesses. So I suspect that will be a very large proportion of people who use these tests. The Conservative MP said the cost of supplying the quick-fire result tests to everyone in England would be met by the two-year £ billion NHS Test and Trace budget.

Why is the government bringing in free rapid tests  The government site says: One in three people with Covid- do not experience any symptoms and may be spreading the virus unwittingly. Rapid testing detects cases quickly, meaning positive cases can isolate immediately.

The couple has been together for so long, we can hardly remember a time when we werenapost enamoured with their love story. But in all this time have you ever wondered what happened when the pair first met  The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge discussed the first time they laid eyes on each other at The University of St Andrews during their engagement interview back in . Kate recalled the moment right away, but William didnapost seem to remember, admitting heaposd have to wrack his brains. Itaposs fair to say the moment wasnapost as cool as Kate might have hoped. The Duchess of Cambridge said: I actually went bright red when I met you and scuttled off feeling very shy about meeting you. William wasnapost there for quite a bit of the time initially, he wasnapost there from Fresheraposs Week, so it did take a bit of time for us to get to know each other. But we did become very close friends from quite early on.  Weaposd probably have had a similar reaction to meeting a prince! During the interview, Kate also addressed a rumour that had been going around at the time, saying she had a poster of William on her bedroom wall at uni. She quickly put the rumours to bed, saying: He wishes. I had the Levi guy on my wall, not a picture of William. The couple went on to talk about their brief split and explained why it was so important for their relationship.

Reportedly, the Duchess of Cambridge also uses powerful gestures to communicate just like Princess Diana once did. Her biographer Andrew Morton said Kate shares similarities with her late mother in law, months ahead of what would have been Dianaaposs th birthday. Speaking of a recent unofficial visit to pay respects to Sarah Everard on Clapham Common, Andrew said Kate is firmly following in Diana’s footsteps.He told OK! : “She didn’t have to say a word, just turned up and laid her flowers and everyone can draw their own conclusions.“That’s exactly how Diana did it – one gesture is worth a thousand words. He also said that the Duchess of Cambridge was comfortable letting her actions do the talking, like the people’s Princess Diana before her. He added: It shows that Kate is someone who doesn’t have to speak out. She’s doing what Diana used to do, which is let her body language tell the story.” And the royal biographer noted Kate’s body language has begun to mirror William’s mother, who tragically passed away in a fatal car crash in Paris in .  “Kate has the Diana Walk,” he said. “Quickly and with determination was very much how Diana walked.” Meanwhile, Katie Nicholl, who is the author of Kate: The Future Queen, said that Kate had been William’s pillar of strength in recent times. She said: “Kate is the silent power behind William, the linchpin that keeps everything together. “It’s been an exceptionally hard year for him and he’s had to shoulder a lot of burden. All the while Kate is quietly in the background supporting him.” "},{"url":null,"title":"landlord who spent 50000 pub","story":"NewsLandlord who spent £, on pub chalet told it breaks Covid rules days before openingThe livid landlord who runs The Marlborough in Wiltshire reportedly claims he strictly followed Wiltshire Councils advice to comply with the virus regulationsmirrorShareCommentsByWilliam WalkerNews Reporter:,  APR NewsHe said he was livid at the timing \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The four-storey property is located in the pricy neighbourhood that is just walking distance from the picturesque River Thames. The home was first prize in the draw, and boasts three bedrooms and a walled garden. Marilyn and husband David have been living in the same two-bedroom semi-detached house for four decades and have no intention of upgrading, despite their surprise win. Have you got a property story  Email webnews@mirror Now she intends to put the prize home on the market. The main beneficiaries will be the British Heart Foundationwho will collect a million pounds from the ticket sales. Marilyn said: It feels very strange to think that Iaposm an instant multi-millionaire. Weaposve lived in our house for more than  years and so we will find somewhere more modern in the same area.  The Omaze Million Pound House Draw raised a million pounds to help the BHFaposs research and its work supporting families affected by heart and circulatory diseases. It also comes at a time the charity is being forced to cut its research programme by % because of the devastating impact of coronavirus pandemic on fundraising. Many British charities have told of counting the cost of the pandemic, as generous donors found their own livelihoods during the period of job cuts.

There are four known forces of physics that supposedly govern the behaviour of every particle and planet but experts have long suspected there must be more. And in an experiment at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory outside Chicago, scientists may have discovered a fth force after tiny particles known as muons were found to wobble at faster rates than expected. Here, particle physicist Dr Harry Clf, left, who was not involved in the Muon g- study, explains what the excitement is all about. Four forces of nature  Gravity holds the universe together and keeps our feet on the ground.Electromagnetic force is responsible for electricity, magnetism, light, radio waves, and holds atoms together. The strong force holds quarks at the nucleus of an atom together and the weak force causes radioactive decay and also transforms particles.What are muons There are three particles that make up everything we see in the universe – electrons and the up and down quarks .And for reasons we don’t understand there are also exotic fundamental particles, one of which is the muon.It is an unstable copy of the electron but only lives for about a millionth of a second and it’s  times heavier.What happened at Fermi  The purpose of the experiment was to measure the magnetic strength of the muon. It didn’t agree with the precise calculation made using current theories and this means there’s something  affecting the muon’s behaviour , which could be a new force of nature.Why does it matter This discovery could point towards an explanation to unanswered questions – why is the universe here, what is it made of, what is dark matter made of. It might answer questions we haven’t thought of .How might it change lives  The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening.

Verphy Kudi, now , admitted manslaughter at Lewes Crown Court last month after leaving of -month-old Asiah home alone in a supported housing block in Brighton. She had been due to stand trial later this year before formally entered a guilty plea to a charge of manslaughter. The court heard the aspiring model left the tot on her own to party in London, Coventry and Solihull, in the West Midlands, more than  miles away. Kudi was living in Gocher Court which was accommodation for vulnerable families run by a charity commissioned by Brighton and Hove City Council.  Her family have questioned the level of support she was given there. According to details outlined by the prosecution at a court hearing last year Kudi left her child unsupervised a dozen times, the Times reports. The first time was less than two months before the toddler died in December .Sally Howes QC, for the prosecution, told a bail hearing for Kudi on October  last year at Hove Trial Centre thatthere was no system to sign in or out of Gocher Court. She said on the first occasion Kudi left her daughter alone in mid-October it would have been clear to staff that the baby was unsupervised and she was spoken to.  The QC continued that there were then  further occasions when little Asiah had been left unsupervised which is understood to include when the tot died. It is now claimed the prosecution classes seven of the incidents as being particularly serious including the final time Asiah was left home alone. On December ,  - Kudiaposs th birthday - she was spotted on CCTV leaving Gocher Court which is run by the YMCA DownsLink Group. She ed home on December  and found her daughter dead.A post mortem examination found Asiah died of neglect. Kudi is due to be sentenced on May . Judge Christine Laing QC ordered that all social services records relating to the case be disclosed to the defence ahead of sentencing. The YMCA group told the Times that there were “aware of a safeguarding incident” involving Kudi in mid-October  and social services were informed but they unaware of other incidents. The charity added: “Families living at these flats live independently and are free to come and go without being monitored. Staff are available during the day, to offer housing-related support and one two hours of planned key-work sessions each week.CCTV footage is not used for live monitoring. It is there to provide security and as a deterrent to anti-social behaviour. The police investigation after Asiah’s death brought these possible further instances to light.” "},{"url":null,"title":"teenagers exercising lose weight fit","story":"NewsopinionTeenagers are exercising to lose weight rather than get fit or just have funA study of data for people born since  revealed attitudes towards exercise has changed, and it could be fuelling eating disorders and depressionmirrorShareCommentsByMiriam Stoppard:,  APR NewsopinionMore teenagers have become obsessed by their weight \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

She has called on the government to change the law for elderly drivers, to ensure they are fit to drive. “What makes it even harder to come to terms with is that his death was so unnecessary, she said. “However, what’s more important is that they should be able to prove they are not a danger to the public so other families don’t have to suffer the heartache we have because of Simon’s death.

The property was one of thousands of aposNissen hutsapos erected in Britain during war-time using pre-fabricated sections. It features distinctive curved roofs clad with corrugated sheets. Many were abandoned or used as storage by farmers. But one hangar, set in the countryside near Dunmow, Essex, has been converted into a private home boasting . acres of gardens. The building, which is one of three surviving Nissen huts situated on the grounds of an old Georgian house near Dunmow, was once used to house service personnel, including members of the RAF and American forces. Now, in keeping with its original shape and structure, it has been converted into a two-storey, five-bedroom property, with a lt to the upper floor and two bedrooms. The home, being sold through estates agents Savills, boasts a large open plan kitchen downstairs with three further bedrooms. Bi-folding doors extend onto a terrace with views across the countryside. Karl Manning, the agent handling the property on behalf of Savills, said: Itaposs certainly a unique building.  You look at the outside of it and you feel like it just shouldnapost really work as a home. But when you go inside, the curved back wall, which has been converted in the style of how it would have looked originally, is really quite impressive. Itaposs kept its original shape, structure and footprint, too. Karl said that the former hangar, along with its two other counterparts beside it, were converted around two or three years ago. The three huts sit just seven miles from the former RAF site, RAF Great Dunmow, which was in use from -.  Karl added: These huts were formerly used as lodgings for service personnel, and then after the war a lot of them became used for storage. But because of the size of these three huts, they were converted about two or three years ago. The other two huts are also currently lived in. Karl said this particular property has been on the market for around three weeks - and there has already been signicant interest in it. The Savills website reads: The property is approached over a substantial shingle drive opening to a natural stone terrace.

In the clip she said: If youaposve ever felt super anxious when youaposre hungover, then donapost worry a lot of people do. Hangxiety is a real thing caused by real chemical changes in your brain. When you drink chemicals in your brain are affected, namely glutamate and GABA. These normally have opposing effects on the brain, glutamate making it more active and GABA making it less active. She continued: Drinking alcohol simultaneously increases the amount of chill GAMA we have whilst decreasing the amount of wired glutamate. This means your brain is acting super slow-mo, giving you slower reactions and lower inhibitions. The morning after, your brain tries to rebalance. It becomes super sensitive to glutamate, which makes it hyperactive and you anxious, whilst becoming less sensitive to GABA which would normally step in and chill you out. Itaposs basically the reverse of what was happening while you were drinking and is a recipe for anxiety.  Sophie went on to reassure people that they shouldnapost stress that everyone low key hates them the next day and theyaposre not embarrassing - theyaposre just a bit chemically imbalanced. Experts agree that aposhangxietyapos is a real thing.Liz Burns, who is a lecturer of mental health nursing at Salford University with a specialism in alcohol services, has previously spoken to The Manchester Evening News all about it.She said: Feeling anxious the next day is down to the interaction of chemical compound glutamate. We may feel fearful because we canapost remember everything that happened the night before itaposs not at the forefront of the mind. We may be able to piece together moments, and memories can sometimes come back to us when weaposre stimulated by something.

If youaposre lucky, nothing ever comes of it. But sometimes, it comes back to bite you on the backside. For example, when you go to get your passport photo taken but decided to wear your hair up for it In this case, it ended up with a woman receiving a rather baffling passport photo - where staff had photoshopped her hair out. TikTok user Katie was left doubled over in laughter -but also feeling fairly mortied, after her photos came back - with her bun bluntly removed. Instead of asking her to take her hair down, staff had simply edited it out, leaving her looking unrecognisable to her friends and family. She shared a video explaining what happened and itaposs gone viral on TikTok. In it, Katie wrote: Wore a bun to get my passport pictures but they said it was too big so they just had to cut it off. The video has been viewed more than , times on TikTok.

The Buster was wrecked on the sands of Woolooglaaposs main beach in  during a trip from Nova Scotia to New Zealand to deliver timber. The m boat, which has become a treasured part of the New South Wales community, gets exposed by the tide and rainfall every few years.This year particular inclement weather has exposed The Buster more thoroughly than ever before.Occasionally itaposs exposed,never seen it this exposed, one local told ABC. Archaeologist Brad Duncan described it as one of the best preserved wrecks anywhere in the world. The tourist attraction was somewhat ironically wrecked on the beach by what used to be the areaaposs biggest pull - a  foot long government pier which draw a lot of shipping traffic to the area. The Busteraposs crew had tied her to the pier during a storm and thrown two anchors down, so concerned were they that the swell would take the vessel back out to sea.

weighing in with goals and being hailed “a real success story” by his boss # it’s been a season to remember for Dundee United wide man Adrian Sporle.The Argentine ace has cemented himself in United gaffer Micky Mellon’s plans, scoring four times in  appearances in tangerine this term.Mellon believes there’s more to come from the -year-old, though, and has challenged him to kick on between now and the end of the campaign.With the Terrors still fighting on two fronts, starting their Premiership bottom-six journey at Hamilton on Saturday and with Forfar to face in the Scottish Cup, Mellon reckons they’ve plenty room for improvement.“Adrian has been a real success story for us this season,” he said.“It was new to him this season, he’s not played at this level before in the Premiership so he’s had to learn about himself as things went along.“He’s had to show he’s capable of stepping up and he’s one of the ones who has done that.“He’s attacked what he’s been asked to do and has had an impact in the games he’s played.“I still believe he can get better and better, there is still a lot of potential there waiting to be unlocked.“Like with the rest of him, I’ve told him to aim high, be tough on himself and he can keep improving.“He’s a great lad with a great attitude, he’s well-liked within the group so everyone has been delighted to see him do well.“He expects to keep doing better and that will help him because every day he’s working hard to get better.”It’s been far from plain sailing for Sporle to get to this point, however.Thousands of miles away from home amid the global coronavirus pandemic, he’s had to adapt to a new city and country as well as rise to the challenge of playing in the top flight.With the recent arrival of girlfriend Sofia to Dundee and the support of his team-mates, it’s made le easier for the Argentine – and it’s showing on the pitch.Mellon empathises with his wing wizard as he revealed his own struggle with being away from family and friends.The Tannadice boss praised Sporle for the way he has coped with the upheaval and believes football has played a huge role in helping him get through.“It has been challenging for everyone over the last year, I’ve only seen my own mother once and my kids down south once as well,” he revealed.“Everyone is in their own bubbles and it’s very dficult.“Coming to Scoland from Argentina, it has been tough on him because he’s not been able to get home at any stage or he’s not been able to bring his family over.“But he’s a good lad, he’s very grounded and has been able to focus on his football.“He’s not allowed what’s been going on with the pandemic affect him.”EXCLUSIVE: Dundee United#s Argentine ace Adrian Sporle opens up on Scottish le, his bromance with Ian Harkes and

With Russell being based in the UK, the official sauces were held up in customs and didn#t get to him.#The chap in the UK who runs Heatonist got in touch with Jen Ferguson who owns Hop Burns  Black in Londonand she pulled together all of the official ones she had. She had a few gaps that she couldn#t fill so she phoned me up asking what my hottest sauce was and I told her it was Reapers and Mangoes.#It was just pure luck as she has hundreds and hundreds of hot sauces in her shop and she chose mine to feature. It was really good for that to happen.#My sauce will be featured for just this one show, but for me, I#m now on their radar as they#ll have seen the brand. Hopefully they see its potential and might use it for a future series.#And Russell, who has now appeared on the show twice, was as good a sport as last time, getting through all  sauces.Russell said: #Why have they packaged it in such an inoffensive way  The others have Medusas on it and skulls, this looks like it could be the interior of a doll#s house. Or could be a Teletubbies day spa. But you#re ensuring me it is a vindictive condiment . #WATCH NOW: https:t.co OuxHUCHPresented by @FordPerformance pic iVpPnlKhCmdash First We FeastApril , Pouring some out, he toasted to Her Majesty the Queen and took a bite.#It is runnier than its predecessors. To Her Majesty the Queen of England. It is making its way to the nose hole.#Watching the show, Mark revealed he was left #in stiches# at Russell#s verdict and description of the sauce, especially the #Teletubby# reference.He said: #I thought it was really good. I watch Hot Ones a lot and some of the funniest ones are when people can#t handle the heat.#Gordon Ramsay was hilarious because he just can#t handle the heat, whereas Russell has clearly got a high tolerance for heat and it just sort of bounces off the side of him. He does like to talk, too.mdash Singularity Sauce Co.April , #Some of his comments on the look of the sauce had me in stitches. It was fantastic. I#ve been thinking about maybe changing the name of the sauce to Teletubbies Day Spa just because the story of how it came around would be golden in future years.# I have now actually tracked down the general manager of First We Feast and we were emailing back and forth. I didn#t even think he#d reply to be honest but the reply I got was fantastic.#Originally I#d said I wanted to get a bottle to Sean Evans and it got a bit bigger than that and before I knew it I was being asked to send some to the guy behind Heatonist in Brooklyn. It is really, really exciting. I#m on their radar now and hopefully my sauce might make it onto the series. #Featuring Carolina reapers, the hottest chillies in the world, Mark says his Reapers and Mangoes sauce is not for the faint-hearted.He added: #The last time Russell was on it he was really funny. The volume of Carolina reapers and where I get them from really makes this sauce pop.#Nowadays, you can get them quite easily from Spain, Holland, Israel, Rwanda and Morocco, places like that. The reapers I have are grown in Devon in the UK by one of the best growers I know of. I don#t think anyone can touch his reapers as they are so good.#They are by far one of the best and have so much flavour. When I ferment them with mangos, usually when you mix heat with sweetness, the sugar will temper the heat a little, but because the reapers are so vicious and the fermenting process eats some of the sugars, it has a mighty punch.#If you can stand the heat of it, it is a very flavoursome sauce. It isn#t the hottest chilli in the world for no reason.#The first time I released it everyone said it was too hot. I toned it down and the minute the new version went out, everyone wanted it back.#Plans revealed for #spectacular# new indoor food market in Aberdeen\" title\"#Plans revealed for #spectacular# new indoor food market in Aberdeen# # Press and Journal\" src\"https:www.pressandjournal fp news aberdeen  aberdeen-indoor-produce-market-plans embed # secretpQfXRIi\" data-secret\"pQfXRIi\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"New owners for The Udny Arms Hotel as venue sees six-figure investment and former Melt owner at the helm of the food offering\" title\"#New owners for The Udny Arms Hotel as venue sees six-figure investment and former Melt owner at the helm of the food offering# # Press and Journal\" src\"https:www.pressandjournal fp lestyle food-and-drink  new-owners-for-the-udny-arms-hotel-as-venue-sees-six-figure-investment-and-former-melt-owner-at-the-helm-of-the-food-offering embed # secretMFvgAXKHBu\" data-secret\"MFvgAXKHBu\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/2.57579155-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/2.57579155-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/2.57579155-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/2.57579155-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"aberdeen shopping centre loses 20 major retailers as city continues to be battered by impact of pandemic","story":"More than  big-name retailers will not reopen for business at a popular Aberdeen shopping precinct as the city continues to be “battered” by the impact of the Covid- pandemic.

We have a list of , which is not yet complete.“The thing that occurs to me is, we are encouraging more production but not developing distribution channels.“The idea is to create an indoor, weekly, regular, dependable street market – which needs to be covered due to the weather.“We have potentially two city-centre sites – we can’t go public on them yet – butwe can pull it off it would be pretty spectacular.“It would be run by a young and dynamic team as we have to create opportunities like this. Young people are getting a very raw deal currently.”Early responses to the AMC’s feasibility study have shown a “very strong pull” towards making Aberdeen’s multi-ethnic food and drink more accessible, unearthing items such as African herbs and spices many would not know are which are produced in the north-east.AMC manager Ahashan Habib said: “We really feel Aberdeen is missing out by not having a regular market, so need support to make this a success and bring people and le back to the city centre.”He emphasised the “awesome” green credentials of the plans, which could reduce the use of unnecessary packaging as well as the distance food and drink needs to travel to reach our plates.Hard and fast rules on how local the traders would need to be – whether from the north-east or the whole of Scotland – will also be determined on the back of the feedback.It follows a painful  months for small and independent traders in the Granite City, hit by the news the city’s existing indoor market would be demolished and then learning it would close early as its operator went into administration.AMC’s plan, more in line with markets found on the continent, would be to open to the public every weekend with wholesale services to north-east hospitality operators through the week.As a charity, board members are hopeful any new venture would benefit from business rates relief, to be passed on to traders.And those behind it hope to have a close relationship with another beacon of light for start-up hospitality firms – the Staxx box market whose creators are looking at city-centre sites, including Shiprow.Mr McGrath, , believes the indoor market could complement the proposed shipping container food and drink venue # and that its vendors would use traders as their suppliers.Last night City centre councillor Ryan Houghton said the city authority was “all ears” on how it could help to deliver the new market.The administration’s business manager said: “It’s fantastic to see local initiatives being driven by organisations and we look forward to seeing detailed proposals.“Plans such as these are going to be crucial in the Covid recovery and I know people across Aberdeen will be looking to support local businesses.“Finding new ways to do that will be extremely welcome.”Aberdeen Multicultural Centre is taking views through a consumer survey available

they plan to support Aberdeen following the news the city may lose its last department store.Last week the north-east was rocked by the news John Lewis plans to close its store in Aberdeen – the only remaining department store in the north of Scotland.The retailer’s plans to close its branch on George Street provoked a huge public backlash, with more than , people signing petitions and hundreds more writing letters asking the chain to reconsider.A taskforce, including local authority chiefs and business leaders, was set up in a bid to convince John Lewis to rethink its decision.The closure of the store could lead to the loss of around  jobs – the latest in a long line of blows for the local economy.City leaders fear a #domino effect# where the loss of the store has an impact on other businesses in Aberdeen and the north-east, prompting calls for government support.The council#s administration has written to the leader of each main political party urging them to support the campaign.We asked the leaders what they will do to support the citythey form the next Scottish Government following May#s election.Here is what they said.#Throughout the pandemic, our retail sector has taken a massive hit and this is reflected by the unfortunate and incredibly sad decision that John Lewis took to close its doors in Aberdeen # a decision I hope it is willing to reconsider.#As we recover from the pandemic and out of lockdown, businesses need to be at the heart of that and a re-elected SNP Government would stand ready to work with the Aberdeen taskforce and all parties in the city to ensure Aberdeen City Centre is vibrant and attractive.“The SNP in government have already backed business in the city with more than £m of support during the pandemic.#Re-electing an SNP Government will ensure Aberdeen City receives a raft of measures to regenerate the area, including access to the £m City Centre Recovery Fund and the £m town centre fund, as well as £m set aside in this year#s budget specically to help support and create jobs in Aberdeen City and Aberdeenshire.#An SNP government stands ready to support Aberdeen, to revitalise the city centre, and to support investment where it is needed.##I’d like to thank everybody involved with the taskforce for working together to try and keep John Lewis in Aberdeen.#News of the planned closure was greeted with dismay across the North East, and I know this must be a really dficult time for the  members of staff.#I hope that a solution can be found that will allow John Lewis to maintain a presence in the city.#The Covid pandemic and its accompanying restrictions have accelerated problems that already existed for retail and our town centres.#Aberdeen has also been hit worse than most, with a collapse in oil prices and a business rates system that takes far more than it gives.#The truth is that the SNP government hasn’t given the region the attention it deserves.#That#s why I launched a campaign last week for a fair share for the north-east, including a £ billion regional enterprise agency, upgrades to key infrastructure, and rolling out broadband far faster than the SNP.#“Our high streets have been

launching a Business Network to establish solid relations with employers across the country.“City centre businesses will be vital in rebuilding our economy. We will focus on jobs and retail to help kick start our post-pandemic recovery, and ensure our high streets thrive once more.”Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: #The closure of John Lewis leaves a major hole in the middle of Aberdeen. We are determined to build a strong and flourishing economy in the North East so that we can sustain international brands like John Lewis in the city.“In the recent Scottish budget the Scottish Liberal Democrats secured £m for transition training specically for the North East boost the economy and new industries.#Under Scottish Liberal Democrat proposals, we will reform business rates to take the burden off high street retailers and give those shops the ability to compete with online retailers.#We will also give local authorities more powers to get to reshape their city and town centres into vibrant and flourishing places that people want to visit, spend money and set up shop.#“The John Lewis closure is devastating news for the workers and it shows how we really need to rethink our high streets after the pandemic, to make them more resilient and focused on the communities that live in and rely on them.#If we want our town centres to thrive, we need attractive public urban spaces that people want to spend time in.#This means levelling the playing field for independent shops, cooperatives like John Lewis and for community spaces, and stop giving tax-dodging online retailers incentives and tax breaks.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/2.57579155-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/2.57579155-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/2.57579155-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/2.57579155-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"local firm listed in exclusive profit league table","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remAn Aberdeenshire-based firm have made it onto an exclusive league table tracking companies in Britain with the fastest growing profits.Score Group, who have their headquarters in Peterhead, are one of just four companies established in Scotland to make the list.With more than , staff, including  apprentices, it is one of the largest employers on the league table.Founded in  to repair valves for the oil and gas industry, it has since expanded to service sectors including aerospace, defence and utilities.

ambitious new campaign to get #Aberdeenshire Back On Track# by ing train stations to north-east communities left without rail links for decades.The Campaign for North-East Rail, spearheaded by train driver Jordan Jack, has today set out its detailed plans for bringing modern rail infrastructure to the #forgotten# corners of Aberdeenshire, which have been cut off from the national railway network since the Beeching cuts in the s.Mr Jordan#s plan, which he has worked on with engineers for six months, details the case for train links to Peterhead, Fraserburgh and Banchory, and an integrated bus service all the way west from Banchory to Braemar.The campaign has outlined a number of potential benefits from its proposals, including a boost for the tourism sector, a transfer of freight transfer from the fishing industries of Peterhead and Fraserburgh from road to rail, and offering a #leline for isolated communities#.The vision would connect  of Aberdeenshire#s largest towns to #fast, reliable public transport, providing an utterly transformative system that will result in massive modal sht for thousands of people in the region#.It would require a number of major infrastructure projects to proceed, such as a bridge over the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route, and reconstruction of the Cruden Bay viaducct.A statement from the campaign in its #Aberdeenshire Back On Track# summary case document said: #Aberdeen is the third largest city in Scotland, yet has the least rail connections of all seven.#Vast swathes of the region lost vital rail links to the Beeching cuts.#Only two lines survived, one to Dundee, and another to Inverness.#Only stations that happen to be on the routes between these cities are lucky enough to have access to rail.#Only five of the region’s  largest settlements have a railway station.#The loss of local rail has contributed to a deep sense of isolation felt in all corners of Aberdeenshire today.#North-east communities feel forgotten about, and disconnected from even the rest of Aberdeenshire.#The historic areas of Buchan, Deeside, Garioch and Kincardineshire within Aberdeenshire are ided culturally and poorly connected physically.#Public appetite for rail is extremely high, and we intend to demonstrate this.#Mr Jack said he and the campaign team have contacted candidates for the north-east regional list, as well as the six constituency seats, ahead of May#s election asking for candidate endorsement.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium

have voiced their support for a campaign to keep the north#s last department store in Aberdeen.Last week John Lewis announced it plans to close its store on George Street # the UK#s most northern outlet and the only one in Scotland outside the central belt.It follows the closure of Debenhams, which has closed its stores in both Aberdeen and Inverness.The announcement sparked outrage from shoppers and members of the public in the north-east, with thousands of people aiming to convince the retail giant to reconsider.Two petitions have been set up, with a combined total of more than , people signing in support of the campaign.Many also added comments sharing why they want the partnership to stay in the Granite City.Chris Cusack described the store as #an important fixture in the city centre, and an essential part of its retail economy#, while Alison Murray claimed the region would be #bereft#the closure goes ahead.Dawn Allen said: #We desperately need to preserve the jobs and it is a three-hour drive to the next nearest store. Aberdeenshire needs John Lewis, not just the city itself.#And Karen Young added: #I worked in John Lewis for years and it was the best store in town. I think this will be a terrible loss to Aberdeen and it breaks my heart that those amazing staff will no longer do the jobs they live and are committed to.#A taskforce, including council chiefs and business leaders, held talks earlier this week with senior management at John Lewis.The campaign to save the store has also been backed by candidates standing in Aberdeen Central in the upcoming Scottish Parliament election.Scottish Labour candidate Barry Black, who set up one of the petitions calling for the closure decision to be reversed, said: #There is a mixture of anger and huge disappointment at the decision. This is the last department store in Aberdeen.#People do have confidence in the future of Aberdeen city centre but they see John Lewis as a huge part of that future. It#s the anchor of that side of the city centre, and there are a lot of retailers in George Street who have grave concerns because of the people it draws to that part of town.#This is much bigger than Aberdeen city. To the public in Aberdeenshire, Moray, the Highlands and even Orkney and Shetland, it#s their local department store.#Douglas Lumsden, the Scottish Conservative candidate, said: #I haven#t seen a public response like this for a long time. It just shows what this means to so many people, and it#s so important to the whole region.#If it does go it will be a devastating loss to the whole city.#Kevin Stewart of the SNP and: “I know from my mailbag and inbox that Aberdonians want John Lewis to stay in our city and I do hope that the John Lewis board will recognise this strength of feeling and agree to maintain a presence in our city.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/2.10676225-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/2.10676225-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/2.10676225-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/2.10676225-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"alba group has no public votes","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remSo, Aberdeenshire Council are the first authority in Scotland to have an official Alba Party group – Leigh Wilson, Alastair Bews and Brian Topping.Mr Wilson and Mr Bews quit the SNP in late  and created the Democratic Alliance group.

This is now a key metric that is considered when putting each area into tiers. The colour scales refer to the potential levels recommended by the World Health Organisation.Another key metric is the rate of cases per , people. The chart below shows the seven day rate in each local authority. Similar to the chart above, this chart is also colour coded by the potential levels as recommended by the WHO.In the early stages of the pandemic, cases were more concentrated in older generations. In the last few months this has shted towards cases being more prevalent in younger people – however, cases are declining in the more vulnerable age groups as the vaccine rollout progresses.As the number of daily new cases reduces, the cumulative totals for the health board areas become less important. The heatmap below shows the number of new cases by health board area.The chart below shows the daily number of deaths after a positive test as well as the cases where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certicate.The heatmap below shows the age demographics of the people who have lost their lives to the virus.The chart below shows a daily snapshot of the number of people in hospital and ICU with Covid-.

If you have a sporting collection, no matter what size or sport, please do get in touch.#It is hoped the project will also support Scotland’s sporting collections to be better understood and help identy the role sport plays in wider issues around health and wellbeing.The research is being conducted by archive specialists Turnstone Consultancy.Research lead Kat Petersen added: #Sporting heritage might be tidily boxed up in an archive or accumulating in a cupboard in your office or clubhouse. However it is being stored or displayed,you have any records or objects relating to sports in Scotland we would love to hear from you.#If anyone is aware of any sporting collections which may be of interest, or at risk in some way, an online survey is available for completion.

Not before time.I was supportive of the mitigation plan, using nets and catch pits, as the simplest and least expensive approach. It was certainly worth a try, but it is abundantly clear now # with reputedly £ million spent # that it is not working.The , tonnes or more poised to come down on the road may well be an underestimate, and recent closures of the OMR, despite the new bund, doesn’t say very much for the efficacy of the protection. So we need an alternative, and we need it soon, not  years away.Talk of #alternative traffic corridors# is just a distraction.There may well be a case for a bridge-and-tunnel approach. Such has been successful in Norway and # notably # both in Iceland and Faroe Islands, which have much smaller resource bases than Norway. But these would be long-term schemes, each requiring the completion of several major interlinked crossings, for the like of which Scotland’s roads authority has hitherto shown neither interest nor aptitude.The problem at the Rest is a local one which requires a local solution. It’s only a mile or so of road which is at issue there.The alternatives, realistically, boil down to three:Overhead protection might well be required over quite a long distance, as it’s not just the bit at the catch pits which is threatened. The slopes of the Cobbler have experienced slides too. Since the hillside ies it might not be possible to use standard prefabricated modules, and in any case installation work would close the A for some time.A tunnel through to Butterbridge could be driven quite quickly # particularlythe Norwegians did it # but the approach in upper Glen Croe would require protection just like the OMR. Sir William Lithgow’s proposal mentions this, but construction would also almost certainly close the OMR, leaving no ersion for that period.The construction of a new alignment up the south west side of the glen, however, either on or roughly parallel to the existing forestry road, would avoid interference with through traffic.Both the gradient and the transverse slope would be substantially similar to those of the existing A, though thewould be marginally greater, which is probably why the north east side was chosen when the #new# A was built.The core of the case for the third option, however, is that the south west side of the glen has experienced far less erosion, both historically and in recent years, than the north east one.Stand at the upper viewpoint, or better still a little way along the Lochgoilhead road, and look around. The slopes of Ben Luibhean on which the A runs show far more watercourses and gullies than any of the others in the vicinity.This indicates a lot more rainfall impacting that slope, probably by the prevailing weather being funnelled on to it through the pass at the top of Glen More. And that weather is becoming worse.There have been no major slips over the forestry road in recent years, despite a spate of them on the opposite slope. It may just be the trees. I don’t think so, but in any case the trees are there, while it would take some years for tree cover to established above the A.Going back a lot further in time, the pattern is the same. The burn in the floor of upper Glen Croe has been pushed, over the centuries, by slip debris coming down from the north east slope, and the depth of that debris can easily be seen in the gullies recently carved in it behind the new bund.There is also a fair number of impressively-sized boulders on the lower slopes on that side, which at some point rolled down the hillside. Some of these came from the Cobbler, and although most are below the road a few are not. There is nothing to say that more will not arrive.A further point is that while the lower slopes on each side of the upper glen are similar, those on the south west side ease off towards the top, while those on the NE slope do not.It is on these upper slopes that the small slips develop which can pick up more and more water and debris on their way down, hence the fan shape of the typical slip. There is, in other words, a lot less potential for the initiation of slips on the south west side.I think that this all points to the need for a serious look at the forestry road, and I fail to understand why the investigations a few years ago dismissed it as a viable alternative.It’s the existing A which isn’t viable. And why any of these solutions would take  years to complete also beats me. Local objections  There is only one house in upper Glen Croe, and in the rest of Argyll I have yet to meet anyone who doesn’t want a permanent solution.My suspicion is that the biggest dficulty is that Transport Scotland can’t yet find a way to explain how £ million could be spent to such little effect. I might, of course, be wrong in all this, but I wait to be convinced of it.Arthur Blue, ArdrishaigSir,Since the temporary repairs to the Rest are clearly getting nowhere and costing money into the bargain, I would like to suggest a radical solution to the problem, and that is to build a viaduct right down the centre of the valley, based on the design of the MillauFor those not familiar with this structure, it is well worth an internet search. I believe this is still the world#s tallest bridge and is a really beautul structure.Seen from a distance, the white deck and piers look quite unreal # moreBefore anyone asks where that sum of money is to be found, I would point out that Boris Johnson#s proposed tunnel to Northern Ireland may cost between £ billion and £ billion # nobody knows because it hasn#t been designed yet. Nevertheless, Alister Jack is extremely enthusiastic about the proposal, so clearly money is not a problem.Not only would this new viaduct solve the problem once and for all, I suspect that, like the Millau Viaduct, it would become a much-photographed tourist attraction.John McCall, LochgilpheadSir,In last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser, Councillor Alastair Redman criticises the SNP for setting aside £, of its own money to campaign for an independent Scotland.Not surprisingly, he fails to enlighten us as to the costs of  the Tory party#s #Union Unit# set up by the Prime Minister at the taxpayers# expense.David Hay, MinardSir,Due to the speed with which the NHS is carrying out its vaccination programme, there is hope that we can soon all get out again andto normal.We still, however, face huge challenges. The economy has suffered. The NHS faces a big backlog of cancelled operations. Our young people have a lot of schooling to catch up on. We don’t have much time left to stop our climate changing before it is too late.Here in Argyll the Scottish Government must rise to the challenge of building a permanent solution at the Rest and Be Thankful.These must be our priorities. We can’t afford to spend the next few years arguing over independence. That’s an unnecessary distraction.We need a needle-sharp focus on the recovery without the distraction of another isive referendum.Put recovery first.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardMr Reid is the Argyll and Bute LibDem candidate for May#s Scottish parliamentary election"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor march 12 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The vaccination process carried out with great economy and efficiency # and entirely painlessly so that we really will have to stop calling it #the jag#.The real bonus was the warmth and good humour from everyone involved that made the whole process welcoming, so that you left with a smile on your face. Only after the event do you realise what a tremendous team effort it was from everyone involved and all of them deserve our thanks.I hope very much that the Mid Argyll area makes a near  per cent response to the vaccination invitation, because that is what this effort deserves and will demonstrate to those involved the very real, genuine appreciation we have for their work during the pandemic.Norman Rea, Kintallen, TayvallichSir,The rank hypocrisy of the Scottish Tories knows no bounds.While they are frothing at the mouth that the first minister should resign over allegedly misleading the Scottish Parliament, at the same time Prime Minister Johnson was proven to have deliberately misled the Westminster parliament.Standing up in the House of Commons, Mr Johnson stated that all Covid-related contracts were #on the record#.This was three days after the High Court ruled the government had acted unlawfully by failing to publish hundreds of such contracts, which somehow seemed to find their way to those with Tory party connections.Two weeks prior to this, the Health Minister Matt Hancock was found guilty of illegal activity by the High Court, refusing to resign or even apologise when the extent of illegal awarding of PPE contracts was revealed.Last year Tory Home Secretary Priti Patel was found guilty of breaching the ministerial code by being a bully and shouting and swearing at civil servant employees in the Home Office, recently reaching a £, settlement with the former Home Office Permanent Secretary.Compare and contrast that with north of the border, where the Tory party has demanded the resignation of the first minister even before the outcome of the enquiries into the handling of the Alex Salmond case by the Scottish Government has been published.Not a cheep from them demanding an apology, let alone a resignation, for the flagrant abuses by their Westminster colleagues. What hypocrites.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,This Mother’s Day, school feeding charity Mary’s Meals would like to pay tribute to incredible women around the world.From the mums in the UK whose food has nourished us throughout our childhoods, including those who volunteer and fundraise for Mary’s Meals, to the women who cook and serve our daily meals for children in some of the world’s poorest countries, we celebrate them all.Mary’s Meals feeds more than . million hungry children in  countries every school day.That’s why I am asking your readers to send a Mary’s Meals gt card to the special women in their lives this Mother’s Day.

Thanks to the amazing commitment of some truly dedicated people working in the NHS and in social care, lives have been saved and people have been cared for. Stroke teams up and down the country have in many areas managed to continue to offer specialist care and treatment to patients throughout the pandemic. We cannot thank them enough.But the fallout from Covid- is going to pose challenges for everyone in health and social care. Our Recoveries at Risk report last autumn highlighted the real le impact of the pandemic on people recovering from a stroke.Emerging evidence of links between Covid- and stroke means that now, more than ever, a renewed national focus on stroke is needed in Scotland.Health officials have been working during the pandemic to review evidence and define what #a progressive stroke service for Scotland# should look like.This will include improved stroke care bundle figures, improved stroke prevention measures, a national thrombectomy service and stroke-specic, person-centred rehabilitation.The charity is pleased that people affected by stroke will be included in the development of this work.A draft paper will be with the Scottish Government in the next few weeks. Whatever the outcome of May’s election, the Stroke Association in Scotland expects the next government to push this work on, and for a new, improved, progressive stroke service to be implemented.Colin Oliver, public affairs officer, the Stroke Association in Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"argylls abigail releases debut single","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Keith also co-wrote and produced the single at his studio on the Isle of Lewis.Abigail said: #The single is about encouraging women to follow their passions and carve out a le that they can enjoy and be proud of.#The music video that we created doesn’t have me in it, I wanted it to showcase powerful women who are following their dreams in whatever field their passions and talents lie.#The ambition behind the single is for it to be inspiring and help others to find the courage and drive to fight for their goals, no matter what those are.#I have always recorded with my band Heron Valley, who are a traditional folk band, so recording something for myself has been really dferent. Firstly, due to the obvious genre dferences but also because I’ve always had the support of five other people to make key choices, so it’s been a big change making decisions by myself on how I want the music to sound.#I have really enjoyed the process and the musical independence recording the single has given me.#Originally from rural Argyll, Abigail grew up with music very much at the heart of her family learning fiddle from a young age, also being taught guitar and vocal stylings at home with her father. She joined Heron Valley in its infancy while also studying at Royal Conservatoire of Scotland Junior School.As well as touring extensively with Heron Valley, Abigail went on to graduate from The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland where she studied Scots Song and classical violin. Her unique music style and honest song writing make Abigail an exciting prospect for the Scottish music scene and Lady a much-anticipated release.Lady will be available to download and stream from Friday March ."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column march 12 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

As many examples as possible will then also be published in the Campbeltown Courier, Argyllshire Advertiser and Oban Times newspapers.The artwork, which must be created specically for this showcase, can be on any surface # as long as it can be photographed and submitted # but it is limited to one image per person. It is not a competition and none of artwork will be judged.Gigha-based youth work facilitator Kenny Wilson, one of the project#s organisers, explained: #As youth workers, we kept hearing the same phrases from young people, phrases like #My bedroom has become my classroom# and #I feel like the walls are closing in on me#. Young people were asking questions like #Where can we go # Nowhere. #Who we can meet # No-one. #What are we allowed to do # During lockdown, very little at all.#The idea is to give artistic young people something to do that#s not prescribed by the Curriculum for Excellence [Scotland#s education framework] or by the government to give them the freedom to choose what they want to do, to design whatever they want to design.#The reward will be seeing their artwork published online and in the newspapers.

She has travelled and trekked throughout the world, walked across Scotland numerous times, climbed many of its peaks and now lives in Argyll amongst the scenery she loves.Lovely Kilmartin Glen is host to many wonderful historic sites and ancient monuments.Overlooking its northern reaches the renaissance remains of Master John Carswell’s Carnasserie Castle stand proud, its ruins eerily dramatic despite now being more home to crow than human.There are many ways in which to explore the area. This circular takes you through time from Carnasserie Castle in the east to the prehistoric rock art at Ormaig in the west, before wending southwards on the path used in bygone days to reach Old Poltalloch. Then, turning east, you come to Lady’s Seat, which offers lovely views down the glen, a brief respite before turning northwards toto the castle’s realm. Glimpses over to Loch Craignish and down Kilmartin Glen give one time to ponder the geology of the area swept by the glaciers of the last ice age.At the car park you will see a small path exiting the NE corner by the information boards. Turn left and head up the track towards the castle. You initially come to a turning left, you will take this shortly. Meanwhile the castle lies just ahead, through a gate and up a steep path to your left. Currently you can but admire its grandeur from the outside, either from here or the next section of the walk .Return to the track and take the turn on your right SW up through the trees and to a gate. Ahead you will cross the field for m, with the castle to your right, before re-joining the farm track. Follow it to a T-junction .Turn right and continue up the field and through a gate. A young forestry plantation lies to your left, pretty and convoluted little hills and glens to your right. Effectively the valley floor is the line of a dyke with the lumps, bumps and ides a mixture of limestone, igneous rock intrusions, sandstones, gritstones, conglomerates and folding doing much to create the complex NE SW flow seen in the shape of the hills and lochs all carved out by glaciers.Follow the track over the col past a gnarly old plantation on a knoll. The route descends for km towards Loch Craignish before veering sharply right to cross the Eas Mor burn at its western end. Note the main track you come on to. For those wishing to miss the path to Old Poltalloch you will need toto this point and keep following it south east to join up with the rest of the route.Cross the bridge over the Eas Mor. Ignore the small path to your right with a barrier and continue for m look out for the new track signposted up to the prehistoric rock art of Ormaig. After ascending m you will see the little paths to your right leading to the stones, a good place to pause and wonder at those who carved them.Return to the track below and south over the Eas Mor. At the sharp left-hand bend turn immediately right towards the sea. After just m, opposite a ruined croft, an easily missed path slips down to a wall. As soon as you are on it, it is obvious and now wends its way southwards towards Old Poltalloch through the ‘Big Wood’.The path is boggy in places with the odd fallen tree. After .km it reaches a forestry road turn left and follow this for m to a sharp left-hand bend. The path goes straight ahead at the bottom of the bend just below a turning point, again it is not obvious until you are on it. Continue to follow this all the way until you reach the road at Old Poltalloch, passing farmstead ruins and the old walled garden on your right. The house itself has now been renovated.Turn left. The track, which also leads to a jetty below, climbs upwards for nearly km before reaching the col leading to Kilmartin Glen. Ignore the two tracks you pass on your left .Descend for m and take the grassy forestry track to your right. After m a path leads upwards on your right to Lady’s Seat, a worthy detour for a grand view over the glen.Return to the track and turn right to descend to the main track below . Cross straight over, through a gate to the right of some sheep pens. Passing a track from your right after mzigzag down through the woods to a gate. The track does a sharp -degree turn right and, a little after, turn left to follow the tracks back to Carnasserie and your earlier outward route.Please note: Historic and Environment Scotland properties and sites remain closed due to Covid the castle can only be viewed from the outside at this time.

Please help us raise awareness and raise funds. Whilst we are all fighting coronavirus, Target Oian Cancer is putting the needs of women with oian cancer before all .In  my mother, the actress Marjie Lawrence, was diagnosed with oian cancer just three weeks before she died. Had we and her doctors been aware of the symptoms, Marjie might be alive today. If diagnosed at the earliest stage, nine in  women will survive. But two thirds of women are diagnosed late, when the cancer is harder to treat.This March, for Oian Cancer Awareness Month, I’m writing to ask your readers to take just two minutes of their time to learn the symptoms and spread the word to their families and friends.The main symptoms of oian cancer are: persistent bloating, feeling full or having dficulty eating, tummy pain, and needing to wee more often or more urgently.If you believe in a future where every woman diagnosed with oian cancer has the best chance of survival, please show your support and visit www.targetoiancancer.org.uk MarchSarah Greene, Target Oian Cancer PatronSir,We welcome the latest announcement from the Scottish Government that communal worship can potentially resume from March  with the possibility of up to  people in attendance, assuming physical distancing of two metres can be in place.Christians are Easter people we live with hope in all circumstances, and the church will be providing guidance to congregations to help them ensure that buildings are re-opened in a safe and responsible manner.While some congregations will adopt a cautious approach regarding the reopening of our buildings # and others won#t have the practical means to do so # everyone will be very glad at this news and will already be looking forward to how most appropriately to celebrate Easter .In whatever we do, we#ll be remembering that the God who raised Jesus from the grave has been faithful to us throughout the whole of this last year.Rt Rev Dr Martin Fair, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of ScotlandSir,The first Citizens’ Assembly of Scotland has submitted its final report to the Scottish Parliament, with its  powerful democratic recommendations aimed at improving the wellbeing of Scotland#s people and governance.I personally would have loved to be a participant in this new democratic exercise, meeting and sharing with, speaking and listening to, a wide range of our people, many very unlike me and with very dferent perspectives, opinions and lived experience.To be informed by a range of expert, evidence-based perspectives, to explore and discuss implications and reservations, and to move towards a rough consensus on a range of key questions that will affect ourselves, our children and grandchildren, and that will shape the future of our country – that’s the exemplar of the active, responsible citizen of st century Scotland.There#s a climate assembly also currently working towards its conclusions, and I await its recommendations with interest and anticipation.Recommendation six of the first assembly is: #That in order to ensure that citizens can make informed decisions in relation to rebuilding their communities the Scottish government and parliament should: establish community-based citizens# assemblies to assess what is happening in our communities , identy gaps and recommend actions, including through digital technology, that can bring people together and make our communities more inclusive.#We have a Scottish election coming up in May, and I hope to see a good turnout as a good majority of Scotland’s electorate, from age  upwards, make sure to vote in this most critical exercise of our moment of power and responsibility.Subsequently, I hope to very soon look forward to a renewed interest in local democracy, as an Argyll and Bute Citizens# Assembly debates and decide the shape of Argyll and Bute#s future for the coming decisive decade.Perhaps that future will include enhanced interest and participation in some version of our current powerless and voiceless community councils.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"longing for a rest","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

This is mainly due to massive insecticide use and habitat loss caused by intensication of agriculture.Up to  per cent of flowering plants and  per cent of commercial crops require insects for pollination, with honeybees and hoverflies most often doing the job.But with declining numbers of these species, farmers may employ hives of bees to prevent crop yields falling.Wild honeybees forage within three miles of their nest, and onthey perform the #waggle dance# that advertises the location of productive foraging sites to other bees. Also, odours from scented flowers picked up inside the nest while unloading pollen act as cues to guide nest-mates to specic flowers.Now scientists have articially imprinted bees with flower odours in an attempt to improve crop yields*.In trying to establish long-term memory for flower odours, the scientists offered bees in three separate groups of hives alternative odours:  sucrose solution scented with synthetic sunflower odours,  sucrose solution scented with jasmine odours,  sucrose solution alone. They then relocated the hives to a sunflower plantation and compared the foraging activities of bees exposed to the three solutions.First, scientists decoded waggle dances to identy sunflower-specic dances. Using this information, they observed bees from hives fed with sunflower odours performing sunflower dances one hour after hive relocation.Contrastingly, the control bees fed jasmine odours took - hours and control sucrose-fed bees took  hours to perform sunflower dances.This resulted in the sunflower odour-imprinted bees performing signicantly more sunflower-specic waggle dances during the first day of relocation, peaking at  per cent increase over control hives preferentially visiting sunflowers and bringing in more sunflower pollen loads than the control bees.The scientists then measured the all-important crop yields in five plots containing dferent sunflower hybrid plants pollinated by sunflower odour-imprinted compared to control bees.Seed yields in all five plots were highest when pollinated by sunflower odour-fed bees, with increased production up to  per cent above control bees.They conclude that providing bees pre-programmed to forage on specic crops could circumvent wild pollinator shortages and signicantly increase crop yields.*Current Biology , -.

Especially when option one, the Glen Croe route, was the chosen option from the A Trunk Road Study # summary report published by Jacobs in .Surely, after nine years of consulting, the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland can choose the best solution rather than going through a y and expensive consultation process.Based on this, our members would like the permanent solution fast tracked, which is well within the Scottish Government’s power and we would ask for this to be seriously considered.Our other comments and feedback to last week’s announcement are as follows:The timber road route should be upgraded as a short-term solution this summer and not in the suggested  months.Argyll businesses have faced the issues of landslides for many years. However, the situation has worsened over the past year and in our opinion it has now become a national emergency and requires immediate action.The , tons of unstable material could swamp any further mitigation measures put in place on the A and Old Military Roadand make the roads impassable. This could easily happen when we next have an extended period of rainfall.Savings in further mitigation work could go towards upgrading the forestry road.The long-term solution should be selected from the  The A Trunk Road Study and based on the delivery of the most sustainable outcome.Any well-developed permanent solution needs to be open  without fear of being buried under tons of rock and mud, and will have less environmental impact than the landslides, catchpits, netting and OMR bund we are currently experiencing.Our understanding of costs and timescales from similar schemes in Norway show a tunnel could be built in three years at a cost of £-m, and not the £-m stated by Transport Scotland.Members of The RABT Campaign group represent a cross section of business sectors and we would welcome the chance to meet with your officials to discuss how we might help cut through the y timescales and fast-track decision making.John Gurr  Sir,I heard that there was work going on in Lochgilphead town centre, and that some people were complaining, about mess and upheaval.

As we look ahead to this year’s event on Saturday March  at .pm, many of us are reflecting on the future, as we emerge from the latest, and hopefully last #stay at home# period.With that in mind, we are asking people to use Earth Hour by helping us to create the #Great Scottish Canvas#.

While saving in some areas of expenditure, it has incurred extra costs in tackling the pandemic and faces an uncertain funding future while the national economy tries to recover. The drive to save money in services where bringing in a little more through, for example, parking fees and fines, is understandable up to a point.But when the economy is on le support after a pandemic, surely the relatively paltry sums to be made are not worth the potential damage to Inveraray#s recovery, as seems to be the view of locals Perhaps councillors could look at this a little dferently. If they are determined to push this through for control traffic purposes, why not donate the proceeds, which would be a by-product of well-behaved traffic, to the town  The pier fund could certainly use it. Both the community council and Inspire Inveraray would no doubt welcome the cash and find many uses for public benefit.Just a thought.Congratulations to Cameron on his award. This is a huge achievement among a group of young people who each work hard for others.It is also  a great achievement for MacLeod Construction to be shortlisted for a national award.

However, on further reading, this was yet another unsurprising disappointment. The preferred corridor through Glen Croe is still to be announced and there is still no timetable for completion.Landslips at the Rest and be Thankful have frequently seen much of Argyll isolated from central Scotland, or journeys delayed by endless roadworks or convoys along the old military road. Most of these problems have occurred during the SNP’s  years in government and the continued failure to provide a permanent solution is yet more proof of how little the SNP cares about or understand the needs of people and businesses outside the central belt.It was clear long ago that patchwork schemes were not a solution but, rather than provide a new corridor which would have resulted in major capital expenditure, tens of millions of pounds have instead been wasted on years of ineffective schemes which nature evades in next to no time.In the meantime, the SNP has had no dficulty finding money to prop up central belt vanity projects like the Edinburgh trams.Mike Russell, SNP MSP for Argyll and Bute, has been far more concerned with Indyref and Brexit than the day to day concerns of his constituents and has done nothing to ensure that providing a reliable road connection to Argyll is a top priority for Michael Matheson, the Cabinet Secretary for Transport.The Holyrood elections on May  are an ideal opportunity for the residents and business owners in Argyll, whose daily lives are affected by such an unreliable road, to voice their dissatisfaction and vote for anyone other than the SNP or the Greens who oppose any road building on principle.A dferent government might not guarantee a speedy resolution, but after  years of failed sticking-plaster attempts to patch up the existing road, it certainly couldn’t be worse.Donald McCallum, Strathaven.Sir,Across the Kintyre and the Islands ward I continue to receive complaints about the rather shoddy condition of road signage.In some cases the signs are faded and covered in dirt and in many other cases they are falling to pieces.One example of this is the road signs above the footpath outside Port Ellen Primary School on Islay and sadly there are many other examples. In my opinion in the future Argyll and Bute Council must be more diligent in maintaining our signs.Road signs help to regulate traffic, provide crucial visual guidance and give drivers important previews, especially during night-time conditions.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I write further to correspondence on Lochgilphead#s expensive new pavements.When they are finally finished, could somebody seethey have a bucket or two of tarry stones left over that could be chucked into the tank trap that passes for a roundabout, next to the Tesco garage David Hay, MinardSir,I have immense pleasure in communicating to your readers our new address following our successful relocation of our main office premises.Our email, website and telephone numbers remain the same as before.Email: info@abcab.org.uk and phone  .We have had no break in service and continue to provide advice and support to clients across Argyll and Bute, with our advisers all working from home under current government guidance.We are also available to provide advice to those who find themselves in a vulnerable position and require face-to-face advice by appointment in our Helensburgh and Lochgilphead offices.We commence our second volunteer adviser training programme next month and look forward to welcoming our new trainees.Jen Broadhurst, Bureau Manager, Argyll and Bute Citizens Advice BureauSir,Following the Scottish Government#s pay offer of four per cent across the board for all NHS workers, Unite will ballot its members on the offer over the next few weeks.Unite represents workers in every pay band across the entire NHS structure and recognises that while this offer will put money into the pockets of our members, any monthly pay uplt will y considerably between iniduals. For this reason Unite will be putting this offer to our members without recommendation.The offer includes an opportunity to revisit any settlement including an intention by the Scottish Government to allocate additional funding through Barnett Consequentials. Unite will demand that any additional payment made to the Scottish Government by Westminster through this formula, is passed on to our members.Workers across the NHS have been described as #heroic# in what has been an exceptionally challenging year. Now is the time to reward those workers with the pay uplt they deserve, not just for their work during the Covid pandemic, but also for the pay cuts they have endured through years of austerity.For Unite, other pay potential remains on the table in the form of additional Barnett Consequentials and we will pursue any additional pay that is intended for our members through further negotiation with any future Scottish Government.James O’Connell, Unite regional officer for Scotland.Sir,I work for a TV company called Five Mile Films and we are making a new documentary series this year for Channel .We are looking for people to apply to take part who are wanting to live a simpler le. The filming will take place over a number of months this year in rural Britain.The idea behind the series is about saying goodbye to smartphones, Zoom calls, social media # all the distractions and pressures of normal le # to go and live a simpler le, experience the #good le# fantasy and think about what our modern le and its multitude of choices has really given us.

We raised a magnicent £!David and Cindy MacInnes of Furnace Stores, keen as always to help out, said they would host the tombola # and what a tombola it was # table top sales and the Easter egg hunt for the kids.

Seeds were planted, nurtured and potted on. Plants were lted, ided and begged to thrive.A couple of SCIO members had the unenviable task of separating and folding thousands of raffle tickets # so much fun.And so to the day. Would all that effort be worth it  Would anyone come  Would we be able to raise even more money The answer, of course, was yes. The turnout was amazing, way beyond expectation. Everyone adhered to the face mask and no huggingrules but the smiles as people greeted their friends and neighbours could not be hidden despite the masks.Watching the kids running round looking for Easter eggs and the Golden Egg to win the giant bunny was a joy to see.Everyone attending waited patiently in the queues at all the stalls and no one minded because the sun shone. What a glorious day.All the baking and planting and coaxing donations and ticket sales, the sore feet when it was all over were worth every minute.Overall we raised a magnicent £,.From everyone on the SCIO to all the Furnace folk and friends #  thank you.

When we hear of something that is dficult to believe, we want the evidence of our own eyes.Jesus#s disciple Thomas was like that. It was the week after the crucixion had destroyed their dreams. The disciples were huddled indoors in fear of their lives when suddenly the resurrected Jesus was there among them.Thomas hadn#t been with the others when it happened. He just could not bring himself to believe without seeing him for himself.

The market intelligence report, now in its th edition, builds upon Euroconsultrsquos previous iteration that accurately predicted more than , satellites would be launched during , a record year despite COVID-. The new release further reinforces the sentiment that the s will be the decade of small satellites, anticipating the launch of close to , smallsats before .The main driver for this continued growth during a time where many face pandemic-related challenges is plans for satcom broadband ldquomega-constellations and the continuous necessity for replenishment launches. Of all smallsats to be launched, % are expected to be part of constellations. Furthermore, the smallsat manufacturing and launch market are set to do more than triple over the next decade, to  billion and  billion respectively, driven by the multiplication of constellation projects from both commercial and government stakeholders. Euroconsult, who operate from locations across North America, Europe and Asia and specialise in the space sector and satellite enabled verticals, have released their updated findings at a time when launch rates are at least on par with last year, suggesting that the era of the mega-constellation has truly arrived.Flagship examples of low earth orbitbroadband constellations, such as SpaceXrsquos Starlink and Amazonrsquos Kuiper, account for almost half of the projected demand over -. Readers are therefore advised to go beyond raw numbers as vertical integration keeps growing with numerous players seeking to manufacture, operate and launch their own smallsats. Signicant future market shares are now captive of a region, country or of an integrator and or launch provider, challenging both commercial satellite integrators and launch providers which see more of their target customers not only leaving their addressable market, but also competing with their own services. The smallsat market is however more open to procurement from third parties at the subsystem level than at the satellite level.The updated report, free extract available, comes with an option to access premium features, including Euroconsultrsquos Smallsat Constellation Database that covers extensive past, current and future data - the first time Euroconsult have ever shared their ldquosecret ingredients with customers.Alexandre Najjar, Senior Consultant at Euroconsult stated, ldquoOur smallsat report is once again in high-demand and with major intelligence updates being drawn from post-pandemic data and reviews of key pricing models and satcom application forecasts, plus the inclusion of Space Logistics information that features In-Orbit Servicing, Debris Removal, Last Mile Logistics and In-Orbit Manufacturing, we believe this report will be invaluable to key industry stakeholders and investors.Other valuable updates to Prospects for the Small Satellite Marketinclude a reviewed and refined pricing model for manufacturing and launch prices, while satellite applications in the database have been rebalanced, most notably with regard to Information, Earth Observation and Security applications. The Euroconsult report incorporates new content to help give decision makers key knowledge in this area, as well as a reviewed and up-to-date forecast accounting for the economic situation and impact of COVID-. With its increasing importance, the extensive Euroconsult database has been updated to reflect the signicant growth and developments of the Chinese constellations, with input from Chinese-speaking stakeholders.This publication includes extensive data points on units, mass, and value for manufacturing and launch services. It provides a forecast for the next decade broken down by application, orbit, operator type, mass category, operator region, as well as integrator and launch provider, type of integrator, type of launcher and other subsets.

The first time that a second ballot was required, all with an amazing  per cent support of the community members who voted and the many organisations and iniduals who gave their time, effort and financial support to achieve this unprecedented result.#TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOWee Toon workers# nightmareThe Campbeltown area is one of the hardest places in Scotland to find a job.Analysts at Durham University using government figures have calculated that there are . people chasing every job vacancy in the Campbeltown Travel to Work Area.The figures for the three months up to January were . people chasing each vacancy.The February figures put Campbeltown and surrounding area at the top of the league table in Scotland for numbers of unemployed per vacancy.Islay and Mid Argyll were seventh in the table with . people chasing each job while Oban was st with ..Bottom of the table, the easiest place to find work, was the Aberdeen area.Since Durham University prepared its figures, Campbeltown has suffered two major jobs losses.Mull of Kintyre Seafood is expected to close next month with the loss of  jobs and last month Campbeltown Shipyard laid off  men, about one-third of its workforce.FIFTY YEARS AGOFishermen backed to the hiltCampbeltown Town Council is to urge the government to take #every possible step# to protect Scottish fishermen#s interestsBritain enters the Common Market.A resolution submitted by Mr AIB Stewart, secretary of the Clyde Fishermen#s Association, was unanimously accepted at a meeting of the council and representatives from the fishing industry.Fishermen stand to lose the protection of a -mile fishing limitthe country joins the Common Market.Mr Stewart said, with a trace of witty sarcasm: #Of course, inwe could fish in the Mediterranean.#He then referred to the large quantity of herring which was bought in Scotland by other countries, whose once huge fishings have finished.#They have over-fished their own grounds. Three-quarters of the herring landed in Britain are caught between the Clyde and the Minches,# he revealed.If the limit was abolished, Mr Stewart went on, foreigners would not send carrier boats, but ships to catch fish.He concluded by wondering what would happen to communities like Campbeltown, Carradale and Tarbert and places all around.Mr William McAffer, of Tarbert, said his main fear was unemployment.#If we lose the limit, we will lose our identity,# he said.And Councillor Henry Moffat warned: #We#re going to finish up with plenty of empty boats and more men on the dole. People#s livelihood is at stake now.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOThe Poor RollA considerable number of applications for poor relief were disposed of, and the roll of outdoor poor was revised, several alterations in the payments made to iniduals being sanctioned.Bailie Campbell, in connection with the usage where by children in receipt of Parish Council assistance are struck off the roll on attaining the age of  years, suggested that the rule should not be rigidly enforced, but that allowances should be continued as long as children remained in school.Such a concession might be a help to bright pupils, and in the case of others it would keep them off the streets and out of harm till such time as they secured employment.Mr M#Arthur thought it was a waste of time keeping children in school after .Pupils of exceptional educational promise might be helped on the recommendations of responsible authorities, but as for the others the best service that could be done them would be to assist in securing employment for them, and particularly with regard to girls, getting them into domestic service.Temperance reportRev Mr MacLeod, as convenor of the Temperance Committee, submitted his annual report on temperance.He said it had been hoped that the report this year would be of exceptional interest, but the No-Licence Poll taken last November showed that they had still a long way to go before they reached the goal of their desires.There was little cause for elation in the present situation, but still there was no reason to be discouraged.The failure of the efforts on behalf of No-Licence last November was due to the apathy of Christian men and women and to their indference to the terrible effects of the drink traffic.They congratulated their Arran brethren on the magnicent fight they had put up and the splendid result achieved.Shiskine had been the prime factor in the struggle, and there great things had been done but in the north end good work had also been achieved, against odds.Mr MacLeod emphasised the need for no slackening of effort in bringing home to the minds and consciences of the people their duty in relation to the drink traffic, and advised especially the education of the young with regard to this matter.There was plenty of room for increased effort in these directions in all congregations of the Presbytery.Mr MacLeod was thanked for his report."},{"url":null,"title":"leader march 26 2021","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Especially when option one, the Glen Croe route, was the chosen option from the A Trunk Road Study # summary report published by Jacobs, issued in .Surely, after nine years of consulting, the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland can choose the best solution rather than going through a y and expensive consultation process.Based on this, our members would like the permanent solution fast tracked, which is well within the Scottish Government’s power and we would ask for this to be seriously considered.Our other comments and feedback to last week’s announcement are as follows:The timber road route should be upgraded as a short-term solution this summer and not in the suggested  months.Argyll businesses have faced the issues of landslides for many years. However, the situation has worsened over the past year and in our opinion it has now become a national emergency and requires immediate action.The , tonnes of unstable material could swamp any further mitigation measures put in place on the A and Old Military Roadand make the roads impassable. This could easily happen when we next have an extended period of rainfall.Savings in further mitigation work could go towards upgrading the forestry road.The long-term solution should be selected from the  The A Trunk Road Study and based on the delivery of the most sustainable outcome.Any well-developed permanent solution needs to be open  without fear of being buried under tons of rock and mud, and will have less environmental impact than the landslides, catchpits, netting and OMR bund we are currently experiencing.Our understanding of costs and timescales from similar schemes in Norway show a tunnel could be built in three years at a cost of £-m, and not the £-m confirmed by Transport Scotland.Members of The RABT Campaign group represent a cross section of business sectors and we would welcome the chance to meet with your officials to discuss how we might help cut through the y timescales and fast track decision making.In the s and s boys were often recruited from the town and district by shipping companies.

With Tommy#s family#s kind permission, the Courier shares his story again.Campbeltown#s Tommy Kelly could have no idea he was playing before a future football icon when invited to England for professional trials in .Tommy, something of a football legend in his native Kintyre after a prominent role with Campbeltown Pupils, was known as #Iron Man# for his fearsome playing style and boundless energy.After shining in the local leagues, he was invited to Hartlepool United, a club starting season   in English football#s fourth tier, and managed by Brian Clough # all thanks to an unlikely talent spotter.Tommy said: #As far as I know it was a tanker driver working down here who told Hartlepool about me.#The next thing I had a letter through the door inviting me to a trial.#Clough ran the rule over Tommy, who played mostly as an outside right, who was then in his early s and starting out on an eventual -year career in Campbeltown with the gas board.The young Clough, in his first management job after a prolic career was cut short by injury, greeted Tommy by saying: #I hope the heather#s not growing out of your ears.#Tommy said: #That threw me a bit. I wondered who this arrogant young manager was.#I can still see him now. Although he was just starting out in management, he had total respect among the players. All you heard was #boss, boss, boss# when they addressed him.#Tommy played at outside right against a local side and scored two goals. Clough was so impressed he wanted the #Iron Man# back down for two more trial matches, and Tommy, having loved the atmosphere, was keen to .He said: #The crowd at the Victoria Ground was brilliant and it was a great feeling scoring two goals.#However, the second trip did not turn out quite as planned.Tommy laughed: #Hartlepool paid expenses for my trips but it was hardly enough to get me to Peninver.#I ed and brought the late Mike McGougan, a classy winger for the Pupils, down with me. I phoned Mr Clough beforehand and he was ok with it.#So when we arrived, I met Clough and introduced him to Mike.#Clough said: #Why don#t you bring the whole f****** pipe band down ##We were a bit shocked and Mike got annoyed and spoke back to him. He never played while we were down there.#I spent three weeks at Hartlepool between the two trips, but Clough would only sign me as an amateur. He and his assistant Peter Taylor, who was an absolute gentleman, were on a tight budget.#By that time, I had a family to think about, so it just didn#t work out. I told him it was professional or nothing.#I was just a hard player with a great engine, and the odd goal in me.

Before the end of the service, the church roof collapsed in what would have been a tragedy, however, all the congregation, being outside, were unharmed.The site is also home to the Clan MacDonald of Largie family crypt. Inside the locked mausoleum, above which the words #Here rest the bones of the House of Largie# are inscribed, are the carved grave slabs of several members of the MacDonald family, including founder Ranald Bane MacDonald, a th century warrior.The stones, featuring Celtic patterns, animals, swords and ships among other things, are said to be some of the best preserved examples in Scotland.Nature has taken hold in many areas of the graveyard but the Killean and Kilchenzie Churches Preservation Association, established in , is working to preserve the buildings that remain from further ruin.According to the charity#s Facebook page, its main aims are: to preserve and make safe the historic churches and the carved stones of Killean and Kilchenzie, by approved conservation techniques, so that these items are available for view and for study by future generations to advance education and encourage interest in the architecture, social and religious history embedded in the sites of the churches, carved stones, and the historical heritage they represent and to preserve and restore the surrounding graveyards so that the headstones are secured and their data recorded so that the genealogical records are preserved."},{"url":null,"title":"from our files april 2 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

In - the figure was closer to ,.It is said that damaged ied from #localised root pulling# to heavy grazing of root crops and pasture.Geese were also blamed for creating large puddles.The report suggests that one reason for geese becoming an increasing problem was the fact that they were being attracted by improved grazing work done by the farmers.The president of the Kintyre branch of the NFUS, Rory Collville, said the survey backed the case for a compensation scheme.The branch is due to discuss the survey next month.He told the Courier: #Two-and-a-half-thousand birds may not sound like much.#Butyou were a farmer with that number in your field you#d want compensation for the damage they cause. Where they are a problem, they are a serious problem.#Lighthouse keepers leaveThe last keepers will leave the Mull of Kintyre lighthouse this weekend when the lighthouse is officially automated.The lighthouse, which has shone out over the North Channel since , will be de-manned on Sunday.It has taken two years# work to automate the lighthouse.

It underlines the fact that it is communities who know best what is best for them.Argyll and Bute Council was at the centre of ensuring our resilience teams got support and Scottish Government funding dispersed quickly and efficiently.That is why I find the decision of the Tory Lib Dem Independent ruling administration to remove the recycling service from Kintyre Recycling Ltdand taking it in-house as short-sighted. And giving them only six months notice is disgraceful.KRL has provided a reliable service for the community since  and given employment opportunities to people with barriers to work. It has a committed board and management team who have ersied the projects it does to ensure sustainability. But this decision leaves a gaping hole in its business plan and a workforce unsurethey will still have jobs.There is a projected increase in cost of £, to supply recycling bins across Kintyre. But this does not take account of the possible social and welfare cost of the impact on the workforce. This is yet another blow to the community already hammered by unemployment.I urge the council to work closely with KRL to find a solution that ensures that all of the KRL employees at risk of redundancy are found suitable employment and that this valuable organisation can continue to employ vulnerable people providing services from which everyone benefits.In , the SNP published a coloured map showing options for the route of the A at the Rest and Be Thankful. Nine years later, all they have done is colour in the map slightly dferently. We are no further forward.Whoever is in government after the election must stump up the money needed to construct a road protected from landslides. This must be done a lot quicker than the  years the SNP say it will take them.Without urgent action, many businesses in Argyll will not survive.Across the Kintyre and the Islands ward I continue to receive complaints about the rather shoddy condition of road signs.In some cases the signs are faded and covered in dirt and in many other cases they are falling to pieces.One example of this is the road signs above the footpath outside of Port Ellen Primary School on Islay and sadly there are many other examples.In my opinion, in the future, Argyll and Bute Council must be more diligent in maintaining our signs. Road signs help regulate traffic, provide crucial visual guidance and give drivers important preview especially during night-time conditions.I will continue to campaign for more frequent road sign maintenance for every corner of my ward.Following the Scottish Government#s pay offer of four per cent across the board for all NHS workers, Unite will ballot its members on the offer over the next few weeks.Unite represents workers in every pay band across the entire NHS structure and recognises that while this offer will put money into the pockets of our members, any monthly pay uplt will y considerably between iniduals. For this reason, Unite will be putting this offer to our members without recommendation.The offer includes an opportunity to revisit any settlement including an intention by the Scottish Government to allocate additional funding through Barnett Consequentials. Unite will demand that any additional payment made to the Scottish Government by Westminster through this formula, is passed on to our members.Workers across the NHS have been described as #heroic# in what has been an exceptionally challenging year.Now is the time to reward those workers with the pay uplt they deserve, not just for their work during the Covid pandemic, but also for the pay cuts they have endured through years of austerity.For Unite, other pay potential remains on the table in the form of additional Barnett Consequentials and we will pursue any additional pay that is intended for our members through further negotiation with any future Scottish Government.I work for a television company called Five Mile Films and we are making a new documentary series this year for Channel .We are looking for people to apply to take part who want to live a simpler le.

It is not depression it is more subtle and has spiritual overtones – I would say it is most profoundly a spiritual phenomenon.Looking into it, I clearly identied aspects of it in myself today! It appears to be the most #underdiagnosed# and unacknowledged spiritual illness of this age.I found that Pope Francis also came across it. Commenting in the context of healing the paralytic by the pool, he said the #first illness# is the one afflicting the paralysed man. He had #resigned himself to it,# the Pope said, #perhaps saying to himself: #Le is unfair, others are more fortunate than I am#. There is a plaintive tone in this way of speaking # there is resignation but there is also bitterness.#He added that it is an attitude reminiscent of #many [Christians] who lack enthusiasm and who are bitter#, who repeatedly say to themselves: #I go to [church] every Sunday but it is better not to become involved! I believe for my own sake, but I don#t feel the need to give it to others: each one peacefully at his own home.#These people, the Pope added, also take the attitude that # you do something well in le, they#ll reprove you: so, it#s better not to take the risk#.Good Friday, Easter Sunday # excellent days to take the risk and resolve to do something well in le, to set sensible goals to be better than I am now.

Traffic management will remain in place  hours a day during footpath improvement operations.In order to carry out the footpath improvements works at Hall Street, some parking restrictions will be required, however, access to businesses and properties located on the street will be maintained for pedestrians, with only minimal disruption, to ensure public safety.The safety of maintenance workers remains #a top priority# during this project and strict physical distancing protocols, in line with Scottish Government guidance, will be in place to ensure all on-site personnel remain safe throughout the duration of the project.Argyll First councillor Donald Kelly welcomed news of the plan which will be finalised after the consultation period ends. He said: #I am pleased that this work has finally been programmed and I look forward to seeing the long-awaited and much-needed improvements to the ious areas of the town.#"},{"url":null,"title":"tributes paid to golf writing great jock macvicar","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I went to school one year and Jock came the next year.#The pair went on to become two of the best known names in Scottish golf, Belle through her success on the course and Jock through his coverage of the sport.Jock interviewed Belle from time-to-time before her retirement in the mid-s.She said: #When he interviewed me, he would say, #Before we start, any news of home # He took the name of Dunaverty and publicised it worldwide.#When I was on the way up, people would say, #Dunaverty, where#s that # and I#d say, #Paul McCartney, Mull of Kintyre, you know # I used to say that between Paul McCartney, Mull of Kintyre and Jock MacVicar, we got Dunaverty on the map.#A Dunaverty Golf Club spokesperson said: #Everyone at Dunaverty Golf Club is deeply saddened to hear of the passing of our honorary member and dear friend Jock MacVicar. Jock was a great supporter of Dunaverty and spread the word of our fantastic course around the world. Our thoughts are with Jock#s family and friends.#Belle added: #Jock was very well respected in the industry. He had a lovely way –somebody said something in frustration when they came off the golf course, mad at themselves, something that could maybe be twisted another way from what was intended, Jock never crossed the line of doing that.#If he did have a wee criticism of somebody, he always found the nicest possible way to say it. He had a nice way with words and a nice way with people.#The week he died, Jock took part in an interview about The Masters, one of the four major championships in professional golf, which began this week.#It was in connection with Scotland#s interest in Robert MacIntyre from Oban,# Belle said. #Jock was fiercely proud of the fact, I think, that he could mention Kintyre and Oban.#It#s a pleasure to have known him all those years and, for me, it was a wee link with Kintyre too.#Although Jock lived in Glasgow, he kept coming back to Kintyre to see his family and friends, so he obviously enjoyed being here.#Jock came from a line of renowned MacVicars from Southend. As well as writing for the Campbeltown Courier, his father Angus was a prolic author in a number of genres, including crime thrillers, juvenile science fiction, and autobiography.

It has been such a tough time for them and their parents and carers, so I felt it was important for them to have something fun to do.#I remember how much we loved going to Carradale as a family for its egg hunt, so I thought why not bring it to town.#I would like to say a huge thank you to everyone who took part and helped in any way to make this such a successful event. We made up  bags and just  were left!#Mandy added that the chocolate treats were purchased with a donation from The Jolly Monday Show from sales of Jerusalema dance stickers some art packs were donated by Peaches and Dreams Crafts, and the other items were purchased by The Hub through funding from Children in Need for activities for young people the sheets with the clues were printed by Keeping It Local and the orienteering clips used as stamps were on loan from Stuart McQuaker and the Physical Education department at Campbeltown Grammar School."},{"url":null,"title":"from our files april 9 2021","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

As a result, a number of people have been reported to the procurator fiscal.This week, once again, the team has been in action. A property in Campbeltown town centre was searched under warrant and a -year-old man and a -year-old woman reported to the procurator fiscal.Inspector Tom Harper told The Courier: ‘Recent changes in our sht pattern for officers’ work hours to make them more efficient have enabled us to use our resources to create a small pro-active team which is concentrating on drug abuse in the town.‘And we have had good and sufficient intelligence for four drugs search warrants to be executed in recent weeks.’As a result of that, two people have been reported for being concerned in the supply of drugs and the other two were for drug possession.This will continue for the foreseeable future as drug use and drug dealing has been identied as one of the greatest concerns in the community.This month, Strathclyde Police is to consult with the public on its community policing plan for the coming year. The top four concerns for Kintyre and the islands of Gigha, Jura and Islay, as well as drugs, are: anti-social behaviour, assault, violent crime and speeding motorists.TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGOBid to protect Sanda birdsThree Kintyre islands have been designated a conservation area in a bid to halt the decline of a species of seabird.Sanda and its surrounding islands of Sheep and Glunimore have been named as a Site of Special Scientic Interest by Scottish National Heritageas a result of the high level of shags which breed on the small group of islands.Nationally important birds such as razorbill, cormorant and puffin also breed on the islands which form the most southerly breeding area in the British Isles for the storm petrel and Manx shearwater.The islands are owned by Dick Gannon and his we Meg, both of whom live in Campbeltown. The couple are glad the wildle to be found on and around the islands had been formally recognised.Meg Gannon said: ‘The wildle on the islands has always been a great delight to us and we take its conservation seriously in all that we do on Sanda.‘The recognition by SNH that the islands are worthy of scientic designation is most welcome at this time.’Dick Gannon added: ‘We are very pleased. We have always had a green attitude on the island.’The Gannons are currently refurbishing all of the island’s properties into self-catering houses.FIFTY YEARS AGOAmericans interested in CampbeltownThe results of a small advertising spree in the USA, which cost Campbeltown Town Council £, were made known at the council’s finance committee meeting on Monday evening.Town clerk Mr William Wilson reported he had received four replies, from industrialists and one from a real estate agent.One firm, from Florida, claims to be the makers of the word’s finest rear view traffic mirrors. Another firm was involved in the plastics industry.Mr Wilson raised a laugh when he said the real estate agent wanted to #sell’ Campbeltown.On a more serious vein, Councillor Dan Black said he thought the £ was a worthwhile investment and considered it should be spent in a similar manner annually.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOThe mining crisisOnce again, the country has been plunged into industrial chaos by a national strike of miners.One of the most calamitous results of the great coal strike last autumn was the loss to the British coal trade of the continental market.The immediate and inevitable result must be a rise in the cost of living, because the food which was paid for by coal must now be bought in some other way, while the ships which used to sail from these shores laden with coal must now sail in ballast and make all their profits upon the homeward voyage.But it need scarcely be pointed out that the greatest sufferers have been the miners themselves, who have been condemned by the misguided policy of their leaders to severe and increasing unemployment.In these circumstances, the action which the Miners’ Executive has seen fit to take in calling a second strike is the more suicidal, since they have the lessons of the past three months vividly before their eyes.The first evidence that once again the miners are signing their own death warrant is already to hand.One of the largest firms of coal merchants in this country received, on the eve of the strike, news from New York that the American Coal Exchange was already flooded with inquiries from continental countries.Now that the strike has been declared, these inquiries must inevitably result in contracts stretching in all probability over a period of years.The result will be that however the contest is decided, and however hard the miners may subsequently be pleased to work and however cheap the price at which British coal is offered on the market, practically the entire field will already be occupied by foreign competitors and the British export market for coal will be seriously, and perhaps fatally, narrowed.The effect of that must be a corresponding rise in the cost of living and delay in that fall in the cost of production which alone can win back for this country its supremacy of the markets of the world."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday april 9 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Sadly we have all heard of someone who has been affected by stroke and many people like me have tragically lost someone too.Almost five years ago, my wonderful mum, Diana, suffered a severe stroke. She died four weeks later. My mum was the most active, #full of le# person I knew. She LOVED le. She was my best friend and I miss her every day. That#s why I want to ask your readers to take part in the Stroke Association#s A Walk to Remember.This wonderful event is a special way to celebrate the le of your loved one whilst raising money in their memory.Simply pick a special place that is filled with memories, create your route, and on June  take part in your own walk to remember to raise funds for the Stroke Association.Stroke strikes every five minutes in the UK, and there are around , survivors in Scotland living with its devastating effects who really need our help.Like so many charities, the pandemic has drastically affected the Stroke Association#s income.However the charity has still been supporting stroke survivors as much as they can with support and advice, while continuing to fund vital research into the condition.Please join me and do something amazing in your loved one#s memory by taking part in A Walk to Remember.It#s bound to be an emotional but amazing day for all of us that have lost someone to stroke. Walk in their memory and raise funds to rebuild more lives after stroke.To sign up, please visit https:www.stroke.org.uk fundraising a-walk-to-rememberChildren#s lives have been turned upside over the last year due to challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic, with many spending extended periods of time out of school and behind closed doors.The NSPCC#s Childline service has heard from thousands of children who have found this time really challenging.Some have felt overwhelmed with home schooling and struggled to access their learning due to a lack of technology, whilst others have missed their friends and family and many have seen their mental health deteriorate.The NSPCC and Childline adapted during the pandemic so our frontline staff could continue to be here as a vital source of support for those children who felt like they had nowhere  to turn.Even though many children in Scotland are now back at school, it remains vital that we are still here to support those who are struggling with the impact that the pandemic has had on them.To help us be here for children and to remind them that Childline is a source of support they can turn to, we are encouraging schools across the country to get involved in the NSPCC#s Number Day.This annual fundraising day, which is based around fun maths activities, will take place in primary and secondary schools across the country on May  in aid of the children#s charity.As part of the day, schools can sign up to enjoy puzzles, games and challenges to raise vital funds.There are a range of activities for dferent age groups and teachers will also be provided with resources including information on supporting their school#s safeguarding.It#s now more essential than ever that children aren#t left alone, isolated and unsupported with their worries, and the money raised from Number Day will help the NSPCC in its mission to make  a better year for children.To sign up, visit the NSPCC#s website and search for Number Day and fill in your school#s details using the registration form.Age Scotland has won a £, grant for an innovative telephone friendship service which links older members of the ex-services community.Our Comradeship Circles service has helped to connect hundreds of older veterans for regular group calls since the pilot scheme was launched six months ago.The funding from the Armed Forces Covenant Fund Trust#s Tackling Loneliness Programme will enable our service to expand and continue until autumn , reaching even more older people. We are also looking for volunteers to support the service.There are an estimated , armed forces veterans in Scotland, with an average age of . The Comradeship Circles also welcome their partners, widows, and widowers.Participants simply dial into the weekly chat, with a facilitator on hand to assistnecessary. The service is popular with those who are unable or find it dficult to enjoy social connection online.Our Comradeship Circles has been a social leline for many over the last six months, so we#re delighted this funding means they can continue.Even before the pandemic, thousands of older veterans still felt isolated because of health conditions, disabilities, or living in a rural location. Although restrictions are now easing, we know that many are feeling lonelier than ever before.While more and more older people are getting online, there are still hundreds of thousands who are unable or prefer not to use the internet.This telephone service has been especially valued by older veterans who have a disability or health condition which means they struggle to use the video conferencing apps.Comradeship Circles mean they can enjoy banter and share stories and memories of military le.It#s been inspiring to see the care and support that the veterans# community gives each other, helping each other through dficult times. Many participants have told us that they’ve rekindled old friendships or made new ones, or look forward to a natter to get them through the week.If you or someone you know is a veteran aged  or over, we#d encourage them to give it a try.A call to the Age Scotland helpline     can open the door to camaraderie and extra support for older members of the ex-service community.I have been contacted by many of my constituents about the concerning condition of Ballymartin road on Islay.It has gradually been getting worse over the years but is now as bad as it has ever been and is getting to the stage that it#s nearly not passable for a small car without risking damage.I have raised this with our roads department and although funds are stretched, this road is clearly in need of some desperate repairs and,left unmaintained for any longer, will only end up costing the hard-pressed council taxpayer more to fix in the long-run."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week april 9 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Marilyn Shedden, one of the school#s chaplains, joined in the fun and helped the children do their own improvisations.On the last day of term, the final performance was watched and this was deemed the most exciting when the stone had rolled away and the tomb was empty.Even though the pupils learn about Easter each year, there were still questions about how people saw Jesus alive after he had been dead.Up in the forest near the school later that day, the children heard the events from the Bible as they decorated and rolled eggs.This was a memorable event as the children had previously made a mud slide and this is where they chose to roll — or throw! — their eggs.On ing to school, the Easter celebrations continued with the end-of-term prize-giving and an egg hunt in the playground."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week april 9 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The disciples were huddled indoors in fear of their lives when suddenly the resurrected Jesus was there among them.Thomas hadn#t been with the others when it happened. He just could not bring himself to believe without seeing him for himself. Thomas gets a bad press because of this.We often react to this wee excerpt from Thomas#s story aswe would have been less reluctant to believe. We carry our willingness to believe as a badge of faith. Poor old Doubting Thomas.But is doubt a weakness  Or is it simply an opportunity, a space, a fertile ground in which faith might grow and ultimately blossom A week later, the disciples were gathered again in the same house where they had last seen Jesus. This time, Thomas was with them. Once again, Jesus came and stood among them. He greeted them again, #Peace be with you,# before turning and addressing Thomas directly.He said to him: #Put your finger here and see my hands. Put your hand in my side. Do not doubt but believe.#Jesus#s words are aimed not only at Thomas, but at everyone who encounters this story, and struggles to believe that God is capable of doing the very thing that God has promised — call our world into new and unending, resurrected le.#Do not doubt but believe.#"},{"url":null,"title":"four-candidates-confirmed-scottish-parliament-election-2021-midlothian-north-musselburgh","story":"Colin Beattie , Stevie Curran , Charles Dundasand Iain Whytewere confirmed as the four candidates for the seat at the Holyrood election when nominations closed yesterday afternoon.Mr Beattie has represented the area in Holyrood since .

Parliamentary candidate for our constituency.Words canrsquot do justice to the sense of pride I feel knowing that I have the opportunity to represent the constituency where Irsquove lived my entire

the Midlothian Police and Fire board.I have extensive experience working in the public sector, which includes over  years of employment with Lothian and Borders Police Police Scotland .My hobbies are golf and IT.Itrsquos strange that our Holyrood constituency crosses county borders, with Musselburgh, Wallyford and Whitecraig on the east side of the boundary.There are similarities between Midlothian and East Lothian, we have many shared values, but in other ways our counties are very dferent.East Lothian being a coastal authority attracts much more tourism, with a wonderful array of golf courses which I particularly enjoy.Irsquove been a member at Musselburgh Golf Clubfor over  years.Now for some of the politics of this election.I opposed independence in  and I oppose another referendum.We canrsquot risk having a parliament that focuses on old arguments or settling old scores. Scotland deserves a better government and a better opposition.Our focus must be on delivering a national recovery plan so we can build a fairer and stronger Scotland.I will be a strong voice for our communities.I will focus on a recovery plan, a health recovery, an education recovery, a jobs recovery.I will fight for opportunities for our young people and I will campaign for fairer funding for our councils.There are also local issues that require urgent intervention, probably none more so than the very poor patient experiences at Riverside Medical Practice.I cannot accept that it is not within the gt of your MSP to resolve these problems.This will be my very first task.Charles Dundas WHILST some people seem to have been distracted during the first week of this election by the fuss around a new party and defections from the SNP, Irsquom very pleased to report that Willie Rennie and the Scottish Liberal Democrats have kicked things off on a really positive and constructive note.Our campaign has been launched with a needle-sharp focus on putting recovery from the pandemic first.For communities like Musselburgh, that means prioritising the creation of jobs, cutting NHS waiting times, boosting mental health services and seriously tackling the climate emergency.In the first week of the campaign, our Lib Dem focus has been on setting out our plans to boost Scottish education for every stage and age: to get a good start in le to excel at school and to help people retrainthey need to.At the heart of our ideas for education are an Education Bounce Back plan to tackle the attainment gap, because we believe it is an essential investment which allows everyone in Scotland to achieve their potential.Back in , the SNP called our proposals for extra money to be allocated directly to schools and targeted at closing the poverty-related attainment gap ldquodangerous and ldquoridiculous, but we didnrsquot give up, and during the last Parliament the Scottish Government created a Pupil Equity Funding scheme to do just that on a year-by-year basis.Then in the last Scottish budget, the Lib Dems were able to secure an extra  per centto boost that scheme and do more to close the attainment gap.Now, Willie Rennie and the Lib Dems propose to make this targeted extra money for the schools who need it most a permanent feature of Scottish education, and start offering it on a long-term basis to schools so that they can make plans to invest it over multiple years with confidence.That should allow the  teachers currently employed on temporary contracts because of the uncertainty around the PEF scheme to be given more security and allow Scottish education to bounce back the way that it needs to.Iain Whyte WHILE campaigning this week, I have been investigating the car parking provision in Musselburgh.I do not agree with the suggestion from East Lothian Council of introducing parking charges at coastal car parks at Back Sands and Levenhall Links.The council is considering introducing charges here on an experimental basis in line with existing arrangements at other coastal car parks.The council has also mooted the possibility of a further review of parking charges in a much wider Musselburgh Town Centre Parking Review.The introduction of parking charges at coastal car parks further down the East Lothian coast has been deeply unpopular and I am disappointed that East Lothian Council are considering expanding the arrangements to Musselburgh.The waterfront area has seen an increase in visitors throughout the pandemic.This has been a really good thing, as people have needed that break in the fresh air to exercise and maintain their mental health.But it isnrsquot enough just to think about what happens during the remaining lockdown.We need to encourage visitors to keep visiting the area once lockdown is over.This will help to rebuild the Musselburgh economy by supporting local businesses.The same goes for the town centre car parks, which are vital to getting high street businesses back on their feet once they can reopen.Introducing car parking charges would send out entirely the wrong message and will only encourage visitors to park in locations where there is no charging.That could be very disruptive for local residents as their neighbourhood streets would become clogged with cars avoiding the charges, giving them their own parking headache.If elected, I will work with the local Conservative councillor in Musselburgh to oppose this proposal and do all I can to encourage visitors to Musselburgh to help businesses rebuild in line with the Scottish Conservative proposal for a Town Centres Revival Plan."},{"url":null,"title":"musicians-impress-judges-online-bagpipe-competition","story":"Pupils

Any forward player will tell you that. If you have a terrible game and score a goal or play fantastic and not score ndash you are judged on your goals as a forward.ldquoHopefully, I will get another goal but I need to make sure I am in the team.

He had a love spot on his forehead,anyone saw it theyrsquod fall in love with him.ldquoHandy, said Finn, amused by the idea.ldquoWell not always, so he kept it hidden under his long hair. But Grainne was smitten by him and so she had a plan.ldquoShe put a sleeping potion in Fionnrsquos drink and the drinks of others, then placed a sacred oath on Diarmuid so he had to go with her. They fled as Fionn slept. When he awoke he was enraged at the betrayal. He vowed revenge and hunted for them for many years.ldquoWait a minute, said her nephew. ldquoFionn didnrsquot love her did he  I mean they hadnrsquot met until then, so why was he so angry : Chapter  of Tims BookldquoHe saw it as a betrayal. Diarmuid had been one of Fionnrsquos closest friends now hersquod run off with the woman he was due to marry.ldquoBut she didnrsquot want to marry Fionn anyway.ldquoIt was the way of things in those days, women had no choice in who to marry. Thatrsquos why I like Grainne, she refused to accept it and ran off with the man she did love. She defied the greatest warrior that had lived as well as convention. There are many stories about her travels with Diarmuid, places they hid, the adventures they had. All this time Fionn was searching for them. When he finally found them, the years seemed to have softened his anger and they made peace.ldquoSo it was a happy ending then  I canrsquot see the connection to the name of this place, though, said Finn.ldquoThe tale is not finished. Izzy stopped walking to explain what happened next.: Chapter  of Tims BookldquoYou see, the way Fionn felt inside was not the way it showed on the outside. Bitterness still festered under the surface and it showed itself when he went hunting with Diarmuid and the other warriors of the Fianna.ldquoDuring the hunt, Diarmuid was attacked by a wild boar. A prophesy had told that he would be killed by a boar and the beast savaged him. He managed to kill it, but Diarmuid lay mortally wounded.ldquoThere was one chance to save him. If Fionn gave Diarmuid water to drink from his hands, his magical powers would save his le.ldquoAh, because of his magic thumb  wondered Finn.ldquoAye, well remembered Finn. There was no time to lose. Fionn rushed to a nearby burn, cupped his hands and brought water to the dying Diarmuid. But then...Izzy put her hand on her heart.ldquoThen what  her nephew asked, spreading out his arms in a questioning gesture.ldquoFionnrsquos anger and vengeance ed. He couldnrsquot forgive Diarmuid for his betrayal. So he deliberately let the water seep through his fingers.ldquoBut Fionnrsquos emotions were conflicting and when he saw Diarmuid dying on the ground his bitterness eased, and he ran back to the burn to collect water. But, as before, he let the water drain from his hands because, in the last moment, he still couldnrsquot forgive.: Chapter  of Tims BookIzzy began walking.ldquoSo he leaves Diarmuid to die  asked Finn, catching up with his aunt.She paused again.ldquoHis warriors, including Fionnrsquos own son Ossian, begged him to give Diarmuid water. They were all loyal to him, but they also loved Diarmuid. They had all suffered from the split between to two men they both loved.ldquoSo for a third time, Fionn ed to the burn. He walked carefully with the water in his hands. Memories of his old friendship flooded his mind. An understanding grew in him of the power of Grainnersquos love for Diarmuid and how dficult it had been for them. Fionn felt his bitterness and anger finally dissolve he could now forgive.ldquoHe knelt down by Diarmuid and carefully trickled the water onto his lips. But it was just too late.ldquoHe was dead Izzy nodded. Finn walked on, saying nothing.: Chapter  of Tims BookThey had reached the part of the trail where tall planted pine trees grew. There was the faint sound of running water below on their right and Izzy led Finn down a small path that zigzagged steeply down a slope.They reached a burn which tumbled down the glen, with native trees lining its banks.Izzy paused by a hazel tree that leaned over the burn to catch the sunlight. Finn arrived with a thoughtful look on his face.ldquoSo that story is how Creag an Tuirc got its name  he asked.Izzy was looking for hazelnuts, so she spoke as she knelt down and foraged.ldquoNobody knows for sure how it got its name. The tale of Grainne and Diarmuid is actually an ancient legend from Ireland, but legends and stories are carried by people and planted in new places.She stood up happy, holding a hazelnut between her thumb and finger. She put it in her pocket and looked at her nephew.ldquoThere was a shared culture and language here with Ireland. Creag na Tuirc was named in Gaelic in the mists of time. Was the story of Diarmuidrsquos death told here round the fireside  For sure it was. Was the rock named to give the tale a local setting  I like to think itrsquos possible. There are lots of places in the Highlands named after these old Celtic legends. Therersquos a place called Tor an Tuirc which means hill of the boar, near Oban, and close by there is a standing stone called Diarmuidrsquos pillar. Local people said it was where he was buried. So the stories were planted here many years ago and now have roots here too. In fact, just up the road there is what tradition says is Fionnrsquos grave.ldquoReally! Aw can we go there aunty, please : Chapter  of Tims BookldquoOf course, we might even be able to see it later today, Izzy assured him.She continued her search for hazelnuts and Finn helped, but they found no more.ldquoIrsquod hoped to find nine, explained his aunt.ldquoWhy nine ldquoIrsquoll tell you later, in a story, Izzy smiled.Finn was quiet as they walked down the path by the tumbling water. Suddenly, he recognised where he was: the waterfall theyrsquod passed earlier.ldquoYou stay here and enjoy the falls, Irsquoll meet you at Rob Royrsquos grave, said Izzy as she wandered back to Balquhidder Kirk.: Chapter  of Tims BookFinn stayed a while longer, watching the water cascade over the rocks. The sound soothed him and the damp coolness of the air was welcome in what was becoming a very warm day.He eventually walked back to the kirk and emerged from the shade of the trees to see his aunt talking to a man. They broke off their conversation as soon as they saw Finn and the man walked briskly away out of the kirkyard.ldquoJust a tourist asking about Rob Roy, she explained when she saw Finnrsquos inquisitive expression.Two women then arrived.ldquoDo you know where Rob Royrsquos grave is  they asked Finn. He smiled and pointed at it.ldquoCould you take our photo please  they asked.They stood by the graveside with their thumbs up as Finn clicked a couple of times to make sure. Finn was keen to explain the mystery of the grave but they didnrsquot linger. The women thanked him and left, happy theyrsquod got their photo.As they drove away, Finn noticed the other car parked in the small parking space.He was sure it was the same car which had been parked in the layby by Samsonrsquos Stone the day before. But he thought no more of it, as his stomach began to tell him it was time for some proper food.He looked for his aunt. She was in the th-century kirk, looking at a stone with a carving of a person on it.ldquoIrsquom hungry, can we go for lunch  Finn asked.ldquoSure.They walked back to the car through the wood and past the waterfall once again.On the way, Izzy pointed out the grave of Robert Kirkrsquos we, who had died young, and the faerie hill on the northern edge of the kirkyard.It was midday and the sky was almost a Mediterranean blue.They left Balquhidder and drove towards Kingshouse at the east of the glen, which was originally built to accommodate British army officers using the military road.Balquhidder had seen its share of Redcoat atrocities in the aftermath of Culloden in , as many MacLarens had come out for Bonnie Prince Charlie.The military road had been built to make transport of the military easier, and to supply the many British army forts located in the Highlands, which were garrisoned to keep an eye on potential Jacobite trouble.As they drove out of the glen towards Loch Earn, Izzy told the tale of Capt Donald MacLaren.He had joined the Jacobites during the rising of . He was wounded and captured, then taken on a journey to England for execution. But he managed to escape while passing a place called the Devilrsquos Beef Tub in the south of Scotland, and one tradition says he ed to Balquhidder and lived many years in disguise as a woman, despite being heavily built.She told it in a funny way and Finn laughed at the image of this big bearded man dressed as a woman fooling the soldiers.ldquoHow can you remember all these stories  he asked.ldquoI remember the pictures they paint in my imagination, replied Izzy.ldquoMaybe I sometimes get some of the details wrong but for me they are portraits in my head and so when I tell the story I just describe what I see. Thatrsquos the way I remember anyway.Finn understood what she meant. Her stories had helped him paint his own portraits in his head.He was silent for a while as Izzy drove, then said: ldquoI want to phone my mum.ldquoOf course sweetie, letrsquos find a phone box and seeshersquos free.Izzy felt a wave of anxiety. She was worried that Finn might have recognised who she had been talking to at Balquhidder. She also had emotions that were not showing on the surface.She asked herselfshe was she doing the right thing.

market."},{"url":null,"title":"letter-week-solve-parking-issues-north-berwick","story":"The implication of this for our coastal towns is that we can expect, at times, a very large influx of visitors.If our communities and the council do not plan and prepare for this, as sure as night follows day, ending lockdown will be followed by traffic chaos, parking anger and quite possibly a few irate letters to the Courier.Last summer, after the proposal to turn Elcho Green into a car park had been scrapped, a handful of North Berwick residents undertook a week-long survey of the townrsquos car parks, counting spare spaces in the morning, the middle of the day and late afternoon.The week chosen included a Friday on which the beaches were the busiest any of us had ever seen them.There were very rarely any spare spaces in the long-stay, free-to-use car parks in the town centre .Morning and afternoon there were always spaces free in the shorter-stay car parksand in the paid-forcar park.There were always Blue Badge spaces available, but on the busier lunchtimes all other spaces were full in these car parks.On the busy beach days, the parking at Recreation Park and at the station car park was also full by the middle of the day, although at all other times there were spaces at these.Even on the very busiest days, the car parks at the sports centre and the high school were virtually empty, and the car parks of Tesco and Aldi also had spare capacity.No one can expect to be able to park where they want, when they want, for as long as they want, all at no cost.Building more car parks is not viable.The only sites proposed are ones where any other form of development would not be tolerated.Any gain for drivers would be small compared to the loss of amenity, and any parking created would not be adequate.The solution is to use the parking resources that we have more efficiently.If you have an errand which requires a car, avoid lunchtime.Your best bet is to get in and out before am.If you can manage your trip to town without using a car, walk or cycle instead.On the really busy beach days, we need to do more than leave matters to first-come first-served.Even good signage, although helpful, will not solve the problem alone.Anyone who recalls the traffic gridlock on Marine Parade last year will know that what is required is some active traffic management: closing the road to the Haugh car park when it is full, and having helpful and friendly guides at Marine Parade and where directing visitors to the places they might find a place to park firstly to the Rec or the station and, once those car parks are full, to the school and the sports centre.Robbie Wightman,Clford Road,North

of the bottle you can never get it back again.ldquoIt changes your outlook on le, not just travel.The family, from Dunbar, had been on a package holiday in Turkey when they first had the idea of travelling the world.Ian, who was HR director at Jewel and Esk College, and we Anne, who is a dietician, had asked their children where they wanted to go next on holiday.Rory, now , and Roonagh, now , produced a list of  countries, with the family looking into whether an around-the-world ticket existed.By the summer of , they were ready to get their passports out and leave Dunbar behind.Ian, , told the Courier that family and friends gave the news a mixed reaction.He said: ldquoConfusion, disbelief, lsquoare you madrsquo, concern and, for some, jealousy but they saw it as a holiday and I know it was not.ldquoMost parents will understand going away with your kids for a couple of weeks and it is not always a holiday and you feel you need a holiday when you get back.ldquoImagine doing it for a year!ldquoIt is   family living and not on a holiday budget but a tight budget.ldquoWe really had to make money go far and save up for the big ticket items.ldquoYou get homesick and tired and ill, and all the things are part of the challenge of a year but are completely offset by amazing things you do, the people that you meet and the great weather.ldquoWhile Scotland was shivering, not just in the cold but in the middle of the last recession in early , we were splashing in the waves of the surf at Queensland in Australia.ldquoIt is not a hard luck story ndash we were very, very lucky to have done it but we created the opportunity for ourselves.The family started off in Cape Town ndash ldquoa city by the sea with an iconic mountain ndash before finishing  months later in Rio de Janeiro ndash ldquoa city by the sea with an iconic mountain.Along the way, they visited a number of countries, including Swaziland, Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand and Peru.He said: ldquoThere were  days that were special days, where we did something extraordinary and memorable ndash whether it was seeing the sunrise over Machu Picchu or Rafael Nadal warming up at the Australia Open or walking the Great Wall of China.ldquoThen, there was family time, the other  days, which was just as special.However, it was not a trip of five-star hotels and luxury, with the family staying in hostels and travelling overland to reach destinations.In a time before Kindle, Google Translate and Airbnb, it often meant learning about the next stop on the journey while they were travelling.Last year, Ian, who now runs his own outsourcing human resources and health and safety business, decided to start writing about his travels as ldquoa legacy project.Fittingly, a first draft of the book, which is now available on Amazon, took  days to complete.Positive feedback convinced him to push ahead with the story, which he hopes could inspire others to enjoy their own journeys.The family has very much caught the travel bug, with Rory marrying a Mexican woman in her homeland and younger sister Roonagh volunteering for a month in Ghana.Ian said: ldquoEvery time we travel, we look back and say we wish we could have done that dferently, longer or we did not have the time to do that.ldquoIt would be amazing to go back in time and redo some things.ldquoIt is also interesting to go back to places to see how they have changed.ldquoObviously, in that decade there has been a massive impact of climate change, deforestation of rainforests, and species have become extinct that we saw in the wild.ldquoIt would be interesting to go back to the same places and also interesting to go back and see what they look like after dark, rather than being stuck in a hostel room with the kids.ldquoThere are also many, many other places we have not visited that we would love to and we are planning our future travels ndash and maybe future travel books as well."},{"url":null,"title":"urgent-change-needed-riverside-medical-practice","story":"Their plea follows a ldquolarge and unexpected surge in demand at Riverside Medical Practice ndash which has about , patients ndash which was making it ldquoreally hard for patients to get through on the phone and book an appointment.It comes as an online petition has been launched by patients calling for ldquourgent change.The number of call attempts to the practice, the largest in East Lothian, rose sharply in March after a period where the number of call attempts were slowly decreasing to pre-Covid- pandemic levels.The Riverside, which is based at Musselburgh Primary Care Centre, said that the pattern of call attempts had changed too, as more calls were made at am to try and book an appointment, with a larger number of redials being seen.Dr Richard Fairclough, GP partner, said: ldquoWersquore looking at all of the data we get via our phone system as quickly as possible, so we can understand the full extent of the situation that we and the local community are facing.ldquoWersquore also trying to better quanty all the dferent reasons people call, so we can better understand how to best direct patients to other more appropriate health services, and to our online services.ldquoBut one thing is apparent: demand is completely outstripping the health systemrsquos capacity to meet that need, and there are more people needing an appointment than each appointment we have available. This has been the case for some time.ldquoThis means that some people are being left without the expert support from their GP that we desperately want to offer, and we recognise the depth of feeling in the community about this.ldquoWersquore doing absolutely everything we can to try and improve the situation, including increasing the number of clinical and non-clinical staff we have, and working to improve our phone system and the way we manage calls we receive.ldquoWe need to be clear, though, that all of these changes will take time and will not improve the situation overnight.ldquoOnce all of the recruitment is completed, we will be at the limit of people we can employ at the practice, so the number of calls we can answer and the number of appointments we then have available will not substantially increase without wider health system change.ldquoThe practice met with Colin Beattie MSP last week, along with East Lothian Health and Social CarePartnership, community councils and our patient participation group, all of whom have expressed their willingness to work collaboratively with us to bring change.ldquoWersquove made clear to all the pressure wersquore experiencing and the impact this has for people in Musselburgh and for our staff. Wersquove also made clear the changes that need to happenpeople in Musselburgh are to have their health needs met ndash namely a rapid move to put in place the changes the Scottish Government has already agreed must happen right across Scotland to relieve what was recognised several years ago as an unsustainable workload in general practice.ldquoThese changes include the movement of urgent care, pharmacotherapy , vaccinations and community nursing away from general practice, to come instead under the control of local health and social care partnerships. This will allow GPs to focus on their role as expert medical generalists, working to improve the long-term health of both iniduals and the wider community they serve.ldquoAs Musselburgh continues to grow, we also urgently need to hear from those overseeing the development of the town to hear how they plan to service the primary care needs of the community.The online petition launched by patients says: ldquoPatientsrsquo frustrations are running high as appointments are increasingly dficult and mostly impossible to secure.ldquoWait times on calls to connect to the surgery are often in excess of an hour, only to be told there are no appointments available and the patient needs to call back the following day to repeat the frustrating process, with no guarantee of an appointment at the end.ldquoReports of calls being made every day for a week with no success in securing an appointment are now commonplace.ldquoUrgent change is needed, as the health of patients registered with the practice is being put at risk on a daily basis.ldquoThe staff within the practice are working flat out but it is obvious demand far exceeds supply.The petition will be lodged with the Scottish Parliamentrsquos Cabinet Health Minister and Lothian Health Board Patient Experience Committee.They are being asked to intervene and assist the practice ldquoto analyse their current problems, thereafter equip them with the resources needed to implement an accessible appointment system which will, in turn, provide comprehensive medical care for every registered patient at the practice.The petition is at change.org p patients-registered-with-riverside-practice-riverside-practice-appointment-systemThe practice said it was pleased that its patients were adding their voices to the calls for change.A spokesperson for the East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership, said: ldquoELHSCP is already delivering a wide range of self-referral services that offer patients sameday access to specialist clinical, mental health and MSK supportin Musselburgh and across the county. These services have been designed in partnership with local practices to deliver the GP contract and direct people to the right care from the right professional at the right time.ldquoThese have proved to be very popular with patients and we would urge people to think about referring themselves to these services without going to their GP first."},{"url":null,"title":"community-volunteers-important-role-supporting-rail","story":"A Community Rail In Scotland report, released last month and sponsored by the Rail Delivery Group,

to everyone.It is hoped that these and, when Covid- restrictions ease, guided walks will entertain and inform both people who know the area well and those who are new to it.The river North Esk rises in the Pentland Hills, while the source of South Esk is beyond Gladhouse Reservoir in the Moorfoot Hills.Both rivers flow northeast through wooded valleys rich in wildle, history, towns and villages, to their confluence at Watersrsquo Meet in Dalkeith Country Park.As one river, the Esk then flows through Musselburgh to the Firth of Forth.The first talk, on Thursday, April , at .pm, will be given by Dr Iain Reid, a well-known aquatic ecologist at the Forth Rivers Trust.Entitled lsquoFish of the Midlothian Esks placed within the wider context of the Forth districtrsquo, it will deal with present challenges and future potential for improving healthy fish populations in the rivers.Future subjects this year will include the development of the North Esk Way, managing river impacts, artists and photographers along the Esk valleys and the nature of the Esks.The trust has been helping to develop pathways along the North Esk for many years, providing insights into the features and attractions of the Esk valleys.John Oldham, trust chairman, said that the new programme should have something for everyone interested in issues of pollution and flooding, as well as natural and cultural history.He said: ldquoSome of the folk who live in the Esk valleys know a great deal about the natural and social history that surrounds them but not everyone does. With so many families moving into the area, perhaps for the first time, there are places of great beauty and rich heritage to discover and to learn about through our talks and walks programmes.He added: ldquoThe last year has reminded us all of the importance of getting out into the open air to stretch the legs and relax the mind. The paths along the Esk valleys take you through beautul woodland, magnicent estates, sites of previous intense industry and places of great geological, biological and historical interest.ldquoTo walk these ways is to follow in the path of signicant figures of the Enlightenment, artists, poets and writers, industrialists of note and some great scientists, plus a few rogues.Mr Oldham added: ldquoNo rivers are without their problems and the Esks have their share. Some are legacies of the industrial past and others from more recent developments. To learn about the rivers and how they are being managed for the future is important to us all.ldquoVisitors to the area, even from quite short distances away, can be surprised to see what the Esk valleys have to offer.ldquoTo take a friend for a walk along Roslin Glen, through the woods at New Hall, around Gladhouse Reservoir or to see the birds at the estuary in Musselburgh and hear lsquothis

electing their new representative next month.Four candidates - Euan Davidson , Craig Hoy , Paul McLennanand Martin Whitfield- are in the running for the role.Each week, theEast Lothian Courierwill give each of the candidates the chance to speak about what theyve been up to and why you should vote for them.Euan DavidsonEuan Davidson WHILST other parties have been bickering over the constitution, this week the Liberal Democrats have been concentrating on education.If Scotland is to recover to a stronger position post-pandemic then education will be at its heart.In , Nicola Sturgeon stated that we should judge her on her record of tackling the attainment gap between the richest and poorest students.Itrsquos fair to say on that score, the SNP Government has failed dismally.Even before the pandemic struck, progress had stalled completely with the worst figures for years.That was before the exam scandal last year, where the SNP were happy to see pupils from the most deprived areas impacted disproportionately until they had to bow to public pressure.My party has long campaigned for the introduction of extra funding for schools in deprived areas, which we introduced in Government at the UK level.We were eventually able to persuade the Scottish Government to introduce the attainment fund and we now want to see it expanded signicantly.In , it simply cannot be right that your le chances are still decided by your parentsrsquo economic circumstances.We also want to see an overhaul in the way we approach education as a society.The introduction of Curriculum for Excellence, whilst well meaning, was badly mismanaged by the SNP Government.Failures like this and the exam scandal show that much more faith needs to be put in our teachers and education professionals rather than Scottish Government ministers.Another priority for me is improving early years education.Evidence shows that a signicant proportion of a childrsquos le chances are decided early on.Thatrsquos why we want to delay formal schooling until age seven.The evidence from countries across Europe shows starting children with a more play-based, less formal approach, leaves them much more prepared for formal learning later on.Another referendum will do nothing to overcome the economic and social damage of the pandemic.To give our children a fair chance, we must focus on education and recovery.Craig HoyCraig Hoy THIS election is a straight choice: we can focus on recovery or another isive independence referendum.This week, I have spoken to many residents while on the campaign trail in areas including Dunbar, Garvald, Longniddry and Prestonpans.I recently conducted local surveys and produced a series of local manestos, which I hope you have received.As MSP I will focus on:My pledges dovetail with wide-ranging and ambitious plans outlined by Douglas Ross and the Scottish Conservatives during the first weeks of the campaign.We have announced a major drive to ensure young people can afford new homes.While East Lothian has seen thousands built, itrsquos shocking that many people seeking to buy their first home have to leave their home town to get a foot on the housing ladder.I am also committed to expanding local railways.On this issue, and on every issue, I wonrsquot just tell voters what they want to hear.Other candidates have talked about re-opening the old Haddington to Longniddry line.This solution is unworkable, putting at risk the much-loved railway walk.Instead, I have worked closely with rail experts to explore plans for a new UK Government-funded section of the East Coast Mainline, which could expand existing rail capacity at Dunbar and Prestonpans, delivering new edge-of-town stations at Haddington, Tranent and Blindwells.If we focus on recovery and not another referendum, these are the ambitious, job-creating policies we can deliver for East Lothian.I look forward to working with you as your MSP to achieving them.Paul McLennanPaul McLennan THIS week, Irsquove focused on helping to prepare East Lothian businesses to reopen during April.Throughout both lockdowns, East Lothian has demonstrated itself as adaptable, resourceful and committed to community wellbeing.Our residents have shown resilience, determination and neighbourly kindness.Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP have pioneered the visionary lsquowellbeing governmentrsquo in East Lothian, lsquowellbeing high streetsrsquo can hold the key to economic recovery as our new normal.We can increase support for -minute neighbourhoods, putting everything within easy reach, with traders already playing their part by prioritising local produce and reducing their carbon footprint.This underlies the SNP Governmentrsquos vision for lsquorenewing Scotlandrsquo post-pandemic, with the pound million Green Jobs fund mapping the environmentally sensitive economic recovery younger generations deserve and demand.Well-supported shop local initiatives have greatly expanded and Irsquom keen to extend this as East Lothian builds a strong recovery.The SNP Government boost of a poundm lsquoScotland Loves Localrsquo fund is encouraging people to shop locally when they can, keeping wealth circulating within their community.During the pandemic, Irsquove chaired the East Lothian Council Town Centre Recovery Groupelected, Irsquoll initiate an East Lothian Business Advisory Group to ensure the vital business voice is heard.Our high streets are being supported by  per cent non-domestic rates relief for retail, hospitality, leisure and aviation sectors this year, with Scottish Government investment of poundm.It has also invested poundm over the le of the parliament to support community-led regeneration and town centre revitalisation.I fully support this holistic approach to empowering communities.This, coupled with prioritising lsquowellbeingrsquo via a universal basic income running in parallel with doubling the child payment, gives families increased means of participating in a thriving society.The SNP Government has committed to , new homes, including affordable and social housing, stimulating the construction industry and ensuring warm, safe housing as essential.Sharing the responsibility for improving the lives of the most vulnerable benefits society.For a wellbeing local recovery and for recognising that no one is better off until everyone is better off, make both votes SNP.Martin WhitfieldMartin Whitfield I AM PLEASED that there has been such a focus on two important issues in the early part of this campaign: the recovery of our NHS and tackling poverty.This included Anas Sarwar unveiling Scottish Labourrsquos recovery plan for Scotlandrsquos NHS following the devastating impact of the pandemic.He highlighted the backlog for cancer treatment, with thousands of missing cancer diagnoses as a result of Covid.We need an urgent plan to address this crisis, including rapid diagnostic centres and a catch-up plan for screenings by increasing staff and processing capacity to clear the backlog within a year.Child poverty in Scotland was one of the key issues covered in the first televised campaign debate.The SNP have been in power for  years but child poverty was rising again even before the pandemic hit.Scottish Labour believes the next parliament must prioritise a national recovery so that we can transform the lives of children across Scotland and end the scandal of child poverty.Another big pledge this week from Anas Sarwar is for a lsquoClean Up Holyroodrsquo Commission.The recent behaviour of our MP has demonstrated how little power constituents have over elected representatives in between elections.The commission will consult on ideas to give Scotland a parliament that can better hold the government to account and win back the trust of the people.As lockdown continues to ease, Irsquom pleased to see more local businesses and organisations able to open up again.This has been such a dficult last  months and I know that many businesses have been using lockdown to refine and renew the way they welcome customers back.I wish them all well in the weeks ahead and encourage people to keep shopping locally.Finally, the easing of restrictions has also meant Irsquove been able to get out and do more leafleting, restoring some semblance of normality to an otherwise very dferent election campaign.Leaflets and direct

He is generally credited with steadying the listing ship of devolved governance. by Brian taylor: Strugeons inquiry performance was controlled and capableNow Nicola Sturgeon is seeking re-election under that same Additional Member System. Devised, remember, to thwart her party. An exercise which has not been entirely successful in that the SNP has held sway at Holyrood since Mr McConnell demitted office in .But she faces an additional challenge. In addition to her customary opponents, she has to contend with a former chum. Her erstwhile mentor Alex Salmond is seeking to confound that Holyrood voting system by seeking regional list seats to supplement the constituencies he expects his former party, the SNP, to retain or gain.Mr Salmond describes that as a super-majority for independence. For that sum to work, however, there would have to be an almost universal transfer of list votes from the highly competitive SNP to Alba, presumably eclipsing the pro-independence Greens while, at the same time, the pro-Union parties fail to take advantage of this apparent contention on the Nationalist side.To say the least, that is asking a lot. Still, it is feasible and Mr Salmond remains a persuasive campaigner, despite the poll suggestions that, after years of controversy, accusation, acquittal and inquiry, he is rather less popular than was formerly the case.In passing, one might also note that his concept of vying up the independence vote was not discussed with or ratied by Nicola Sturgeon in any way. Further, it runs precisely counter to the message Mr Salmond himself delivered when he won majority power in . Then, the endlessly repeated mantra was ldquoboth votes SNP.Again, though, it remains a possibility in pursuit of what Mr Salmond has called the ldquonoble cause of independence. Contrary to claims that he is intent on vengeance, he insists he is only too eager to help that broader aim, as he has always done.Alex SalmondWhich presents Nicola Sturgeon with a dilemma. Could she conceivably work with a man who told a Holyrood inquiry she had breached the Ministerial code  A man who, she informed the same inquiry, had recounted behaviour towards a woman which she regarded as ldquodeeply inappropriate Before we arrive at such hypothetical post-election scenarios, however, there is the small matter of winning popular support from the voters.This lands Nicola Sturgeon with a more elemental conundrum. To be clear, she yearns for independence. She craves it, like a gourmet treat, all the more appealing for being kept at a distance, and denied by rivals.How, though, to achieve it  Strategically, she has three good reasons for focusing more in this election upon other policies, other issues, while retaining independence as the over-arching aim, through a referendum. In the BBC Scotland debate this week, she said such a poll should be held in the first half of the new Holyrood Parliament, once coronavirus had subsided.Those reasons for caution  Firstly, just like Jack McConnell promoting devolution in , she knows that independence lacks universal popularity. Many remain to be convinced.Even some who ultimately favour or would acquiesce in an independent Scotland might prefer to concentrate for now on other matters, notably this hideous plague and the attendant economic challenge.So she couches independence not as a concept in itself but as a potential answer to those financial woes a solution to be adopted when the time is right. Not immediately. For now, the SNP mot is that Scotlandrsquos problems need Scottish solutions, not a recipe advanced by Boris Johnson.Simultaneously, she is aware that this approach, which she judges to be necessary to sustain widespread popular support for her government, with its range of policies and objectives, is scarcely calculated to enthuse the more zealous of her adherents in the wider nationalist cause.That partly explains the lingering disquiet in the SNP over strategy. It, partly, explains the creation of Alba, although that is very largely down to Mr Salmond.Which brings us to Ms Sturgeonrsquos second reason for caution. An over-emphasis on independence might serve to energise Mr Salmondrsquos offer, to her dismay. In her mind, she sees an all too familiar figure, with an all too familiar grin, offering to help.Thirdly, every time she talks up independence or is asked so to do, we can expect an intervention from Douglas Ross of the Tories or, indeed, from Labour or the Liberal Democrats.Mr Ross is simply itching to make this election a quasi-referendum, to make it a straight fight between independence and the Union, hoping that he will, thereby, cajole indy-sceptics from other parties to vote Tory.A further thought disturbs the Sturgeon sleep pattern. She accuses Mr Salmond of gambling, of seeking to trick the electorate into a referendum. What , she asks, that leaves a residue of discontent and disquiet, even among potential independence supporters, so that any subsequent referendum is lost Mr Salmond denies this would happen and argues that Ms Sturgeon would, eventually, see the advantage of collaboration.Read more by Brian Taylor:Sturgeon versus Salmond.

And yes, which currency Scotland would use, how much debt incurred, and what kind of risk and disruption encountered along the way.On these big issues that lie at the heart of a proposition backed by three political parties, scarcely a word will be said during this misleadingly named ldquoindependence election campaign.That will please some people ndash but the half-hearted gumming of independence side issues and referendum logistics could leave us all with the worst of both worlds. Not sufficiently indy-free for opponents of constitutional change, but not full-blooded, vivid, detailed or real enough for everyone .So, letrsquos be honest.

All these questions ndash while erting ndash are just political window-dressing.If the SNP, Greens and Alba believe we need an independence referendum within the letime of this new Parliament to build back better, then Scots deserve some straightforward, honest discussion of that core question.Will Scotland tackle climate change and Covid recovery better as an independent country or as part of the United Kingdom  Itrsquos the debate voters are having among ourselves ndash with no broadcasters or politicians bold enough to lead the way.Irsquod give my eye teeth to hear or see it on the box. But that will not happen. Not on BBC Scotland anyway. Its first leadersrsquo debate was an unfocused, superficial, sloganencouraging and unrevealing encounter.Meanwhile, the world weariness of some BBC Scotland journalists is increasingly hard to conceal.Last week, one reporter volunteered that she hated election campaigns and was just looking forward to the final results, while another made daring mention of ldquothe I word in an election report asindependence was some unspeakable, embarrassing mad aunt locked in the political attic. So much, so normal.But might Alex Salmond enter the ring and stir things up  The Alba leader is contesting his exclusion from BBC debates but the corporation has successfully resisted many legal challenges to debate line-ups and I doubt it will cave in now.Besides, Mr Salmondrsquos inclusion might not deliver a greater independence focus, given the inevitable distraction and muddying of waters created by two bitter rivals standing on one TV .Furthermore, comments by Anas Sarwar suggest Nicola Sturgeon might not be aloneshe simply refused to appear with the former SNP leader.But letrsquos not be naive. Itrsquos not just the broadcasters ndash it suits every political party to avoid the actual subject of independence as well.Scottish Labour has started its Holyrood campaign on the front foot. It wonrsquot want to risk that impetus by ing deep into issues like low pay, precarious work and brutal benefit regimes which can only be tackled by wrestling power from Westminster. Douglas Ross faces an even bigger challenge.Managing to look awkward atop a large Army vehicle last week, every appearance reminds voters that while the MP for Moray is physically larger than Ruth Davidson, the new Scottish Conservative leader is nowhere near as comfortable in his own skin or politically bullet-proof.So, Douglas Ross will be happy to keep making swipes at ldquoseparation without being drawn into real debate about the benefits of the union.Willie Rennie would have to lay aside the publicity stunts with giant deckchairs and badgers to become the unionrsquos most passionate advocate and while the Greens must persuade Yessers they really back independence after acquiring more profile for their stance on gender rights, they also have to put clear green water between themselves and other indy parties on the list.So, with relatively few bites of the media cherry, the party will probably major on the green recovery. Meanwhile, Nicola Sturgeon has a record to defend and a wariness of half-launching any independence campaign without final, settled positions on currency, deficits and borders.Still, she may have to tryAlex Salmond lets rip at his policy launch tomorrow. Of course, the Alba tail cannot wag the SNP dog.But since Ms Sturgeon has had five post-Brexit years to devise new independence strategies, it may seem strange to votersshe doesnrsquot leap at the chance to unveil them.

So mesmerised by their surroundings have they become, they long to wear its esoteric costumery.Sturgeon is now apparently queasy about Alba gaming the system. Nothing resembles gaming the system than her MPs picking up poundk packages to sit in the Parliament of a state it wants to dismantle while doing the square root of sod all.

However, many people living with long-term conditions are unfortunately unable to access the facilities they need for physical exercise. As we approach the Scottish Parliament elections, we need to consider what a more sustainable, healthy society might look like, with physical activity at its heart.Movement for Health, a new coalition of Scotlandrsquos leading health charities, is asking all political parties to unite behind the prioritisation of physical activity facilities and support for people with long-term conditions to enable them to lead healthy lives.Why do we need to focus on physical activity now  Unfortunately, the evidence is stark:  per cent of deaths in Scotland are caused by inactivity, compared to nine per cent worldwide. Equality is also a critical issue ndash % of adults living in Scotlandrsquos deprived communities have reported a limiting long-standing illness, compared to % in more affluent parts of the country.The Covid- pandemic has brought increased urgency to the issue of inactivity, with statistics showing that % of people with a long term health condition have been doing less activity than normal during lockdown.If Scotland is to recover from the pandemic and address health inequalities, we need to act now. The benefits of regular physical activity are well-proven. As much as % of long-term conditions can be caused by inactivity. People who exercise regularly have a lower risk of developing signicant health conditions. Research also shows that physical activity can boost self-esteem and energy, while reducing risk of stress and depression.The pandemic has heightened the importance of ensuring everyone has access to local services and facilities to participate in and enjoy physical activity. Everyone should have a right to access facilities and services to maintain their health, especially iniduals living with long-term conditions who, as a group, have struggled to maintain activity during Covid- due to support being lost and facilities being closed. Yet, as we feel the economic bite of the pandemic, many of our leline facilities are potentially under threat of closure due to lack of funding. Ensuring everyone can access their local parks and countryside is critical both from a healthcare and equity basis.Post-Covid recovery offers an opportunity for change. We believe that through national and local leadership, there is a real opportunity to create a step-change in our approach to physical activity and revitalise our communities and workplaces through appropriate infrastructure to encourage active travel and physical activity.In doing so, we will create jobs, local opportunities and resilient communities. We need a mix of personalised social prescribing, such as prescribed physical activity, and appropriate pathways for all NHS patients.

It is worth pointing out that the PISA programme has its academic critics who question the methodology being used and the validity of the results obtained.One obvious issue with the PISA exercise is that like is not being compared with like. Scotland is very much in a minority of countries in having a national comprehensive system where some  per cent of youngsters are educated in their local high school. Most countries operate selective systems and or like China and Japan, where % of high school students attend private schools, there is a much larger private sector. So the PISA results must be treated with considerable caution. Furthermore, the drive by some countries to push up their PISA scores can be very damaging for their pupils.

Worryingly, in ,  Japanese school students committed suicide, such is the pressure on them to succeed.And what about this lost \"golden age\" for Scotlandrsquos schools  Quite frankly it never existed ndash at least not for the vast majority of Scottish pupils. When I started teaching, local authority senior secondary schools were still in existence. At their best, these schools could match and indeed outperform some of our celebrated private schools. However, running alongside these senior secondaries were our junior secondary schools. Conditions in these schools were markedly dferent. The use of corporal punishment was frequent, classes were usually streamed and sometimes single sex. While pupils in the junior secondaries might be leaving school at the age of  with some form of local certication, often vocationally based, none of them would have sat national examinations. For that to happen the leaving age had to be raised to  which happened in , which coincided with the move to comprehensive local authority high schools. Critics of our schools should also be reminded that the last three decades of the th century saw considerable disruption with teacher strikes, working to rule and the boycott of extra-curricular activities.I would encourage those loudest in their criticisms to visit their local schools. Compared to my early days in teaching the atmosphere now is warm, welcoming, purposeful, supportive and confident. There is much to be proud of.Eric Melvin, Edinburgh.* TOM Wyllie,claims that recent PISA statistics show Scotlands record in education to have \"plummeted\". This is hyperbole and factually incorrect, the four nations of the UK sit side by side in the PISA league tables of educational achievement, only slightly better than the average of the top OECD nations. This is not good enough for any of the UK nations of course, but singling out Scotland for criticism is simply gaslighting Scotland, which many Scots seem to delight in.Mr Wylie then goes on to ask a number of questions concerning Scotlands economy, currency, and trading arrangements.

The first was the compensation promised by the English to the \"Parcel of Rogues\" who sold their nations independence to secure reimbursement of cash they had gambled and lost by investing in the Darien scheme on the isthmus of Panama.

I think thats a failure of leadership.\"Evenby standing, Im encouraging people to stand for the Conservative Party, to be bold, I think thats a huge achievement in itself.\"The Scottish Parliament has faced criticism over its lack of ersity.Since , there have only been four MSPs from black, Asian and minority ethniccommunities. All have been men of Scots-Pakistani heritage.SNP Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf previously said this record of \"no black MSP ever, no female BAME MSP ever\" was \"frankly a failure of all of us, regardless of party\".The SNP has put BAME or disabled candidates top in its eight regional lists.The partys hopefuls include Graham Campbell, Glasgows first African Caribbean councillor, who is standing in Lothian.Mr Aibinu said Scotland had a \"dferent pattern of migration compared to what we have down south in, for example, places like London\".But he said it is becoming more erse, adding: \"With that change there should come more representation in the Scottish Parliament.\"So I think what we have right now, Im actually quite encouraged that we have more candidates coming forward from specically a black background wanting to stand for the Scottish Parliament, and the Conservative Party is right at the forefront of this.\"He continued: \"We now have a much larger pool of people in Scotland and in Glasgow specically, which is perhaps the most erse of the cities in Scotland.\"So Im hoping maybe at the next Westminster general election, wed have people from black backgrounds standing as well.\"However, he said representation is \"not just about having elected members in parliament\".He added: \"Its also about parliament being open to communities.\"Mr Aibinu said there is \"work to be done\" but he is \"encouraged by the current trajectory\".He said: \"From a policy perspective, mentorship is something we should encourage.\"The Tory hopeful said he had experienced racism in the past.He added: \"I dont let it stop me.

Proposals to scrap the tests come after ministers said earlier this year that they would remain available for teachers to deliver following disruption caused by Covid-related school closures.Ross Greer, education spokesperson for the Scottish Greens, said the decision to ldquoimpose standardised assessments on pupils as young as four was ldquoa mistake.He added: ldquoSNSAs create a pressure on teachers to narrow the curriculum and focus on satisfying test scores, rather than equipping young people with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed.ldquoThe Greens will scrap these tests at the first opportunity.Mr Greer said the SSLN provided important national data on attainment levels by sampling schools in a non-intrusive manner.Ross Greer said his party would axe the tests at the first opportunity.ldquoScotlandrsquos teachers meet some of the highest professional standards in the world, he added.ldquoWe should put our trust in them to deliver what their pupils need, rather than obsessively gather data which has little practical use.ldquoThe SSLN survey did exactly that, before the Government scrapped it.

Off he careens, into the distance, until hes just a speck, that invisible elastic between parent and child stretching but never breaking.Seeing that level of confidence and enjoyment is wonderful to watch. You only hope it continues, becomes a le long pleasure.In the first few months of the pandemic, among all the hardships and relentless grim news, it really was wonderful to see such an increase in people out on bikes.We were inching into the summer months and, with just one hour allowed outdoors, many people chose to use that time cycling.The parks were full of people exploring but vastly reduced traffic and quiet roads made cycling around the city a relaxed experience, rather than one spent hyper vigilant, watching for trouble, and so many more new cyclists were taking advantage of the situation.Those numbers have kept increasing and the latest figures, this week, show that cycling is up by % in Scotland.While thats good news, it also makes a lot of sense. The roads are still quieter than pre-pandemic, there is still a hesitancy to use public transport, and were so limited in our leisure options that people are turning to outdoor pursuits for exercise and socialising.There has also been a huge push from local authorities during the lockdown to create more space for people walking and cycling and to make the roads more amenable to non-vehicular traffic.The issue, as we move forward through and out of the pandemic, is going to be about how we keep encouraging people on to their bikes and give them the confidence to feel free in the saddle.Even with the improvements of the past  months, barriers still exist, particularly for women cyclists.In Scotland, more than three times as many men than women commute to work by bike.When asked, women speak about concerns over safety. They are worried about the harassment they face while out on their bikes. Id love to tell you that cat calls and aggression are an unfounded fear, but I would be lying.Often women are the ones doing the school run, which is not impossible by bike but understandably has logistical concerns that can be off putting.Research from Sustrans showed that, as well as fitness levels and safety, womens concerns were linked to their appearance. If that seems like vanity, its not. Women are judged on how they look and it can be a faff to commute by bike then look smart for the office.It involves forward planning, carrying clothes back and forth, arriving at work early to change and sort hair and make up in toilets, and etc. A tip: waterproof trousers will change your le.There is nothing worse than spending the morning on an office chair with a soggy bottom.I completely understand the hesitancy to start cycling and the fear of being on the road. It makes me laugh to look back at how gradually I took my bike out. I started off literally cycling to the end of my street and back. Then I was brave enough to make it to the park for a cycle round and home again.Eventually a colleague, who lives nearby, offered to accompany me on the commute to the office. He was big and bold and I hidbehind him the whole way there and all the way back again.There are lots of ways of getting support with confidence building though. In Glasgow, Bike For Good is a brilliant social enterprise doing great work helping people new to cycling and supporting cyclists to maintain their bikes.Bike For Good acknowledges that cycling can have particular challenges for women and non-binary people and that bike maintenance can be a male-dominated area so they have specic sessions catered for people who dont identy as men. Theres also a new buddy scheme being set up.In cities theresissues with cycle storage for those in flats and tenements but this is slowly being addressed with the introduction of on-street secure cycleparking.Despite the improvements over the past year, its good to get out with a more confident buddy as some of Glasgows cycle routes are bonkers and can be off-putting to a novice. You can find yourself having to bump down kerbs to keep on the route being erted away from well lit and visible paths on to glass-strewn, cobbled back lanes or one moment be dutully following painted routes and the next moment come up against metal railings with nowhere to go.But when you find yourself sailing along a well-constructed, properly thought out, segregated cycle route... theres nothing like it. Gliding along, away from the traffic, fresh air in your face.Yes, sometimes dirt spraying from the road onto your cheeks yes, sometimes rain suddenly bursting unexpectedly from a clear sky yes, sometimes wind in your face that makes your thighs ache from the effort of pedalling.Cycling is not always joyous but there is always a little bit of joy about it.One of the major barriers, though, and the most dficult to tackle, is the ingrained lack of respect for cyclists and cycling. Not only from drivers but from those who are creating our cycle lanes.This morning, on a short, two-mile journey from Glasgow Sherf Court to the South Side, I had to navigate around five cars parked in cycle lanes and then three workmens vans stopped on the South City Way segregated cycle route. Drivers are more often than not parked on the South City Way.Theyll argue that they cant block the road but thats part of the problem with how we perceive cycling infrastructure - as though it is an added extra, a luxury, rather than fundamental. The car is still king and its routes to be as protected as a royal parade.As the cycle routes around the south side of the city are developed there have been a lot of roadworks. Every effort is made to keep carriageways open for cars but the bike lanes are closed and replaced with the dreaded Cyclists Dismount signs.I look forward to the day that changes are needed to facilitate roadworks and drivers are told to Park Here and walk the rest of the way. Thats obviously an imperfect comparison but it almost literally grinds my gears that these road changes dont take into account the fact cyclists are also commuters with somewhere to be.The ersions that are put in place for cyclists can sometimes be mind-bendingly confusing. Theres one at Buchanan Wharf, as you come off the Squiggly Bridge, that has painted arrows for cyclists that,you follow them, take you right into the path of oncoming foot traffic with nowhere  to go.I do, though, see improvements being made. The way to encourage more people to cycle is fairly simple - make cities and town centres less attractive to cars so other activities and means of transport naturally fill those spaces.Its an exciting time for cyclists and its a good time to be supporting people to take up cycling. There are hurdles but hard work going on to overcome them.Just imagine - city spaces where you can be free to fly as confidently as a four-year-old whos learned the pleasure of two wheels."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-independence-nicola-sturgeon-gives-firm-no-working-alex-salmond","story":"The First Minister insistedher focusis on fighting the upcoming election in a bid to win as many seatsfor the SNP as possible.However, although she said they were \"hypothetical questions\", she did not rule out the prospect of working with the Greens,who also favour Scottish independence ndasha coalition is needed.Scottish Green Party co-leader Lorna Slater previously spoke out about the prospect of a coalition between the two parties, saying the Greens ldquowant to be in government in this country.Ms Sturgeon, speaking to the Scottish Parliamentary Journalistsrsquo Association, refused to rule out a future coalition.She said: ldquoI am concentrating on fighting this election and winning as many seats as possible for the SNP.

Ifyoursquoreworking to a budget and donrsquot need the ultimatewhen it comes torange, then you might like what the ZS EV has to offer.BackgroundInterest in electric vehicle technology is growing at a rapid pace, but price continues to be a barrierfor some. Enter the MG ZS EV. Priced to undercut its rivals by a signicant margin,itrsquoseven cheaper than some supermini EVs.The ZS has been around for a while. The spacious compact SUV was launched in  with a choice of .-litre or .-litre petrol engines. However, MG had their eye on full electrication from thevery outset and designed the ZS  with that goal in mind.Driving ExperienceThe ZS EV is powered by a .kWh, water-cooled lithium-ion battery which delivers a WLTP-rated driving range of  miles.Itrsquosnot quite cutting-edgewhencompared to comparable family EVs which manage miles from a single charge ndash but those cars are signicantly more expensive and are less spacious to boot.As with any EV, the ZS EV is quick off the mark withan immediateNm of torque.Therersquos kW of power-the equivalent of PS-which will see you hit mph in just . seconds.However, off-the-line performanceisnrsquotquite matched by top speed which is limited to mph.At the wheeltherersquosa nty Rotary Gear Selector in place of the usual gear stick, offering the choice of Drive, Neutral and Reverse, coupled with aswitch that allows you to select between three levels of braking energy recoveryLevel one provides a small amount of regeneration whilst requiring much the same braking action on the part of the driver whilstlevelthreeoffersa near one-pedal driving experience with maximum braking regeneration kicking inas soon as the accelerator is lted.Once you get used to it, this level provides an easier drive, improves overallefficiency,and reduces overall wear on parts. Clever stuff.Design and BuildMG has done a great job with the styling.At a smidge over .m in the ZS EVsits between smaller crossovers like the Nissan Juke and larger family-sized crossovers like the Kia Sportage. It also sports a couple of model-specic features such as the updated lsquostar-riderrsquo front grille which frames the iconic octagonal badge andtherersquosa unique colour option which MG call lsquoPimlico Bluersquo.Without exception, every EV model under the pound, price markisconsiderablysmaller than the ZS EV ndash both inside and out.The battery pack has been carefully positioned beneath the car to avoid eating into valuable passenger or luggage space.

It is a depressingly all-too familiar sight.“Stagnation” was the term Mr MacKinnon used, and he was spot on.As lives become ever more disconnected from the land, it’s quite understandable why people no longer have the inclination, or time, particularly when there is no great financial . But how it must frustrate those desperate to work the land to see all these crofts going to waste.Survey after survey has demonstrated a huge interest from people wanting to get a foot on the ladder, but they can’t because the traditional avenue of family inheritance is not open to them.The croft tenancies that do come on the market go for astronomical sums, way beyond the reach of young families and completely out of kilter with agricultural potential.And this is the problem, the reason that so many people hold onto non-working crofts is because they can see the pound signs they can see what it might fetch in terms of its housing potential, with estate agents only too happy to downplay the fact that every croft tenancy sale and every de-crofting application has to be approved by the Crofting Commission. It’s not proved too much of an impediment in the past.In fairness to the commission, they have made improvements. As much as the law enables, they do now try and prevent housing speculation – although one recent case in Lochalsh suggests there may be still some way to go. And they have at least made the right noises about dealing with neglect, which has prompted an increase in formal sub-leases and tenancy transfers.But as Mr MacKinnon noted, it is dficult for them to really stamp their authority without the proper resources.So an impasse remains, young families are unable to get access to land while countless crofts go to waste.But there is a solution, evenit will make for an uncomfortable journey: remove the ability to trade tenancies on the open market and at the same time get rid of the right to buy a croft. At a stroke, those motivated purely for monetarywill disappear their incentive gone. Then arm the commission with the necessary resources to properly tackle neglect —rather than the current practice of gentle encouragement without force — and those who have crofts but can’t do the work will have to quickly find a solution. Step forward new entrants.Granted, the opposition to such an approach will likely be signicant. Denying people the opportunity to do with an asset what they please will be seen as anti-libertarian, a curb on personal freedom, and you can easily predict the outrage.But the responsibility of a crofter is not to do as you please. You are part of a unique system of land tenure which was established nearly  years ago to keep people and communities alive. That is still very much of relevance today. Denying those fortunate enough to have crofts from lining their own pockets and ensuring everyone lives up to their duties doesn’t seem an unreasonable expectation in that context.It is expected that, Covid recovery depending, the new term of the Scottish Parliament willto the matter of crofting reformand there is an opportunity here for a proper radical approach which addresses the needs of crofting today but, crucially, with the principles of old at its heart.It will require politicians and leaders of strength and conviction who are able to make a compelling case in the face of undoubted opposition, who can the see the vision that a new, radical approach will bring and who can reject pressure from all sorts of vested interests.

Daniel Kane found herself in Malawi - the fth poorest nation in the world. Malawi, with a population of almost million and only a handful of ventilators and very little PPE, was totally unprepared for the pandemic. Charlotte assisted in the initial response to the first surge of the coronavirus as it spread throughout Malawi. Currently, however, a second and more deadly wave is gripping the country with devastating consequences. Charlotte said: “There are ten times more cases than during the first wave and a projected exponential increase in the infection rate. “Access to hospitals and modern health care is extremely limited. Many covid- patients are being treated in temporary wards in carparks with oxygen cylinders and . “There is no ability to give patients ventilatory support and take them into intensive care. Frontline healthcare workers risk their lives every day without adequate PPE and basic essentials such as hand gel.”Another huge contrast with the UK is that it may be some time before poorer countries like Malawi can get the vaccine. Here in the UK, the vaccine rollout has been a massive success with every person eligible for a free vaccination on the NHS. In poorer countries it will take much longer even for the vaccine to reach frontline health workers and the most vulnerable. The “Economist” reckons that it will be  at least before there is widespread vaccine roll out. “This means that Malawians have at least two years to get through before there is effective vaccine cover. As the vaccine rolls out in advanced economies and many of us are starting to see a glimmer of hope that normality willsoon, the story in Malawi couldn’t be more dferent,” says Charlotte.For health systems which are already woefully under-resourced, dealing with a second wave and a new strain of COVID- is a monumental challenge. Hospitals and clinics are operating without the basics to protect their staff and patients. Basic levels of PPE and hand gels are in very short supply. Without this support fragile health systems will be decimated of their most precious resource at this time – healthcare workers as many are at home sick with COVID- or sadly dying. This comes at a time when hospitals are buckling under pressure and desperately need health workers to be able to work.Charlotte now works as a doctor in Liverpool where the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine has launched Bump It Forward campaign to help bring PPE and vaccines to Malawi, Kenya and Zimbabwe in an attempt to redress this massive health inequality. The fund raising campaign actually came about as the result of a dream.A Christian friend of Prof Melita Gordon, who works in Malawi fulltime as part of the Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme, dreamt about how she was to receive her vaccine free of charge and an idea emerged to ‘pay forwar’d the cost of that doseage to help people in countries who did not yet have vaccines. It was a very direct, personal idea that people in the UK who have had a vaccine get it for free while the people in Malawi don’t. People love the idea of the BumpitForward campaign as it provides the opportunity to give back the cost of the vaccine in the order of pound. which they get it for free to help protect healthcare workers in Malawi, Kenya and Zimbabwe until the vaccine reaches them and save lives.Dr. Kane says she would love to see a local response to the campaign after her experience at the Mulanje District Hospital.Charlotte says: “The hospital is doing a great job, providing quality, safe and dignied care in extremely dficult circumstances.“Just like in the UK, they have had staff shortages related to staff testing positive for COVID which has made things all the more dficult. The senior nurses have designed a protocol to make best use of reusable gowns and are very grateful to receive the PPE donation. “I worked at Mulanje for the first six months of  and they have been brilliantly supportive partners in MLW-led research into reducing deaths from sepsis and HIV associated TB, so it is a pleasure to be able to support our partners when they are in need of PPE at this time. #Bumpitforward is a wonderful campaign which I couldn’t recommend highly enough.Give the equivalent of your Covid- vaccine to protect frontline staff in African countries who will have to wait for theirs. You can help keep them safe by donating the equivalent cost of your vaccine, to protect them until they can get theirs. There has already been a huge response to the Bump It Forward campaign and it continues to grow! It has now raised over pound,.

The scale of the  disaster still resonates to this day and, not surprisingly, we in Northern Ireland remain particularly intrigued by the tragic story. After all, the near legendary ‘unsinkable ship’ was built on the slipways and docks of Harland and Wolff.We have flocked to see several epic movies about the disaster and watched fascinated as deep sea submersibles have traversed the wreck of the ship.Who can forget the elaborate chandelier apearing out of the murk when the first cameras were sent into the wreck at the bottom of the Atlantic.But only a small number of local people will be aware that Alexander Carlisle who led the initial design team for the project was from Ballymena.With the help of a few sources we hope to make the link between the City of the Seven Towers and the most famous ship in history.Perhaps the best article on Carlisle’s role has been penned by Paul Louden-Brown FRSA for the Titanic Belfast website. And he begins his exploration by asking why so many people have credited the much more famous Thomas Andrews, played by Victor Garber in the enormously successful  movie, with the design. Louden-Brown argues that Thomas Andrews did not design Titanic or her sister ships Olympic and Britannic.He states, unequivicolly that the man who deserves credit for the design is Alexander Carlisle.He writes: “So why, when so much is written and talked about Titanic, has such a mistake been made  The answer lies partly in the power of film.“In  Walter Lord’s best seller ‘A Night to Remember’ about the Titanic disaster was turned into a feature film.“The film’s screenplay, outside of the author’s control, featured a degree of dramatic license in order to increase the impact of the story.“ The first of these dramatizations was the launch of Titanic - the White Star Line held no formal naming ceremony for their steamships and Titanic was no exception - yet in the film a lady names the vessel and breaks a bottle of champagne over the bows.“I asked Bill MacQuitty, the Belfast-born producer of the film, who, as a child, witnessed the launch of Titanic, why he included an invented scene in his film “His answer was revealing ‘because it’s what an audience expects to see at the launch of a ship.’ The same, he said, applied to Thomas Andrews’ characterization.“The idea of the designer of the ship going down with his creation, while the owner escaped in a leboat, was too good a storyline to ignore.”Louden Brown continues: “MacQuitty was well aware who really designed Titanic and that J. Bruce Ismay was not a coward but his primary concern was turning an historical event into a commercially successful feature film.“ In that respect he succeeded and ‘A Night to Remember’ remains the definitive version with Titanic enthusiasts and the public alike.“The film’s influence is clear to see. James Cameron’s blockbuster film ‘Titanic’ also re-enforced Andrews’ position as ‘designer’ in a similar caricaturization to that used by MacQuitty almost forty years before.”Countless books, magazine articles, TV documentaries and even a set of th anniversary stamps featuring an image of Andrews all reinforce the misconception that he designed the ship - the invented story is just too powerful.Louden Brown continues: “None of this uncomfortable truth is intended to take anything away from the reputation of Thomas Andrews he was a brave man and did his duty.“He died helping others and his name is properly honoured in the country of his birth but he does not deserve credit for designing the ‘Olympic’ class liners that honour belongs to Carlisle.“The man who designed Titanic was born in Ballymena, Co. Antrim on  July . Alexander Montgomery Carlisle, eldest of five children and the son of John Carlisle, Headmaster of the Royal Belfast Academical Institution, was educated at his father’s school.In , aged sixteen, he began work at Harland  Wolff as a premium apprentice. Serving alongside him for the next five years was his friend, fellow apprentice and future brother-in-law William James Pirrie . The two young men were destined to play a leading role in the development of Harland  Wolff.In April  Carlisle married American born Edith Wooster, twelve years his junior, at the First Congregational Church in San Francisco.The couple had two daughters and a son and, as Carlisle was steadily promoted, the family purchased a large red brick house in Elmwood Avenue near Queen’s University.In  Carlisle was made chief naval architect at the yard and from this date he designed some of most famous liners belonging to the White Star Line amongst the long list were Teutonic, Cymric, Oceanic, Adriatic and finally the ‘Olympic’ class liners.As Manager his redevelopment plan of the yard in order to facilitate the construction of the world’s largest liners transformed Harland  Wolff into a virtual factory production line.At the end of June  he resigned from the positions of General Manager and Chairman of Managing Directors at the relatively young age of fty-five - the reason for his decision to resign are unknown. Remarkably he had never taken a day’s sick leave since joining the firm.Universally popular with the workforce, who nicknamed him ‘Big Alec’, the growing issue of Home Rule and the political instability of the period may have contributed towards his decision to leave. At the time of his retirement Carlisle split his time between his homes in Belfast and  Hyde Park Place, Londonsup.His designs for the ‘Olympic’ class were completed with both vessels under construction Olympic plated and just four months away from launching and Titanic in frame.Thomas Andrews’ involvement, from July onwards, was to take up where Carlisle had left off in the management of a project where the major designs decisions had been completed several years before.Continued from page : Louden-Brown ‘s article continues: The disaster which overtook Carlisle’s last creation was said to have broken his heart.Called to give evidence at the British enquiry into the loss and asked about his role in the design of Titanic, he explained that he was in charge of turning the concept for the ‘Olympic’ class into design reality.Both ships, he said, were ‘entirely designed practically by Lord Pirrie. The details, the decorations, the equipment and the general arrangements all came under me.’Carlisle was being modest about his influence and abilities. His ‘signature style’ for the White Star fleet was well established by the s the proportions of the hull to the upper works, rake of the funnels, spacing of the masts, design of the bridge front and more, gave each vessel an unmistakable and identiable White Star look.Lord Pirrie’s opinions on the design, or otherwise, were not sought by Lord Mersey and it remains a signicant oversight that he was not called to give evidence, or asked to provide even a written statement, particularly with regard to the decision made regarding the number of leboats provided on each ship.Carlisle placed blame for the lack of leboats with the White Star management.It was Carlisle who outlined the design of what became the Welin Quadrant Davit system, capable of handling up to twice the number of leboatsthe Board of Trade regulations required, but the owners made the decision to reduce this number to just  with four collapsibles.The famous shipbuilder always followed his own inclinations having scant respect for convention.In February  he was arrested on a Coroner’s warrant for failing to attend the inquest into the death of a workman killed in the yard. On promising to attend the adjourned inquest he was released.He was made an Irish Privy Councillor by King Edward in . Like Pirrie, Carlisle became a Home Ruler - campaigning for an indpendent Irish Parliament within the Imperial context.Carlisle, a keen collector of autographs, counted amongst his collection many prominent personalties including those of King George and Kaiser Wilhelm.He met the Kaiser on a number of occasions before the First World War. His eldest daughter married Baron Frederick von Versen, one of the Kaiser’s aides, and in  when visiting the married couple in Berlin he was entertained by the Kaiser.The two men were formally introduced at the unveiling of Queen Victoria’s memorial in front of Buckingham Palace in  and they met again when he was a guest at a famous supper party after one of the Kiel yachting regattas.A noted Germanophile, the Ulsterman was certainly impressed with all things Germanic and made several Atlantic crossings in the liners Amerika, Kaiserin Auguste Victoria and Imperatorit appears his tastes were better satisfied by the lavish surroundings in the German liners.Long after the war, anti-German sentiment still prevailed in Britain but it did not bother him.It was rumoured that a rt existed between Carlisle and his brother-in-law Lord Pirrie, but no reason has been offered as to why this should have been the case. The most plausible explanation was Carlisle’s Bohemian tastes, his close ties with the Kaiser, popularity with the workmen in the yard and his plans to join the Labour party and stand as a Parliamentary candidate.The many statements he made about German shipbuilding ‘they are equal in every way to us as shipbuilders and operators’ and his prophesy that they would once again compete with the British in the size and speed of ocean liners and his left wing politics did nothing to endear him to the Chairman of Harland  Wolff.For Pirrie, a Liberal but conservative by nature and by now a rising star of the British establishment, the idea of a relative with known German sympathies making statements like this and with a daughter married to a former aide of the Kaiser was galling enough, but,he had lived long enough to discover Carlisle also planned to visit his old friend the now ex-Kaiser, it would probably have ended their relationship.Eighteen months after Pirrie’s death in November  Carlisle did just that and visited Wilhelm exiled at Doorn in the Netherlands he said at the time ‘My friends tell me that it was an extra-ordinary thing for a British subject to accept the hospitality of the former War Lord, whose subjects, military and civilian, chanted the Hymn of Hate, but I am an unconventional man.’He stayed for a weekend and in some style the standards the Kaiser was used to in the old days at Potsdam were still kept up. He brought along his autograph book and the two men reminisced about many of the famous names the book contained and, le before the war. Carlisle had been unwell for sometime with heart and lung problems, and during his stay ‘took a chill’.Defining convention to the very end he organized and paid for his funeral in advance, proudly showing off to family and friends the framed cremation certicate that cost pound s d and telling them how cheap it was to dispose of himself in this way and that it was time he disappeared from this earthly stage.That time came on  March  at his London home and three days later, on the th, his funeral, as arranged, took place at Golders Green in North West London. The German theme continued with light music - Schubert’s ‘Reminiscences’ and ‘Nachtstuck’ and an Allegretto by Mendelssohn - played by an organist who was also paid in advance. There was no clergyman present, no formal religious rites were observed, no hymns were sung and no prayers were recited. The small group of mourners included his two daughters, sisters Viscountess Pirrie, Mrs Hunter and several family friends. After the cremation he left instructions for the ‘Merry Widow’ waltz to be played as his ashes were scattered in the Garden of Rest. ‘I am sure it will be more agreeable than the dead march from “Saul”’, he had remarked.So ended the le of a remarkable man. During his letime Carlisle had overseen the tremendous growth in world shipbuilding and his own part, pivotal in transforming the emigrant ship into a virtual floating city and the need for improved le saving appliances in the new generation of large passenger liners, but his plans were ignored. Many of the obituaries published in Britain omitted mention of Titanic, still a painful subject even in . In other countries that was not the case and he was given the credit he deserved for his far sighted designs and for the influence he made on British and world shipbuilding, denied him in modern times because of the power of film, the very thing, paradoxically, that has been largely responsible for keeping the story of Titanic alive.

He said lockdown and a bit of decluttering had given him an opportunity to revisit an old favourite he played while working on Downtown Radio’s First Edition breakfast show with Richard Young.At one stage, we played this song by Ray Stevens called the Mississippi Squirrel Revival. When I came across it, I thought I hadn’t played it in years, so I asked Alexa to play it, he added.You would have to hear it — it’s one of those songs that would put a smile on your face.It’s not one of his best-known songs, like Misty or Everything is Beautul, but it just struck a chord with listeners.During lockdown,I’m having one of those days that makes you go ‘oh God, more of this’, I stick it on. It makes me smile.Rebecca McKinney, who co-presents Cool FM’s breakfast show with Pete Snodden, uses music to lt her mood.Getting in the car and turning up the radio has always felt therapeutic to me, she said.During the first lockdown, I was shielding at home after being ill. Niall Horan’s Heartbreak Weather album was the one. This lockdown, the song Alright by Red Carpet is also on repeat.Conor Hogan, otherwise known as the Belfast Food Blogger, loves listening to music while working in the kitchen.I’ve been doing lots of cooking while we’ve been at home. Alexa is my new best friend to get a playlist going while I’m doing that, he said.I love listening to Counting Crows, Michael Jackson and Elvis. My favourite track of Michael Jackson’s would be Stranger in Moscow.We also listen to Dance Monkey by Tones And I about three times a day because my daughter, Lily , loves dancing to it.For comedian Shane Todd, who presented the Rave Lockdown on BBC Radio Ulster, Maniac  has been the track of the pandemic.It was the undisputed anthem of the Rave Lockdown. Songs like that invoke memories of my youth and long summers, he said.Belfast-based businesswoman Cathy Martin found solace not in single songs but in whole lives shows.Gok Wan’s live DJ sets on Facebook and Instagram made for an awesome kitchen party atmosphere, evenit was just ourselves, she said.According to the BPI survey, just one in  people are listening to less music than before or none at all.The jump in listening was most pronounced among the -to- age group, with almost half saying they consumed more music now than previously.The results also suggested people relied on their favourite songs for a boost when separated from friends or loved ones.Half of those surveyed listened to music to improve their mood, while % said it helped them wind down or sleep and % said it made them feel motivated.For the % who reported weekly feelings of anxiety, more than halfsaid songs eased their pain.Some % use it to alleviate boredom, % to improve concentration and % as an accompaniment to exercise.The statistics were taken from the BPI’s All About the Music study, which examined trends in the industry.It said Dua Lipa, The Weeknd, Kylie Minogue and Lady Gaga were some of the year’s most popular artists.Geoff Taylor, chief executive of the BPI, Brit Awards and Mercury Prize, added: Music has many intrinsic benefits, not least in raising spirits and promoting wellbeing, but this new research underscores just how much of a leline it’s been for people since lockdown, inspiring and reassuring us and also helping many of us to work, study and exercise to greater effect.The transformational power of music to improve lives has rarely been more pronounced.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk d .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dda-bfc-a--fcbfff_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk d .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dda-bfc-a--fcbfff_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk d .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dda-bfc-a--fcbfff_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk d .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dda-bfc-a--fcbfff_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk d .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dda-bfc-a--fcbfff_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern Ireland PremiumMaureen ColemanOpinionThank you for the music... it#s been a real lesaver in lockdownThe poet Robert Browning was spot on when he famously wrote: Who hears music, feels his solitude peopled at once.Most ReadVideo: Youths clash with police in second night of trouble in west BelfastBrandon Lewis meets political leaders over Belfast disorder after Assembly unites to call for end to violenceSouth Belfast UPRG becomes first loyalist group to call for an end to unrestKevin ScottOpinionThe cowards who attacked me from behind don’t represent the good people of west BelfastFancy a pint  Stunning homes and their back garden barsTop VideosPlayYouths shoot fireworks atpolice in west Belfast PlayClean-up underway after night of disorder in west BelfastPlayBoris Johnson condemns violence in Northern Ireland after another night of unrestLatest CoronavirusNorthern Ireland Covid- death toll lowest since OctoberFionola MeredithOpinionAlways another reason to keep the NI Covid rules in placeOxford jab benefits #far outweigh# potential risks, insists chief medicRobin Swann launches consultation to extend modications to children’s social care regulationsLatest from Belfast Iain Henderson misses out again as Ulster unchanged but Northampton Saints name strong side for Challenge Cup qurter-finalPrince Philip Duke of Edinburgh dies aged Ukraine v Northern Ireland LIVE: Updates from Women#s Euro  play-off first leg as Kenny Shiels# side make historyAnonymous ticket-holder claims £m EuroMillions jackpotPolice dog injured along with  officers, as MLA questions PSNI Belfast disorder tactics,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Utterly reckless and depressing to see more violence at interface areas tonight. My heart goes out to those living in the area who are living with this fear and disturbance. This needs to stop now before lives are lost.The White House led condemnation following the scenes of Wednesday night#s violence in west Belfast which police have said was on a scale not seen in Northern Ireland for many years.Around  people were involved in a riot in the Shankill area on Wednesday evening with petrol bombs, bottles, masonry and fireworks thrown at police and also across the interface at Lanark Way.A bus was hijacked and petrol bombed, destroying the vehicle. The driver and passengers had previously been forced from the bus by masked rioters. Another two vehicles were also hijacked in a night of mayhem.Riot police fired six plastic baton rounds. Eight officers were injured and two men aged  and  have been arrested, with more arrests expected to follow.Police said paramilitary involvement was likely. Local sources said there was some UVF and UDA participants while the majority of those taking part were very young men.There have been accusations that older loyalists are exploiting young people involved in the unrest and placing them at risk of injury or prosecution. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Taoiseach Micheal Martin led condemnation of the violence.The pair spoke over the phone on Thursday afternoon about the developments over recent days.A statement from the Irish Government said: Stressing that violence is unacceptable, they called for calm.The way forward is through dialogue and working the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement. They agreed that the two governments would continue to stay in contact.In the United States, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said: We are concerned by the violence in Northern Ireland and we join the British, Irish and Northern Irish leaders in their call for calm.Nationalist youths had gathered at the Lanark Way peace wall and a period of intense sectarian violence took place, as police and local youth and community workers tried to bring the unrest under control.In a bid to take young people off the streets, Education Minister Peter Weir said some youth services would be reopening.The services will apply to facilities and youth clubs which operate in areas of heightened community tensions, such as the Shankill. Mr Weir said: At this time it is even more important that youth services are able to meet the needs of young people in these areas.Condemning the Shankill disorder, Assistant Chief Constable Jonathan Roberts said officers witnessed intense disorder in a built up area for a sustained periodBelfastphotographer Kevin Scott was also assaulted by two masked men and his camera equipment damaged. Following a special sitting of the Stormont Assembly the Executive later released a joint statement in a rare show of unity saying: Those who would seek to use and abuse our children and young people to carry out these attacks have no place in our society.Belfast Most ReadVideo: Youths clash with police in second night of trouble in west BelfastBrandon Lewis meets political leaders over Belfast disorder after Assembly unites to call for end to violenceSouth Belfast UPRG becomes first loyalist group to call for an end to unrestKevin ScottOpinionThe cowards who attacked me from behind don’t represent the good people of west BelfastFancy a pint  Stunning homes and their back garden barsTop VideosPlayYouths shoot fireworks atpolice in west Belfast PlayClean-up underway after night of disorder in west BelfastPlayBoris Johnson condemns violence in Northern Ireland after another night of unrestLatest Belfast BeatPolice dog injured along with  officers, as MLA questions PSNI Belfast disorder tacticsUS President Joe Biden#s White House voices concern over Belfast disorderNorthern Ireland traffic alerts: latest delays and ersionsVideo: Youths clash with police in second night of trouble in west BelfastLatest from Belfast Iain Henderson misses out again as Ulster unchanged but Northampton Saints name strong side for Challenge Cup qurter-finalPrince Philip Duke of Edinburgh dies aged Ukraine v Northern Ireland LIVE: Updates from Women#s Euro  play-off first leg as Kenny Shiels# side make historyAnonymous ticket-holder claims £m EuroMillions jackpotPolice dog injured along with  officers, as MLA questions PSNI Belfast disorder tactics,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Devotion to the QueenThe duke spent more than  years as the Queen’s companion.His support was unwavering as he stood by her side through each decade of her reign.He was the longest-serving consort in British history – supporting the nation’s longest-reigning monarch.Their compatibility led to a long and successful marriage – despite their contrasting personalities – with Philip seen as adventurous and tempestuous, and the Queen as more passive, cautious and conventional.Always one step behind Elizabeth, the duke let the monarch take centre stage, but accompanied her throughout the triumphs and trials of her role as head of state.. Public dutyPhilip’s le was devoted to public duty.He carried out thousands of engagements in the UK and around the world during his letime – from entertaining visiting presidents and hosting charity receptions to holding private dinners for military organisations.Sprightly even in his s, he was steadfastly committed to serving the nation without complaint.His retirement from public duties in August  came at the age of .. His gaffesPhilip was famous for his controversial comments – from describing Chinese people as “slitty eyed” to asking a sea cadet whether she worked in a strip club.The duke never curbed his off-the-cuff remarks, and even at the age of  he was caught on camera swearing at an RAF photographer for taking too long to take a picture.Despite the criticism he faced, Philip will be forever known for spicing up even the dullest of royal engagements.. The Duke of Edinburgh’s AwardHe set up his youth achievement awards programme in  and it became one of the best-known self-development and adventure schemes for  to -year-olds.Millions have signed up to work towards their Bronze, Silver and Gold Awards and the scheme has been praised for challenging young people and broadening their horizons.. No-fuss approachThe duke was a no-nonsense man who could not bear a fuss. He was not interested in what legacy he would leave behind.Illness did not require sympathy and his birthdays were kept as low-key as possible.. Royal patriarchAlthough the Queen was head of state, it was Philip who was head of the royal family.A firm father, the duke took the lead behind closed doors.He was also in charge of family barbecues when the royals holidayed at Balmoral and took pride in his culinary skills.. Carriage drivingPhilip was synonymous with carriage driving.He loved nothing more than to go haring through the countryside at high speed, whip in hand, in a horse-drawn, wheeled carriage.“I am getting old, my reactions are getting slower, and my memory is unreliable, but I have never lost the sheer pleasure of driving a team through the British countryside,” he explained in the book he wrote about the sport.The duke was also a keen oil painter.. Naval serviceHe could have been First Sea Lord – the professional head of the Navy – had he not married Princess Elizabeth.But his naval career came to an end in  due to the failing health of his father-in-law, George VI, and when his we became Queen a year later, his destiny was set.His le at sea – following distinguished service during the Second World War – was put aside for royal duty, but he always maintained close connections to the armed forces and their organisations.For Philip’s th birthday, the Queen – who is well aware of what he sacriced – poignantly bestowed upon him the title of Lord High Admiral, titular head of the Royal Navy.. Dashing princePhilip was Princess Elizabeth’s Prince Charming.Tall, blond and athletic, he was a royal heartthrob in the s when he romanced the future Queen and married her in a fairytale ceremony.. Charity workThe duke was patron of countless organisations and charities.When he turned , he stepped down as president or patron of more than a dozen organisations – but was still involved with nearly  charities or bodies ahead of his retirement.He was particularly interested in scientic and technological research, industry, the conservation of the environment and the encouragement of sport.. A moderniserWhen the Queen first became monarch, she gave Philip the task of reorganising her Balmoral and Sandringham estates, which he did with ruthless efficiency.He set about modernising Buckingham Palace after being told by aides to keep out of the Queen’s official duties.“I tried to find useful things to do,” he said about starting a footman training programme at the palace.He was also Ranger of Windsor Great Park and fundamental to the upkeep of the vast parkland, from designing gardens to introducing deer.. Not being Prince ConsortQueen Victoria’s Prince Albert was Prince Consort, but Philip, despite his longevity as a royal consort, was never given the title.Politicians suggested he be offered it, but the duke – unconcerned with his own standing – was simply not interested.PAMost ReadVideo: Youths clash with police in second night of trouble in west BelfastBrandon Lewis meets political leaders over Belfast disorder after Assembly unites to call for end to violenceSouth Belfast UPRG becomes first loyalist group to call for an end to unrestKevin ScottOpinionThe cowards who attacked me from behind don’t represent the good people of west BelfastLoyalists planning more unnotied parades in act of #civil disobedience# as summer of disruption loomsTop VideosPlayYouths shoot fireworks atpolice in west Belfast PlayClean-up underway after night of disorder in west BelfastPlayBoris Johnson condemns violence in Northern Ireland after another night of unrestLatest UKPrince Philip Duke of Edinburgh dies aged Anonymous ticket-holder claims £m EuroMillions jackpotWho was the Duke of Edinburgh and what do we know about his le and role Queen losing her ‘rock’Time of grief amid troubles for royals and nationLatest from Belfast Iain Henderson misses out again as Ulster unchanged but Northampton Saints name strong side for Challenge Cup qurter-finalPrince Philip Duke of Edinburgh dies aged Ukraine v Northern Ireland LIVE: Updates from Women#s Euro  play-off first leg as Kenny Shiels# side make historyAnonymous ticket-holder claims £m EuroMillions jackpotPolice dog injured along with  officers, as MLA questions PSNI Belfast disorder tactics,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Derry has experienced seven days of disturbances in the Waterside area of the city during which police officers have been attacked, vehicles burned, roads blocked and residents left in fear. The work of Michael Mulqueen, Professor of Policing and National Security at University of Central Lancashire, has largely focused on Ireland and he is therefore well acquainted with NI politics. He believes that fundamentally the current disorder is rooted in the absence of effective political and community leadership. googletag.cmd.push Speaking to the Derry News, Professor Mulqueen explains that in such a vacuum vulnerable people can be preyed upon. “Instead of being valued and supported, they are being drawn within the grip of serious criminal elements instead of being led on a path to cross-community healing, they are being infused with grubby politicised doctrines of suspicion and hate, and instead of being offered a future, they are being manipulated to ruin their le prospects by engaging in criminal behaviour,” he says. In his view, the two parties occupying the two polarities of Northern Irish politics - Sinn Feacutein and the DUP - carry a ‘heavy share’ of responsibility for what has occurred. googletag.cmd.push  Professor Mulqueensees promise in the neighbourhood policing model, driven by Chief Constable Simon Byrne and his senior team, which seeks to deliver impartial policing to all communities. That policing model, he says, is set up to be the very opposite of one side or the other asserting political control over Northern Ireland’s policing. “But because they profit from propagating deeply-rooted tribalism the parties concerned routinely seek to delegitimise the PSNI, resorting to allegations that it is biased and incompetent, even when evidence-led processes internal and external to it conclude otherwise,” the Lancashire Professor surmises. “The Sinn Feacutein leadership have stoked recent tensions by gathering in such numbers at the funeral of Bobby Storey.     “But traditional unionism, in its reaction to the subsequent PPS decision on prosecutions, has gone down the same route. “The First Minister, Arlene Foster, by calling on Chief Constable Simon Byrne and his senior team to resign, is targeting the standing of the PSNI chain of command at a time of sustained rioting.” He adds: “Proportionate, lawful and accountable public order policing depends upon clear lines of command and control, which the police hierarchy is designed to deliver. “By not fully thinking through the consequences of her antipathy for Mr Byrne, the First Minster is raising risk to officers and creating the wrong controversy – one that overshadows the hurt Sinn Feacutein inflicted upon many people by gathering in numbers at the funeral. “She is engaging in really hazardous politicking.” ‘WHATABOUTERY’ Similarly, he believes, the Pitt Park and Ormeau Road incidents were transformed from moments of potentially useful questioning of police actions into opportunities to delegitimise the police and, arguably, the state. Professor Mulqueen states: “Sinn Feacutein office holders could have reassured shaken communities that robust impartial mechanisms governed police performance and discipline. “They could have informed public debate by engaging themselves with Authorised Professional Practice , which comprises the evidence-based procedures produced by the UK’s College of Policing for everything from an arrest to a riot. Instead, they inflamed insecurity and doubt. “Officer decision making at Pitt Park is recognisable as a moment of adherence to APP’s requirement to balance competing risks. “Ormeau Road is both an instance of accountability in action and the severe scrutiny officers face in every aspect of their operational duties. It is a shame when this serious business is trivialised into political ‘whataboutery’.” Societal isions which have persisted for generations in Northern Ireland can be overcome, and a more prosperous NI realised, through the healing of ided communities. But, he says: “Sinn Feacutein, with a perennially strategic leadership focussed on coherent tactics to deliver their primary goal of a united Ireland, will have no issue with undermining the police as and when doing so serves that goal. “Traditional unionism is caught in a tangle of unfavourable consequences for Northern Ireland, arising from it being on the wrong side of history when a majority of UK voters decided to exit the EU in . “It is under pressure from a growing cacophony for a border poll that even the Irish Government is seeking to quieten. “The rationale for calling upon the Chief Constable and his senior team to resign is remarkably incoherent and, so, may be related to the pressures unionism is under. “All told, traditional unionism and the DUP in particular is a more unpredictable actor but one, current evidence suggests, is more likely to undermine policing, however unwittingly. “Certainly, the spectacle of the DUP’s First Minister refusing to meet the Chief Constable is a bad look for moderate unionists and the community generally.” .  HEALING Solving these intractable problems can be done through proper community policing, according to Professor Mulqueen. He says: “The neighbourhood policing model, which Chief Constable Byrne and his team are implementing, may not have been designed for this purpose but it is, however uncomfortably, exposing the deficits of Northern Ireland’s tribal politics. “Neighbourhood policing is about empowering all communities within a ing country. So, by its nature, it creates tensions with the sectional goals of those who do not wish the country toas the Good Friday Agreement sets out or who wish it to merge into something . He continues: “Politicians must reconcile with their voters the harm that their political priorities are doing against the healthy potential of a policing model that serves all people, regardless of allegiance. “This is why I am optimistic: in Northern Ireland right now, there is an excellent policing model and there is a police leadership team clearly wedded to implementing it, despite continuous challenge. “PSNI has serious challenges to face, not least of which is its legitimacy among all communities. “The root problem, however, is not with policing. The problem is one of weak politics and the time it takes for that to mature or give way to the business of healing and building communities served by a dedicated police service.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There are smiles on the faces of the few people who are moving up and down the pavements. Approaching midday, the sun,not quite splitting the stones, is definitely causing them some discomfort. Traffic is almost constant. It comes through at a steady pace, the roar of passing lorries reverberating off Dungivens roadside shops and houses. A green and white ice cream van emblazoned with Super Mario rolls through the town. I can almost hear the theme tune in my head. googletag.cmd.push Dungiven Main Street curving down the hill. As I make my way up the hill, there is construction work going on in a few of the estates off Main Street. One man carefully removes paving stones in front of a set of flats. Further on, McReynolds Bar sits in forlorn darkness, mourning the loss of another sunny day in the beer garden. The towns other Covid-abandoned pubs would no doubt concur. The ornate gates of Gaelcholaacuteiste Dhoire are closed for Easter, but the sun illuminates the castle like a scene from a postcard. Across the street, the Kevin Lynch memorial has been spruced up, with Easter just around the corner. Political posters adorn street corners as parties jostle at the starting line ahead of next years Assembly election. googletag.cmd.push At the top of the town, traffic grinds to a halt, stled by road works that have created a narrow corridor of cones and warning signs. Heading back towards the town, I spot two people on a narrow laneway, seemingly in heated discussion. Both have puffy coats and woolly hats on, despite the strong sun, and there is a lot of finger-pointing. I decide to give them a wide berth. Passing through the town again, I notice the door to Inner Beauty is open. A glance in on the way past reveals a woman sitting cross-legged on the floor, with products strewn around her.     I have to go back. Road works at the top of the town are currently causing disruption. Claire McGill, who runs the skincare specialist salon, tells me she is preparing goodie bags to leave outside the salon for local children in place of their usual Easter celebrations. “Every Easter Saturday, we usually do an Easter egg hunt through the town, but Ive been closed since Christmas Eve,” she explains. “My customers are really running out of products now. Ive been doing deliveries, but to be honest, there is no profit in it, between time, effort and road works. “I did a delivery yesterday that was just to the top of the town and it took me over an hour. I only spoke to her for about two seconds at her front door too. Its a nightmare. “My phone hasnt stopped with people askingIm open today, because Ive had the shutter up doing this.” Claire says the latest period of lockdown has been a hard pull. Forced to seek the help of a local councillor in accessing government grant support, it still took a number of months. “I didnt get any grants because I dont have a rates bill in my name, so he got it all sorted. It took months, I only got my first one there in the middle of February, from October. ” she says. “I know everybody thinks getting pound a week when closed is fantastic, but firstly, its all taxable, so its only pound a week. “I have girls furloughed, so theres nothing left. My landlord is so decent, which is just as well, otherwise wed all be closed by now. “Were very lucky in the town that were in that everybody is very close,” she adds. Karen Groogan is looking forward to welcoming customers back in store. In an example of that close-knit community, Claire sends me across the street to meet Karen Groogan. Karen runs Groogans, a boutique clothes and fashion shop on the towns Main Street, and agrees with Claire that community support has been vital during this time. “In the run-up to Christmas, this year more than any other year, the town really got behind shopping local and it was brilliant,” she says. “Ive found this one has been harder for several dferent reasons. The weather has been a real downer and regarding shopping, I think people have been better prepared this year. “Last time I was able to help them out and ersy, selling things I wouldnt normally sell, whereas this time round, theyve had a houseful of stuff for their kids already.” Finvola keeps a watchful eye on Dungivens Main Street. As well as the dficulties associated with Covid, Karen is in two minds about the effect the new bypass will have on trade in the town. “I really dont know how its going to affect us. A lot of locals think its going to be a great thing for the town and encourage people to shop local,” she tells me. “I hope thats the way, but is there enough for them to shop local  We could really do with a good bakery, a good fruit and veg shop, but all those shops have closed because of the high rates. “Now were going to make the road to Derry even shorter. There is a feeling that when the town quietens down it will make people shop local, and I really hope thats true. “I do really well from passing trade though professional women going between Derry and Belfast for their work. They dont have the time to go shopping at the weekend and nor do they want to. “Whenever they come here, they know theyre going to get what they want. The girls that have come over the past four years know Im here, but its going to be hard to get any more girls like that. “Thats what I really worry about losing the passing trade. I really enjoy the company of them as well, so Im on the fence about whether or not it will be a good thing for the town.” Karens online trade has been good, but it doesnt replace the rapport she builds with her customers. “We do have a website, but I prefer to be open and able to sell things to people,” he says. “My shop is the kind of shop that you come in for one thing and you come out with more. Its a treasure trove. “Its got all sorts of dferent things school wear, home wear, childrens and ladies clothes, whereas it can be a bit limiting online.” The Roe sparkling in the March sun. Moving past the empty shop fronts at the bottom half of the town, your reward is the sight of the sun shimmering on the clear waters of the Roe. A young couple appear along its banks, ing from a ramble in the nearby fields. Throughout lockdown, people have rediscovered the beauty of their immediate surroundings. While the fine weather intensies dreams of normalitys , many will be hoping ambivalence to local nature spots will notwith it.

There are smiles on the faces of the few people who are moving up and down the pavements. Approaching midday, the sun,not quite splitting the stones, is definitely causing them some discomfort. Traffic is almost constant. It comes through at a steady pace, the roar of passing lorries reverberating off Dungivens roadside shops and houses. A green and white ice cream van emblazoned with Super Mario rolls through the town. I can almost hear the theme tune in my head. googletag.cmd.push Dungiven Main Street curving down the hill. As I make my way up the hill, there is construction work going on in a few of the estates off Main Street. One man carefully removes paving stones in front of a set of flats. Further on, McReynolds Bar sits in forlorn darkness, mourning the loss of another sunny day in the beer garden. The towns other Covid-abandoned pubs would no doubt concur. The ornate gates of Gaelcholaacuteiste Dhoire are closed for Easter, but the sun illuminates the castle like a scene from a postcard. Across the street, the Kevin Lynch memorial has been spruced up, with Easter just around the corner. Political posters adorn street corners as parties jostle at the starting line ahead of next years Assembly election. googletag.cmd.push At the top of the town, traffic grinds to a halt, stled by road works that have created a narrow corridor of cones and warning signs. Heading back towards the town, I spot two people on a narrow laneway, seemingly in heated discussion. Both have puffy coats and woolly hats on, despite the strong sun, and there is a lot of finger-pointing. I decide to give them a wide berth. Passing through the town again, I notice the door to Inner Beauty is open. A glance in on the way past reveals a woman sitting cross-legged on the floor, with products strewn around her.     I have to go back. Road works at the top of the town are currently causing disruption. Claire McGill, who runs the skincare specialist salon, tells me she is preparing goodie bags to leave outside the salon for local children in place of their usual Easter celebrations. “Every Easter Saturday, we usually do an Easter egg hunt through the town, but Ive been closed since Christmas Eve,” she explains. “My customers are really running out of products now. Ive been doing deliveries, but to be honest, there is no profit in it, between time, effort and road works. “I did a delivery yesterday that was just to the top of the town and it took me over an hour. I only spoke to her for about two seconds at her front door too. Its a nightmare. “My phone hasnt stopped with people askingIm open today, because Ive had the shutter up doing this.” Claire says the latest period of lockdown has been a hard pull. Forced to seek the help of a local councillor in accessing government grant support, it still took a number of months. “I didnt get any grants because I dont have a rates bill in my name, so he got it all sorted. It took months, I only got my first one there in the middle of February, from October. ” she says. “I know everybody thinks getting pound a week when closed is fantastic, but firstly, its all taxable, so its only pound a week. “I have girls furloughed, so theres nothing left. My landlord is so decent, which is just as well, otherwise wed all be closed by now. “Were very lucky in the town that were in that everybody is very close,” she adds. Karen Groogan is looking forward to welcoming customers back in store. In an example of that close-knit community, Claire sends me across the street to meet Karen Groogan. Karen runs Groogans, a boutique clothes and fashion shop on the towns Main Street, and agrees with Claire that community support has been vital during this time. “In the run-up to Christmas, this year more than any other year, the town really got behind shopping local and it was brilliant,” she says. “Ive found this one has been harder for several dferent reasons. The weather has been a real downer and regarding shopping, I think people have been better prepared this year. “Last time I was able to help them out and ersy, selling things I wouldnt normally sell, whereas this time round, theyve had a houseful of stuff for their kids already.” Finvola keeps a watchful eye on Dungivens Main Street. As well as the dficulties associated with Covid, Karen is in two minds about the effect the new bypass will have on trade in the town. “I really dont know how its going to affect us. A lot of locals think its going to be a great thing for the town and encourage people to shop local,” she tells me. “I hope thats the way, but is there enough for them to shop local  We could really do with a good bakery, a good fruit and veg shop, but all those shops have closed because of the high rates. “Now were going to make the road to Derry even shorter. There is a feeling that when the town quietens down it will make people shop local, and I really hope thats true. “I do really well from passing trade though professional women going between Derry and Belfast for their work. They dont have the time to go shopping at the weekend and nor do they want to. “Whenever they come here, they know theyre going to get what they want. The girls that have come over the past four years know Im here, but its going to be hard to get any more girls like that. “Thats what I really worry about losing the passing trade. I really enjoy the company of them as well, so Im on the fence about whether or not it will be a good thing for the town.” Karens online trade has been good, but it doesnt replace the rapport she builds with her customers. “We do have a website, but I prefer to be open and able to sell things to people,” he says. “My shop is the kind of shop that you come in for one thing and you come out with more. Its a treasure trove. “Its got all sorts of dferent things school wear, home wear, childrens and ladies clothes, whereas it can be a bit limiting online.” The Roe sparkling in the March sun. Moving past the empty shop fronts at the bottom half of the town, your reward is the sight of the sun shimmering on the clear waters of the Roe. A young couple appear along its banks, ing from a ramble in the nearby fields. Throughout lockdown, people have rediscovered the beauty of their immediate surroundings. While the fine weather intensies dreams of normalitys , many will be hoping ambivalence to local nature spots will notwith it. In Dungiven, the community has pulled together, and they will look to harness that spirit of regeneration after Covids bitter chapter is finally drawn to a close.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Theyd have known each other from the discos in Slaughtneil.” Club rivalry was parked. Joe asks himself how they all managed to pull in the same direction. But they did. That was the magic of it all. *** The late Paddy and Peggy Trolan moved from Brackagh, in Desertmartin, to settle in Draperstown with the building of Moykeeran in the sixties. Joe was one of nine children. There were four houses in a row, the Trolans, their neighbours Murrays, followed by Gormleys and the Mullans. The walk up the hill to Straw seemed like a daily pilgrimage, with the gear-bag slung over the shoulder. Pat Joe McKenna, Seamus Doherty and Laurence Groogan wouldve been preaching the hurling gospel. “Those lads wouldve kept you going every night,” remembers Trolan, goalkeeper in Ballinascreens  winning U hurling squad. After five years of school at St Colms, three months at St Patricks Maghera, while he liked it, told him he didnt have the appetite for A-Levels. His parents supported his decision to leave school. His talents at Draperstown Celtic saw him picked up by Irish League club Coleraine, he signed up for a YTS through the soccer. “It was in Castlereagh College, in the middle of East Belfast,” Trolan recalls. Hed later follow it up with a BTEC business course in Magherafelt Tech, but the soccer pathway gave him his first break. Twelve from the YTS scheme and a dozen from the similar programme in the south toured America in , competing against university sides. “We battered them all,” Trolan remembers. Of  or  of the travelling Irish party offered scholarships, he was the only one to accept. “I was like why not, my O-Levels were good enough to get me in...I just thought lets go and do it.” In September , it was off to Floridas Flagler College, a first step in his journeyed career through the education system. A month and a half spell in the summer of  was his longest stint back home. He was soon back across the pond, to Atlanta, for both a Degree and Masters in Sociology at Georgia State University, followed by a second masters, this time it was in sport. An absence of a soccer team and ato his GAA roots with the recently formed Clann na nGael club in Atlanta gave him the a first taste of the home from home feel to the association overseas. Half of Bantry, mixed with Cavan and Armagh exiles, saw the club flourish and compete at the North American Championships. “I remember us winning a Junior B hurling championship one year in Boston,” Trolan adds. “That was the time the boys flew out from home for a few months. Youd Burnsy ,McNicholl, Mickey Boyle and Ollie Collins. “Some would fly for Labour Day weekend, with others coming out before that and theyd be doing a bit of work. “Youd see them walking about with their Jordanstown and Queens shorts on,” Joe laughs. After eight years in Atlanta, it was ato Florida for Joe where he began his PhD at Florida State University in Tallahassee. “Its been so long now, I dont knowI ever will finish,” Joe laughs. This time, with no GAA, it was back to soccer for his sporting fix. Orlando began a hurling team, Tampa Bay and Augusta had started up, “There just wasnt the demand where we were,” he explains. “Now itis massive, there are regions and even four or five college hurling teams.” With his American leg coming to a close, in , it was time to get his foot on the employment ladder. *** Joe thanks his lucky stars for Banpo Banter, an interactive section of the Seoul Gaels website, named after a part of the city along the Han River where the club trained. In his mid-thirties, and with his studies behind him, it was time to enter the real world and three job offers sat on the table. Vermont and Maine, where the two American opportunities lay, didnt have a GAA club, but typing GAA in Korea into an internet search unlocked Joes future. As the messages and banter began to flow online, he liked what he saw and could feel the warmth. Seoul Gaels was founded in  by a group of Irish teachers who came over for the World Cup and the lestyle appealed to them enough to look for work and stay. “The lads sounded like they were up for a bit of craic,” Joe says with a smile. “That made my mind up, I am going to go to Korea...I wanted to get back playing. I said Ill go to Seoul, have a bit of craic for a year and go back to the US.” Joe in action during the Asian Gaelic Games. Now,  years on, he is still there and loving le. After an initial one-year contract, he is now Assistant Professor in Hankuk University, where he lectures in sports management, development and community. On the GAA front, he was Chairman of the Asian Board and still plays a role on the committee, as Assistant Development Officer. “I landed here in March , joined up with the Gaelic and soccer teams over Paddys Day,” Joe begins. Thats when the penny dropped of the magnitude of the Asian GAA community. The names begin to roll off his tongue. Japan, Shanghai, Singapore...they all had teams. Later that year, the Asian Games Gaels took place in Bangkok with  teams involved – men and women. At the heart of it was Derry native John Campbell who founded Thailand GAA two years earlier. “After that tournament I said Im staying in Asia,” beams Joe, one of over  Irish exiles in Seoul. “I got to meet people from Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Japan, Beijing, Hong Kong...everywhere. “That convinced me to stay, The university was fantastic, the people were great and as a bonus...the Gaelic was unreal.” The hurling was peripheral at the tournaments initially until an Irish influx – that included former Offaly player Gary Hannfy – saw the sport grow. Trolan describes Vietnam as a hotbed of all things GAA, with so many Irish are moving over. “We have  clubs in Asia,” he points out. “We dont realise how many people are out here until tournament time and then everybody comes out of the woodwork.” There are local tournaments, as well as the separate Southern and Northern Asian Gaelic Games. “For the main one, theAsian Gaelic Games, you are looking at over  people showing up and another couple of hundred who turn up to party and socialise...its a big deal,” said Trolan, a recent Hall of Fame winner, a trophy named after the late Brian Conlon from Newry-based First Derivatives, one of their sponsors. The games are seven minutes each way, with a two minute break in the middle. Friday night is the opening ceremony followed by wall to wall games on the Saturday. If you closed your eyes, it could be a GAA tournament anywhere in the world. By Sunday, the numbers are thinning out as the play-offs taper off towards the ious finals. “When you get knocked out, you start drinking and enjoying the craic,” Joe utters, with another infectious smile. On the Sunday night, the all you can eat and drink banquet has an annual fancy dress theme, with the Presidents of both the GAA and Ladies Football boards in attendance. An awards ceremony is factored into the festivities. “It is mayhem, but good mayhem,” Joe continues. “Last year we had Jack McCaffrey and Paul Mannion out, those two lads had a brilliant time and were blown away by the interest in GAA out here. “For us, it is all about the community, getting together and having a bit of fun, while making connections. It means where you go in Asia, you have someone to link in with and wed always meet up...thats what happens with the GAA.” At the tournaments, hed hear pockets of ex-pats conversing in Irish and was pleasantly surprised to hear the cúpla focal in areas of Seoul. While there is a bustling Irish community, a little under half the players would be non-Irish, a mixture of dferent nationalities. “On the womens side, there are a lot more locals playing because it is non-contact and players can pickoff the ground,” points out Trolan, who was Chairman of the Asian Board at the time the pick-up was taken out of the mens game. “We went to Croke Park and asked for a deviation and it was granted, so we kept it,” he explains. “It is one of the hardest skills for a lot of people and it was slowing the game down and frustrating a lot of the non-Irish, so we got rid of it.” Trolan speaks of locals playing the games in China and three or four of Seoul Gaels senior team being native Korean, a side that played in numerous finals. In another development, Trolan was central to starting a separate Youth Asian Gaelic Games, with around  players in action, at every age group from U to U. In Singapore, there is even a childrens officer going around schools and GAA is beginning to appear on the PE curriculum. “The lads in Hanoi have  Vietnamese kids out on a Saturday playing football,” Trolan states. Its tremendous progress. At the older age of the scale, the vibrant scene offers social football to everyone. Joe remembers joining in at Ballinascreen football training a few years back on a visit back home. “I was never so black and blue in my le. I forgot how fast it was and how hard people hit,” he laughs. “I am , there is a social hurling scene startingbutyou are over a certain age, there is not much there playing wise.” Seoul is dferent, with players continuing into their late fties with the junior teams, all for a bit of craic. Win or lose, there is a can of cold beer and banter on the sideline. Nobody is judged on their skill level or their physique. “The le is good here, the standard of living...even during the pandemic, le has been normal,” Joe admits. There were some restrictions, but no lockdown. Going to a restaurant or grabbing a coffee was the norm. He fits in a seven-mile run every day, with a longer one on Saturday and charges the batteries on a Sunday, as he gets himself primed for marathons. While he regrets not continuing to learn Irish in his younger years, he is trying his hand at Korean. The alphabet and reading it is easy, but speaking is a dferent story. “It is so hierarchical, with so many levels,” Joe concedes. “If we are out for a meal and I try to speak it, people will look at my wewanting to know what I am saying...so I pass the puck to her.” Joe and his we Helen during a trip to Shanghai. They live in the suburbs of Seoul, in Gwangju, close to work and a -minute bus journey from the city centre where the main university campus is. “We are surrounded by farmlands and I can smell slurry, its just like home,” he jokes. The transport network, he states, is the best in the world. Bus and train lines, all interlinked...you can get anywhere in the city for less than a fiver,” he continues. Will heto Ireland  If a similar job comes up at home, he might consider it. Growing up he never thought hed have ended up in America, let alone spend  years in Korea. “Now I am here, I dont know what will happen next, dont close the doors on opportunities,” he adds. Instead of Vermont or Maine, in small-town America, Joe ended up in a city of  million people. “I wouldve loved wherever I had ended up and had a good time,” Joe sums up. “But I am really glad I ended up in Seoul...with the football, hurling, getting involved in the Asian County Board and I met my we. It took me on a nice trajectory.” Thank God for Banpo Banter.\",\"keywords\":\"GAA,Joe Trolan,Seoul,Hurling,Ballinascreen,South Korea\",\"articleSection\":\"GAA\",\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"description\":\"Le has been a series of decisions and relocations around the world for Joe Trolan.

After studying in the USA, he spent  years in Seoul where sport still plays a huge role in his le and work. He spoke to Michael McMullan...The size of the ball may have ied, the continents have changed, but Joe Trolan and sport have never been far apart. His le has been defined by it. Growing up in Ballinascreen, his evenings pinged between football and hurling, stirred in with Draperstown Celtics soccer team. Dull moments were scarce. Now, he lectures in sport management in Seoul. The stamps accumulated on his passport have an interesting story to tell. As he navigated the globe, the former Derry minor hurling goalkeeper is a walking advert for the slogan fortune favours the brave, all with an infectious smile that radiates. The summer of  saw Peter Stevenson assemble a team to dance with the best that Irelands underage hurling landscape had to offer. All-Ireland champions Kilkenny exhaled palpable relief as Derry took them to the brink of a semi-final exit. googletag.cmd.push “I was a mad man in the changing room,” Trolan remembers of that Sunday morning in Croke Park. It took his next door neighbour in Moykeeran, Diarmuid Murray, to calm him down. On the pitch it was dferent. The bruises from being peppered by Geoffrey McGonagles shots in their practice matches that summer prepared him well. “He was an animal on the pitch,” Trolan recalls. “When we played games, as a keeper, I knew nothing could be worse than Geoffrey barrelling down at you.” Trolan was blown away by the natural skill of Mickey Collins and Rory Stevenson, a joy to watch. googletag.cmd.push At club level, he played behind Sean Farmer Kennedy and his thou shall not pass was the motto. If the ball got past him, the man wouldnt. “When you look at that Derry team, there were some serious headcases on it,” Trolan laughs. It was a team bus youd just love to have been on. He speaks of the mix of personalities. Rivalry, talent and laughter, all merged together. “When youd get Squidgyand Farmer together, they were lunatics. Theyd have known each other from the discos in Slaughtneil.” Club rivalry was parked. Joe asks himself how they all managed to pull in the same direction. But they did. That was the magic of it all.     *** The late Paddy and Peggy Trolan moved from Brackagh, in Desertmartin, to settle in Draperstown with the building of Moykeeran in the sixties. Joe was one of nine children. There were four houses in a row, the Trolans, their neighbours Murrays, followed by Gormleys and the Mullans. The walk up the hill to Straw seemed like a daily pilgrimage, with the gear-bag slung over the shoulder. Pat Joe McKenna, Seamus Doherty and Laurence Groogan wouldve been preaching the hurling gospel. “Those lads wouldve kept you going every night,” remembers Trolan, goalkeeper in Ballinascreens  winning U hurling squad. After five years of school at St Colms, three months at St Patricks Maghera, while he liked it, told him he didnt have the appetite for A-Levels. His parents supported his decision to leave school. His talents at Draperstown Celtic saw him picked up by Irish League club Coleraine, he signed up for a YTS through the soccer. “It was in Castlereagh College, in the middle of East Belfast,” Trolan recalls. Hed later follow it up with a BTEC business course in Magherafelt Tech, but the soccer pathway gave him his first break. Twelve from the YTS scheme and adozen from the similar programme in the south toured America in , competing against university sides. “We battered them all,” Trolan remembers. Of  or  of the travelling Irish party offered scholarships, he was the only one to accept. “I was like why not, my O-Levels were good enough to get me in...I just thought lets go and do it.” In September , it was off to Floridas Flagler College, a first step in his journeyed career through the education system. A month and a half spell in the summer of  was his longest stint back home. He was soon back across the pond, to Atlanta, for both a Degree and Masters in Sociology at Georgia State University, followed by a second masters, this time it was in sport. An absence of a soccer team and ato his GAA roots with the recently formed Clann na nGael club in Atlanta gave him the a first taste of the home from home feel to the association overseas. Half of Bantry, mixed with Cavan and Armagh exiles, saw the club flourish and compete at the North American Championships. “I remember us winning a Junior B hurling championship one year in Boston,” Trolan adds. “That was the time the boys flew out from home for a few months. Youd Burnsy ,McNicholl, Mickey Boyle and Ollie Collins. “Some would fly for Labour Day weekend, with others coming out before that and theyd be doing a bit of work. “Youd see them walking about with their Jordanstown and Queens shorts on,” Joe laughs. After eight years in Atlanta, it was ato Florida for Joe where he began his PhD at Florida State University in Tallahassee. “Its been so long now, I dont knowI ever will finish,” Joe laughs. This time, with no GAA, it was back to soccer for his sporting fix. Orlando began a hurling team, Tampa Bay and Augusta had started up, “There just wasnt the demand where we were,” he explains. “Now itis massive, there are regions and even four or five college hurling teams.” With his American leg coming to a close, in , it was time to get his foot on the employment ladder. *** Joe thanks his lucky stars for Banpo Banter, an interactive section of the Seoul Gaels website, named after a part of the city along the Han River where the club trained. In his mid-thirties, and with his studies behind him, it was time to enter the real world and three job offers sat on the table. Vermont and Maine, where the two American opportunities lay, didnt have a GAA club, but typing GAA in Korea into an internet search unlocked Joes future. As the messages and banter began to flow online, he liked what he saw and could feel the warmth. Seoul Gaels was founded in  by a group of Irish teachers who came over for the World Cup and the lestyle appealed to them enough to look for work and stay. “The lads sounded like they were up for a bit of craic,” Joe says with a smile. “That made my mind up, I am going to go to Korea...I wanted to get back playing. I said Ill go to Seoul, have a bit of craic for a year and go back to the US.” Joe in action during the Asian Gaelic Games. Now,  years on, he is still there and loving le. After an initial one-year contract, he is now Assistant Professor in Hankuk University, where he lectures in sports management, development and community. On the GAA front, he was Chairman of the Asian Board and still plays a role on the committee, as Assistant Development Officer. “I landed here in March , joined up with the Gaelic and soccer teams over Paddys Day,” Joe begins. Thats when the penny dropped of the magnitude of the Asian GAA community. The names begin to roll off his tongue. Japan, Shanghai, Singapore...they all had teams. Later that year, the Asian Games Gaels took place in Bangkok with  teams involved – men and women. At the heart of it was Derry native John Campbell who founded Thailand GAA two years earlier. “After that tournament I said Im staying in Asia,” beams Joe, one of over  Irish exiles in Seoul. “I got to meet people from Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Japan, Beijing, Hong Kong...everywhere. “That convinced me to stay, The university was fantastic, the people were great and as a bonus...the Gaelic was unreal.” The hurling was peripheral at the tournaments initially until an Irish influx – that included former Offaly player Gary Hannfy – saw the sport grow. Trolan describes Vietnam as a hotbed of all things GAA, with so many Irish are moving over. “We have  clubs in Asia,” he points out. “We dont realise how many people are out here until tournament time and then everybody comes out of the woodwork.” There are local tournaments, as well as the separate Southern and Northern Asian Gaelic Games. “For the main one, theAsian Gaelic Games, you are looking at over  people showing up and another couple of hundred who turn up to party and socialise...its a big deal,” said Trolan, a recent Hall of Fame winner, a trophy named after the late Brian Conlon from Newry-based First Derivatives, one of their sponsors. The games are seven minutes each way, with a two minute break in the middle. Friday night is the opening ceremony followed by wall to wall games on the Saturday. If you closed your eyes, it could be a GAA tournament anywhere in the world. By Sunday, the numbers are thinning out as the play-offs taper off towards the ious finals. “When you get knocked out, you start drinking and enjoying the craic,” Joe utters, with another infectious smile.

Ollie Higgins, grandson of Essential Design Group directors Oliver and Mandy Higgins, passed away in July  after a year-long battle with a sarcoma cancer of the diaphragm. A number of the Castledawson companys employees have now launched an initiative to raise funds for Clic Sargent and the Childrens Cancer Unit Charity, who were hugely supportive during Ollies illness. The initiative coincides with the groups th year in business, and participants will be challenged to complete , steps every day during April. Donations will be collected online via Virgin Money and the public are encouraged to join in the action. googletag.cmd.push Rebecca Higgins, Ollies aunt, and Essential Designs Marketing Manager, said the -year-old was a little ball of energy. “He was such a happy-go-lucky wee boy, he wanted to be outside all the time playing,” she told the County Derry Post. “He did go through his chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and was fantastic through it. You wouldnt have known to look at him that he was going through treatment. “Unfortunately, though, he relapsed in April  and he was taken back into hospital. Then he was given a terminal diagnosis at the end of May, the day before his th birthday.” Both the chosen charities have been instrumental in helping the Higgins and Randlesome families through such a heartbreaking time. googletag.cmd.push Rebecca said Clic Sargents home from home initiative was a saving grace. “You get your own room, but its a shared house. Ours was called Pauls House. It is right across the road from the Royal Victoria Hospital,” she said. “It meant that when he was given his terminal diagnosis, the whole family could stay. We would have stayed with Ollie until late at night, and then we would have walked across the road. “We lived an hour away from the hospital, so it was fantastic to be able to stay up and spend every minute we could with him because we knew he was going to pass away soon.”     The family also wanted to support the Childrens Cancer Unit Charity, who also helped support them throughout the experience. A squad from the Coachman, Magherafelt, in their #littlehulk T-shirts. The charity provided Ollies sister Lucy with a memory box and helped provide opportunities for him to enjoy precious days out before he passed away. “Ollie wasnt allowed in crowds, we couldnt even take him to a coffee shop for his lunch, so they rented out places and got them all cleaned before the children came to that place. “It meant they could have days out where it was safe, and along with children who were going through the same thing as them. “They also did what was called the beads of courage. Each bead represents something Ollie went through, chemotherapy for example, and there are dferent-coloured beads for them.” While the company had ordered a number of T-Shirts, the huge interest and support from within their community for Ollies memory has meant they have already run out. Emblazoned on the T-shirts is the #littlehulk hashtag, a reference to Ollies nickname. Its meaning is twofold. “He absolutely loved the Hulk. He had a wee Hulk figurine and he carried him everywhere,” said Rebecca. “Thats how he got his nickname, but then he sailed through his treatment and was doing so well, so everybody said he was strong like the Hulk. “He loved Polepatrick too, we used to take him and he loved walking around through the forest, so thats why we chose Polepatrick as his resting place.” Donations can currently be made by searching for Ollie Higgins on Virgin Money, or by contacting Essential Design Group directly. Anyone taking part in the , steps per day challenge is also asked to post their pictures and videos on social media, using the #littlehulk hashtag in memory of Ollie.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Last week, the Derry News revealed that the local school has launched a fundraising appeal to gather the pound, it owes the DE. Foyle College is a co-educational Voluntary Grammar School which has been providing a high-quality education for young people in the city and surrounding area for over  years. It is understood that the debt has to be repaid by the end of June or the school risks losing its Voluntary Grammar status and by extension its independence. googletag.cmd.push The DE was asked to confirm the date by which the debt has to be paid, what formula is used to decide how much the DE got from the sale of the old Foyle College lands and the potential ramicationsthe money cannot be gathered. In response, a DE spokesperson said: “As per normal procedures with schools, the Department is continuing to work with Foyle College to secure repayment of funds related to their move to the new site at Limavady Road.” Following the publication of last weeks article in the Derry News, a former pupil of Foyle College who is now living in Canada got in touch with the paper to encourage people ‘from around the world’ to help the local school. googletag.cmd.push In , Foyle College moved around  pupils from its home on Duncreggan Road and Northland Road to a new ‘state of the art’ campus on Limavady Road. The DE purchased the site and building. However, to allow pupils to attain the ‘first class’ academic, athletic and artistic standards it has set, the local College invested in additional facilities including sports pitches and extra classrooms. These enhanced facilities came at a cost of pound.m. Around poundm of that cost was covered by a previous fundraiser while the school awaited the final figures for the sale of its former campuses. It has since emerged that DE sold the original lands for pound.m.     According to Foyle College, the department retained pound.m of that for grants it previously awarded to the old school sites. That means pound.m was available to the school, leaving a deficit of pound,. In correspondence with alumni and friends of the school, the College says DE’s figures are based on ‘clawing back’ money that has been spent on a school prior to its new build. It reads: “Because the school has received grants from DE over the past  years to fund capital items at Springtown and Duncreggan, legislation provides that DE claw back a proportion of these grants against any sale proceeds from land owned by the school.” Foyle College is asking friends of the school to help raise pound, by June .  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Bombscares,Benficaand theBrandywell Stadium. This is the story of a community that needed to catch a breakand how its football club, exiled from the league for more than a decade, was brought back from the dead. TheBrandywellwas one of the poorest areas in Europe and home to Derry City Football Club. In the shadow of the civil rightsmovementand the Troubles, the club managed to keep playing. Until one day when the team bus of Ballymena United was caught up in the violence, taken away and burned. The ramications would eventually see Derry City FC banned from playing at home andput out of business. googletag.cmd.push A newco-commission fromBBC Northern Irelandand BBC Two,Dferent League: The Derry City Story,charts the extraordinary journey of onecommunity as they found a haven away from the violence and a taste of success like never before. Sometimes football can change the world. In , when times were bleak,the cityneeded a saviour. Tony O’Doherty was a Northern Ireland international who had played against England at Wembley. He teamed up with another international,Terry Harkin, and two other professionals Eddie Mahon and Eamonn McLaughlin,to become the ‘Gang of Four’ who challenged the status quo. They made it their goal to get senior football back in their hometown. googletag.cmd.push An incidental chat in a city centre shoe shop, managed by Terry, over some lunchtime sandwiches would change everything. With repeated rebuffs from the Irish League in Belfast to their requests to gain re-entry, the four lads decided to take their footballing revolutionsouth – to the League of Ireland in Dublin. They had no premises and no money. But they did have the phone number for a manager called Jim McLaughlin. Brought up in theBrandywell,Jim brought his team Shamrock Rovers to theBrandywellto play a makesht team of amateurs rounded up to play as Derry FC. The crowds flocked to the ground and the Gang were able to show that there was an appetite for football in Derry. It was time to cross the border and bring their big idea to the salubrious surroundings of the Burlington Hotel in Dublin.     The triumph-over-the-odds film, directed by local director Guy King and made for the BBC by State Of Grace Films and Stray Bear Films, follows the emotional storyof how in September , after  years in the wilderness, football was back at theBrandywell. The club would go on to lt silverware and lt the spirits of the city, unleashing a carnival of hope, pride and optimism. Featuring in-depth interviews with the Gang of Four, never-before-seen archive footage and the memories of the faithful supporters, the film portrays an inspirational bunch of people who made their dreams come true. The rollercoaster took their club and community from the depths of despair to footballing nirvana, landinganhistoric domestic treble in the League of Ireland. It would culminate with the arrival of football royalty with Sven-Goran Eriksson bringing hisBenficateam of superstars into the heart of the Bogside for a European Cup tie.

The Martin Property Group had applied to build a six-storey building on a vacant plot on Northland Road between Clarence Avenue and the Magee campus of Ulster University. The building would have incorporated a total of  social housing apartments –  two-bedroom apartments and seven one-bedroom properties. A number of residents in the area lodged objections to the plans. They said that some sections of the apartment complex would overlook their homes and also highlighted that there would no parking spaces at the apartments. Planning officers with Derry City and Strabane District Council have completed a report into the application. googletag.cmd.push The report recommends that the planning application be refused. However, the final decision on the planning applications rests with councillors on the councils Planning Committee. The application for the Northland Road apartments will be discussed at a meeting next week of the Planning Committee. In the planning report, a council officer says that an original application for the apartments was amended after planning officials had initial concerns regarding its scale and design. The report said that the revised design had taken better account of the character of the area. However, the planning officers said that they would still recommend that the application be refused. googletag.cmd.push In the report conclusions, the officers said the proposed development would impact on existing on-street parking. The report also claimed that the apartments would have a negative impact on the future of a protected tree on the nearby Magee campus.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Raineys Director of Rugby is delighted. Theyve got their man. After a selection process, attracting many candidates, Ian McKinleys credentials elevated him to top of the pile. One thing the Rainey players will know, beyond anything  he brings to the table, their new Head Coach has experienced adversity and came through the other side. Real adversity, the sort that stops most. But not Ian McKinley. Loss of sight in his left eye forced him to tell Leinster coach Joe Schmidt he could no longer play. Leinster stood by him, offered him a shoulder to lean on long enough to secure a coaching role in Italy. googletag.cmd.push Once there, a new set of goggles and the unrelenting support of his family saw him find an avenue back to a playing career that saw him play to a level where he could retire again. This time was dferent, it was on his own terms. It was always sport for Ian McKinley. His father Horace was captain of both Trinity College Dublin and Old Wesley rugby teams, his mother Pam played hockey. The youngest of four, began his sporting adventure on the Gaelic field, at the age of nine, with leading Dublin club Kilmacud Crokes. When the club won a first ever All-Ireland U Feacuteile title in , Ian was centre back. Behind in the corner was Rory OCarroll who would later pick up two All-Stars as part of Dublins all-conquering blue wave. The fulcrum of the attack was none other than Ireland rugby international Ian Madigan. googletag.cmd.push “That was by background, even though I always wanted to play rugby,” McKinley points out. The back garden of the family home was a haven for kicking goals and scoring tries, but it wasnt until he went to secondary school that his rugby came on the radar. St Columbas College wasnt a rugby superpower, but it gave Ian a footing. He played Gaelic football for Dublin underage teams as far as U, before it was time to decide which route to go down “I made a decision in my last year of school, which way to go and my heart was with rugby,” points out Ian, who was awarded a rugby scholarship at UCD.     The day after his last exam in St Columbas, near the home and close to Dublins Marlay Park, he was accepted into the Leinster Rugby Academy and trained with stars like Brian ODriscoll. “Youd be training with the boys youd been watching on telly for the last  years,” he added. “It was a baptism of fire and you have to learn fairly quickly.” Just when all the pieces of the puzzle were slotting into place, a freak injury in UCDs top of the table clash, at home to Lansdowne, turned Ians world upside down. “I got a boot from my teammate who stamped on my face, his stud went into my eye and burst my eyeball. It was a strange one to say the least”, he recalls. After being rushed to hospital, he received emergency surgery and remained there for a week. “The surgeon was incredible,” states Ian, who had  percent of the sight back in his eye inside six months and was back training with Leinster ahead of the new season. There was another setback to follow. In his documentary Look Beyond, on Amazon Prime, Ian recalls going to kick a conversion after a Leinster try and the ball being more fuzzy than normal. It was a result of a developing cataract and later a detached retina left him, at the age of , with no vision in his left eye. “I spoke with Joe Schmidt and said I cant continue as my eye was really sore and to play out-half with  percent vision would be too tricky,” adds Ian. Getting his good eye gouged on the first game of his comeback led to the alarm bells ringing. “I thought I am never going to step onto a rugby field again without protecting my eyes. Rugby is a big part of my le, but it is not my whole le.” Ian is thankful for Leinster who kept him on board with work experience where he got a taste for coaching some of the junior teams. He loved coaching, but playing was the ultimate goal, the childhood dream of playing in the garden, thinking of playing on the big stage. “Thats what was eating me up, not fulfilling my potential...to stop at  was pretty hard,” he said. *** It was time for a fresh start. New Zealand or Australia would be too far, but he just wanted to get away from Ireland, somewhere completely dferent. The call came from Udine close to the Italian border with Slovenia. Leonorso offered him an opportunity to coach. His girlfriend Cordelia Mulholland, now his we, travelled with him on a new chapter in their le. “It just seemed like a chance to learn a new language, to how rugby is viewed...I fell in love with the place, I still love the place,” explains Ian. The weather, food and wine werent bad either. In , following a conversation with his brother Philip, thoughts flickered to the possibility of prototyping rugby goggles. By January the following year, Ian had acquired the first pair and was keen to test them out. On a wet night in action for Leonorso, the goggles passed the test. His muck-clad body was irrelevant, Ian was back playing rugby on a night of redemption. As his form picked up, semi- professional side Viadana came calling and hed later become the clubs captain. Hed later play PRO rugby with Zebre, before getting snapped up with Benetton Treviso. McKinleys meandering path had also met another roadblock. France, England and Ireland didnt accept the goggles as being safe for use. Zebre were due to play a game in Ireland, but a letter of request, to weaar the goggles, was rejected. It was time for clan McKinley to join forces on a campaign of meetings, petitions and ious appeals before eventually getting the goggles over the line and accepted. “They give me confidence that nothing was going to happen to my other eye,” Ian states. “It made my vision a little bit worse...the padding meant I could see  degrees less. People think it enhanced my vision, it made it worse.” There was time for one more step. Having played three years in Italy and while having played for and captained Ireland Us, he didnt play senior and was eligible for the Italian national team. With a nine-game losing streak hanging over them, Italian boss, the former Ireland player, Conor OShea handed McKinley his international debut against Fiji. Leading -, he marked his first outing with a late penalty in one of nine international appearances. Another one was against his native Ireland the following year in Chicagos Soldier Field. When his contract with Treviso expired last year and thoughts turned to the future. He now lives in Cordelias native Bellaghy. The couple welcomed their son Malachy into the world last December. On the rugby front, McKinley – who had spent time coaching under John Andrew at both Ballymena and Rainey - began to ponder. Was  his last dance  “It is not something you think of all of a sudden, it is your whole livelihood, it takes over your le,” he said of his decision to retire a second and final time. “All you can focus on is getting your body right, your mind right for the week. There is no rest time and you are constantly on the go. “It was something I reflected on,” Ian continued. “I said to myself when I initially went back and played and was lucky enough to play rugby a second time, I wanted to retire on my own terms and at as high a level as I possibly can.” Champions Cup. PRO. Six Nations. Those three boxes have been ticked, with the landscape around the next corner uncertain. “I can be very content with whats happened,” he sums up. “The biggest thing is that you have thousands of players using these goggles now...which has been the biggest triumph out of all of this. You have kids and adults that are now participating in rugby, which has been amazing.” Retiring is never easy. But McKinley has never been one to sit still. Monday, April  and getting Rainey out in groups of  to begin training for the new season is the next step. The new adventure excites him. “Its nice, having been in a professional environment since  , to go back to grass-roots rugby, to touch base again with why you started rugby,” he concludes. Rainey have made quite the catch.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Defeats to Longford and Waterford have placed the Candystripes under mounting pressure as they head to unbeaten Pat’s looking for a reversal in fortunes. It could well be a defining few days for Derry City, who travel to Inchicore before ing to the Brandywell on Tuesday to face league champions Shamrock Rovers. Their poor start, whilst unexpected, could well be forgotten with a goodover the next few days and defender Danny Lupano is adamant that results will come because of the determination and the talent in the squad at present. googletag.cmd.push “We can’t keep thinking about the two losses, we have to move forward and think about the next game, focus on the next game,” he insisted. “I believe in our group. We have good players and we have good chemistry. Some of the players don’t really know each other yet but we’re getting to know each other and I believe once we get going and once we get those three points and get that momentum, I believe the team will be flying. “Everyone is positive that things will be fine. The people can see that the performance against Waterford compared to the first game of the season was so dferent in terms of the application and the hunger. Everything was much better so everyone has to stay positive and thinking about going down to St. Pat’s and getting a result.” googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

While it seemed the rebuild of the R would take signicantly longer than the father and son team anticipated, Car SOS changed all that after Brianrsquos daughter, Libby, contacted the programme makers who were quick to realise the signicance and history of the car the McKay family now owned.Gerard said the road to the Car SOS reveal at the Millbrook Lodge Hotel in Ballynahinch at the end of last summer began in  when a family friend alerted them to the whereabouts of the iconic car mdash which was lying on its side mdash in a scrapyard in Crossmaglen.ldquoWe did not know the full history of the car at this stage, but we did know that it was famous across Ireland as it was driven by John Moloney, whom I used to watch driving it at Mondello Park when I was much younger, he explained.ldquoJohn was was very successful and won a number of Irish Rally Championships with the R which was one of the first of its kind to compete in Ireland.ldquoWhen Dad and I bought the car it was a shell. I had always wanted to get my hands on Moloneyrsquos red and white R and was delighted to discover it was the very one that we now owned. While it needed major surgery, I was nonetheless delighted to have a car with such pedigree. However, we did not know the full history of the R at that stage.Gerard explained that when the car was brought home, neither he nor his father knew about the link with David Gillanders and what R they really had on their hands.ldquoA family friend from Leitrim, Eamonn McAleenan, initially told us about the car and when we got it back to Loughinisland he told us it was famous. When we replied, lsquoWe know, it was John Moloneyrsquosrsquo, Eamonn said, lsquoNo, I mean it is really famousrsquo and revealed that it was David Gillanders car. We couldnrsquot believe it.ldquoThe rally community is very small and everyone knows about cars, where they came from and who owned and drove them. When Moloney racedthe car it was probably the talk of the country as it was an Austin Rover works car, but when we hauled it out of the scrapyard we had no idea what we had really bought.Gerard said his father knew who Eamonn was talking about and recalled seeing images of the car in the Motoring News magazine.ldquoWe did our homework and, sure enough, it was Gillanderrsquos R and we had this confirmed by someone inEngland who is something of an expert in the MGcars. We knew that we had the real deal, he continued.ldquoA mechanical manual came with the car which would help us get it back on the road again. It was pre-Facebook at this stage but when I put a photo of the car on the internet, it literally exploded with messages.ldquoIt is hard to believe that the car was in a scrapyard for  years. When we bought it in , the car had been stripped for parts and the shell was getting tired. When we got to the scrapyard it had been sitting on top of some tyres but had fallen over on to its side.Gerard said he was ldquodoing handstands as he had got his hands on Moloneyrsquos car, explaining that being the owner of the vehicle with his father ldquowas the ultimate for him. He said when he put the car on the internet many people commented that they thought Gillanders car had been lost.When it came to rebuilding the car, Gerard and his father had the engine, gearbox and two out of the three dfs. They ended up getting a third from a Peugeot  they purchased.With Gerard moving to England for five years, no work was done on the car which was left in a garage with a cover over it, but in  the R was moved from Loughinisland to his garage in Castlewellan.ldquoDad was a mechanic and I am a joiner by trade while another friend of mine, Frank McMullan, helped with the bodywork. We got the shell back into shape and then started getting the  on but Dad then had a stroke so the work stopped. For me, there were more important things to worry about. That was fine as restoring the R was always going to be a long-term project anyway. It was labour of love.Just weeks before last yearrsquos lockdown, Fuzz and Tim rocked up to take the R back to England for its makeover after being contacted by Gerardrsquos sister and with the team one week away from completing the job, work had to stop due to Covid-.ldquoIncredibly, the work on the car was completed within about six weeks as a -strong team was working on it. They also had a very firm foundation to start with which helped, Gerard explained.In the build-up to the big reveal, the McKay family was due to go to England at the end of last March, but this wasnrsquot possible due to lockdown restrictions, so the unveiling was put on hold until last August.However, Brian and Gerard had no idea what was happening and arrived at the Millbrook Lodge Hotel for a family meal. And they couldnrsquot believe their luck when they saw David Gillanders sitting in the reception area.They told the rally driver that they owned his car and when they all went outside and saw a television crew and Fuzz rocking up in the gleaming R, they thought it was a programme involving the famous Scottish driver.ldquoI recognised Tim right away as Dad and I watch Car SOS and was not surprised to see him as I thought everything was focused on Gillanders. Then Tim spoke to Dad and I by name which really threw me. Then he said it was our car.ldquoIt was a pretty surreal moment and when we got to take the car for a drive it was incredible. The heat and noise of one of the most powerful rally car engines on the planet sitting over your left shoulder is an amazing feeling.ldquoWhat we now have is a museum quality car which is incredible and it certainly wonrsquot be raced. We will take it to shows and maybe some demonstration runs, but that will be it. Its competition days are over.Gerard added: ldquoThe reveal of the car was very emotional for Dad who thought all his Christmases had come at once. The R is everything we expected and more. Dad thought he would never have seen the car finished and is running about ashe is  again.ldquoI always thought that one day I would have been able to get the car back on the road as a petrol head never gives up on his dream. While I am sure I would have achieved my goal, what the Car SOS team has done is miraculous.ldquoWe are just a normal family which is car mad. Fuzz and Tim are gentlemen and a pleasure to work with. They are so down to earth and we canrsquot thank them or the Car SOS team enough. They were brilliant..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/7Apr2021-Coach.jpg","title":"Coach Conor gets call up  ","story":"KILLYLEAGH goalkeeper Conor Brennan has been helping Northern Irelandrsquos U-s in a training camp ahead of their Euro qualiers later this year.The Glasgow Rangers Academy goalkeeping coach was drafted into newly appointed manager Gerard Lyttlersquos set-up after former Manchester United lsquokeeper Roy Carroll was required for duties with the senior squad.ldquoGerard gave me a ring to seeI could fly over from Scotland after Roy got the call up to help with the seniors, he said.ldquoI spoke to Rangers as I obviously am firstly employed with them, but they were more than happy for me to move on over. Therersquos three lads in the international team who are also on Rangers U- set up so I could keep an eye on them as well.Brennanwho also plays for East Kilbride FC in Scotlandrsquos Lowland Football League, joined the back room staff to help benefit the U- team after their Euro campaign was cancelled due to the Covid- pandemic.The team was set to play three qualiers in Sweden throughout March but those were cancelled. The camp was used ahead of the sides Euro  qualiers which take place in October.ldquoI was analysing what the team could do. A lot of stuff I was doing with them wasvery basic, such as handling and reflex drills. Some people may think that they should be the best in the country at their age but we are in the middle of a pandemic so its important to have that in your mind.ldquoNot all of the team are getting the game time they need through no fault of their own.The recent camp lasted from Monday to Friday, with manager Lyttle drafting in fellow countryman and former Rangers defender Gareth McAuley alongside the Killyleagh custodian.ldquoGarethrsquos experience and his calibre was great for the lads, they all grew up watching him play and now hersquos looking ahead to mould the future said Brennan.ldquoThe U-s are trying to get a few friendlies alongside a few training camps to keep busy. Gerard is trying to bring new players and staff together to see what the people are about. Having Gareth involved in the team is a no brainer.Brennan had the opportunity to work with promising young goalkeepers Conor Manderson from Portsmouth FC, and Dungannon Swtsrsquo Conner Bryne during the camp.Northampton Townrsquos Dylan Berry had to withdrawal from the camp after being called up to his clubrsquos senior team.ldquoThe young lsquokeepers are showing a lot of promise, this is why Gerard arranged the camp, Brennan continued. We want them to develop into future senior team internationals and have them playing at the highest level possible.As for the Killyleagh man himself, Brennan highlighted his aspirations for both his own playing and coaching career.ldquoI want to continue to keep doing as I am doing. People forget because of my coaching that I am still a player. I still enjoy the feeling of getting out on the pitch and playing. Irsquom only , soi play my cards right I could be playing for at least another ten years.Scotlandrsquos Lowland League recently made the decision to end this season on a points per game basis after discussions with the Scottish FA took place.ldquoI am disappointed that the season at East Kilbride ended. It was a real sickener as we were going to give it a right good go, but ultimately what can we do. The club has been brilliant for me and I definitely want to get back there next season.Brennan has gone from strength to strength with Rangers as he enters his fourth coaching season at the Glasgow club.ldquoIts going really well at my forth season at Rangers. In terms of my set up, Irsquom the U- goalkeeping coach and itrsquos a job I love doing and Irsquom passionate about it.ldquoI was the youngest in the UK to have my Uefa goalkeeping A licence, so that was a big help in attracting Rangers.ldquoI am currently completing my outfield Uefa A licence which will add another string to my bow and I eventually aim to have a Uefa pro A licence a few years down the line.Brennan has left his door open for any future offers to assist with the international squad, insisting he is happy to help in any way he can where possible..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/7Apr2021-Engineer.jpg","title":"Engineer was legend in motor sport  ","story":"JAMES Nathaniel Brown served his apprenticeship at Stewartrsquos Motor Works in Downpatrick before the Second World War, later moving to work for the former Ulster Transport Authority.In late  he opened his Antrim Road garage in Ballynahinch with a loan from a family friend and what a sound investment it proved to be, spawning a long and distinguished family connection with motorcycle sport of ious types.Not long after his business opened, James Nathaniel Brown mdash or JN as he was affectionately known mdash developed a business and social relationship with the Herron family from Leitrim, outside Castlewellan.And the sports connection evolved from here when Jimmy and Wilfred Herron began to take an interest in competition in the form of grass track racing, with JN putting his considerable engineering skills to good use in preparing the machinery for the brothers.However, the grass tracking phase was fairly short lived, with the Herron boys turning their attention to road racing and Jimmy consistently obtaining good results, But he was somewhat outshone by Wilfred who in his first season in  developed at a spectacular pace, going from novice to a force to be reckoned with.The swtness of his rise through the ranks is illustrated by the result from the  North West  road race when, riding a cc Gold Star BSA, he finished third behind very distinguished international company in the shape of Jackie Wood and Bob Brown, the Australian who later rode works Matchless, Gilera and Honda machinery.Later that same year a Norton Featherbed was acquired just after the TT and, some six weeks later, Wilfie was in a stunning fth place in the World Championship Ulster Grand Prix when a split petrol tank forced race officials to black flag him with several laps to go.Wilfie subsequently finished that season tied on points with Louis Carter for the Walter Rusk trophy which was in effect the Irish road-race championship, with Jimmy backing this effort up by finishing fourth in the championship which covered all classes.In , Wilfie confirmed this form was no fluke by winning the Irish Championship, including a fth place finish at the Ulster Grand Prix to score two world championship points. He then repeated the feat in , scoring consistently all over Ireland.At this stage, Jimmy was always a top contender in the cc class and along with brother Wilfie the duo were a force to be reckoned with.The speed and reliability of the brothersrsquo machinery during this spell was clear proof of JN Brownrsquos meticulous approach to preparation and outstanding ability in the tuning stakes, establishing a reputation whichwas to be enhanced over the following years.From  on, business pressures enforced a break from competition for the Herron brothers but JNrsquos enthusiasm was undiminished and he turned his attention to the grass track and motocross scene and it was during this phase that he became more and more involved with engine development, compared to just preparation.JN began this era with a youngster by the name of Mervyn McConkey who would progress to legendary status in grass track and scrambling history, becoming Irish champion in every capacity class available. A feat that no one has ever matched.The machine chosen for this venture was the Triumph Tiger Cub, the cc class being very popular in Ireland for all types of racing and where the legendary Joey Dunlop started his illustrious career.McConkey showed great potential right from the word go and within weeks of his first race was starting to win on a regular basis. Indeed, before long he was a top contender in the cc, cc, cc and cc classes and there were occasions when he won every race he entered at a given meeting, with a seasonrsquos tally of wins almost topping the  mark.All this was of course greatly helped by JN Brownrsquos engine tuning and modication programme, with the development aspect of his activities accelerated with the acquisition of a cc BSA C-.Indeed, so successful was the Brown McConkey alliance that results came to the notice of the BSA factory in the shape of the companyrsquos competitions department manager Brian Martin, with whom JN established a successful and long-lived development partnership.The factory C-s were being successfully campaigned by future world champion Jeff Smith and Saturday afternoon scrambles were regularly televised on BBCrsquos Grandstand programme.JN would send to the factory details of modications which had proved successful in Ireland and, of course,something was tried and failed in Ireland then the factory avoided any adverse publicity. Over the followings number of seasons BSA quietly supplied free machinery each season for use as a development test bed.In addition, JN also began a series of specials by increasing engine capacities, using the time honoured lsquobitzarsquo method of adapting separate parts of other engines to alter bore and stroke measurements and so achieve the desired capacity.Examples of this process were cc and cc specials, both of which were successfully campaigned by McConkey and his son Junior Brown.The BSA factory was kept informed and developed the works machinery along similar lines in terms of cylinder capacities used. The high point of factory development came with Jeff Smith becoming World Champion in  and again in , with both championships achieved using cc engines which confirm the signicant input from the Ballynahinch engineer.The next chapter in JNrsquos story emanated in a roundabout way from the USA.Triumph had long had a large part of their export sales in America whose major race was the prestigious Daytona  which had become something of a Harley Davidson benefit, with the manufacturer taking  successive wins from  onwards.SuccessThis success was largely attributable to Harleyrsquos capacity advantage in running cc machines, whereas the overhead valve equipped opposition were restricted to a cc limit.Triumph dealers in America began pressing the factory for some more race development on the T model being used at Daytona, but this request received a cool reception from MD Edward Turner.Luckily enough, Triumphrsquos head of development, the brilliant Doug Hele, took up the gauntlet and with his dedicated team and working largely in their own time, undertook the race development work.They eventually reached the stage where they scooped the  and  Daytona events with riders Gary Nixon and Buddy Elmore and the production T was re-christened the Daytona model. Further work enabled Percy Tait to record podium places in the World Championship Grand Prix series.Back in Ballynahinch, JN began to see this as a challenge and reckoned he could do as well as the factory, or maybe even better.His son, John, bought a second-hand T for his father to work his magic on and, to house the engine, a frame and cycle parts from a  World Championship winning cc Mondial were bought from George Purvis. It subsequently transpired that George had actually rebuilt the frame. After considerable development work had been carried out performance figures were indeed impressive with the motor producing approximately  BHP at , RPM, comparing very favourably with the fully race designed and developed Manx Norton and Matchless G engines favoured by the majority of top riders of that era.Consider also that the published factory figures for the  T production bike was  BHP at , RPM, with top speed quoted as  MPH ndash the Brown racer, pulling a tall gearing, could hit mph.JNrsquos work paid off in quite spectacular fashion at the  Tandragee  where Mervyn McConkey finished second to the late great Brian Steenson on a G Seely and ahead of that seasonrsquos cc Irish road race champion on a Manx Norton mdash not a bad result for a grass  scrambles specialist using a production based engine.Some year later, I spoke to road racer Ian McGregor. Ian was small in stature, but huge in his racing achievements and said he loved riding that bike as it was small enough to be comfortable for his size, handled well and was very quick.For the following three or four seasons, the Triumph was ridden, with ying degrees of success, by a number of top road racers including Wilfie Herron, Tom Herron Whilst the machine was undoubtedly very quick and handled well, it proved to be a bit fragile. Hardly surprising, considering the very advanced state of tune applied to what was still basically a production roadster.In  Wilfie bought a Norton Commando for competition in the recently introduced cc class. He approached JN with a view to having the Brown magic applied to the preparation of the machine and this wasduly carried out, once again to startling effect.The combination which had proved so successful nearly  years before resumed in full swing. For the following couple of seasons Wilfie was once again the man to beat in his chosen class with a record of something like  wins from  races over this outstandingly successful period.Through the late s, the development of two-stroke machinery drove on and expanded into the higher capacity classes so successfully that it became a near impossibility to campaign a four-stroke with any hope of consistent success.Having been a dedicated four-stroke fan for so many years, the two-stroke dominance was almost an anathema to JN and, after a brief spell working with a Bultaco Pursang, he drted from active participation in the motorcycling scene, but did continue with some consultancy work with Cosworth regarding F car engines.In the late seventies and eighties JN and my brother, John, sponsored my rallycross sprint hillclimb Mini. With development help from JN, I was fortunate to quickly become a front runner. JN always said that % of winning is done in the workshop before the race meetings on the Saturday.In later years JN became great friends with Keith Duckworth, the English mechanical engineer famous for designing the Cosworth double four valve per cylinder engine and cylinder head. Jim was also great friends with Sir Frank Williams and Sir Patrick Head, who was technical director of the Williams F team.JN was also great friends with the Rev Harold Good who later became Moderator of the Methodist Church in Ireland, with the Brown family running motorsport events at Martinrsquos Quarry and McCormackrsquos Quarry in the eighties in Ballynahinch in aid of the local Methodist church building fund.Sadly, for the last two or three years of his le JN had dementia and found things dficult given the active le he had lived.His funeral in  was one of the largest ever seen at Lough Inch Cemetery in Ballynahinch and was attended by motorcyclists from far and near. Also in attendance and Formula  greats like Sir Frank Williams, Sir Patrick Head and Keith Duckworth.I will always remember JN as a great innovative pioneering engineer who was fired by his own initiative. The likes we will never see again.Meanwhile, the Brian Steenson Memorial Group is planning to have a chat show and talk about the le and work of JN Brown later this year when lockdown restrictions ease and the group. The group will also have a new memorial cup this year dedicated to JN which has been donated by his son Junior.The Brian Steenson group would like to wish founder member Trevor Lindsay best wishes as he recovers from illness, with their thoughts also with his we Margaret and family at this time..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/7Apr2021-CDiary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C April 11%2C 2001  ","story":"NEWCASTLE ndash Two of Down Districtrsquos biggest visitor attractions will be open this weekend, as moves continue to prevent the collapse of the Easter tourist season.The Department of Agriculture has bowed to signicant tourist industry pressure and agreed to reopen both Tollymore and Castlewellan Forest Parks which draw thousands of day trippers to the area.Both parks attract thousands of visitors over Easter and also boast the arearsquos largest touring caravan sites which are heavily used over the Easter period.Confirmation the gates at both Tollymore and Castlewellan are to open for business again came on Monday afternoon, just hours after the Department of Agriculture had warned they would remain closed. However, pressure was stepped up when it was revealed that staffing problems, and not the foot and mouth crisis, was the main reason for the closures.Virtually all the forest park staff are away on disinfecting duties, mainly at ports and border crossings and Department officials felt they could not be spared to open the forests.ARDGLASS ndash A yard of ale, talent contest and car pulling competitions are the stuff of which traditional summer festivals are made.And according to the newly elected committee set up to bring Ardglass Festival back to le, these are examples of the old fashioned games most people prefer.The committee which was elected following the grouprsquos annual general meeting recently, has already announced the revival of the annual event which has not been staged since .The festival, which was one of the most popular events in the district for several years, was cancelled because of lack of interest but  local people have now volunteered to organise an events programme once again this year.BALLYNAHINCH ndash A Ballynahinch councillor is this week standing by his claims that thousands more vehicles are passing through Ballynahinch each day than officially acknowledged.Mr Francis Casement said while he is not prepared to reveal the source of his information, he says the figure he produced three weeks ago were compiled by the Roads Service and are accurate.The SDLP councillor produced daily traffic figures for several parts of the town which showed that over , vehicles pass through High Street.His comments come one week after Down Districtrsquos Divisional Roads Manager, Mr Sean Price, wrote to the Down Recorder, claiming the figures quoted by the local councillor in March were ldquocompletely erroneous and not based on departmental surveys.Mr Price said he has already informed Mr Casement about this and asked him to be more precise in ldquoidentying the source to enable him to shed some light on the confusion the figures have created.KILLYLEAGH ndash The Planning Service has ruled there will not be a public inquiry into one of the biggest private housing developments ever proposed for Down District.Public scrutiny of an ambitious poundm plan to build over  new homes and a marina at the Gocean area in Killyleagh had been widely expected, but planning officials have decided against an inquiry.They confirmed on Monday afternoon that the application by Ravenblack Developments, which was being dealt with by senior planners in Belfast, has been passed back to planners in Downpatrick. They will now re-examine the proposal before making their views known to local councillors.It has been widely expected the inquiry would have taken place next year, but the fact that it has not been ordered could result in construction work on the project beginning sooner than expected, provided planning permission is granted.DOWNPATRICK ndash A group of residents in Downpatrick are seeking urgent talks over a proposal to build  new homes in the town.The Ardglass Road residents are hoping to meet senior planning officials and Roads Service engineers to discuss what will be Downpatrickrsquos largest building project for several years.They say while they have no objections to the proposal to build several hundred new homes, they do have concerns about the increase in the amount of traffic the development will generate.Councillor Mrs Anne Trainor said the existing roads infrastructure is already struggling to cope with the demands being placed on it and will not be able to cope with more traffic.She admits while the construction of the homes will be good news for the local economy, shops, schools and churches, it is important the existing roads network is upgraded.Details of the scheme to build the new homes on land formerly owned by the Down Lisburn Trust was made public last week and local residents has been given two weeks to register any opinions.The new homes are to be built by the Ballygowan firm of Micwall Developments and the scheme is due to receive its public launch in August or September.BALLYCULTER ndash Organic chickens bred at a Ballyculter farm could soon be featuring on supermarket shelves across the Province.The new initiative, which is being spearheaded by organic farmer Dr John Orr, is being backed by the Crossgar firm of Bells Poultry, which hopes to take its first delivery of free-range chickens later this week.By Friday the birds will be on sale in butcherrsquos shops in Belfast and Dublin andsuccessful, the move to breed organic chickens locally could knock the stuffing out of European competition.The plan was hatched several months ago and Mr Adrian Gunn the agricultural manager with the Crossgar firm, believes the market is ready for an increase in the number of organic chickens.He said with an increasing number of consumers turning to organic products, the time is right to move in this direction and supply them with organic poultry products.STRANGFORD ndash Local school children braved the April showers on Monday to take part in a historic event.Armed with wellington boots and spades, pupils and teachers from St Josephrsquos Primary School in Strangford joined members of the Woodland Trust at Compass Hill outside Strangford, to plant the first trees of the new millennium woodland.Monday was the first stage of the project which saw the children helping to plant a new woodland which has been envisaged for them when they grow up.A new footpath is being built which leads to the Lough shore with breathtaking views from Compass Hill and the Tea House.The woodland and hedges which are being planted have been specially chosen to encourage bird and insect populations and work is currently underway to clean and restore the old Japanese pond.A number of relaxation areas have also been pinpointed for the positioning of seats, along with wooden sculptures which pupils at the local schools helped design.The sculptures of woodland animals have poems, which were written by the children, beautully carved below them and will be there for further generations to admire.CASTLWELLAN ndash Castlewellanrsquos famous May Day horse fair, which has been a feature of le in the market town for generations, has fallen victim to the foot and mouth crisis.Down Council had this week ruled that the traditional horse fair, which attracts hundreds of people of Castlewellan, cannot go-ahead on May .The decisions to cancel the event was taken at a special meeting in Downpatrick on Monday night, but politicians have agreed to allow the fair to proceed on May .They argue it would be unwise to allow people from rural areas to meet in large numbers in Castlewellan for the annual May Day fair and to bring horses in to Castlewellan.But the politicians have given a guarantee they will continue to monitor the current situation and have agreed thatcircumstances change and new directives are issued by the Department of Agriculture, the horse fair could proceed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/7Apr2021-Funnyman.jpg","title":"Funnyman Brian compiles humorous stories  ","story":"FOR over  years Brian Johnston has been involved in entertainment, compering concerts and appearing at after dinner s and events for numerous church, charitable and other organisations throughout the province and further afield.Ten years ago Brian, who lives near Temple, published a collection of the stories he has told over the years.

I was just putting thoughts down and all the lines came out in rhyme, she said.ldquoFor the two years I was sitting here at home, I was vegetating, which is not like me. I didnrsquot want to do anything. I knew Ryan would have said to me, lsquoCome on Mum, catch yourself onrsquo.Just four months before Ryan died, the mother of two lost her father.One of the poems in the collection is based on the special relationship between them both.ldquoWe understood that Daddy at  had a good innings but the worst of it all was that he and Ryan were such good friends and so close, she explained.ldquoI got Ryan cremated but his ashes lie with his Papa so they are together and friends forever now. Knowing the two of them are together has helped me.ldquoIt was a very traumatic time, but losing a son has been the ultimate and most horric experience I can ever express to anyone, especially by the means in which it was done.ldquoNot only that, one of the boys who did it is now appealing his sentence. He only got four and a half years in prison and the rest out on licence. That shows there is no remorse. If I had done something like that, I would be saying, lsquoRight lock me uprsquo, I would be horried.ldquoThe judicial system in this country is ridiculous. Four years for murdering someone  I know they say it wasnrsquot murder but it was in the end.Another poem, called The Gt, is about a locket of her sonrsquos hair that she kisses every morning to help her get through the day.Jayne was in New Zealand visiting her daughter Rebecca, who had just had her first baby at the time of the attack on her son.ldquoIt took me three days to travel back from New Zealand, knowing my son was seriously ill in hospital. I was literally shaking the whole time, she recalled.ldquoRyanrsquos father, my ex husband Gordon, had flown from England to be with him. We both sat by his bedside when Ryan was stable enough for us to be in the room.ldquoI canrsquot commend the ICU team of doctors and nurses enough who worked with my son. They were amazing but, unfortunately, Ryanrsquos brain injury was too severe.Jayne, who is working on a second book of poems, says of her son: ldquoRyan was actually very shy but once you got to know him, he was always joking around and had a big smile on his face.

I feel the challenge is ambitious, and I feel like I want to be apart of it.ldquoThe signings the manager has brought in are unbelievable. Players such as Michael Moore with the odd age and experience and talented players like Nigel Prentice, Josh Cahoon and Scott Dornan to name a few. I just feel asa new challenge will be good for myself.Walsh thanked his former team as he looked forward to new beginnings.ldquoOlympic are my boyhood club and I wish the boys all the best for the season ahead. There is no doubt Irsquoll be back to support them on my free weekends, he remarked.ldquoI want to thank Olympic for accepting me to move on and signing the transfer.

We want to utilise him as a mentor to the next generation coming through.Walsh has starred in two Border Cup finals, putting in the man of the match performance in his teamrsquos agonising penalty shootout loss to Crumlin Star in . He would not rest on his laurels for long, however, as the claret and blue side won the trophy a year later.ldquoThere has been quite a few highs whilst at Olympic said Walsh. ldquoStarting with the acceptance to get into amateur league football, winning and gaining promotion for several leagues with winning Division A being one of the best feelings.ldquoGaining Premier Division status for a small club like Olympic was huge, alongside back-to-back Border Cup finals was great.ldquoObviously, losing to Star in the first final on penalties wasnrsquot nice to take, but beating Rathfriland in the final tops it.Walsh has now set his sights on a potential season ahead, with his own long term plans in mind for his new club.ldquoMy aims for the long term is hoping to be able to push Ballymacash to become a championship side. Making the move to Ballymacash will be great exposure for myself too and the messages Irsquove received from players and some management from other amateur league clubs have been respectful.He continued: ldquoThe support I have received from players, committee and fans of the Ballymacash has blown me away.

Police quelled crowds of  people on either side of the peace line and deployed six AEPs, a type of plastic bullet, as well as arresting two men, aged  and , on suspicion of riotous behaviour.Secretary of State Brandon Lewis was due to arrive in Northern Ireland later to hold emergency talks with the main political parties, as well as faith and community leaders.Mr Lewis will meet with First Minister Arlene Foster, from the DUP, and deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill, from Sinn Fein, on Thursday afternoon, the PA news agency understands.He has urged all communities to work together to end the violence, saying the determination to move on from the Troubles could not be “crushed by a small minority”.There have been six consecutive nights of violence across Northern Ireland.Sir Keir Starmer has urged Boris Johnson to “step up” and convene all-party talks, as he noted unionist concerns that the Prime Minister’s Brexit promises were not being kept.Earlier, ministers in the Stormont Executive condemned the violence and Stormont MLAs unanimously passed a motion calling for an end to the disorder.In a joint statement, the five-party Executive said: “While our political positions are very dferent on many issues, we are all united in our support for law and order and we collectively state our support for policing and for the police officers who have been putting themselves in harm’s way to protect others.“We, and our departments, will continue to work together to maximise the support we can give to communities and the PSNI to prevent further violence and unrest.”More than  PSNI officers have been injured since the violence started last week.The Stormont Assembly was recalled from Easter recess for an emergency sitting following a motion put forward by Ms Long calling for MLAs to unequivocally condemn those involved and support the rule of law.Speaking during the Assembly debate, DUP leader Mrs Foster said the scenes witnessed were “totally unacceptable”.The First Minister said the injuries to police officers, harm to Northern Ireland’s image and people’s property had taken the region backwards.She said that the future required political leadership.The PSNI has said it intends to review footage to identy those involved in violence.Ms O’Neill said the violence was dangerous and unacceptable.She said illegal loyalist paramilitaries and criminal elements were influencing young people and orchestrating the violence.“They are holding back their own people and they are holding back their own community,” she said.But Assistant Chief Constable Jonathan Roberts later said during a press conference that he could not confirm whether paramilitary groups were involved in recent riots.“I can’t confirm the involvement of paramilitaries but the orchestration of last night’s disorder and the previous nights is the subject of investigation,” he said during a press conference at PSNI headquarters in Belfast.“The scale of the disorder last night was at a scale that we have not seen in recent years in Belfast or further afield.“The fact that it was sectarian violence involving large groups on both sides is not something we have seen in recent years. We believe there was a level of pre-planning.”An estimated  people gathered on either side on the Lanark Way peace wall gates from pm, which escalated to “signicant disorder”.The violence is unfolding at a time of increasing rancour in the political sphere amid tensions over Brexit’s Irish Sea trade border and the fallout from the police’s handling of a mass republican funeral that took place during pandemic restrictions last year.As rioting has flared across Northern Ireland, all four main unionist parties continue to call for PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne to quit over how his service dealt with the funeral of former IRA leader Bobby Storey.Unionists are furious at a decision by prosecutors not to take action against  Sinn Fein politicians, including Ms O’Neill, for attending the funeral – a decision partly related to the fact that police had engaged with organisers before the event that drew , people on to the streets.Mr Byrne has vowed not to resign and has signalled a desire to engage with people who have concerns about policing in the region.Wednesday’s scenes of violence flooded social media and prompted UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson to appeal for calm.He tweeted: “I am deeply concerned by the scenes of violence in Northern Ireland, especially attacks on PSNI who are protecting the public and businesses, attacks on a bus driver and the assault of a journalist.“The way to resolve dferences is through dialogue, not violence or criminality.”---A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

That passing trade is something we rely on, and wersquore blessed to be in a great location.ldquoThe problem is, when people have a drink they forget about social distancing.\"Asked what he thinks of the latest changes, he said: ldquoItrsquos so important we try and get open outdoors as quickly as we can, more so for people in more remote areas where people are unlikely to drop by for a takeaway.     ldquoFor the good of the industry we need the beer gardens to open as soon as possible. I canrsquot see any reason why that wouldnrsquot be being spoken about now.ldquoPerhaps therersquos something we donrsquot know. If that is the case, then come out and say it because none of us want a third wave ndash that would kill businesses. The critical thing is we can have an uninterrupted summer.Is he expecting the high numbers some of his customers are predicting this weekend ldquoYes, probably ndash there has been a buzz since they let people travel locally, so Irsquod expect another rise in numbers again.ldquoWe need to be careful for our residents. We are a public service and we donrsquot want to cause trouble. Traders have got to remember that.Residents and friends Tracey Scott and Debra Cooper have enjoyed visiting the unusually quiet beach at weekdays through the pandemic, but said they will avoid the seafront this weekend.ldquoI hope people continue to be weary, Ms Scott, who lives alone at her home in Llandough, said. ldquoBut it seems to me recently people have stopped social distancing as much.ldquoI come here with friends and family sometimes three times a week, but I have to avoid it on weekends now.ldquoThere are just hordes of people not keeping to social distancing rules. Itrsquos a great shame.ldquoI walked with my mother here not long ago and was being bumped into by people. I canrsquot put myself at risk, and I canrsquot put others at risk.ldquoItrsquos so dficult because I live alone and I keep away from people Irsquod very much like to hug. Then someone comes and brushes past me. I know it sounds odd, but you do feel almost violated when that happens.ldquoItrsquos dficult, because I really do want the businesses to thrive here and I would like to support them on the weekends.ldquoMy message to people would be lsquogive it time, and letrsquos play it safe ndash donrsquot all rush at oncersquo.Ms Scottrsquos son and his partner, in their twenties, are also avoiding weekend trips to the seafront due to her son having asthma.Ms Cooper said: ldquoFor months now Irsquove only gone out in the week because it gets so busy. Itrsquos strange ndash the nice weather comes and the residents keep out the way.Hugh Pickford, who owns Pickfordrsquos Gallery and Bar With Rooms on the seafront, says he feels for residents, and itrsquos become dficult for traders to police overcrowding.ldquoItrsquos probably bred by us not being able to open indoors and police the situation ourselves, he said.Social distancing signs remain after the road had to be temporarily closed due to people packing the Esplanade over ChristmasldquoAt the moment people come and get a takeaway and go across the road. The problem is thatrsquos what everyone is doing. It doesnrsquot look great at times. But what can we do ldquoOver Christmas it looked almost like a carnival atmosphere to be honest.ldquoIrsquod like to look on the bright side. The seafront has really seen a revival in the last couple of years. Even at am now Piotr at Stol Coffee draws a crowd here. Itrsquos nice to see.That revival is continuing this weekend too as a new cafeacute opens inside the Pier Pavilion.The new rules mean the Pickfords can open their rooms to all people in Wales again.Hugh PickfordldquoWersquove not had much interest at the moment in the rooms, he said. ldquoPeople booked for April and then cancelled when they realised it was room service only. People donrsquot seem to want to eat off the premises or in their rooms, so thatrsquos hitting us a bit.ldquoWersquore looking forward to the summer. With staycation season likely to be ahead of us, it should be a great place to be.What you saidResidents have been responding when asked what they thought of the new changes.Jo Broad, from Blackwood, predicted: ldquoPeople will go crazy. Of course we need our lives back or at least some sort of normality. The beaches will be full again.ldquoLetrsquos hope people will be sensible, not go crazy, and letrsquos hope for safety, or I think there might be a summer lockdown coming.Newport resident Lisa Edwards said: ldquoPeople need to stop hiding behind the government. We are in charge of our own destiny and we have to resume some normality.ldquoTo do this, we need to be allowed to resume living, but sensibly. Itrsquos people flouting new rules that will cause a second wave.Claire Dunning said: ldquoWaiting for the next lockdown. People will take liberties.

Itrsquos an eclectic and fascinating place that has, over the last fty years, evolved to be welcoming and inclusive to many dferent types of peopleChapter Arts Centre came to le thanks to the driving force of writer Mik Flood and artists Christine Kinsey and Bryan Jones.CEO Chapter Andy Eagle. Photo Kirsten McTernanDiscussions about the opening of an arts centre in Cardf started in  and were part of a vision for a space where artists could produce and present work, free from commercial pressures. Experimental work was seen as key to its identity, and the needs of artists were at its heart.The venue was formerly Canton High School, and the initial period of set up was a demanding time. The founders, and a gang of enthusiastic and dedicated volunteers, lovingly cleared, restored and adapted the building to make it fit for purpose as Walesrsquo first arts centre.The first official Board meeting was held on  April  and in July that year Chapter opened its doors with a temporary cinema, gallery and bar, and with former classrooms used as studios, workshops and offices.

Every year, the venue welcomes , visitors to more than  film screenings,  live performances,  visual art exhibitions and  community classes, artisan fairs and events.Mr Eagle added: ldquoChapter is many dferent things to many dferent people. For some, it will be the international gallery exhibitions and the programme of independent films.\"For others, it will be the cafeacute bar and restaurant to meet friends before a Cardf City home game, or it will be for dance and theatre classes or a cup of tea before working in the community garden.\"But at its heart itrsquos a centre for contemporary art, supporting artists and creatives from Wales and beyond to produce and present work.Chapter works with practitioners at every stage in their careers, supporting and stimulating opportunities for exciting new talent as well as promoting the work of established artists.It is a springboard for the creative community of Wales with a focus on bringing the world to Wales and Wales to the world.Chapter is home to over  of Walesrsquo most dynamic creative companies and artists, including BAFTA Cymru, Printhaus, ie ie Productions, Everyman Theatre, Beryl Productions, Cardf Music School and Taking Flight Theatre.

We are an arts organisation that generates almost all of its income through ticket sales, classes, hires, cafeacute bar and other activity.\"The small remaining amount comes fromArts Council of Wales and is used to support our arts and education programme. Our capacity to earn incomeliterally stopped overnight and that was profoundly scary.Support has been generated from extremely generous public donations and from a range of funders including Arts Council Wales, Welsh Government, BFI, Art Fund, Ffilm Cymru and Admiral.Since its closure, Chapter has offered an exciting Chapter from Home programme, consisting of over  virtual film screenings, online theatre productions and art exhibitions, monthly online comedy gigs presented by Welsh comedian Robin Morgan, virtual lectures with Arts Society Cardf, as well as outdoor theatre performances with Cardf-based companies including Theatr Iolo and Kitsch  Sync.Currently showing at Chapteris internationally focussed art exhibition Artes Mundi.

Irsquom opposed to this plan. Itrsquos a loss of open countryside yet again, and the big issue of course that wersquore concerned about in Llantwit Major is the impact on local infrastructure.ldquoWe have two surgeries in Llantwit Major: one is nearly falling down.

Our traffic is chock-a-block the roads are gridlocked at peak periods.ldquoWhorsquos going to live in these homes  Wersquore building more and more homes all the time, but there are so many homes already available.

About  per cent of the planned homes will be affordable.     Both sites would be accessed off of the Northern Access Road, also known as Fford Bro Tathan. This new road was built in  and , running from the B north of Boverton to the St Athan enterprise zone and Aston Martin factory.Planning officers responded to Cllr Johnrsquos concerns by pointing to the newly built road, as an example of new traffic infrastructure in the area and saying new residents of the proposed homes could help local shops by bringing them extra trade.A plan showing the layout of site A Picture: WYG Free to use for all LDRS partnersAn image showing the layout of the siteAnother concern was noise pollution: the eastern site is close to a firing range used by the Ministry of Defence. Councillors on the planning committee feared future residents could suffer from hearing loud gunfire. Planning officers said they could make noise complaints.David Harris, who lives in the local area, told the planning committee: ldquoThis site is located right opposite and within  metres of a live MOD firing range. This range can be used seven days a week, up to pm. Itrsquos regularly used.ldquoNo matter how much mitigation is used in the building fabric, you canrsquot reduce the exceptional noise of live gun fire when you have your windows open or when yoursquore in your garden. This fact alone makes this site totally inappropriate for residential development.Because the housing development is split into two sites, councillors voted on two separate planning applications, one for each site.The second application, for the eastern site, only narrowly passed a vote. Six councillors voted in favour of granting planning permission, and six voted against, with four abstaining. Planning officers warned refusing permission could risk a costly legal challenge.As the vote was tied, the chair of the planning committee, Cllr Jonathan Bird, used his casting vote to grant permission, effectively voting twice. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In private, it was Philip that the Queen would defer to. vw,vw,px, px\"Philip with the Queen at Pangbourne College in Berkshire At home, he assumed the position of head of the family as the royal patriarch.The duke became the longest-serving consort in British history and the oldest serving partner of a reigning monarch, while his we became Britainrsquos longest-reigning monarch and the worldrsquos longest-reigning still-serving monarch.Like his great-great-grandfather Prince Albert, Queen Victoriarsquos beloved husband, Philip immersed himself in national le, yet managed to retain something of the sceptical spectator.Some thought he was arrogant, rude and insensitive others found him witty and fun.He could be abrupt, outspoken and was not afraid of using colourful language. He was parodied for his bad-tempered outbursts and criticised for his famous gaffes.Philip once warned a group of Scottish students in China that they would become ldquoslitty-eyed. vw,vw,px, px\"The duke on a state visit to Ireland On another occasion, he pointed to a fusebox of loose wires in a Glasgow factory and remarked that it looked like it had been installed by an ldquoIndian.He was well aware of his public image, once telling former Tory MP Gyles Brandreth: ldquoI have become a caricature. There we are. Irsquove just got to accept it.     Philip was a forceful man, often portrayed as short-tempered and rather off-hand in his manner.Yet he had the ability to charm and could be relied upon to break the ice with his sense of humour and quick repartee.The curious duke would ask endless questions while on engagements, grilling and challenging his hosts persistently.He had the no-fuss, no-nonsense manner so often associated with his daughter, the Princess Royal. vw,vw,px, px\"Philip and the Princess Royal leave the morning Christmas Day service at St Mary Magdalene Church on the Sandringham estate He was once said to have described himself as ldquoa discredited Balkan prince of no particular merit or distinction.Philip often received little public acclaim for his tireless charity work and support for the monarchy in dficult times.He and the Queen witnessed the failure of three of their four childrenrsquos marriages and the fallout that followed, particularly the scandal surrounding Camilla Parker Bowles, who eventually married into The Firm.The royal family also faced criticism for their response to the death of Diana, Princess of Wales.The duke was depicted as a tough, but caring father, amid speculation that his relationship with the Prince of Wales was not always the easiest. vw,vw,px, px\"The Duke of Edinburgh and Charles at Windsor Castle But he guarded his privacy and refused to discuss such matters.By almost any standard he was a remarkable character.

It was there he learned to ldquomess about in boats, laying the solid foundation of a future naval career.His Uncle Dickie, Lord Mountbatten, one of Britainrsquos greatest seamen, took a keen interest in the princersquos progress.After leaving school, Philip joined the Royal Navy, beginning at the Britannia Royal Naval College in Dartmouth in May , and was singled out as best cadet.During the Second World War, he served on several ships ndash firstly on HMS Ramillies ndash and saw active service against German, Italian and Japanese forces.Early in , the -year-old prince was in action as a midshipman.In March , he was a searchlight control officer on the battleship HMS Valiant and was mentioned in despatches for his part in the battle of Matapan against the Italian fleet. vw,vw,px, px\"The duke became an Admiral of the Fleet His commanding officer said: ldquoThanks to his alertness and appreciation of the situation, we were able to sink in five minutes two in gun Italian cruisers.Shortly afterwards he was awarded the Greek War Cross of Valour.When he moved up through the ranks to become First Lieutenant in the destroyer HMS Wallace , he was the youngest officer in the service to have an executive job in a ship of its size.He was present at the Japanese surrender in Tokyo Bay in .Home leaves brought invitations from King George VI to stay at Windsor Castle.It was in this romantic setting that the dashing naval officer resumed his friendship with the young Princess Elizabeth.They had been present together on ious occasions, including the wedding in  of Philiprsquos cousin, Princess Marina, later Duchess of Kent, to Princess Elizabethrsquos uncle, Prince George, Duke of Kent, and at the coronation of George VI in .But it was at Dartmouth in July , when King George VI and Queen Elizabeth visited the naval college with their two daughters, that Philip, then , and the -year-old Elizabeth had their first publicised meeting. vw,vw,px, px\"The Duke of Edinburgh in his Navy days Good-looking and blond-haired, the tall, athletic prince impressed Lilibet by jumping over the college tennis nets.From that time they maintained a regular correspondence and met on several occasions.Philip was invited to spend Christmas  with the royal family at Windsor and, by the end of the war, newspapers were speculating about their relationship.There was, however, some disapproval and suspicion of this foreign prince in the post-war years.Old-school courtiers were concerned that he was not a traditional English gentleman, even though he had fought for Britain in the Navy.But Philip and Elizabeth were already in love.

He saw no state papers and, although he was a member of the House of Lords, he never spoke in the chamber.On the death of the King, with his naval career at an end, Philiprsquos le changed irrevocably.He was left disappointed when the Queen declared on her accession that the royal familyrsquos surname would be Windsor and not Mountbatten, prompting him to make the well-reported remark: ldquoIrsquom just a bloody amoeba.There are claims that his actual protest in fact contained a number of expletives and the assertion that he was only there to provide sperm.After the Coronation, Philip was required to play a major role both nationally and internationally. vw,vw,px, px\"Philip joins the Queen to greet wellwishers in Australia He accompanied the Queen on Commonwealth tours and state visits overseas, as well as on public engagements in all parts of the UK.He also undertook many royal engagements on his own, at home and abroad.
