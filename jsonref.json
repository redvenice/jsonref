Here, he tells Sophie Goddard how he’s keeping not only his pub afloat, but is helping out the people – and animals – around him, too ...For thousands of small business owners, the global pandemic has flung their futures – and those of their staff – into uncertainty. That’s certainly true for Graham Blaikie, and his pub the Mercat Grill in Whitecraig, Scotland. “I’d been watching the news about Covid-19 since December and luckily we’d prepared,” he explains. “Even before we closed, we had contactless hand sanitisers and I was always wiping down handles and menus. I’d also removed items from tables, so there weren’t as many touch points.” But when Boris Johnson’s March announcement saw pubs and restaurants close to the public, the business that had taken Blaikie nine years to build was suddenly forced to adapt for survival.The first step was ensuring customers could still enjoy the food they loved. “Prior to the shutdown, we’d been talking about what our strategy would be – I bought containers and had our takeaway menu prepped, so we were ahead of the game”, he says of being ready for business the next day. “We had a lot of fresh food in the pub, so on the Saturday we started the takeaway system.” But it wasn’t without its problems. “It’s not as easy as you think doing takeaway food, especially restaurant-style. When people order with us they’re having haggis cigars, patties, fish and chips, pepper beef with rice and my mum’s desserts ... that’s six different containers at least. We spent about £2,000 on takeaway boxes initially, that’s a lot of money. But it’s hopefully keeping us going.”With the government support package now in place – and extended until October – Blaikie has turned his attention to helping local people. Launching his Soup(er) Hero campaign in April, he is now making soup and sandwiches for those in need. With help from the community council, a community hub – where food is dropped off and distributed by local volunteers – was born. The feedback keeps him going. “There’s an older couple and the wife’s got cancer and every day they get their soup and sandwich,” he says. “They have the soup at 12 o’clock, then the man drives his wife to the hospital for her treatment and when they come back, they enjoy the sandwich. That’s what makes it worthwhile.”It’s not just people benefiting, either – residents of Edinburgh zoo are also tucking into the pub’s surplus wares. “I had a massive box of bananas left over and my mum said: ‘You should take this to the zoo.’ So I got hold of all my leftover fruit and knocked on the zoo door – and that’s been it ever since.” Now Blaikie’s weekly deliveries of fruit, vegetables and fish help to feed the animals at a time when visitors – the zoo’s main form of income – have come to a standstill. “You’d probably choose not to eat some of the bananas, for example, because they don’t look as good, but they’re perfectly fine for the animals. When we’re making sandwiches, not everybody likes the heels of the bread either, so I freeze them and take them along – nothing’s getting wasted. And if I see something for a good price at the wholesalers – apples, cabbages, broccoli - I’ll pick that up, too. We need to keep zoos going, they’re all under a lot of pressure.”While it’s difficult to ascertain when exactly businesses such as Blaikie’s will open again, for now, he is focusing on adapting the way they work to ensure business is possible. “We have an isolated table in the front vestibule area, so people can come in and collect food safely, using contactless on the card machines for takeaways. We have separate areas for drivers to sit in too, so we’re doing everything we can.” And plans are already afoot for when pubs are finally allowed to reopen. “I’m looking at adding an area to the outside, so people can sit there the whole year round and I’m hoping to put in a little microbrewerydistillery, so I could eventually make hand sanitiser further down the line.”Why focus on helping others when keeping his own business afloat requires such effort? “I believe in helping people. I know this virus is a horrible thing, but it’s bringing out a lot of good in people as well. Neighbours are looking after neighbours, people are helping others with shopping or taking dogs for a walk. For so long, I didn’t like the way the world was going ...”What does Blaikie hope will come out of this situation? He pauses, then says: “That people start to work together a bit more, being more thoughtful of what’s going on around them. And of course, that they come to the Mercat for a meal.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

Nobody trusts nobody no more,” says a long-haired young man, building a wall (or perhaps a tomb). “Everybody’s like, ‘Don’t come near me bro, you might have the infection.’” But this isn’t lockdown Britain – nor indeed lockdown anywhere in 2020. It’s the Derbyshire village of Eyam during the 1665-6 plague outbreak, as imagined by artist Nick Burton in the exquisitely doomy new comic strip Our Plague Year.Burton has a flair for the bittersweet. The two-page comic Lily that he showed in the Manchester Open Exhibition at Home last year was a romance between a bicycle and the woman who first rode it. Recalling Lily, Bren O’Callaghan, the curator of Home, contacted Burton in March asking if he might consider producing a comic “addressing some of the themes that were prevalent in our society at the moment”.Home will release new episodes from Our Plague Year on its website every Friday from 29 May (the impatient can subscribe to an email that will reach them two days earlier.) “Each is a vignette that dips into a small moment,” says Burton, who has built up enough plot and material for Our Plague Year to stretch to 100 episodes. A book seems likely. God help us all if the serialisation is extended and we reach that many episodes while still under lockdown.Researching similar events throughout history, Burton came across the story of Eyam, a village in the Peak District that famously isolated itself from surrounding communities after the Black Death arrived in a cloth delivery from London. “You could immediately see the connection with what was going on in our society,” says Burton, who notes the irony that, although he’s just constructed a dramatic universe around Eyam, circumstances dictate that he’s never set foot in the actual village.It’s no bad thing that the setting of Our Plague Year exists only in Burton’s imagination as “an alternative-world Eyam”. It frees him to redraw phenomena of our present time as historical fiction: a population struggling with confusing guidelines from on high nosy neighbours avidly policing local behaviour kamikaze amblers using bodily proximity as a threat.Drawn as lockdown continues and moods shift, Our Plague Year can marry the long narrative arcs of a graphic novel with the responsiveness of a strip cartoon like Peanuts or Doonesbury, which are more “read one day and in the bin the next”, notes Burton.The parallels with plague-beset Eyam are darkly, comically real. “Just like today, we’d have some people who adhere to the lockdown and others that think it’s ridiculous,” says Burton. He describes how the wealthier residents of Eyam swiftly departed for other residences, and how the boundaries of the village were policed.Contemporary conspiracy theorists may be wigging out over 5G towers and secret labs in Wuhan the residents of Eyam looked to the superstitions of their own time for the source of their suffering. “It was the end of the age of magic and the beginning of the age of science,” says Burton. “So you still had people blaming the fairies for it: they were such capricious, evil creatures in those days, people were scared of them.”The most touching evocation of Eyam has happened on Burton’s own doorstep. William Mompesson, the vicar of Eyam, closed the church and instead led his congregation to worship in the open, by a rock called Cucklet Delf. With the synagogue shut in Burton’s Salford neighbourhood, the local rabbi has become equally inventive. “I live in a three-storey flat here, and my kitchen window looks into an open space bounded on all sides by townhouses and flats,” he says. This space, usually populated by kids and trampolines, has become an ad hoc synagogue, a Cucklet Delf for our times: “The rabbi in the middle, and everybody in their windows reading from the scriptures.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aed879190801f497bb30650977292de1939cd657/0_0_4210_2526/master/4210.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a058e2717aa0093a668a6ddf25227c12","title":"b and m diy sales uk lockdown home improvement gardening","story":"It said customers had been visiting its stores less frequently during the lockdown but their average spend had been much higher than usual.However, the business was experiencing larger-than-normal operating costs in distribution and its stores because of physical-distancing measures and higher wage costs during the crisis.It also warned there had been a significant “bring-forward” of demand in some key categories, partly caused by the warm spring weather.The chief executive, Simon Arora, said: “We are not expecting this current level of trading to continue as normal shopping patterns resume.

The lender has also guaranteed that it will not make any staff redundant this year.He added that the hit to profits would be short-term and that it had been expected before the health emergency in the UK.On the possibility of financial products being offered to customers with negative rates if the Bank of England dropped the base rate further, Garner said: “Negative rates, we have seen them in places around the world, it is fair to say they are unproven in terms of their impact. The continued supply of credit into the economy from the financial services sector is a really big factor in leading a recovery.”He said the impact of Covid-19 meant Nationwide was no longer seeking to break into the business banking sector.“The business case is no longer commercially viable,” he said. “It is a difficult decision but the right one.”“We have proved it is possible to break into the current account market,” he said.Deposits grew by £5.7bn (2019: £6.0bn), helped by strong growth in current accounts and the success of a new savings range launched in October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8864cba6106260ce9e616a161f598911d3f22e2b/0_44_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=586eb7c9cb56c1a8d67e896a78c086cf","title":"shielding impossible coronavirus testing and tracing","story":"Testing and tracing is the answer to protecting our most vulnerable – not trying in vain to ‘cocoon’ them awayIn the\u0026nbsplast UK government report on coronavirus policy,\u0026nbspthe word “shielding” is mentioned 36 times. The UK, Sweden and the Netherlands have all shown much interest in this strategy of cocooning elderly and other vulnerable groups in their homes or shelters while attempting to reopen economies outside.To date, shielding has meant asking the elderly, chronically ill, and others vulnerable to hospitalisation from coronavirus not to leave home, to avoid any face-to-face interaction, and to restrict human contact to the digital realm. What goes unsaid is that this strategy of shielding is distinctly western, and has not proven particularly effective at protecting these iniduals.\u0026nbspThe first vocal proponent of shielding was Boris Johnson, who announced in mid-March that the UK would keep its economy open and achieve “herd immunity”. In the meantime, the elderly and those with chronic illnesses would need to protect themselves by shielding from the rest of society. David Halpern, the chief executive of the government’s behavioural insights team, said, “there’s going to be a point, assuming the epidemic flows and grows, as we think it probably will do, where you’ll want to cocoon, you’ll want to protect those at-risk groups so that they basically don’t catch the disease – and by the time they come out of their cocooning, herd immunity’s been achieved in the rest of the population”. His plan turned out to be disastrous. Deaths ravaged care homes and households, and the UK quickly reversed tack and introduced a national lockdown on 23 March. The UK now has one of the highest death tolls in the world.\u0026nbspYet shielding strategies stuck: governments in the US, UK, Sweden and other western countries still advise confinement for vulnerable populations. Most (with the exception of Sweden) recommend shielding in conjunction with a national lockdown.In contrast, east Asian governments have adopted policies focused almost exclusively on mass testing, tracing, and isolation of infectious iniduals. In South Korea and Taiwan, governments made two face masks a week available to citizens and registered non-citizens across the country. The core objective in these countries was to drive the virus out and prevent both young and old people catching it.Beyond immediate family and friends, the elderly and people with chronic illnesses are also more likely to need regular contact to receive medical care, grocery deliveries, and transportation. The extent to which at-risk populations must rely on others for essential care and services is a huge challenge to the efficacy of any shielding strategy.In the UK, where a national shielding strategy was temporarily adopted, care homes also became hotbeds for infection. Care home deaths were found to be higher than 22,000 by academics at the London School of Economics. Inefficacies aside, shielding itself is harmful to the mental health of those who are vulnerable. Older adults are already at heightened risk of depression and suicidal thoughts\u0026nbspaccording to\u0026nbspthe Kaiser Family Foundation, social isolation from shielding can exacerbate these mental health challenges. It’s unlikely that this group’s mental health will improve from being asked to shield indefinitely.\u0026nbspAnd the elderly alone don’t bear the risks of coronavirus. Many younger iniduals live with key risk factors that put them into vulnerable groups that require shielding. Earlier this month, the world’s largest patient\u0026nbspstudy\u0026nbspby the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Oxford University found that key factors relating to coronavirus deaths included uncontrolled diabetes, severe asthma, obesity, poverty and ethnic minority status.As western countries ease lockdown, suggestions have been made for those being shielded to stay “cocooned” away indefinitely until a vaccine or antiviral therapy is found or natural herd immunity is reached. What we suggest instead is a general strategy of suppression, where governments make a commitment to keeping daily new cases as low as possible through an active testing-and-tracing programme and real-time monitoring of transmission.At the same time, the government should advise those in “shielded groups” about their inidual risk, as well as provide them with data about transmission within their communities, and then leave these iniduals to make an informed decision about how and when they would like to engage in society.For a government to pursue shielding alone, with its proven inefficacies and intrinsic harms, would be nothing but an Orwellian strategy – one that presides over the fates of those at greatest risk, against all evidence. There are serious ethical and moral questions around building a society where the healthy and young are left to circulate, and the elderly, the disabled and the vulnerable are hidden away.\u0026nbsp• Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh Yasmin Rafiei is a research assistant at the University of Edinburgh"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc3e98a8e9de6d390e954619f38be69160e7e65c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73db4d56cd6b703132959c7f55c93c38","title":"tories impunity luck cummings","story":"The party has clung to power by flouting political norms, but in the Cummings affair it faces an angry and contemptuous publicWill the Tories get away with it? In many ways, it’s been the central question in our politics since they squeaked back into government in 2010. Ever since they used the power vacuum after that year’s hung-parliament election to quickly cobble together a coalition with the Lib Dems, the Tories have been careering from one narrow scrape to the next.Calling and losing the Brexit referendum, conducting a failed austerity experiment, constructing a Brexit deal out of U-turns and procrastination, and now trying to bluff their way through coronavirus, the Conservatives have taken huge, often disastrous risks, and yet have remained in office throughout. They have maintained that ascendancy, in large part, by ignoring the usual rules of political accountability. They’ve succeeded by being shameless.Conventionally, British governments are thought to be answerable to a shifting but powerful combination of institutions and interest groups: parliament, the main political parties, the courts, the media, business, Whitehall’s codes and conventions, and public opinion. All governments try to ignore some of these, some of the time. Government is difficult, especially in an old, quarrelsome country such as Britain, and being held to account for your inevitable mistakes can be lethal.But few British governments have worked as hard to avoid accountability as the Tories since 2010. From the Fixed-term Parliaments Act of 2011, which prevented David Cameron’s controversial coalition from being judged in an early election, to Theresa May’s attempts to stop MPs debating her Brexit deal, to Boris Johnson’s illegal suspension of parliament last year, the Conservatives have hidden from scrutiny ever more blatantly. Even the language Johnson uses – on the rare occasions he appears in public – seems designed to minimise accountability, with its clouds of vague adjectival phrases (“vast progress”, “world-beating”) and as few verifiable facts as possible.\u0026nbspThis week, this contempt for accountability reached its logical conclusion, in a way, with Johnson’s refusal to sack the unelected Dominic Cummings for clearly breaking their own government’s lockdown rules, or even to respond to many of the allegations against him. For anyone brought up on the idea that British politicians are scared of the press, Cummings’ performance in the Downing Street garden on Monday was quite an education. When a reporter from the Daily Mail – usually believed to be the most influential paper of all – asked Cummings whether he had offered to resign, he didn’t even look up from the written statement he had just given. “No. I have not offered to resign,” he said flatly, continuing to scribble on his papers. “I have not considered it.”For Cummings and Johnson, like other populists, the only authority to whom politicians should be accountable is the usefully nebulous one of “the people”. Defending Cummings’ behaviour during lockdown, Johnson and his ministers have been saying all week: “People will make up their own minds.” Repeating stock answers, regardless of the question asked, is another way of avoiding accountability, and is the government’s main communications strategy.One obvious advantage of answering only to “the people” is that – in theory, at least – it need happen only occasionally, in general elections. And between such contests, a government with a strong majority, such as the current one, can do a great deal in a single term in centralised Britain, as radical prime ministers from Clement Attlee to Margaret Thatcher have demonstrated.Arguably, it was Thatcher’s fall in 1990, and the 20 years of often anxious, closely scrutinised governments that followed, that established the model of accountability from which Johnson and Cummings are trying to escape. Thatcher was dumped as Tory leader and premier despite having handsomely won her third election in a row only three years earlier, largely because of an unproven suspicion in parts of her party and the media that she was no longer a winner. She was held to account by the Westminster establishment, and found wanting.Her successor, John Major, led a government that effectively imploded under the weight of hostile scrutiny. Scandals far smaller than the Cummings one led to a stream of ministerial resignations. Newspaper editors felt, sometimes correctly, that they could push the prime minister around. The then editor of the News of the World, Piers Morgan, wrote in his diary: “Major’s brought all these exposes on himself, with that ludicrous ‘Back to Basics’ speech”, which had called for a return to “traditional values.” Half in jest, Morgan worried that if his paper kept exposing Tory “sexual shenanigans”, “there will be literally nobody left to run the country”. If only exposing Tory hypocrisy had a similar effect now.After Major came Tony Blair, with his crushing majorities. But even he governed as if he was perpetually on trial before the tabloids, big business, swing voters and other rightwing or centrist interest groups. New Labour was often too worried about being accountable to be radical.Since 2010, the Tories certainly haven’t made that mistake. They’ve reshaped the country and its relations with the outside world almost regardless of what anyone else thinks. And when they’ve been too weak or short of ideas to enact many policies – as they were from the 2017 election to the Brexit stalemate last autumn – they’ve just clung on, ignoring regular Commons humiliations and the declarations of commentators that they lacked the authority to govern.The stubborn, tunnel-vision quality of modern Conservative government can be disorientating for Westminster journalists, many of whom absorbed a lot of their assumptions about how politics works during the 90s and 00s. Towards the end of Cummings’ long, repetitive press conference, a reporter asked almost desperately: “How can you not feel apologetic?”Yet even the very limited accountability that populists do accept can be dangerous for governments in between elections, in some circumstances, such as during a national emergency. The polls show that a growing majority of people are outraged by Cummings’ lockdown breaches – and this anger is fast eating into the government’s popularity.Many voters may have been vaguely aware for years that a seam of hypocrisy has run through the Conservative governments since 2010, which behind their rhetoric of national sacrifice has indulged the rich and powerful. But the Cummings affair has brought this hypocrisy to the surface of public life, and crystallised it into a compelling, easily digestible anecdote.As Major discovered when his administration was characterised as “sleazy”, once warning labels are attached to a government they are almost impossible to peel off. Whether Cummings eventually resigns, or is sacked, or not, what many voters think about the government may this week have shifted for good. Reporters will be looking for more hypocrites in Johnson’s administration. It may become a zombie government: stumbling on in office for years more, as Major did after his scandals, but widely discredited and mocked.However hard populists try to limit it, political accountability comes in many forms. Having to govern before a contemptuous public can be the most painful of all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ffe26f22a328048b1926c5bc1d4c81db7ea2e1f1/0_141_2119_1273/master/2119.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a20302e7e735c784c69530d76ca03f7f","title":"track and trace is no laughing matter so dont turn it into a farce","story":"Matt Hancock may want to make a joke out it, but if the new measures are to be taken seriously, the health secretary has to act accordinglyHas there ever been a more unsettling sight than Matt Hancock, laughing?

And the next we were calling him too fast! HAHAHAHA. Oh, my sides.\u0026nbspWhatever it was coursing through his noisy face, it definitely wasn’t mirth. He looked as if he had been taught to laugh by the goats that had unaccountably raised him, and was trying it out for the first time. But that isn’t the question. “Will test and trace be ready?” isn’t even the question, since given any opportunity to outsource a complex and vital process to a monolithic and incompetent services company, the government will take it, and we have to make our peace with that.\u0026nbspThe question is: will any of us obey it? Someone calls up, tells you you have had contact with an infected person, but won’t tell you who it was. It is no different from the system with STIs, they say, except it is\u0026nbspreally different, because you could normally at least narrow down who had given you gonorrhoea, or if you couldn’t, you could take your quarantine on the chin. You can get a test, but even if it is negative, you still have to stay in isolation. You might think you have had coronavirus, you might even have tested positive for it in the past but, building in the uncertainties around immunity, that makes no difference.Simple thought-experiments, such as “What would Dominic Cummings do?”, yield a hard: “Bugger that for a game of soldiers.” It takes a very particular set of attributes to be able to ask others, in a convincing and compelling way, to do their duty. It would be boring to list them all when it is plain that no one in government has any of them.\u0026nbspProbably the only way this is salvageable is for the cabinet to lead by example: all declare themselves quarantined, following test-and-trace instructions, constantly, one fortnight rolling into the next. Maybe get someone else, such as the opposition, to step in and govern for a bit. It’s quite an ask, but, in the national interest, worth it.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad2632bf740089a7cfe7421d35ea988dcf380930/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b34bcb0c1d8d115e766b740262ac5c7","title":"teachers and parents how do you feel about schools reopening","story":"We’d like to hear from people about the return to schools, whether to teach or take their children, from MondayPrimary schools will begin their phased reopening to all pupils on Monday after more than two months of general closures, prime minister Boris Johnson has announced.Schools are already open to vulnerable and key worker children, who will gradually be joined by their classmates – though many primary schools will not be open to all eligible pupils right away.We would like to hear from teachers and parents of children who are returning to school next week.How is your school preparing for children to return?

Last week Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of the Office for Students, told MPs that before a student accepted a place, universities must provide “absolute clarity” about what their experience of starting during the pandemic would be like. But many vice-chancellors say this is unrealistic and are hedging their\u0026nbspbets for fear of “over-promising”.The head of a university in the elite Russell Group says: “We can’t honestly be clear where we will be in four months’ time. And there are legal implications if you say ‘yes, you’ll be here attending seminars and staying in halls,’ and then that can’t happen.”Prof Colin Riordan, the vice-chancellor of Cardiff University, another Russell Group member, says: “We are fortunate that we aren’t regulated by the OfS so we can safely ignore what they are saying. Our regulator in Wales is being much more pragmatic and not asking us to do what we can’t do.”Universities are devising plans for how to open up their campuses again in the autumn – not least because they are worried that thousands of new students might otherwise try to defer their places.Mike Taylor, a computer programmer from Ruardean, Gloucestershire, says his youngest son, Jonno, who wants to be a composer, is now unsure about whether to press ahead with studying music at Lincoln University, a course he feels is “absolutely perfect” for him.While Taylor is not convinced small-group teaching is safe, he is most saddened about what his son’s social experience of university would be like. “If you go to study music, you want to sing in choirs, form bands, do gigs in the student union, and so on. None of that can happen safely,” he says.“The big concern is that university is one of those things you get one shot at. If Jonno goes now, he burns his precious three years, and accumulates his huge debt, for what can only be a substandard experience.”Simon Marginson, professor of higher education at Oxford University, says that faced with an online start, many students’ instincts will be to defer, or to “take their chances” on admission in a future year. “Students will be more sharply aware of a diminished offering at university than the struggle to find work in a recession, which they have yet to fully experience,” he says.Riordan, meanwhile, says universities are hoping that by September regulations will have relaxed enough for freshers to have a campus-based experience, even if it looks and feels very different because of distancing rules. But he says no one knows for sure whether there will be a resurgence of the disease, or what the regulations will be at that time.“Most of us are being pretty cautious, as over-promising or giving students misinformation would be far worse,” he says.Cambridge, Manchester and Nottingham Trent universities have all confirmed that they will be delivering lectures online, at least for the first semester, with hopes to deliver small-group teaching face-to-face. Riordan agrees large group teaching by September is likely to be “out of the question” and says small-group contact would be “the easiest thing to fix”.Other elements of the plan are trickier. “What you can’t put online so easily are things like chemical practicals, which need a lab, or teaching doctors and dentists, where there really needs to be personal interaction and training. We have to find a way around that as we clearly can’t stop training doctors.”Like most universities, Cardiff has mapped out one-way systems around its buildings similar to those in supermarkets. Extra toilets are being commissioned in car parks.However, one of the questions keeping Riordan awake at night is how the university will ensure that young people, who have been among the most likely to flout social distancing rules, take the plan seriously.“We may get people to sign an agreement as a condition of being on campus. We have to do everything we can to avoid an outbreak.” His team is talking to lawyers about this.While parents and staff want reassurances about safety, he believes many students are still hoping for a first term of socialising and parties. He advises a reality check: “We won’t have the same sort of nightlife anywhere in the country.”However, some universities, sensing that many students will want a campus-based experience, are aiming to deliver lectures in person. Worcester says that to keep numbers down it will alternate students between those attending in person and those watching online, and will also offer smaller face-to-face classes.Its vice-chancellor, Prof David Green, says he is determined to have in-person teaching wherever possible, because “research is already showing that students from disadvantaged backgrounds have found it hardest to progress their studies during the lockdown”.The head of Aston University, Prof Alec Cameron, says: “Cambridge announced no lectures, but their model has always been that lectures are a voluntary element. Most of the sector still relies on lectures as a core component.”However, Cameron estimates that a 200-person lecture would need to be cut by about two-thirds to comply with social distancing, and his university doesn’t yet know how to achieve that.Another big challenge, he says, will be working out with its private provider how halls will function, with their shared living, kitchen and dining spaces. “In the short term it may be difficult to provide some of those arrangements under strong social distancing requirements,” he admits.Cameron says: “We have to be open about the uncertainty that is attached to our good intentions. We are saying that we will be enrolling and commencing students in September. But at the heart of our decision making, our top priority will be whether it is safe for students and safe for staff.”Smita Jamdar, head of education at the law firm Shakespeare Martineau, wants the OfS to “dial back” its demands. “Right now, with universities under the most extraordinary pressure, they seem to be expecting more of them than they would in normal times.”However, Colin McCaig, professor of higher education at Sheffield Hallam University, says universities can’t keep would-be students in the dark much longer. “It’s a circle that has to be squared. Universities need to come out and put their sticker up on the window and say ‘Hey, this is what you’re getting.’ Only then can consumers make a proper choice.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5dbcac3b6c6a50ac88d5c22f4a798279615911b9/453_589_3497_2099/master/3497.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bfc017bfe7ffe4c96742260ff4062ff8","title":"share your photos of butterflies in the uk","story":"We want to see your photos of butterflies you have spotted around the country during the sunny weather Due to a combination of warmth and sunshine across the UK, butterflies have been spotted enjoying the good weather.If you have seen any near you, we’d like to see your photos.You can get in touch by filling in the form below.

The caterpillars spent winter feeding on cotton grass and 45 hand-reared pupae are now being released on to a secret site where they will be kept in protected tents while they emerge from their pupae.\u0026nbspConservationists are going into the tent to check them two or three times a day, releasing any butterflies as they emerge.\u0026nbspHeather Prince, who is part of Chester zoo’s invertebrate team, said: “Breeding and rearing butterflies in an incredibly delicate process that requires a fine balance of conditions at each part of their life cycle. Countless hours have been spent inside our specialised breeding centre nurturing the tiny eggs, rearing the larvae and caring for their host plants as well as monitoring their final pupation period.“It will be incredibly rewarding to see large heath butterflies fluttering around in their new home – a place where they’ve been missing for more than 100 years – and know that we’ve contributed to preventing their extinction in this area.”The butterflies rarely fly more than 650m from where they are born so were unlikely to colonise the area alone. Alan Wright, communications manager at the Wildlife Trust for Lancashire, Manchester and North Merseyside, says he hopes there will be a good colony here in the next 10 years.\u0026nbspHe said: “In Victorian times there were literally thousands of these butterflies in the mossy areas around Manchester. This reintroduction part of a wider effort to get native wildlife back in the right areas … It just seemed right that if we could get Manchester’s butterfly back to the mosses that’s something we should do. Everyone here is absolutely over the moon about this.”\u0026nbspPeat extraction means these boggy areas are up to 20 feet lower than they were a century ago and this reintroduction is part of a bigger project to restore greater Manchester’s heavily degraded wetlands. Other species set to be reintroduced include bog bush cricket, white-faced darter dragonfly and carnivorous sundew.\u0026nbspThere are a few isolated populations of large heath butterflies remaining in England and Wales and larger populations in Scotland.\u0026nbspThis follows the successful reintroduction of large heath butterflies to Heysham Moss in Lancashire between 2014 and 2016, and conservationists are now planning to reintroduce the butterflies to Risley Moss in Cheshire."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9847dee09021a3cbe8e91203ecb622c80eaf5367/0_156_4747_2848/master/4747.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=50565846d49a2aff0febef31e10935da","title":"the thing i miss most in lockdown now pub beer gardensgrace dent","story":"‘The most useful thing Dominic Cummings could do for his country right now is to flout lockdown again, only this time do it in a pub’In case you’ve not noticed, going out – the comeback –\u0026nbsphas started. I have been out, and I’m not sure I like it. The new world has lots of rules and they’re largely opaque. And the dining out options are lousy. I began with a trip to a newly reopened fish and chip shop in Chingford, while resembling an extra from prison camp drama Tenko, hair-styling, mascara and bra-wearing having fallen off my agenda several months ago. Nowadays, only Rita Ora and women on TikTok wear actual makeup. The rest of us have grown too accustomed to not caring. Pre-lockdown, I wore more makeup than your average rodeo clown right now, bothering even to tweezer a ision in my monobrow feels fancy.No one will see me in the chip shop, anyway. The rules –\u0026nbspbecause there are chip shop rules these days – say queuing in a confined space is forbidden. “Two people only permitted inside the shop,” the sign said. Everyone found this confusing. Did that mean two people from one household? Or two strangers? Did it mean that, if two people were inside the shop, I could stand outside and shout my order? Everyone’s confusion about the new rules made the woman serving us livid. Although I’m not sure if she was mad about us breaking the rules or mad that the rules meant she had to wear a mask.Alas, those chips, which I’d dreamed about and plotted over for more than 60 days, were lukewarm and soggy by the time I’d driven them home. The rules strictly forbid leaning against the ledge eating them hot and fresh in the chip shop while helping yourself to extra salt and vinegar, which, now that I think about it, was one of life’s sweetest, simplest pleasures. Yes, eating in a layby is, technically, permitted, but let’s face it, I’d look like a carb-loading dogger. I’m trying hard to love life in the new world, but my feelings are presently tepid.Along with chip shops and takeaway coffee, we seem to have been given back the right to have picnics. This is great news for fans of eating Sainsbury’s coleslaw somewhere that has no working toilet, throwing a scotch egg into a bush to re-route hornets, drinking too much warm rosé with friends of friends you have never really liked, and inevitably stinging your va-jay-jay on nettles while weeing. It’s a no from me, but many people are devotees. The rule seems to be that you can eat mini-quiches outdoors, but mind who you do it with. And do not, whatever you do, attempt to use a picnic bench in the park for your picnic, because they’re all still taped up like crime scenes.It could be time for us to question many of these things, and what we possibly need right now are more rule-breakers. The most useful thing Dominic Cummings could do for his country right now is to flout lockdown again, only this time do it in a pub beer garden. He needs to take one for the team. There are few sadder sights across the land than these much-loved but now abandoned sun traps, their tatty wooden benches baking indolently in the sun. All these unseasonably glorious May days have been going to waste, and for a man so fiercely Brexit, that is about as anti-British as it gets. I drove past a dozen pubs on my way home with my lukewarm chips, and my heart was colder still.Cummings’ last jaunt made us question our pilfered right to wander in forests and even take a pleasant day trip to Barnard Castle, but we need him for a much bigger job. He should start this Saturday morning with a swift drink on the lovely sun terrace outside the The Albion in Islington, before sinking four or so more – possibly with his top off – over lunchtime.Yes, the fallout would be incendiary, but once the quacking had stopped, something magical might happen. Perhaps we could prise these spaces open again. Although we’re grateful for car showrooms and golf clubs, these things mean nothing to the majority.\u0026nbspAnd, obviously, there would need to be some rules – most of us have proved we’re good at following those – but there would also be cloudy cider with friends, giant Jenga, hot chips in a plastic basket, cheap ketchup in sachets, bad jokes and lots of sunburned forearms. Things will move on, but I know I will never take my right to loiter and languish, to laugh with friends or to drink lager from a pint glass for granted ever again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f01caf042b2bf6b49a75dc8debff50bd7c392974/0_177_4424_2655/master/4424.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8311e47b40459875bd5388ce09a3c60","title":"what when where questions answered on premier leagues return","story":"Television viewers can look forward to six weeks of wall-to-wall summer football coverage from 17 June onwardsThe League has set a provisional date for return of 17 June.

They are the two fixtures\u0026nbspleft over from March. Once completed, all\u0026nbspclubs\u0026nbspwill\u0026nbsphave played 29 games each.

The kick offs will be:\u0026nbspFriday 8pm Saturday 12.30pm, 3pm, 5.30pm, 8pm Sunday 12pm, 2pm, 4.30pm, 5pm Monday 8pm Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday 6pm and 8pm.Mostly at stadiums of the home team, always behind closed doors. Concerns over the possibility of fans gathering outside groundshave led\u0026nbspthe police to request the following games take place at neutral venues:\u0026nbspManchester City v Liverpool, Manchester City v Newcastle, Manchester United v Sheffield United, Newcastle v Liverpool and Everton v Liverpool.\u0026nbspThe police have also asked that this list includes any match that may see Liverpool win the title.With Jürgen Klopp’s team 25 points clear of their nearest rivals Manchester City,\u0026nbspLiverpool could win the league with their first fixture, the Merseyside\u0026nbspderby. That would require City to have lost against Arsenal. Liverpool, whatever their rivals do, need two wins to seal their first championship in 30 years. How they will celebrate any win is to be decided, with the league drawing up plans for a physically-distant trophy lift.With no fans allowed into stadiums, the resumption will be made for TV. Every match will be shown live, the majority – 64\u0026nbspof 92 – on Sky. The broadcaster has pledged to show 25 games free to air. BT Sport will show 20 matches but none will be free to air.\u0026nbspAmazon will show four games and, in a first for the national broadcaster, the BBC will also show four Premier League matches live.Project Restart has involved no shortage of problems but the question of how any resumption should include the people who would have filled the\u0026nbspstands has not been at the forefront. There may be cardboard cutouts of fans, as in Germany, there may be videos shown on big screens, but the interaction between fan and team will be lost. Most clubs have announced that ticket holders will be refunded for matches behind closed doors.As it stands none of the three isions beneath the Premier League have resolved what to do next. League Two clubs had voted to end the season, while League One remains ided over what to do and the Championship hopes to resume. The EFL has announced\u0026nbspa meeting on 8 June at which a process for deciding on possible outcomes will finally be agreed.The Premier League has always said it planned to resume competition when it was “safe to do so”. That is now felt to be the case after medical protocols were developed and approved by clubs and players. Any player or member of staff who tests positive for Covid-19 will be expected to isolate for seven days but plans as to what will happen should multiple players test positive are yet to be agreed. A broader resurgence of the virus in the country may also take the restart out of the league’s control.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfe62484b3fc222d4ceb3bb1c2bc15bf94ef792f/0_128_580_348/master/580.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=fec6efa821721447ec5f8a759a2c647e","title":"like many people i have noticed an uptick in vivid dreams","story":"A dream about running is my first recurring one for many years. Will I still have it when lockdown ends?When lockdown began, I took up running. Regular runners may remember those first few agonising jaunts – where the background noise of the world disappears and the only sound is your heaving breath, the only sensation your aching feet (and bruised pride, at being outpaced round the ponds by an unleashed sausage dog).Perhaps that’s why on my third, stitch-filled run, I didn’t know what time it was when I found myself on the home stretch. I didn’t know why, as I huffed up the road, people were in their front gardens clapping, their faces alight. The penny dropped: it was a Thursday. It must have turned 8pm. We were clapping for the NHS. And as I stopped to join the applause of people actually worthy of it, I chuckled about my brief thought that somehow they might be clapping for me.I keep dreaming about this. Sometimes the cheering becomes jeering, sometimes I recognise the faces. Like many in lockdown, I have noticed an uptick in vivid dreams, despite having always had them. My favourite ones are comic: I dreamed that instead of breasts sagging with age, they floated upward, wreaking havoc with people’s eyelines. My worst dreams dredge up unresolved moments, like seeing the faces of friends I’ve lost touch with. (I’ve long believed friend endings are the worst because they’re unnecessary. Unlike romantic partners, where you can only have one, it’s fine to have multiple friends with some in “friend storage”. So to be Marie Kondo’d out of a life feels severe.)But this dream is my first recurring one for many years. Will I still have it when lockdown ends, I wonder? Perhaps I’ll find out soon: I write this under eased measures. But a resolution that satisfies the subconscious mind? I feel instinctively that is farther away too many shocks endured, too many unanswered questions. Either way, I know I’ll be running – round the ponds in the day, or for my cheering neighbours at night."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79900a9571734d8a4dce1edeccff361aebfc97e8/1_0_5344_3206/master/5344.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=bba396ef59cf54ae226b8992089eafc9","title":"anywhere but westminster online covid 19 uk","story":"In lockdown, our series is using footage sent in from around the UK to tell the story of the world outside the political bubbleThe day after the 2019 general election we were on an early-morning train from Stoke-on-Trent to London, feeling as if a long and messy chapter of recent British history had at last come to some kind of full stop. Brexit was a certainty, the Conservatives had won a big parliamentary majority, and the Labour party was more estranged than ever from its old heartlands. Having covered a country in mounting political ferment since 2010, we thought we could at least put Anywhere but Westminster on pause.But in March, everything changed once again. As the Covid-19 crisis reached the decisive point of lockdown, we decided the series had to be reawakened. But if we were as subject to the new restrictions as anyone else, and just as scared of the virus, how could we do it?The answer has defined our experience of the past two months. Instead of travelling to places, we have issued call-outs for information about what people are living through, and footage of their lives, usually shot on their phones. In addition, often using contacts we have acquired over the past 10 years, we have approached old and new sources, and asked them to participate. A mountain of video has arrived, which we and our team have spent long days and nights combining with our own material and turning into finished films. The result, by a mixture of accident and design, has been an ongoing series of videos that tells the story of this crisis from the core of people’s actual experience.We’ve chronicled the lives of a 26-year-old man whose arthritis medication suppresses his immune system, meaning he has to live in complete isolation, and an intensive care nurse who facilitates people saying their last goodbyes via Zoom. We’ve spoken to families whose experience of lockdown is light years away from any “bake cakes and learn Spanish” cliches, and people who have spoken movingly about losing loved ones. Crucially, we have also gone out of our way to explore how communities have come together, and provided new kinds of support to friends and neighbours.Unintentionally, it feels like what we’re doing is true to most people’s experience of the crisis – and, in particular, the mixture of an often lonely world suddenly mediated via the internet, and an unexpected sense of common purpose and togetherness. It sometimes feels as if encouraging people to document their own experiences is sparking a change in the way we feel about our journalism, and presenting us with a new challenge we will have to face when the crisis recedes: how to push even further beyond the standard approaches of the media, and give an even more authentic sense of where the country is going.For now, one thing seems particularly clear. The convulsive political events of the past 10 years were at least partly about rising inequality and insecurity, and people’s sense that power was too distant. Covid-19 has highlighted those things to the point that they are even more inescapable than before – which, for us, means that the work has to go on.Stay at home, keep your distance from people and don’t mix with anyone outside of your circle: the rules of lockdown are almost the polar opposite of the rules of Anywhere but Westminster.Our process has been to get out there to places the media doesn’t normally visit, get close to people, and talk to those outside our bubble. Seeing a political media that was too socially distant, we wanted to counteract it with a kind of journalistic gap-closing.Through the ruptures of Corbynism, Brexit, and the rise of populism, the idea that there was a gap between the way politics was presented in the news and lived in the world became accepted, and even a cliche. After 10 years, I sometimes felt like one of an ageing pair of small-time bank robbers, always coming back for one last job.But coronavirus and the resulting lockdown brought us new purpose – or a new version of our old purpose. Once again, the news was dominated by images from government briefings from Westminster and political journalists trying to hold them to account – this time over Zoom. There was also a blizzard of figures: infection rates, deaths, jobs lost, workers in furlough. We wanted to give more space to ordinary people to speak – putting human stories to those numbers and policies, but also capturing the ways in which communities were coming together to help each other.Same old problem, then: the difference is that we are working from our bedrooms and putting the films together using footage sent to us by people around Britain. Like everything else about this moment, it’s been a journey of discovery, with highs and lows. I will not miss wrestling with hundreds of clips shot in different formats, sent to me along with a constant stream of messages, questions, and pinging alerts. But I have also found moments of emotion in the footage that it would be hard to match in anything I shot myself.A paradox has become clear: while the issues we cover have always been bottom-up, the process of making a film that has a narrative viewers will watch and engage with is a very top-down process, requiring lots of control in the hands of the person filming and editing. Normally we videographers film with great attention to detail, trying to get each shot just right, and capturing every aspect of a scene in sequences of shots. Now I’m in collaboration with people who don’t even hold the camera the right way round (hint: it’s not vertical). But what they lack in technical skills they have made up for in authenticity.So, in many ways, this has been a process of letting go – of the old standards that we thought were so important, and of the visual “grammar” we have taken for granted. Instead we have found value in a new kind of intimacy and sincerity that comes from people having filmed their own stories, and the greater sense of control they have in the process. And we have tried to lay open the process to the viewers. In some ways this version of Anywhere but Westminster is the most true to its original vision. Hopefully it will open up new ways of thinking about how we do our video journalism and share power with the people we report on, and at the same time encourage people to see the power in capturing and documenting these times in video for themselves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e60efe287d1477c1d28411ae3f6dc099a6841771/83_0_3405_2043/master/3405.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f18b0acf514602c15e6b0036683204a","title":"what are your experiences of debt during the coronavirus pandemic","story":"We’d like to hear from people about how they are managing existing debts during the coronavirus pandemicSince the lockdown thousands of people have found themselves grappling with significantly reduced finances.

But it’s a sliding scale –\u0026nbspand one that certainly mattered less when she was knocking out undeniable dance-pop party starters like Poker Face and Just Dance, or cementing her status as pop’s freaky outlier on the twisted Bad Romance. That she appeared in alien-like form in that song’s video made perfect sense: here was a chameleonic pop superstar in the vein of Bowie, Prince and Madonna opening a portal to an escapist dimension. Later, it made sense that she would lean into the imagery of hair metal on 2011’s gloriously OTT, Springsteen-referencing Born This Way. Yet on 2013’s bloated Artpop – billed as an exploration of the “reverse Warholian” phenomenon in pop culture, whatever that may be, and featuring at least one performance in which she employed a “vomit artist” to puke green paint on her chest – the aesthetic felt more like desperate distraction tactics.Seemingly bruised by that album’s relative commercial failure (2.5m global sales compared with debut album The Fame’s 15m), she disowned dance-pop altogether on 2016’s Joanne. Ludicrous lobster hats and sinewy meat dresses were swapped for pink stetsons and denim cut-offs, while early producer RedOne’s churning synthpop was replaced by Mark Ronson’s rustic warmth. Collaborators included Florence Welch, Josh Homme and Father John Misty, while the album’s stripped-back sound pushed the rockist assumption that quieter somehow equals more authentic. Its middling success was quickly superseded by the Oscar-winning, chart-topping movie A Star Is Born, in which Gaga’s character Ally was locked in a plastic pop v heartfelt rock authenticity war.But, as ever, it’s all about packaging, and Joanne was as much of a pose as Artpop. In many ways, the ballad-free, dancefloor-primed Chromatica represents not only Gaga’s most personal record, but her most straightforward. Obviously there’s a conceptual framework – that title, despite sounding like a Mac software update, actually represents a planet anchored by equality and inhabited by “kindness punks” – but it feels much lighter than before. As Gaga said in a recent interview with Zane Lowe, she prioritised “simple messaging”, a phrase that would have been reverse-Warholed up its own backside a few years ago.Fun and dumb lead single Stupid Love aside, the majority of Chromatica’s 13 short and to the point songs (ignoring three orchestral interludes that feel beamed in from another album) dig into the person behind the facade. On dark centrepiece 911, she details her reliance on antipsychotic medication (“Keep my dolls inside diamond boxes  Save ’em ’til I know I’m gon’ drop this”) over a chugging swirl of industrial synths, while opener Alice dismisses Gaga’s damaging obsession with perfection over a sugary house confection. Babylon, meanwhile, buoyed by classic house piano and a soul-stirring choir, pulls off the very Gaga trick of conflating the big and the small, touching on the Bible, ancient mythology and, as she’s done ever since the start, the complexities of fame. The healing power of dance, cruelly frustrated by the current lockdown situation, rushes through the album like cheap poppers, with the 90s house pop of the Ariana Grande duet Rain on Me acknowledging trauma before dragging it on to a sticky provincial nightclub floor. The ludicrous Elton John collaboration Sine From Above – which, with its panpipe-inflected beat and unstoppable euphoric rush, would win Eurovision on any given year – digs deeper into this simple idea that music can soothe even the most damaged soul.That song ends with an unexpected shift into cranium-rattling drum’n’bass, a fleeting taste of experimentation that feels oddly missing elsewhere. While some of Gaga’s best work was made quickly, often on the road in tour buses, the songs on Chromatica were passed around from producer to producer apparently to free up the process. (Strangely, this is the first album not to feature Gaga as a listed producer, with the credits naming everyone from BloodPop to EDM producer Axwell to noise merchant Skrillex, while maximalist alt-pop producer Sophie – who confirmed her involvement back in 2018 – is noticeably absent.) At times, as on the generic Eurodance double-whammy of Free Woman and Fun Tonight, it means the songs feel overworked: sometimes their often short running times deny them space to breathe (the claustrophobic Plastic Doll). Sour Candy, a collaboration with K-pop girl band Blackpink, falls disappointingly flat: aiming for the sweaty throb of deep house,\u0026nbspit ends up sounding like a dashed off, cheaply produced interlude.\u0026nbspGaga is on much safer ground gliding around the joyous French house swirl of Replay, which has a startling lyric about burying trauma in graves and scratching at the dirt of her psyche. It’s another example of how, after years of using her music to try to heal other people – be it her gay fanbase on Born This Way, or her family on Joanne, an album named after her dead aunt – Chromatica finally turns that gaze inwards without ending the party. Unsurprisingly Gaga’s truest self was always going to be as loud as possible."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4abe85afc46f0f0cae0762e7b92f20ea06a5a13/0_306_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1009240f862ec30c02ee7883f4272a6f","title":"brexit is the uk headed for a no deal","story":"For the past few months UK and EU negotiators have been locked in talks trying to thrash out a trade deal before 1 January.

Safina was 16 years old, ranked 63rd in the world and she had just defeated Anna Kournikova, the most famous Russian player across the lands. As usual, many questions were about people other than Safina about Kournikova, her mother, her superstar brother. Finally, somebody wondered what she actually wanted from her own career. “The sport life is so short,” she replied. “I just want to enjoy it and don’t get injured.”Safina went on to have an enviable career. She won 12 titles, Olympic silver and reached No 1. She bullied top players with her brutal weight of shot, reaching three grand slam finals. Even though she never won Roland Garros, she is one of the best clay-court players of the 21st century.It has been nine years since Safina, now 33 and retired, last competed and she is locked down in Moscow. It takes just one question – about whether she would return to the sport if not for the stress fractures in her back – to understand that for everything she did, she never actually managed to reach either of those simple goals she set years ago.“If I would be able to start from the beginning of my career, maybe, but I don’t feel like coming back to the tour. It’s something that I guess is very deep. I think I got disappointed in some way by tennis, because I dreamed that once you become really famous, you become No 1 in the world, you would have a different life. But once you have this, everything, and you realise that it’s not what you’ve been dreaming of, then all your dreams fall apart.”Safina grew up training in Valencia as her brother, Marat Safin, ascended to No 1 in 2000. Despite his two major titles, Safin’s discipline never matched his talent. Fans lined the stadiums for his charisma, looks and famed self‑destructions as much as his tennis. Safina was different. Her discipline drove her success as she became a supreme athlete, but she always directed her frustrations inwards. While he would break racquets, she would break down.This is where her disappointment lies – she came to take everything in her career so seriously that the pressure was suffocating and her joy was lost: “I couldn’t handle my emotions and all these things, and for me that’s why it was tough.”The rise itself was thrilling. Safina announced herself to the world in the spring of 2008, beating both Justine Henin and Serena Williams to win a breakthrough title in Berlin. Within a year she was No 1 and dominant on clay, but the more Safina’s ranking rose the more she would play the biggest moments in a state of perpetual torment, on the verge of tears, unable to cope.“I always had a dream to be famous, No 1 and all this, but then suddenly I felt so much pressure being there. I didn’t expect that I would have this pressure. I thought it was going to be fun, you know? You become famous, you become No 1. And everybody is happy. It’s actually the opposite! Everybody wants to beat you.”In the 2009 Australian Open final, she froze and was eviscerated 6-0 6-3 by Williams. She collapsed under pressure in the Roland Garros final against Svetlana Kuznetsova, infamously serving a double-fault on match point. By Wimbledon, she was the No 1 player in the world yet Serena held three grand slam titles. She became the butt of every joke.“Of course, you hear every day the same questions in every interview: ‘When are you going to win your first grand slam?’ And I’m like: ‘You think I don’t want to win a grand slam?’ And then I started to struggle with this because it’s something that was really annoying for me and it was very painful because it’s something that I really wanted to win.”Safina sees her future in the player box rather than on the court. She cannot wait to fly back to Valencia and work as a coach. She may not have been able to enjoy herself at the top of the sport, nor to stay healthy, but the emotional intelligence and self-awareness she displays as she talks in her third language will carry her a long way. Perhaps it can help.“For all the experiences that I went through while I was struggling, I don’t want players that I coach to feel like that. I want them to understand that tennis is a beautiful life. It’s a beautiful sport. It’s so much joy and even the hard work should be a joy. Tennis is not a struggle. It’s fun and it’s a short period of life. I don’t want to go back for my perspective myself because I know that I’m going to be the same – taking it too seriously and crying.” Then she laughed. “I want to teach the players not to make the same mistakes I’ve made.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f0b958bb88a925899aa71717cab892057b099db/0_299_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4eba4962fafc2a587412337ff9aa8917","title":"my favourite game britain upset usa gold tokyo 91","story":"The gamble of mixing up the running order paid off when Kriss Akabusi overhauled the inidual champion on the anchor legWhat’s the most underrated non-annual sporting event of all time? Here’s a contender: the 1991 World Athletics Championships, too often boiled down to Mike Powell v Carl Lewis in an astonishing long jump, and Liz McColgan reducing a 10,000m field to puddles amid harrowing heat and humidity in Tokyo.Plus: the top six in the men’s 100m all went under 10 seconds. Marie-José Peréc and Michael Johnson stormed to their first global titles, while Finland’s Kimmo Kinnunen flashed in the pan furiously with a 90-metre javelin effort. It was a time, too, before relays became a vehicle to help performance directors meet medal targets. The men’s 4x400m, the final event at Japan’s National Stadium, had everything.With Britain’s Roger Black finishing just five hundredths of a second behind the USA’s Antonio Pettigrew in the inidual event, the hope was that the underdogs could keep the favourites honest. Despite Derek Redmond holding the British record, the in-form Black was the presumptive anchor attraction. So when word circulated that not only was Black on the first leg, with John Regis – who had run in the 4x100m final just 90 minutes earlier – also down to run, it sounded duff.And yet Black, groomed like a Chariots of Fire extra, was lead-off. Redmond, a prodigious talent rendered sporadic due to thighs seemingly strung with cheese rather than ham, was up second. Regis would seek to melt minds with a keg-chested third-leg presence, before Kriss Akabusi – the Timmy Mallett of track and field – took on Pettigrew.Some thought had gone into this. Regis had an overlooked flying lap to his name as part of a rampant 4x400m victory at the 1990 European championships, unofficially timed at 43.93sec – Iwan Thomas’s 23-year-old British record is 44.36. Still, Andrew Valmon, Quincy Watts, Danny Everett and Pettigrew were markedly superior regardless of the order. Adding up the best marks each runner would ever achieve inidually, the USA were three and a half seconds quicker.Black was undeniably a strong kick-off for British hopes, but Valmon, fifth in the inidual final, fought gamely from the gun. As the track’s stagger unwound, the two handed over more or less simultaneously. Britain needed Redmond to find form.He steamed away from 21-year-old Watts, who was enjoying a barnstorming debut season in the event. But though not yet the athlete who would blister the Barcelona straight in 1992, Watts was a cool head, cruising past his increasingly ragged rival. “Has the British gamble failed?” pondered David Coleman.Yet Regis clung doggedly to his man, even hinting at an attack. Honours ended up even, though the smooth-striding Everett glided round as if on castors, while the solidly carved sprint specialist noticeably sagged in his final strides. For this reason, Regis released Akabusi early in the changeover zone after a fine “390m” in the words of his anchor runner.Akabusi adopted a lean-shoe stance – almost exaggeratedly attentive to his rival’s movements. And though the American looked comfortable, Akabusi cornered wide to apply pressure that immediately told. Pettigrew’s rolling style became a flail, his desperation to reclaim the lead depriving him of all rhythm. Though the slowest of the four British legs, every one of Akabusi’s glorious, unthinkable 410m provided plenty for his latterday motivational speaking career.Within the year normality was restored, with Valmon and Watts among the USA quartet that savaged the world record at the Olympics. Black and Regis had Olympic and world silvers in their future respectively awaiting Akabusi was Barcelona bronze and replacing Roy Castle as host of Record Breakers.Derek Redmond’s Olympic ambitions memorably crumpled in a heap halfway round his 1992 semi-final, overshadowing Everett’s final bow at Games level in the race that immediately followed as the American’s foot gave way. No Nike ad for him he did get a time for crossing the line unaided though.The fact that Pettigrew admitted EPO doping had featured in the latter end of his career undeniably makes everything before that taste a little different. It’s stranger and more complex still in light of his 2010 suicide.For that one day 19 years earlier, however, see it as compelling statistics bested by eccentricity and imagination. “The gamble paid off,” concluded Coleman. And how."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1451d2914ec9be9acda79cc3144b139399fb1ac2/24_0_3451_2072/master/3451.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=594c565f1355c0179929ee3bbd6a50aa","title":"talking horses scottish horse racing planned to be back in action from 22 june","story":"Government rules about sport’s return may appear just two days before racing’s return but the BHA remains confident“The long break is nearly over,” horse racing’s followers were assured by the ruling body on Friday as frantic preparations continued for the planned resumption at Newcastle in just three days’ time. But still the government has given no formal indication as to whether it is content for the sport to resume, an omission that continues to cause much nervousness, including among trainers.“When you start thinking through it, any delay now would be absolutely catastrophic,” said Mark Johnston, who has sent out more winners than any other British trainer in the sport’s history.“It’s not just the plans for next week. The whole system that’s been created around two-year-olds assumes they can run next week in order to go to Royal Ascot, which has been left in its normal spot a fortnight later. We’ve got Classics at the end of next week. We would really have to think again if it didn’t start on Monday.”Johnston is also mindful of the fact that racing continues in France, where the first Classics of the year will be staged at Deauville on Monday. If the sport proved unable to resume in Britain, he fears major owners would be tempted to switch their interests across The Channel.“Within two days of racing being suspended here, I lost nine horses,” Johnston said. “Five of those went to Ireland because they were still racing there, though it had stopped by the time they got there. But now they’re racing in France. If we had any further suspension now, it would be disastrous. You’d see some being moved to France and not just any old horses, it would be the best ones.”For racing to go ahead on Monday requires the government to publish the third and final section of its guidelines on the return of professional sport, which will deal with how sporting action can be managed behind closed doors. The BHA needs to ensure its safety protocols, published last weekend, comply with those there will now be very little time to adjust if, as is expected, the government guidelines are published on Saturday.But BHA officials have been involved in the discussions that led to formulation of the government’s guidelines and there is confidence at 75 High Holborn that there will be no great surprises in the small print when those guidelines finally see the light of day. The BHA sounded very sure of its position in a statement seemingly intended to settle nerves.“We’re counting down the hours to the return of racing,” it said, “and looking forward to official confirmation from the UK Government after it has published its guidelines for the resumption of sport in the next day or so. The long break is nearly over.“This morning, we’ve been busy processing the declarations received for Newcastle’s fixture on 1 June and we are now implementing our new medical screening procedures to ensure we safeguard those who plan to be there on Monday for racing’s return.”James Armstrong, Newcastle’s clerk of the course, sounded like a man at the eye of the storm as he directed preparations. “At the moment, we’re just a bit manic,” he said. “It’ll be very disappointing if things don’t go ahead as planned but we’re just eagerly anticipating the nod. I’ve heard nothing to say otherwise.“Everyone’s flat out, getting everything up and running. We’re ready to go, we just want to get started.”Of the detailed safety precautions required by the BHA, Armstrong said: “Not a problem, everything’s in position now. It’s just a question of getting everyone here and getting them familiarised with what we’re doing and the new procedures. It’s a privilege and a bit of pressure as well but we’re ready for it and good to go.” Chris CookNine runners for French ClassicVictor Ludorum heads a field of nine for Monday’s French 2,000 Guineas at Deauville.

Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, told MPs there was “a big influx” of coronavirus cases from Italy and Spain in early March.Doughty, a former member of the home affairs select committee, told the : “This shocking revelation in answer to my question shows one of the likely impacts of failing to introduce proper measures to protect staff at the border when they were most needed – in the first quarter of the year – when over 23 million British and other travellers entered the UK without proper health checks or formal quarantine.“While some of this illness will have undoubtedly been picked up outside of work, the fact Sir Patrick Vallance admitted that we had imported many, many cases, coupled with these figures, suggests that many frontline staff may have been exposed and infected in the course of their work.“The government must urgently publish the scientific advice it used, and an explanation for their failure to act when it could have made a difference.”At least two Border Force staff have contracted Covid-19 and died.Critics of the government’s approach have questioned if more could have been done to screen arrivals earlier in the pandemic, particularly from hotspots, including Wuhan in China – the source of the Covid-19 outbreak – and northern Italy.Of the 18.1m arrivals between 1 January and 23 March, only 273 passengers on three three flights from Wuhan and one flight from Japan were formally quarantined in government-supported isolation facilities.The government stopped issuing guidance at the border to arrivals from specific countries – including from Italy and China – to self-isolate on 13 March, 10 days before the lockdown was imposed. Since then, there has been little intervention other than advice provided on leaflets and posters. There were more than 100,000 arrivals by air into the UK in April.Since then, the government has announced it is to enforce a 14-day period of self isolation for all arrivals into the UK from 8 June, prompting many to question why such a policy was not implemented earlier in the crisis.The figures also show that in the first four months of the year, there were a further 2,345 Border Force and UKVI staff recorded as beginning a period of isolation at home either because a member of their household had Covid-19 symptoms or because the employee themselves was vulnerable to infection.

The large observational study analysed data from nearly 15,000 patients with Covid-19 who received the drug alone or in combination with antibiotics, comparing this data with 81,000 controls who did not receive the drug.Questions about\u0026nbspthe paper’s statistical modelling\u0026nbspwere also raised by Columbia University in the US, prompting Surgisphere, the company that manages the database of patients used to inform the study, to\u0026nbspissue a public statement defending the integrity of the study.But now further questions have been raised about the Surgisphere database and the study methodology. The signatories to the open letter, directed to the Lancet and the study authors, include prominent sceptics of the value of using hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19. The letter lists 10 major concerns about the statistical analysis and data integrity of the study.“The authors have not adhered to standard practices in the machine learning and statistics community,” the letter states. “They have not released their code or data.”The Lancet is among the many signatories to a statement on data sharing for Covid-19 studies.“There was no ethics review,” the letter continues. “There was no mention of the countries or hospitals that contributed to the data source and no acknowledgments to their contributions. A request to the authors for information on the contributing centres was denied. Data from Australia are not compatible with government reports. Surgisphere have since stated this was an error of classification of one hospital from Asia. This indicates the need for further error checking throughout the database.”The letter also expressed concern about unusually small reported variances in baseline variables, interventions and outcomes between continents, despite significant differences in demographics.There is currently no strong, replicated evidence that any drug is effective for the treatment or prevention of Covid-19. This includes hydroxychloroquine, which has long been used for malaria and autoimmune diseases, but its safety and harm profile for treating those illnesses is understood. It is not well understood for Covid-19.Governments around the world have warned against using hydroxychloroquine for treating or preventing the virus, highlighting the drug’s potentially toxic side effects and potential to cause heart abnormalities. There have been serious reports of harm due to people self-medicating\u0026nbspwith hydroxychloroquine\u0026nbspand related drugs during the pandemic.\u0026nbspResearchers are not calling for clinical trials to be halted in the light of the Lancet study. There is a consensus that more strong studies are needed exploring treatments including antibiotics, antivirals and antimalarials. Australia has contacted the Lancet, Surgisphere and the authors of the study for a response to the concerns outlined in the letter.Surgisphere founder Dr Sapan Desai, also an author on the Lancet paper,\u0026nbspsaid before the release of the letter he appreciated the “enthusiasm and lively discussion with respect to our important multi-national observational registry study published in\u0026nbspthe Lancet medical journal”.“We appreciate the highly complimentary responses that we have received and the requests for data-driven partnerships as well as clarifications,” he said.“The analyses were carefully performed, and the interpretations provided were intentionally measured. We studied a very specific group of hospitalised patients with Covid-19 and have clearly stated that the results of our analyses should not be over-interpreted to those that have yet to develop such disease or those that have not been hospitalised. We also clearly outlined the limitations of an observational study that cannot fully control for unobservable confounding measures and concluded that off label use of the drug regimens outside of the context of a clinical trial should not be recommended.”Do you know more? melissa.davey@the"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/966d0d08f2902feb4d95a757e208a686e97da498/0_120_5211_3126/master/5211.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56a28803960c8dc886d8e82572319332","title":"cyprus cover cost holidays affected by coronavirus covid 19","story":"Free healthcare for Covid-19 patients and hotel expenses for dependents will give island unbeatable edge, it says The battle to lure tourists to the Mediterranean is hotting up with Cyprus declaring it will go one step further than its competitors, footing the bill for anyone whose holiday is ultimately ruined by coronavirus.\u0026nbspThe island says its decision to pick up the tab for infected tourists – providing free healthcare for Covid-19 patients and all hotel expenses for their dependents – will give it an unbeatable edge.\u0026nbspSavvas Perdios, the deputy tourism minister, said: “We will cover the cost of hospitalisation of those who test positive during their holiday. And pay for their families and close contacts to be accommodated in quarantine hotels.”While Britons are still banned from Cyprus, with local epidemiologists viewing Boris Johnson’s handling of the disease as catastrophic, Perdiossaid he hoped UK visitors would be allowed back in by early to mid-July. “The relevant list is updated continuously,” the tourism minister said.\u0026nbspThe only bills the Greek Cypriot government will not cover are those for repatriation flights and taxis to airports.\u0026nbspThe gesture to foreign tourists was outlined in a five-page letter to airlines and tour operators announcing the health protocols\u0026nbspthe island will adopt when it reopens to air travel on 9 June. It had been well received, Perdios\u0026nbspsaid. “Neither Greece nor Spain will be able to do this with the tourism volume they’ll have,” he said. “t’s greatly appreciated by our partners abroad and is being seen as one of our strong points this summer.”\u0026nbspIn the unprecedented era of coronavirus, the tourism industry is more desperate than ever to lure holidaymakers.\u0026nbspIn Sicily, the regional government\u0026nbspis planning to\u0026nbsppay for one of every three nights in hotels in a €50m (£45m) scheme to attract visitors, including overseas tourists, while Spain’s state-owned, high-end Parador chain of castles and stately homes, is offering giveaway stays for about €65 a night.\u0026nbspPerdios admits the tourist industry has taken “a massive hit” this year. Although the island has successfully\u0026nbspkept the pandemic in check, attracting visitors this summer is going to be a herculean task. In the Greek south there have been fewer than 950 confirmed coronavirus cases and 17 deaths, while the breakaway Turkish north proclaimed itself coronavirus-free several weeks ago. But with the former colony reliant on British tourists, Greek Cypriot officials say they will be lucky to get a third of the estimated 3.98 million people who visited last year.\u0026nbspPerdios says recognition of good healthcare, including availability of intensive care units, will play a crucial role when Cyprus readmits\u0026nbsptravellers from countries with similarly low infection rates next month.With that in mind, 112 ICUs equipped with 200 respirators have been reserved for critically ill patients while a 100-bed hospital has been earmarked to cater exclusively for foreign tourists who test positive. A 500-room “quarantine hotel” for relatives and close contacts will also be set up.\u0026nbspLike Greece, the island nation’s economy is heavily dependent on tourism and plans are afoot to extend the season into the winter – to attract visitors from the UK and other nations still struggling with the virus.\u0026nbspLetting any tourists in is a calculated risk.\u0026nbspIn the race to readmit them, Cypriot authorities are demanding that, initially, visitors carry health certificates proving they have tested negative for Covid-19 at least three days before departure.\u0026nbspFrom 20 June, when flights from 13 other, mostly central and eastern European countries resume, the precautionary measure will be lifted.\u0026nbspAt all times social distancing will have to be observed, be it at the pool, in the bar, cafes or pubs, with guests encouraged to pay with contactless cards and hotel staff obliged to wear masks.\u0026nbspOn Friday, Athens’s tourism ministry announced that from mid-June 29 countries would be able to resume air links with Greece. The list, which does not include nations still deemed to be Covid-19 hot-spots such as Spain, Italy and the UK, was broader than expected, reflecting the Greek government’s desire to kickstart the vital industry. Taking a page out of Cyprus’s tourism manual, Greece has quashed the idea of visitors having to be quarantined.But in the battle to entice a bigger share of the diminished tourism sector Athens has also gone one step better than Cyprus, nixing the notion of obligatory immunity certificates and announcing that\u0026nbspspot coronavirus tests will be conducted upon arrival at airports instead.\u0026nbspPopular islands that appear to have remained remarkably Covid-19 free are also joining the charm offensive, cutting prices at resorts and hotels with the aim of luring crowds when destinations are relinked to the outside world through direct international flights on 1 July.\u0026nbspFor the first time in decades, an overnight stay on the Cycladic isle jewel of Santorini will become affordable – even if industry figures say health protocols have added heavily to running costs.\u0026nbspThe party isle of Mykonos, whose prices last year surprised even the super-rich, is reportedly offering entire villas to rent for significantly low prices.Across the Mediterranean, industry figures concede that ultimately all eyes will be on Germany this year. The nation’s habit of holidaymakers moving south in the summer months, combined with Berlin’s relatively successful containment of Covid-19, has raised hopes – and with them ever more extravagant package tour offers.\u0026nbspWith Tui and other tour operators already aggressively promoting Greece, Cyprus, Spain and Portugal, hoteliers across the sea\u0026nbspare hoping for a share of German tourism."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8585f1425ff24aa67d7e97517c6304d3c2c8746b/0_75_5171_3105/master/5171.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=111c24c97462e76ec14d78e4b7e45bb2","title":"uk lockdown rules what are the key changes","story":"Varying rules for meeting outside will apply in England, Wales and Scotland The prime minister announced on Thursday that groups of up to six people could meet outdoors in England from Monday, permitting what he described as “a long-awaited and joyful moment” as family and friends reunite after 10 weeks in lockdown. He set out the next stage in the easing of restrictions with a caveat that “there may still be some anomalies, or apparent inconsistencies, in these rules”.The UK government was yet to publish the promised guidance on the new rules on Friday afternoon but here is what has been announced so far.Yes. Whereas people in England were previously allowed to meet one person from another household outside while maintaining a two-metre distance, from Monday, groups of up to six will be allowed to meet. People will be permitted to congregate in gardens and other private outdoor spaces, instead of just in public spaces, as Johnson said “there is no difference in the health risk”.The prime minister said people should try to avoid seeing people from too many households in quick succession, “so that we can avoid the risk of quick transmission from lots of different families and continue to control the virus”.The new rules apply to the over-70s but those considered extremely clinically vulnerable to the virus are still being asked to shield by staying at home.In Scotland, people from one household will be able to meet with another household outdoors in public spaces or a private garden from Friday, providing they maintain physical distancing. The first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said the maximum number of people in a group should be eight.The approach in Wales is similar. People in a household will be able to meet with one other household outdoors from Monday. In Northern Ireland, the Stormont executive plans to confirm its lockdown relaxation after a meeting on 4 June but it is expected to allow small outdoor wedding ceremonies, attended by no more than 10 people.Yes. “You can even have a barbecue providing you do it in a socially distanced way, provided everybody washes their hands, provided everybody exercises common sense,” said the prime minister. . The chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, added that those having a barbecue should remember they can spread the virus by passing things from one person to another.Yes and no. The UK government has said the science makes it clear the chances of spreading coronavirus is much smaller outside so socialising inside is not allowed.However, the prime minister said people could go through houses to access back gardens. Whitty also confirmed it was acceptable for people to use their host’s toilet, as long as they washed their hands thoroughly and wiped down surfaces afterwards.The Welsh government has also said it is OK for people to walk through someone’s home to get to their garden but they would be publishing guidance on how to do this safely.While people in England can travel as far as they want to take exercise and spend time outside, they cannot stay over at people’s houses. “We don’t want people to go to other households and stay there. I’m afraid we are not at that stage,” said Johnson.In Wales people are being asked to stay local, which is defined as about 8km (five miles) from their homes. Sturgeon said there would be no legal limit on how far people in Scotland could travel but she said the strong advice was to stay within five miles.Yes. Outdoor retail such as markets and car showrooms in England will be allowed to open in England from Monday. Other non-essential shops can open a fortnight later, as long as they abide by the guidelines.In Scotland, garden centres and plant nurseries will be able to open from Friday. The Welsh government will decide whether non-essential retail will reopen at their next lockdown review on 18 June, though they said such businesses, which could comply with the physical distancing duty, should prepare to reopen.The UK government confirmed it was pushing ahead with plans to open primary schools in England to some pupils from Monday, giving headteachers three days of half-term\u0026nbspholiday to make final preparations. Nurseries and childcare providers in England are also being told they can reopen from 1 June. However, some local authorities have insisted schools in their area will not be opening.In Scotland, teachers can return to schools from Monday to prepare for\u0026nbspthe start of the new school year on 11 August, when pupils will do a mixture of at-home and in-school learning. The governments in Wales and Northern Ireland have said schools will not reopen on Monday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ccb0a08d6b1f3bf500fbdffdc2628b795bd97ebd/0_44_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e08b4d6933f16af0571d822293ff111","title":"uruguay airport drive in coronavirus","story":"Entertainment-starved Uruguayans can enjoy a socially distanced movie from their own vehicle with snacks just a WhatsApp awayWith commercial flights cancelled around much of the world because of the coronavirus pandemic, one country has adapted its main airport to a new use: as a drive-in cinema.Instead of planes flying in and out of Uruguay’s Carrasco international airport, cars are now arriving nightly for Uruguayans to enjoy a socially distanced movie in the safety of their own vehicle.“It was fantastic,” said dentist Cecilia Muttoni who recently went to a screening of Sonic the Hedgehog with her 29-year-old daughter. “It was the chance to have a communal experience but with each car being its own private universe.”Uruguay closed all entertainment venues, including cinemas, when it went into lockdown on 13 March. The country also closed its borders for all air traffic except chartered repatriation flights.But now, Carrasco airport, located outside Uruguay’s capital city of Montevideo, is showing movies every day.“As a doctor, I’ve been moving around more, but for my daughter, who works at home, it was a great opportunity to go out safely,” said Muttoni.Among the movies being screened are Bohemian Rhapsody, The Lion King and Joker, among others, for around 100 cars each showing. The movies are projected on a giant 20-metre-high screen and the audio is piped into cars over a dedicated radio channel.“We are trying for people to stay in their cars as much as possible,” said airport official Mauricio Carluccio.Special consideration is shown, however, for the enthusiasm of children – some of whom, in their first outing in over two months, have stepped out of the car, as long as they don’t wander far off.Popcorn and McDonald’s can be ordered via WhatsApp. “You place your order, pay it with a credit or debit card to avoid additional contact and they bring it to your car wearing face masks,” said Muttoni.Airport toilets have been opened for movie-goers, who must wear face masks outside their cars. The toilet facilities are constantly disinfected and emergency mechanics are on standby in case of a vehicle breakdown.The promoters behind the project are planning on putting on music shows and standup comedy as well for the drive-in audience.Uruguay has so far had one of the lowest coronavirus tolls in Latin America, even as the region emerges as a hotspot for the pandemic. The tiny country of just 3.5 million people has had 803 confirmed cases of coronavirus and only 22 deaths so far.In contrast, neighbouring Brazil has had the second-most cases in the world after the USA, with about 412,000 cases and nearly 26,000 deaths.Uruguay reacted fast to its first cases in March, with a voluntary quarantine, widespread monitoring and tracking plus randomized tests. The government is still encouraging people to self-quarantine as it gradually starts to reopen but isolation is mandatory only for senior citizens."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7945888c6836589f5965b75a9363ddcc425d14a/229_77_4571_2743/master/4571.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5744180c19f646af0002516beeeecbe8","title":"us unemployment 40m coronavirus pictures","story":"America cities and towns are dealing with some of the highest unemployment rates since the Great Depression"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4265738.1590753973!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"q a could schools reopen before september in light of new health advice","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tOfficials are examining school reopening policies in other countries.

Photograph: Fethi BelaidAFP via Getty ImagesThere’s lots of commentary about reopening schools. How safe would it be to do this? Latest research by the HSE has concluded that schools are “not a high-risk setting” for the transmission of Covid-19. The report published in a European journal on infectious disease surveillance concludes that reopening of schools should be considered as an early rather than a late measure in the lifting of restrictions. On what evidence has the HSE based its conclusion that schools are “not a high-risk” setting?Public health experts examined all known cases of the virus in school settings in Ireland prior to the shutdown of schools on March 12th. There were six confirmed cases in all – three children and three adults.An examination of more than 1,000 contacts of these cases in the school settings found there were no confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the following two weeks.These contacts were exposed in classrooms, sports lessons, music lessons and choir practice for a religious ceremony which involved a number of schools mixed in a church setting.These findings echo similar research in Iceland, Italy and Australia. The authors conclude there are “no zero risk approaches, but the school environment appears to be low risk.”What is the Government’s stance on school reopening?The Government’s roadmap for reopening society still envisages schools reopening on a phased basis in September.Minister for Education Joe McHugh has confirmed this and warned of “massive” logistical work in reopening them safely.He pledged a “model” for reopening schools in September will be ready within a fortnight. What’s happening elsewhere in Europe?In the UK, schools are due to partially reopen on June 1st for pupils in reception (age four to five), year one (age five to six) and year six (age 10-11).What is the view of teachers, principals and parents over reopening schools in Ireland?Last month, teachers’ and principals’ representatives expressed a willingness to reopen schools in June, if it was deemed safe and in line with public health advice. However, since the Government ruled this out, their focus has shifted to ensuring detailed guidance and supports are in place to ensure schools can resume safely.The National Parents’ Council Primary has called for public health advice to be kept under regular review and for schools to be partially reopened in mid-June for some cohorts of students, if safe to do so.So, is there any chance schools will reopen in advance of September?There is still a possibility – though for a limited number of children. The Department of Education is working on a “summer programme” for children with disabilities and from disadvantaged backgrounds. This is likely to be a combination of online and in-school provision, according to Mr McHugh, if public health advice allows.The programme is an adaption of the “July provision” scheme, which benefits about 10,000 children each summer.What will school look like when it reopens? It is likely that schools will reopen in September with students attending on a rotating basis for certain days of the week and learning online at other times. School managers and teachers’ representatives have indicated it will be impossible to accommodate all children in school due to social distancing rules.It has ruled out the idea of having half-days for pupils, where some would attend school in the morning and the remainder in the afternoon, due to the added burden of cleaning classrooms and the staggering of drop-off and collection times.Mr McHugh has also said even if two-metre social distancing rules are reduced to a single metre, school will not be able to accommodate all pupils.How will schools implement social distancing?Most schools acknowledge it will be very difficult to implement these rules, especially at primary level.As a result, school managers have suggested students could stay in groups or “pods”. For example, the same group of ten students would attend school together and play together at breaktime. In addition, sharing of desks, books, devices and other materials would be minimised.When will we get a clear idea if what, exactly, is planned for schools in Ireland?The Minister for Education has said officials are examining school reopening policies in other countries and will have a “model” produced within the next fortnight. There will likely be a large degree of flexibility in the plan given the ersity in the size of schools in Ireland.

Photograph: Crispin RodwellSince early March seven weather stations have experienced an “absolute drought,” which is 15 consecutive days without rain. Drought-like conditions have been most apparent in Dublin where the Phoenix Park weather station had 42 days from March 18th to April 28th, in which just 5.8mm of rain fell. Very little rain has fallen in this month so far either. Just 9.5mm of rain has fallen to date, and the average for May in Dublin is 59.5mm.The fine weather is set to continue over the bank holiday weekend, with temperatures to range from 20 to 25 degrees. The weather on Friday is to be dry and sunny throughout the day, with some cloud cover in the west of the country, and colder breezes along the southwest coast. Temperatures on Saturday will range from highs of 20 to 25 degrees, with clear skies and strong sunshine in most places, according to Met Éireann’s forecast. The west of the country will see cloudier weather, with temperatures along the southern and eastern coasts slightly lower than other parts due to coastal breezes. Saturday night will remain dry and warm in most parts, with temperatures only dropping to 10 degrees overnight. The sunny weather will continue into the weekend and likely through to early next week, the national forecaster has said. Top temperatures on Sunday will reach 24 degrees, during another dry and sunny day. Sea breezes will mean it is slightly cooler along the southern and eastern coasts, with the north and west of the country to be cloudier. Sunday night will remain dry, with some spells of mist and fog patches in parts, and temperatures of nine to 12 degrees overnight. The current outlook for the bank holiday Monday is temperatures of between 22 and 25 degrees, and more dry and sunny weather for the most part. Met Éireann has said there is a risk of light rain showers in the afternoon, and moderate easterly breezes. Temperatures are to begin to drop from Tuesday, and continue to fall into the week down to the mid-teens, the forecaster has said. Gerry Murphy, Met Éireann meteorologist, said the country was set for an “amazing weekend” of “very pleasant weather.”There was a chance of a “drop” of rain on the edge of the west coast, but even that might hold off, he said. “Overall it’s a dry, bright weekend,” he said.

Photograph: Dave ThompsonPAThe Minister of Education Joe McHugh has said it is difficult to see all students being able to return to school in September if the two-metre social distancing rule remains in place.Schools are due to reopen on a phased basis in early September, according to the Government’s road map for lifting Covid-19 restrictions.Mr McHugh told RTÉ radio’s Today with Sarah McInerney that the Department of Education will publish a road map for the reopening of schools in two weeks.He said: “With the two-metre rule still in place it’s hard to see all students being back in September.”Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan, who has resisted calls to support a reduction in the two-metre rule, rejected the suggestion that Mr McHugh’s comments added extra pressure on his deliberations.He told the National Public Health Emergency Team media briefing on Thursday: “We have a clear job to do to assess and provide the best advice we can based on the available evidence and guidance that might exist around any of the public health measures that we have recommended.Set of measuresDr Holohan said the two metre guidance had been part of an inter-linked set of measures that had helped Ireland suppress the virus.“This is the set of measures that’s worked,” he said.“We think that now is not the time to change any inidual one or indeed to overly focus on the importance of one to the exclusion of others.“It’s the interaction between all of these different measures, including the personal behaviours that we have recommended, that have achieved the suppression of the infection that we’ve been able to achieve in this country.“And as we move through the various different phases we’ll keep all those measures under review. If we think that either the evidence available to us or the experience that we’re seeing in other countries suggests that we should make a change in relation to one of those then we will do exactly that.”Meanwhile, the majority of students have signed up to the Leaving Certificate calculated grades system.Mr McHugh said efforts will be made to reach out to students who have not signed up ahead of Thursday night’s 10pm deadline.As of 9am on Thursday, 56,000 students had signed up.He said: “I would encourage the remaining students to get going and if they are having problems they can contact the online helpline.” – PAEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and

nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus. A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this. The issue may become a headache for the Democratic Party as the primary process progresses."},{"url":null,"title":"introducing planet normal new telegraph podcast talks normal","story":"Sick of gotcha political coverage? Tired of the relentless negativity of the news cycle? Bored of endlessly cynical mainstream broadcasters?Then this is the podcast you’ve been looking for: Planet Normal - because some journalists are normal people too.Yet Pearson and Halligan have much in common. They both boast high-level political access – and lace politics into their writing, although rarely from a “Westminster village” perspective. They both have older children and, unlike so many London-centric journalists, live outside the M25.What unites them, above all, is that Pearson and Halligan are staunchly and proudly “normal” – both hailing from unflashy, proletarian, non-professional backgrounds, the first in their respective families to go to university. That’s one reason they share a reputation for shrewd political analysis and trend-spotting - knowing in their bones, often before the Westminster crowd, how “ordinary people” think.“You know that moment when you’re watching a TV panel discussion and finally – finally! – someone says something you agree with,” says Pearson. “That’s what Planet Normal is all about!”Pearson and Halligan have between them spent almost forty years penning national newspaper columns, winning countless awards for their writing and broadcasting. They both feel strongly that the media is now far less representative of the broader UK population than when they started out.“It’s become much harder in recent years for people from ordinary backgrounds to break into high-end journalism,” says Halligan. “We\u0027ve made progress in terms of gender and ethnic ersity, but there’s now far less ersity in terms of opinion – with much of the broadcast media, in particular, dominated by privileged insiders holding the same approved views”.Planet Normal is a small but spirited attempt to counter that. In their 30-minute weekly podcast, Pearson and Halligan will review the news in the same sharp, irreverent, down-to-earth style they bring to their writing. The emphasis will be on calling out pomposity, lifting the lid on reality and countering political spin.And, on their trips to Planet Normal, Pearson and Halligan will be bringing along fabulous guests for the ride, representing all parts of the news cosmos – from politics to showbiz, from finance to culture – while responding to questions from Planet Normal listeners.Planet Normal - because some journalists are normal people too.To make sure you never miss an episode, subscribe on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pocket Casts, or search \u0027Planet Normal\u0027 on your podcast app.Join Liam Halligan and Allison Pearson in the comments section of this article at 1pm (BST) today to discuss their new podcast and more.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"emily maitlis overstepped mark says bbc new statement cummings","story":"The BBC has doubled down on its censure of Emily Maitlis by saying she had “overstepped the mark” in her Newsnight monologue, after the corporation was flooded with complaints about her treatment.Initially, the BBC released a short statement saying the presenter had breached impartiality rules. The public reprimand left Ms Maitis so upset that she asked to be dropped from Wednesday night’s programme.By Thursday afternoon, at least 20,000 people had contacted the BBC to complain. Some were objecting to Ms Maitlis’s speech, but the majority are thought to have been criticising the BBC’s handling of the affair. Supporters had circulated a link on social media to the BBC complaints website.Colleague of Ms Maitlis were also in “uproar” over the reprimand.In a response that threatens to inflame the situation further, the BBC released a lengthy explanation for its actions. The broadcaster said: “Our editorial guidelines allow us to make professional judgments but not to express opinion.“The iding line can be fine, but we aim to say so if we think we have overstepped the mark.It said Ms Maitlis’s introduction “risked giving the perception that the BBC was taking sides and expressing an opinion, rather than being impartial.”Ms Maitlis had asserted that: “Dominic Cummings broke the rules. The country can see that and it’s shocked the Government cannot.” She added that people who had stuck to the rules now felt like “fools”.The BBC said: “But there are some who do not share this opinion, nor think that the issue is a ‘scandal’ or the Prime Minister has displayed ‘blind loyalty’.“By presenting a matter of public and political debate as if the country was unanimous in its view, we consider Newsnight risked giving the perception that the BBC was taking sides. It added: “Our audiences hold the BBC in high trust, not least because we hold ourselves to exacting standards, and we do not want to forfeit this by ignoring our own rules.”The statement insisted that “this is not a question of apportioning blame to anyone”. But it is likely to infuriate Newsnight colleagues who believe Ms Maitlis was vindicated by the police statement on Mr Cummings’ trip to Barnard Castle.The matter will now be investigated formally by the BBC’s executive complaints unit if any of the complainants choose to pursue it - raising the possibility that Ms Maitlis may end up being cleared of a rule breach.Maitlis confirmed that she had “asked for the night off” from Wednesday’s programme, dismissing reports that the BBC had replaced her with another presenter.Sources within the BBC said there is a great deal of anger over the decision by the BBC News department, led by Fran Unsworth, to issue the statement.They argued that Newsnight is not a straight news programme in the mould of the Six O’Clock or 10 O’Clock bulletins but falls in the greyer area of current affairs and discussion, and that Andrew Neil was allowed to deliver provocative monologues on his political shows.John Sweeney, who reported for Newsnight and Panorama before leaving the BBC last year, said that the BBC’s new director-general must “end the chasm” between current affairs and news.One Conservative MP, Daniel Kawczynski, said Maitls’s “aggressive” interviewing style meant Newsnight would struggle to book Tory MPs and ministers in future.Daniel Kawczynski said he had declined to appear on Tuesday’s edition of the show and likened appearing on Newsnight to “entering a bullring”, with interviews akin to a “bloodsport”.On Twitter, he described Maitlis as “extraordinarily aggressive, unnecessarily rude, biased and confrontational to the point of intimidation”.He later told the : “Colleagues will not go on to news channels like Newsnight where it’s more of a theatrical bloodsport than the sensible exchange of views.“This programme, I hope and expect, will wither on the vine because as they fail to get guests more and more people will turn off. If you’re a backbench MP you also have your constituents to think about.

Just 15 per cent of people left their home every day over the same period.Professor Bobby Duffy, Director of the Policy Institute at King’s College London, said: “That four in 10 people did not leave their home for five or more of the previous seven days, with one in seven not leaving their home at all indicates the seriousness with which the public are still treating the Covid-19 crisis.“The UK government’s advice may have shifted to ‘stay alert’, but it’s the ‘stay at home’ message that the public are continuing to follow. “The public’s continued focus on saving lives and protecting health means the government may struggle to coax some people out of lockdown when the rules are eased further.” Yet despite the downsides, many people have started to enjoy aspects of the unprecedented confinement, with one in five saying they have more money than usual left over at the end of the month.The latest results also show people are becoming more resilient to the situation, with many feeling that they can now cope and resigning themselves to long term changes.Nearly half of people - 49 per cent - said that they had enjoyed some aspects of the lockdown measures, while just 26 per cent said there was nothing they had enjoyed.Just over half - 53 per cent - say they are finding coronavirus stressful, down 11 points from 64 per cent last month.Compared with the beginning of April, 38 per cent say the current measures will not become extremely difficult to cope with, up from 26 per cent in the second week of lockdown. Prof Duffy added: “The British public is showing signs of resilience. Not just in keeping to the rules, but also in looking for positives, and engaging in pro-social behaviours like helping others or clapping for carers. “Compared with six weeks ago, compliance to lockdown measures remains high with 92 per cent still following the two-metre rule, 90 per cent hand washing and 89 per cent covering the mouth when coughing. More than half say they are washing or disinfecting items they bring into their homes and 38 per cent are now wearing face masks, double the 19 per cent who had worn them six weeks ago.People are also growing more scared about being hospitalised from the virus, with 40 per cent now thinking they would end up in hospital compared to 30 per cent in April, even though Imperial College estimates the chance to be about 4.4 per cent.Half of people say it would be acceptable for most children to continue to be home-schooled for the very long term if a vaccine or treatment is not found, which researchers described as ‘an extraordinary societal shift.’Gideon Skinner, Research Director at Ipsos MORI, said: “This extensive and detailed study of public opinion and behaviours during the crisis shows that the public are taking the coronavirus very seriously. “As well they might – quite apart from the direct risks, the crisis is having an impact for many people on their financial and mental health too (even though people tend to worry more about others than for themselves). “While many are preparing for the long term, uncertainty continues, and the full impact of the changes the crisis might bring are still to be completely understood.”Yet there are signs that patience with measures is starting to wane. The new figures show that 14 per cent have now had friends or family visit them at home, nearly triple the five per cent who had done the same in the last survey.Nearly one third now say they are certain or very likely to face significant financial difficulties because of the coronavirus, up from 18 per cent six weeks ago.Three in 10 people have had to cut back on non-essential spending, but 21 per cent have had more money left at the end of the month. While 30 per cent have experienced reductions in their income, just six per cent said they had struggled to buy food or essential items and only 5 per cent said they could no longer afford to pay the rent or mortgage. Some 30 per cent of people now do not expect life to return to normal for two or more years, up from nine per cent six weeks ago. The study is based on 2,254 interviews with UK residents aged 16-75, between April 1 to 3 and May 20 - 22.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"people infected coronavirus never show symptoms","story":"The vast majority of people who contract coronavirus never show any symptoms, the first analysis of antibody tests by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has shown, leading to fears the new test, track and trace programme will not work.Under government plans, those showing symptoms are required to self-isolate and be tested while the NHS app will inform people who have been in close contact so they can also quarantine.But new figures show 70 per cent of people testing positive for the virus do not have symptoms at the time of their test, or in the week before or after. Just 21 per cent reported symptoms on the actual day of testing.Likewise for people who reported a symptom on the day of the swab test, only 2.6 per cent were actually found to have coronavirus.  Latest government testing figures also show that just 1.5 per cent of people are currently testing positive for the virus even though most are reporting symptoms.The findings suggest that the government’s test, track and trace policy will fail to pick up at least seven in 10 cases and most people who suffer symptoms will not actually have the virus.Commenting on the new figures, Prof Kevin McConway, Emeritus Professor of Applied Statistics, The Open University, said:  “Most people who tested positive, about 70 per cent of them, did not report any symptoms at all. “There here are potential implications for the effectiveness of tracking and tracing the contacts of people with symptoms, if high numbers of infected people don’t actually have symptoms anyway, or if many people with symptoms don’t actually have the infection.”The results are based on the 885 iniduals who took part in the ongoing Covid-19 Infection Survey run by the ONS and University of Oxford. Peter Benton, Director of Population and Public Policy Operations at the ONS said, that it was crucial to continue social distancing if so many people are infected without realising.“We don’t know what that means about whether they are infectious, but my advice would be that if it is the case that 70 per cent of people who test positive are asymptomatic then it’s important to continue social distancing.”The new results also show that 6.78 per cent of the population has tested positive for the virus, suggesting one in 15 people has been infected in England and Wales or nearly 3.8 million people.It means that infection has around a one per cent average mortality rate, which is close to the 0.9 per cent estimated by Imperial College in March. Separate ONS testing from 10,000 households suggests that between May 11 and May 24 an average of 133,000 people had coronavirus at any given time. The number of new infections is currently at 54,000 a week or nearly 8,000 a day meaning that one in 1,000 people will be infected every seven days. Prof Daniel Altmann, Professor of Immunology, Imperial College London, said: “The level of infections in the community continues to rumble along at a low level. “In terms of assessing your behaviour and risk-management as we shift out of lockdown, this means that, on average, every time you’re in a crowd of 400-500 people (such as a rush-hour tube platform), one person may be unknowingly shedding virus. “You may want to keep some distance in case they’re the person pressed right up next to you.”Experts said the new results showed that there had not been a hidden iceberg of infections, and certainly not enough in the community to build herd immunity without a vaccine. However Sir Patrick Vallance warned that there was still a risk of infection in the community and that the country should be prepared for local outbreaks. “Numbers are coming down at the moment but they are not coming down fast,” he told the daily press briefing.  “We are in a fragile state.“It’s worth remembering that we still have a significant burden of infection, we are still seeing new infections everyday.“There is not a lot of room to do things and things need to be done cautiously step by step and monitored and the test and trace system needs to be effective to manage that.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"double standards show disgrace telegraph readers weeks top","story":"Dominic Cummings’ trip to Durham during the height of lockdown has been at the top of the news agenda this week.The Prime Minister\u0027s decision to publicly support his special adviser has caused alarm among some members of the Cabinet as well as to many outside of politics. But what happens next? Has Dominic Cummings ultimately survived the calls for him to resign or are there still unanswered questions that must be addressed? Emily Maitlis\u0027s Newsnight monologue, the credibility of the UK\u0027s lockdown and the prospect of a post-Brexit trade deal with the US have also dominated this week\u0027s headlines.  readers have shared their views on all of these, plus much more, below.Read on to see what your fellow readers had to say on the week’s top stories and share your own views in the comments section below. Charles Moore believes that the mean-spirited attempt to destroy Dominic Cummings and unhorse the Prime Minister failed this week.  readers have shared their opinions on what a busy few days in Westminster will mean for Boris Johnson\u0027s premiership moving forward. “The Remainer media saw one last chance to reverse or neuter Brexit, by doing down Dominic Cummings and thereby weakening Boris Johnson. That is a perfectly legitimate political aim. But the double standards on show are a disgrace. Labour MPs and Ministers can attend birthday parties, picnics and, regretfully, funerals and no one raises an eyebrow.“Photographers and journalists are cheek by jowl in their desperation to interrogate Mr Cummings, yet not a whisper is heard. The PM’s adviser tries to protect his child and all hell breaks loose. This affair was entirely political nothing to do with public health.”“Dominic Cummings came across very well. Modest, sincere, honest, thoughtful and deeply concerned about his family and country. He managed to shine the light on the media and opposition lies that have contributed to this hysteria and led to public anger, without losing his cool (no mean feat).“The media\u0027s questions were repetitive, accusatory and pre-rehearsed and so completely ignored what he had just said – just intended to propagate their own untruths.”“The problem is lack of clarity. Boris Johnson is a master of ambiguity disguising indecision. Very few people have seen or knew where to look for the rather vague rule that gave the right to a parent to take a child somewhere considered to be safer. The constant command was to stay at home. Nothing was said of making one\u0027s own judgement to ignore it and no doubt many people could have used Dominic Cummings’ excuse but did not due to unawareness.“Mr Cummings’ total lack of personal charm does not help to appease the public on what appears to be a borderline case of acting properly or not.”In response to the Cummings saga, Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis caused a political storm on Tuesday evening when she opened the BBC\u0027s Newsnight show by announcing: Dominic Cummings broke the rules. The country can see that and it’s shocked the Government cannot. She failed to appear on the show on Wednesday, and the BBC went on to clarify that her monologue from the previous night had breached impartiality guidelines.  readers have had their say on what should happen next. “I have remnants of nostalgia for the once world-renowned BBC. The days of Frost, Day, Walden. The superb drama and documentaries. The informative and thought-provoking news items.  “But, sadly, those days are gone.”“During the 2016 referendum campaign the BBC was scrupulously fair. Once the result came in, however, all bets were off. Dimbleby’s ashen face appeared to be a signal to anyone at the BBC to begin working against the result. Emily Maitlis’s intemperate and incautious monologue was emblematic of that tendency.”Reports have indicated that the Government is looking at new plans to increase outdoor contact by allowing two households to meet up in public next month. Is it a good idea? Here’s what our readers had to say.“Behind the curve again. Round here people have been assessing the rates of Covid-19 and likely risks and close family have had socially distanced meet ups in the garden for some time. It\u0027s been known for a very long time that transmission rates in the open air are almost nil. What\u0027s the difference between meeting in the garden and all arriving at the supermarket queue at the same time. No logic to any of this.”“Oh for goodness sake, let people see whoever they like in their family. In the first place, how are people expected to choose one of their adult children and possibly set of grandchildren over another? Secondly, isn’t family the easiest track and trace exercise ever? If you’re meeting family you know exactly who was there and in the increasingly unlikely event someone shows symptoms, two or three phone calls is all that’s necessary.”“Most people are doing this already. I feel that the government\u0027s policy is actually followership rather than leadership. It is deliberately following public opinion in the hope of not antagonising it. If this is true, it is a demonstrably failed policy. It turns out that in times of threat, the population is actually very grateful for firm and decisive leadership.”Former Environment Secretary Theresa Villiers is calling for food standards to be enshrined into the Agricultural Bill. It is understood that George Eustice, the current Environment Secretary, fears cheap US products will threaten British farmers. But where do  readers stand on the debate?“As markets change so must players in those markets. For 40 years UK farmers have been tied to the EU Museum of Farming aka the CAP designed to benefit French smallholders. Now if farmers want to stay in business they must compete in a different market.“If they cannot lower costs like US farmers they must compete on quality. Many people will buy free range organic chicken over factory farmed chicken and organic beef over American factory farmed beef. That is their choice. The free market is about consumer choice not about defending vested interests.”“I expect the biggest losers in an UK-US FTA will be French farmers who are heavily subsidised by their government. But yes, those British farmers unwilling to follow good business practices may find difficult times ahead.“This may be an excellent time for all British companies to review and improve their business models. After all we are now to become a world trader.”@Death and Taxes“Let customers decide. Personally I don’t care where my chicken comes from as long as I am getting good value for my money.”Allison Pearson, infuriated by the Government’s reluctance to ease further lockdown restrictions, has had enough and booked a holiday in July.  readers, for the most part, appeared to agree that now is the time to slowly resume normal life.“The 14-day quarantine is probably the most insane reaction of this government, even worse than the house arrest of all British citizens. It probably had some value in January and February but why now when the pandemic is fizzling out?”“Surely quarantine should depend on where you’ve returned from. If you’ve been mad enough to holiday in Brazil then, yes, a bit of isolation might be a good idea but if you’ve been to a country with fewer or similar numbers of Covid-19 cases than the UK it’s a fatuous idea.“I had high hopes for Boris Johnson but I’m beginning to wonder.”“I know it\u0027s easy to be an armchair critic, and that the Government has had to react to changing situations, but this quarantine idea is bizarre. “It comes on top of the NHS shunting Covid-19 patients into care homes and the abandonment of track and trace in mid-March.

The national government and local authorities are encouraging people to avoid crowded metros, buses and trams without resorting to cars.The Paris authorities have created 30 miles of extra cycle routes in the past month, and nearly 50 miles of new bike lanes are to be provided in Lyon this summer.In the two weeks since France began loosening restrictions, bike use has jumped 53 per cent from its pre-lockdown level, according to the Paris city council. “There is undeniably a post-lockdown bike effect,” said Christophe Najdovski, a deputy mayor in charge of transport. “If you create quality cycling lanes, more cyclists appear.”Anne Hidalgo, the mayor, has cut private car use in recent years, pedestrianising the banks of the Seine and restricting traffic in the heavily polluted French capital.Before the Covid-19 pandemic, she promised to create 870 miles of bike lanes by the end of this year. Many Parisians delighted by the cleaner air and decreased noise during lockdown are now backing Ms Hidalgo’s efforts to prevent the city returning to its car-clogged past, despite objections by motorists’ groups.One of Paris’s busiest roads, the rue de Rivoli, which runs past the Louvre museum, has been closed to private cars. It now has four bike lanes and one for buses, taxis and emergency vehicles. France is pumping £17 million into promoting cycling. Bike owners are eligible for free repairs of up to €50 by approved mechanics, and the Paris authority will pay up to €500 (£452) towards the cost of an electric bicycle.“Some economists predict that bike use will overtake cars by 2030, but with the current dynamic that could happen by 2025,” Mr Najdovski said.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"people shielding coronavirus feeling left behind lockdown measures2","story":"The heads of almost 50 charities have written to ministers saying the lifting of the lockdown with little reference to those deemed too vulnerable to leave home, is making their burden even harder to bear.Around 2.2 million people classed as extremely vulnerable have spent more than two months shielding, after being issued with advices to stay home completely, and rely on food deliveries and medication being dropped off. When the measures came in, they were told they would last for 12 weeks. Since then, the Government has given no timeframe on when lockdown measures for such people - who including those being treated for cancer, and sufferers from conditions like severe asthma, cystic fibrosis and arthritis - will be lifted. A letter from 48 charity leaders to the Cabinet Office calls for clear guidance on what to do when the current 12-week lockdown period for the most vulnerable ends.And he said some of those confined to their own homes were struggling to access food and medicine, with others making difficult decisions about whether they could return to work.He said: It\u0027s simply not acceptable that they just get a message that they are going to have to continue to do this for some time longer, they need to understand what that means and what support is available.Macmillan is hearing from people who feel left behind and forgotten, who got a letter at the start of March telling them to stay in total lockdown, not to leave the house, not to see anyone, to protect themselves.They feel there has been a huge lack of communication to help them understand what lockdown means for them.Other signatories to the letter include the British Lung Foundation, Asthma UK, the MS Society, Versus Arthritis Kidney Care UK and the Cystic Fibrosis Trust. The charities said the impact of the enforced captivity on the mental health of vulnerable people was particularly concerning.Mr Mcintosh said: All of society has been struggling with the impact of lockdown, but for someone with a severe medical condition... already having spent three months in total lockdown without leaving the house, and now spending further months with a lot of uncertainty about what that means for them, that is incredibly bleak and distressing.Many of them feel that they are seeing the days of their lives ticking away without any certainty as to when they are going to be able to see their loved ones, leave their house, or live their lives to the fullest.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"travel restrictions uk remains closed europe reopens tourists","story":"A number of hotels across the country are already preparing to open their doors to tourism, including the luxury Villa D’Este hotel on Lake ComoWhen can we go on holiday again?Can I take a UK holiday yet? Will holidays be cheaper after coronavirus?Get updates to your inbox three times a week with our Travel newsletterAt the government’s daily press briefing on May 28, Boris Johnson announced imminent changes for schools, retail and social interactions, but the lifting of travel restrictions remained on the backburner. Since his speech on May 10 where it was announced that hotels and restaurants may be able to reopen in England on July 4 at the earliest, there has been no further information. This date is dependent on a number of factors and will not be confirmed until closer to the time. There have been no official statements about a date for when international travel will be allowed again either.Meanwhile, across Europe a number of countries are already beginning to lift restrictions so that domestic and international travel can return in a phased way. Norway has announced it will allow entry to business travellers from all the other Nordic countries, including Sweden, from June 1 with no quarantine required. The inclusion of Sweden was a point of contention, given the country has a significantly higher rate of Covid-19 infections, but in the end Norway opted for a blanket rule.Across the Channel in France, cafés, restaurants and bars can reopen as of June 2. The ban that was in place in regards to distance you are allowed to travel, previously no more than 100km (60 miles), has also been relaxed.

Restoring the normal functioning of the Schengen area of free movement is our first objective as soon as the health situation allows it.

Yet once we can travel again (perhaps thanks to bilateral travel agreements, or air bridges, which would circumvent quarantine measures) the pandemic is set to alter the experience for the foreseeable future. Socially distanced, or strictly al fresco, dining, reduced capacity at major attractions and obligatory face masks may greet us in tourist hot spots – but their pretty tracts of greenery will provide a slice of normality.

Naturally, grounded flights and international travel bans are the main reason for this sudden drop.Lockdown is being gradually eased in Portugal now though – restaurants, cafes, museums and art galleries were included in the second stage of reopening on May 18, the third stage is set to begin in June.Foreign Minister Augusto Santos Silva said on May 22 that the country was open to international visitors. “Tourists are welcome in Portugal,” Mr Silva told the Observador newspaper, adding that some health checks would be carried out at airports but that there would be no compulsory quarantine for arrivals.For the latest information on when British holidaymakers will be able to visit Portugal, click here.France is to reopen bars, cafés and restaurants and lift internal travel restrictions from June 2 as part of “phase 2” of its lockdown exit plan.

Regular testing of couriers is still not being carried out but those with symptoms are now being tested, TDL said on Thursday.Whether ‘test and trace’ has been rushed or not – it’s a poor launchTDL describes itself as the “largest UK independent provider of highly specialised pathologyclinical laboratory services to clinicians (GPs and specialists), hospitals, community health services, and their patients”.Its network of couriers collect and drop off medical samples such as blood tests from hospitals and surgeries before delivering them to labs for analysis. During the pandemic they have entered hospitals with a high number of Covid-19 patients to pick up testing samples.The Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB), which represents the couriers, says that this potentially puts them at high risk of infection but the company has not engaged with their safety requests. The union wants regular testing and adequate personal protective equipment (PPE), as well as full sick pay for workers who need to self-isolate because they are aged over 60 or have pre-existing medical conditions. It also alleges that TDL has not implemented proper social distancing in the company’s loading bay.The IWGB has filed a trade union and whistleblower victimisation claim against the company at the employment tribunal on behalf of eight of its members, who say they were targeted for redundancy on “bogus” grounds.The eight workers believe the company is attempting to make them redundant because of their involvement in previous disputes over issues including rider safety and pay.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailTDL strongly rejected the IWGB’s allegations. It said only 46 of its 157-strong workforce had voted to strike based on “unfounded” allegations which the company categorically denies. IWGB said that 84 per cent of members who returned their ballots voted in favour of industrial action.A TDL spokesperson added: “It is inconceivable that TDL would deliberately expose any of its workforce, of whom its courier fleet is an important part, to undue risk at any time but especially now. “All TDL’s health and safety protocols, which includes access to Covid-19 testing for those with symptoms, are compliant with current regulations and UK Government guidelines, are kept under constant review by TDL’s director of health and safety, and when they change, TDL’s protocols change with them.”The company said it proposed to make its team of 10 bicycle couriers redundant because of a downturn in the London area where they operate. A final decision has not yet been made.TDL cycle courier and IWGB couriers and logistics branch chair Alex Marshall said: “I’m incredibly proud of the work we have done during this pandemic. “TDL’s cycle couriers are among the best in the industry, have an impeccable attendance record and in times of tremendous stress have provided a model service to the community. “Instead of rewarding us, management has decided to take away our only means to feed our families in the middle of a pandemic.

During the pandemic they have entered hospitals with a high number of Covid-19 patients to pick up testing samples.The Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB), which represents the couriers, says that this potentially puts them at high risk of infection but the company has not engaged with their safety requests.

If it has water and oxygen, it could potentially be home to\u0026nbspalien lifeA planet the size of Earth has been confirmed around the closest star in our solar system, Proxima Centauri, by an international team of scientists.The planet, called ‘Proxima b’, has a mass of 1.17 Earths and is located in the habitable zone of Proxima Centauri, which the planet orbits approximately every 11 days, according to the new paper published in the journal Astronomy \u0026amp Astrophysics.The first indications of the planet’s existence were in 2013 by Mikko Tuomi of the University of Hertfordshire from archival observation data, with continued research following in 2016. It is believed this planet could be “likely” to be able to support alien life forms.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe researchers detected this planet by measuring radial velocity using the Echelle SPectrograph for Rocky Exoplanets and Stable Spectroscopic Observations (ESPRESSO) which is installed on a telescope in Chile. It is three times as accurate as HARPS, another spectrograph which has been used to measure the velocity of Proxima Centauri.Radial velocity, in relation to a given point, is the rate of change of the distance between an object and that point. As a planet orbits a star, its gravitational pull causes a star to move back and forth. This tiny motion shifts the observed light spectrum of the star slightly due to Doppler shift, which can be detected with sensitive instruments.Everything you need to know about SpaceX launchA low disturbance in Proxima Centauri’s speed, detected by ESPRESSO, tipped researchers off to the presence of the planet. Nobel Prize-winning astrophysicist Michel Mayor said that ESPRESSO makes it possible to “measure the mass of the planet with a precision of over one-tenth of the mass of Earth”, which he describes as “completely unheard of.Proxima Centauri is approximately 4.2 light-years from the Sun, but Nasa estimates it would take approximately 73,000 years for us to reach the planet unless new technologies are developed.Ionic propulsion, nuclear thermal propulsion, nuclear pulse propulsion, fusion rockets, and laser sails have all been considered as methods to travel to the planet.Mysterious signals coming from space answer matter puzzle30 years of space wonder began with a vital but underwhelming imageSpace Force launch: Robotic rocket plane blasts off on secret missionAstronomers find \u0027regular rhythms\u0027 coming from distant starsSpace debris from failed rocket misses New York City by minutes“We were already very happy with the performance of HARPS, which has been responsible for discovering hundreds of exoplanets over the last 17 years,” said Francesco Pepe, a professor in the Astronomy Department in UNIGE’s Faculty of Science in a statement. “We’re really pleased that ESPRESSO can produce even better measurements, and it’s gratifying and just reward for the teamwork lasting nearly 10 years.”Alejandro Suarez Mascareño, the article’s main author, said: “Confirming the existence of Proxima b was an important task, and it’s one of the most interesting planets known in the solar neighbourhood.”Although Proxima b is about 20 times closer to its star than the Earth is to the Sun, it receives comparable amounts of energy. If there is liquid form on the planet, it could harbour life, but researchers said there is still much to be done before that can be confirmed. “Is there an atmosphere that protects the planet from these deadly rays?” said Christophe Lovis, a researcher in the University of Geneva’s Astronomy Department, “and if this atmosphere exists, does it contain the chemical elements that promote the development of life?”It is also possible that there could be a second planet orbiting the star, as the research team found evidence of a second signal in the data – but was unable to determine its origins. “If the signal was planetary in origin, this potential other planet accompanying Proxima b would have a mass less than one third of the mass of the Earth. It would then be the smallest planet ever measured using the radial velocity method,” said Professor Pepe.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The four-part documentary features the testimonies of multiple survivors who say they were abused by the disgraced financier.Its first episode focuses in part on an investigation conducted in 2011 by journalist Vicky Ward for Vanity Fair.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAccording to Ward, Epstein became threatening when he found out Ward was working on a piece about him, telling her that if he didn’t “like” it, “it’s going to be bad for you and your family”.19 best limited series for TV commitment-phobesThe best Amazon Prime and Netflix shows to watch while self-isolatingNetflix to automatically cancel ‘hundreds of thousands’ of accountsJeffrey Epstein: Netflix documentary brings to light new allegationsThe journalist goes on to recall a phone call from Carter, in which she says he shared additional concerning news.“He was pretty spooked because he’d found a severed cat head in his garden,” Ward says.“He also found a bullet on his doorstep.”Ward goes on to state that part of her story with testimony from two women who shared allegations against Epstein were ultimately taken out, which she attributed to an editorial decision on the magazine’s part.Carter disputed Ward’s recollection in a statement provided to the documentary and said that parts of Ward’s reporting “did not meet our legal threshold” at the time.

The issue has now been resolved and we apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused.The outage came as users across the country rely on their connections to work and study from home. While the internet infrastructure has stayed largely stable despite the new working patterns, any outage can very quickly cause widespread problems.Problems were reported right across the country, according to Down Detector. While the area around London, Cardiff and Birmingham saw the most reports, that is likely to be simply a result of where most people are trying to get online.TalkTalk\u0027s status website suggested that all of its services, including broadband, were still online. We\u0027ve no reported issues with Broadband right now, a message on the site read.But the company\u0027s official Twitter page was being sent a flurry of reports, to which it replied with apologies and sent users back to that service status page.It had not sent out any public tweet acknowledging the issues or giving any indication of when they might be fixed.Earlier this month, regulator Ofcom said that internet speeds were largely performing as normal, despite some high-profile outages.Created with Sketch.Coronavirus: London on lockdown Show all 29Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A man walks down a deserted Camden High StreetGoodge Street Station is one of the many stations closed to help reduce the spreadAn empty street in the heart of ChinatownPeople in masks in Chinatown a day after the lockdownA near-empty Piccadilly Circus during the first week of lockdownSonja, my neighbour, who I photographed while taking a short walk.

Users can decide whether they want everyone to be able to reply, only the people they follow, only people they directly mention in the tweet, or nobody at all.The company is also testing asking users to “revise” their language when tweeting rude or harmful content, and a way to see who has replied to your tweet in a quoted-tweet.Trump claiming to use \u0027powers he does not have\u0027 to shut down TwitterZuckerberg says Twitter shouldn\u0027t be \u0027arbiter of truth\u0027This is the most honest Trump has ever been with the American peopleTwitter refuses widower\u0027s plea to remove trolling Trump tweetsThis news comes as the social media site is being challenged by Donald Trump over decisions to took to fact-check one of his tweets that made misleading claims about the relationship between postal voting and election fraud. Mr Trump has since signed an executive order against the company limiting its protection under Section 230, a law which which prevents tech firms from being held legally responsible for the content they allow on their sites. Following riots in Minneapolis after a man called George Floyd died in police custody, Mr Trump tweeted a message calling the protestors “thugs” and said “when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!”Twitter added a label hiding the tweet, saying that it “violated the Twitter Rules about glorifying violence”.

Researchers found 70 per cent of parents do not have any type of external support in providing care and education for their children.The study, which polled 3,055 working parents in the UK, America, France, Germany, and Italy, found similar gendered patterns in other countries too.Researchers found women with children across these countries now spend an average of 65 hours a week on unpaid labour around the house — with this figure having almost doubled since the Covid-19 crisis. This is almost a third more than fathers, who are doing an average of 50 hours a week.It comes after a study by the London School of Economics recently found coronavirus is exacerbating the gender gap as women bear the brunt of childcare responsibilities and homeschooling during lockdown — whether they’re working or not.I founded the Wages for Housework campaign – little has changed sinceThe report found women are more likely to deal with homeschooling, childcare and chores around the house even if they are juggling this with working at the same time.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Together with the way we are adapting our working lives to cope during the lockdown, this gives me hope that in the long term, a more equal society will emerge.”The report found women are more likely than men to lose their jobs in the forthcoming recession because a larger number work in sectors — such as hospitality, leisure, tourism and the arts — that are forecast to be hardest hit.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This trend, combined with people\u0027s own changing attitudes toward social events and large gatherings, resulted in travel dropping by more than 50 per cent before the lockdown began, according to requests made on Apple Maps for car and public transport directions.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRequests on Apple Maps for car directions began to fall on 11 March, while requests for public transport directions began to fall even earlier on 9 March.Many activities and behaviours that were considered normal before coronavirus also remain taboo regardless of the government\u0027s guidelines.The recently relaxed rules mean that cleaners and nannies are now permitted to visit people\u0027s homes, but a recent survey found that the majority of people found this very unacceptable.The poll by Ipsos MORI, which was carried out between 8 and 11 May, also found that having non co-habiting friends, family members or loved ones visit was also considered socially unacceptable.​Public opinion about exercise and driving is more greatly ided, ​though the poll demonstrated that government rules may not be a defining influence on people\u0027s behaviours.Companies\u0027 decisions to keep work from home policies in place show that lockdown measures are not necessarily enforced by government policy decision.The figures also suggest that the impact of coronavirus on travel habits, socialising and other pre-lockdown habits could continue long after lockdown officially ends.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Felix Project has supplied 1,376 tons of produce since 23 March, the equivalent of 3,276,190 meals. This support has ameliorated the deep distress of those unable to afford or access food – in particular, families struggling below the breadline, NHS workers and the elderly.The sum raised from sales of Hirst’s rainbow butterfly hearts means that we are more than halfway to our goal of securing £10m for The Felix Project to help food-poor Londoners over the next three years. It is a pledge given added urgency by the latest jobless claims, which have surged to more than two million.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMore than 4,400 people backed our campaign by purchasing the Hirst limited edition prints – 3,109 bought the small size, costing £300 each, and 1,299 bought the large size, costing £1,000.Mr Hirst said: “It’s amazing to see how people have pulled together and helped each other during this crisis. I am so grateful to everyone who has helped me do my little bit and bought a butterfly heart edition – it’s turned out to be a brilliant communal way to help raise money for The Felix Project and support their important work across London.”How to support our campaignEvgeny Lebedev, shareholder in The Independent, said: “I have long believed in the power of art and this is a wonderful affirmation of that. With the support of Damien Hirst we have passed the halfway point in our mission to ensure no Londoner in any corner of the city goes hungry because of Covid.”Other substantial new donors to our campaign include management consultants McKinsey \u0026amp Company, whose employees voted to make our appeal partner their charity of choice.Olga Nefedova, associate partner, said: “We are making a donation to organisations helping our most vulnerable communities. The Felix Project is very much one of these organisations.”So far, more than six million meals have been delivered by the London Food Alliance – established in response to the coronavirus pandemic and made up of Felix, FareShare and City Harvest – of which over half have been supplied by The Felix Project.Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, paid tribute to the extraordinary all-round effort. “London was hit hard and fast – but oh, how it has stepped up and fought back,” he said. “We are inspired by the mobilisation of businesses, donors and supporters who have joined forces with our staff and volunteers.” The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis.

Each box is packed with goods such as ready meals, fresh fruit, vegetables, tinned goods, nappies, tampons and soap.On the involvement of the young estate volunteers, he said: “They just want to be involved and have been engaged from the start.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.Teachers can stay away when primary schools reopen next week if they believe it is not safe to return, Downing Street has indicated.The “majority” of schools are expected to open their doors to reception, year 1 and year 6 pupils – but Boris Johnson’s spokesman said it was up to inidual head teachers to arrange staffing.Asked if teachers are “obliged” to go back on Monday, and if they will be “in breach” of their contracts if they refuse, he indicated there would be no punishment.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“It is going to be cautious and phased return,” the spokesman said,” adding: “Attendance will grow over time.”“I’m sure head teachers will be having conversations with inidual staff,” he said, with some schools likely to “need more time to prepare”.Schools, nurseries and colleges closed almost 10 weeks ago to help stop the rapid spread of coronavirus – only remaining open to vulnerable pupils and children of key workers.The prime minister confirmed the reopening from Monday, pointing to a “sustained and consistent fall in the daily death rate” in recent days and weeks.However, some schools and local authorities have said they will remain closed, at least for now, amid an increasingly bitter row with Gavin Williamson, the education secretary.Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union (NEU), has described the go-back instruction as “frightening and difficult”.Created with Sketch.Giving birth during the coronavirus outbreak Show all 23Created with Sketch.Created with

She did not want to risk a nearly 300-mile drive with our child given how ill I had been.“We agreed that we should go for a short drive to see if I could drive safely, we drove for roughly half an hour and ended up on the outskirts of Barnard Castle town. We did not visit the castle, we did not walk around the town.”Mr Cummings said he had felt a “bit sick” so they had walked about 10 to 15 metres to the riverbank where they sat for about 15 minutes until he felt better.Claimed he had previously warned of coronavirus pandemicMr Cummings used the briefing to insist he, contrary to some reports, had not resisted the introduction of lockdown measures and had in fact previously warned of the dangers of a coronavirus pandemic.“For years, I have warned of the dangers of pandemics. Last year I wrote about the possible threat of coronaviruses and the urgent need for planning,” he said.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

silence at Guy\u0027s HospitalMr Cummings did in fact write an entry on his blog in March 2019, which more specifically examined the possibility of a deadly outbreak being triggered by a coronavirus accidentally released from a laboratory during scientific experiments. However, there have been suggestions that the reference to coronavirus was actually added to the blog in April 2020.Scientists currently believe Sars-CoV-2, the virus which causes Covid-19, jumped from animals to humans as the product of natural evolution.Described his family’s farm as ‘sort of concrete blocks’The PM’s senior adviser insisted that his trip to Durham to isolate was not because the property on his family’s farm was a “nice place to be”.“The point about it was not that it was some nice place to be. If you have been there, you would see that it\u0027s sort of concrete blocks,” he said.“The point about it was not that it was a nice place to be, but that it was the safest place to be in the circumstances – and it meant that I didn\u0027t have to expose other people to risk unless I absolutely had to in a critical emergency.”Didn’t make inquiries about childcare in London before making tripMr Cummings used the briefing to insist the journey had been necessary because he and his wife had no reasonable childcare options in London if they both fell ill with coronavirus.“I suddenly got a call from my wife who was at home looking after our four-year-old child,” he explained in a prepared statement.“She told me she suddenly felt badly ill, she vomited and felt like she might pass out, and there would be nobody to look after our child. None of our usual childcare options were available.”However, in subsequent questioning from journalists, Mr Cummings later admitted he did not make inquiries about potential childcare in London.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Please consider a contribution or subscription.The government has appeared to invite hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong residents to make UK citizenship bids amid concerns over China’s planned national security law, which critics warn would eviscerate the notion of “one country, two systems”.Foreign secretary Dominic Raab said the UK would allow the roughly 300,000 people in Hong Kong who hold British national overseas (BNO) passports to stay in the country for 12 months, instead of the current six, unless China scraps the proposed law.He added that by allowing BNO passport holders to apply to work and study for extendable periods of 12 months, this would “provide a pathway to future citizenship” – stopping short of pledging definite amnesty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe diplomatic gambit came as Mr Raab and his counterparts in the US, Canada and Australia published a joint statement warning the law “would curtail the Hong Kong people’s liberties, and in doing so, dramatically erode Hong Kong’s autonomy and the system that made it so prosperous”.Noting that “Hong Kong has flourished as a bastion of freedom”, they emphasised their “deep concerns” and warned China’s planned law was “in direct conflict” its obligations under the principles of the Sino-British declaration, agreed when Britain returned the former colony to China in 1997.Created with Sketch.Pro-democracy protesters return to Hong Kong streets Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A pro-democracy protester is detained before being arrested by undercover police during a protest calling for the city\u0027s independence in Mong Kok district on 10 MayJournalists gather round a pro-democracy protester in Hong Kong shopping centre on 10 MayPro-democracy protesters sing songs during a rally at a shopping centre in Hong Kong on 10 MayPolice officers clear a shopping centre of protesters on 10 MayRiot police wearing protective masks stand guard during a demonstration outside a shopping centre in Hong Kong on 10 MayPro-democracy protesters stage a rally at a shopping centre in Hong Kong on 10 MayPolice officers patrol the Tsim Sha Tsui waterfront where protests are scheduled to take place on 10 MayRiot police stand guard in a shopping centre during a pro-democracy protest on 10 MayPro-democracy protesters stage a rally at a shopping centre in Hong Kong on 10 MayA pro-democracy protester is detained by an undercover police officer during a protest calling for the city\u0027s independence in Mong Kok district on 10 MayA pro-democracy protester is detained before being arrested by undercover police during a protest calling for the city\u0027s independence in Mong Kok district on 10 MayJournalists gather round a pro-democracy protester in Hong Kong shopping centre on 10 MayPro-democracy protesters sing songs during a rally at a shopping centre in Hong Kong on 10 MayPolice officers clear a shopping centre of protesters on 10 MayRiot police wearing protective masks stand guard during a demonstration outside a shopping centre in Hong Kong on 10 MayPro-democracy protesters stage a rally at a shopping centre in Hong Kong on 10 MayPolice officers patrol the Tsim Sha Tsui waterfront where protests are scheduled to take place on 10 MayRiot police stand guard in a shopping centre during a pro-democracy protest on 10 MayPro-democracy protesters stage a rally at a shopping centre in Hong Kong on 10 MayA pro-democracy protester is detained by an undercover police officer during a protest calling for the city\u0027s independence in Mong Kok district on 10 MayThe foreign ministers warned the unprecedented move risked undermining trust in Beijing during the coronavirus pandemic, when governments should be striving to enhance it, with Mr Raab adding: “We urge China to step back from the brink.”However, 2,878 members of China’s mostly rubber-stamp parliament voted in favour of the law on Thursday. One delegate voted against, and six abstained.The legislation will make “any act of treason, secession, sedition or subversion” in Hong Kong a criminal offence, and will allow China’s national intelligence agencies to set up bureaux in the city.Communist Party officials will now draft the new legislation and it could be in force before the end of the summer.The violent protests that rocked the city for much of 2019 after a proposed extradition bill quickly reignited with the new proposals, with tear gas once again stinging streets pounded by thousands of masked demonstrators and armed police.​The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I am shaking with anger right now. This is the best they can come up with?“Extending a f***ing worthless document for Hong Kongers (who can pay for themselves to be here for longer than 6 months). They are already here, Raab.“This is a worthless 12 month tourist visa unless he is saying if you live here for a year, UK will give you citizenship.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

One son, aged around 15, was allegedly discovered living in the basement after Mr Gray admitted this to authorities. “The house was filled with urine smell, faeces throughout the house, partially flooded basement,” said the Roane County court on Monday. Investigators searched the address over the weekend after someone told police that the youngest child was walking alone near the family home. Whilst his parents were unaware, Roane County authorities located the child who allegedly told them about the basement and the other child buried in the backyard, reported WVLT News. Detectives then arrived at the house to investigate.The couple also admitted that the children had not received medical or dental attention for at least six years prior to the investigation. At the same time, authorities said the children had “stunted growth” and that the parents had withheld food from them as punishment. The couple could face further charges.

The local administration in the Chinese city said on Wednesday that along with the consumption ban, Wuhan would become a “wildlife sanctuary” where virtually all hunting of wild animals was banned with the exception of measures for ”scientific research, population regulation, monitoring of epidemic diseases and other special circumstances”. As part of the ban, the city introduced stringent controls on the breeding of all wild animals, prohibiting any to be reared for food, CBS reported. Wuhan will also join a wider scheme across the country to offer buyouts to farmers who breed wild animals.​Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFounder of leading animal charity backs The Independent’s campaignWoman jailed for illegal trade in wildlife has sentence doubledArmy of volunteers ‘could be used to fight off invasive species’Coronavirus fears as China plans to entrench mink and fox fur industryWuhan, a city of 11m people in the Hubei province of China, saw the first cases of Covid-19 late last year. The origins of the pandemic are still being investigated but one of the suspected sources is the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in the city which included a live animal section reportedly selling more than 30 species of animals including live wolf pups, golden cicadas, scorpions and civets. China closed the market in January.On the whole, researchers agree that the most plausible explanation is that the virus made the jump from an animal to human in a “zoonotic spillover” event.China has been under pressure from the global community to tackle its illegal wildlife trade after it was linked to the emergence of zoonotic diseases. Coronavirus: China’s farmers offered buy-out to end wildlife breedingThe global death toll is now 318,789 people from the coronavirus, the World Health Organisation reported today. More than 4.7m people have been infected worldwide. Last week, two central provinces in China announced plans for a government buy-out for wildlife farmers to help transition those whose livelihoods depend on breeding wild species for consumption away from the practice.The plans would give wildlife farmers in Hunan and Jiangxi provinces, two neighbouring regions, the opportunity to be compensated for switching to grow fruit, vegetables, tea plants, or herbs for traditional Chinese medicine. There is also an option to breed other animals such as pigs and chickens.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailFarmers in Hunan are being offered compensation of 630 yuan ($88) per porcupine 600 yuan ($84) per civet cat 75 yuan ($11) per kilogram of bamboo rat and 120 yuan ($17) per kg of cobra, king rattle or rat snakes. Each wild goose or Chinese muntjac deer will be worth 2,457 yuan ($345) each.In February, China issued an unprecedented temporary nationwide ban on all terrestrial wild animal commerce and consumption, including exotic species raised on farms. The initial buy-out covers 14 species of farmed wildlife and only farms operating legally with breeding permits before the February ban are eligible for the programme.At present, the Wuhan ban lasts for five years. Similar bans are in place in the cities of Beijing, Shenzhen and Zhuhai but they have been made permanent.Dr Peter Li, Humane Society International’s China policy specialist, said: “Wuhan’s ban on wildlife consumption is extremely welcome as a clear recognition that the public health risk of zoonotic disease spread via the wildlife trade must be taken very seriously if we are to avoid another pandemic.There will however be no less severe of a disease risk from wildlife consumption in five years’ time, so anything short of a permanent and comprehensive ban is still a risk too far. Wuhan becomes the fourth city in mainland China to show such leadership, but we now need cities and countries across the world to step up to the plate and shut down the dangerous wildlife trade.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I’m not.Eventhe enforcement is far from being perfect, it will still have a tremendous effect.According to the British Pub Association, four out of ten pubs are likely to cease to exist at the end of the crisis.Unlike many restaurants that can stay afloat selling takeaway food, pubs cannot generate income in lockdown.Anyone who says that short-term rationing of alcohol in pubs is not a price worth paying to get them to open up fast must have had one pint too many.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No, he hadn’t.“The country can see that and it’s shocked the Government cannot,” she added, before accusing the Prime Minister of “blind loyalty” to Cummings.Then she added, for good measure, that the country had reacted with “fury, contempt and anguish”.I suppose she thought she was speaking for the country with this tendentious, pompous bilge.She was not. She was speaking for herself and those in her North London liberal bubble.The BBC demands that its presenters remain neutral on political matters.Obviously, they don’t. But at least they usually pretend to. Maitlis can’t even manage that. Anyway, the complaints flooded in to Auntie.If this was the first time she’d crossed the line then maybe we might be a little lenient. But it’s not. Far from it.Last September, for example, she managed to force the BBC into that very rarest of things — a public apology, for her appalling behaviour and bias.In an interview she conducted on the programme she was, the BBC concluded, “sneering and bullying”, she was “too persistent and bullying” and “failed to be even-handed”.That was a landmark judgment. I have it framed on the wall of my downstairs khazi. Because the person she had been interviewing was ME.I had turned up to do a debate about Brexit. I was met with a wall of vituperation and abuse that even embarrassed the bloke I was supposed to be debating with, an affable Remainer chap called Tom Baldwin.The BBC warned Newsnight, its hopeless editor and Maitlis that such a breach of neutrality must not happen in the future.It has happened again. So what are they going to do about it  The BBC has admitted Newsnight got it terribly wrong.And will do nothing. Again.Here’s the other thing. I was sacked by the BBC for breaching its code of neutrality. Rightly.I had written an article about how much I hated fox hunting and fox hunters, right at the time the Government was planning to ban the cruel, obnoxious sport.The BBC was right then. But at least I hadn’t broadcast those views on the BBC itself, or allowed them to influence the programme I edited, the Today programme. It was just stuff I wrote in a leftie newspaper.Maitlis broadcasts her idiotic views on her programme!The BBC has to be consistent about this or drop the pretence of neutrality altogether.And for Emily — have some guts, woman.You want a  for your views  Go work for a radio station in the private sector, or get a newspaper column,you can.The BBC has, in the main, behaved well over Covid. But always with the exception of Newsnight.Always with the exception of Maitlis.IF you remember, just before lockdown, it was rumoured that the Spice Girls might get back together.There were gigs planned for next month.“Christ help us,” we all thought. And then we all got down on our knees and thanked Covid for scuppering that idea.Now, however, lockdown looks like it will be eased. Which means they might well fix some new dates. Yikes, etc.I suppose we could tell them the latest scientic news. Singing, apparently, is really bad for spreading the virus everywhere.Choirs and stuff have been banned in some countries. So we could try that line.But then I suppose Sporty and Co might well reply: “You could hardly call what we do singing.”DID you see those hacks questioning the Prime Minister’s adviser, Dominic Cummings on Monday One after another they all stepped up, wreathed in self-importance.And all asked exactly the same question. Over and over again. And therefore got exactly the same response.What the hell is the point of that Did they all think that they would be the only person to ask: “Why is it one law for you and one law for everyone , Mr Cummings ”Did they think they were dead clever coming up with that line Incredible. Thick as a plate of mince, some of us journos.GLORY, glory. Denmark is to open its borders once again.You can travel to the countryyou can prove that you’re dating someone Danish.In my case I think I’d choose one of the models Maja Krag or Terese Pagh Teglgaard – crazy names, crazy girls. I don’t know how I’d prove it to the Danish customs people.Maybe just show them a photoshopped picture of me and Maja out on the town.Anyway, that’syou WANT to visit Denmark.I went there once and was pretty underwhelmed. It was like a middle-class version of Lincolnshire.SO what exactly have YOU accomplished during lockdown A few jigsaw puzzles and watched the entirety of Netflix Listen to this. In  the Bubonic Plague struck London once again. Cambridge University was closed down.And so the young Isaac Newton was forced to leave his studies andhome to Grantham, Lincs, under lockdown.And during this spare time he invented the branch of mathematics known as calculus. And then he discovered the laws of gravity.Oh, and formulated a theory of light which dominated science for the next century and beyond. All done under lockdown.And what have I done  Put out the patio furniture and completed a giant jigsaw puzzle of my own face.Depressing, innit FUNNY, isn’t it, how most of the people screaming blue murder about Dominic Cummings were fervent anti-Brexiteers Cummings was the key architect of the Vote Leave campaign – and the Remoaners utterly loathe the bloke.Among the Remoaners screaming their little heads off are a bunch of Church of England bishops.These include Leeds Bishop “Nick” Baines, who has referred to the Prime Minister as a “liar” and a “bully”.No wonder the Church of England’s attendances have collapsed over the past  years.The Cof E is another institution that has lost its moral compass and is utterly out of step with the rest of the country.THE Chinese government is bullying Hong Kong once again.Thousands of armed police are on the streets, battling protesters.The row is over a new law which makes it a criminal offence to take the p*** out of the Chinese national anthem.Only a deeply insecure totalitarian state would create such a law.Meanwhile, the Chinese President, Xi Jinping, has told his people to “prepare for war”.I don’t know who against.I think Xi has finally understood that the rest of the world is sick to the back teeth of his foul, bullying, communist dictatorship.And once this Chinese pandemic is over we might be more inclined to stand up for ourselves.THE Home ­Secretary Priti Patel is determined to stop economic migrants flooding here from across the Channel.She wants new powers to send boats back to France. Good for her.Since the turn of the year more than , illegal immigrants have arrived on our shores from our neighbours.Brexit Britain is an even more popular destination than it was before we left the EU. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He also attempted to master Japanese during two seasons at League club Nagoya Grampus Eight.Gary explains why sticking to your mother tongue could be an own goal, both on and off the pitch . . .MASTERING a language is one of the most important things you can do.That became apparent to me when, on arriving in Spain, I decided to buy some furniture.Keen that my bedside cabinets had drawers, I asked the shop assistantthey had two tables “con cojones”.The poor woman burst out laughing and explained that in Spanish, drawers are “cajones” not “cojones” — I’d accidentally asked for two tables with testicles.I couldn’t speak a word of Spanish when I signed for Barcelona but I knew I needed to learn the lingo.I had realised that players at foreign clubs who immerse themselves in the culture do better on the pitch than those who don’t.I looked to greats such as Kevin Keegan, who learned German when he joined Hamburg, and Ray Wilkins, who mastered Italian at AC Milan.Then there were others — who I won’t name — who were lured abroad just for the bigger pay packet back in the day and barely lasted a season.I’d studied a small amount of French and German at school but I was so focused on becoming a footballer I didn’t put the effort in.I had a bit of a wake-up call over my lack of language skills on my first day of training.It’s a shock to the system being in a changing room full of blokes bantering and you have no idea what they are saying.Luckily, the team took me under their wing. On the bus to the training grounds Barcelona keeper Andoni Zubizarreta drew a stick man and woman and taught me all the body parts.To get a firmer grip on the language I avoided the ex-pat nightclubs out there and enrolled in a Spanish language class with my then we Michelle and my team-mate Mark Hughes.Poor Mark was only  and struggled with the classes. I think he dropped out after two or three but Michelle and I stuck with it.For two years, three times a week after training, we’d go to school to learn Spanish.It was tough at first as no English was allowed in the classroom, but looking back it did me a world of good.I started playing football when I was small and the skills came naturally. Learning a language was the opposite. It was really hard work and not something that came easily to me.So I made sure I read Spanish newspapers every day and watched the local TV stations. In two months I could get by. After six months I was getting pretty good and in a year I was speaking pretty much fluently.By the time I left in  I was thinking and dreaming in Spanish.From the get go, I made sure I did my post-match interviews in the local language.EvenI didn’t always make sense, it sent out a strong message to the club that I was there for the long haul.Being able to talk to fans gained me a lot of respect and appreciation when I was over there.And when a match goes badly, the pitch can be a really lonely place. But because I was able to speak to my team-mates, it helped me through some tough times.When I went to play for Nagoya Grampus Eight in  it was a whole other story.I took eight months of Japanese lessons before I went out there, and did classes there too. But it is a very dficult language, with a completely dferent alphabet.I learned enough to get by but I was nowhere near as good at Japanese as I was with Spanish.It’s been more than  years since I lived in Barcelona and I’ll admit my Spanish is a bit rusty.Nowadays when I go there I’ll try to speak the language but Spaniards always want to speak to me in English.So many foreigners speak English that it can seem a pointless exercise trying to pick up another tongue.As a nation, we are not great at learning a second language, we can rest on our laurels slightly.But I would argue that it’s more important now than ever to learn, and at the moment we’ve all got the time to spare.Having a second language opens up so many opportun­ities to you and your kids, whether that’s working abroad or in hospitality in the UK.Travel might be shut at the moment, but that won’t be the case for ever and you’ll be giving your family a leg-up during this downtime.Children’s brains are like sponges, they pick up languages so much faster and better when they are younger.And there are so many online tools and courses that I wish I’d had at my disposal when I was first learning.Although I’d always warn against online translation tools — they give a very literal translation which doesn’t always make sense.For example,you type “it’s raining cats and dogs” into Google Translate it won’t mean anything to a foreigner in their own language.Getting kids to do anything can be tricky, as I’m sure mums and dads who are homeschooling have realised by now.In my Celebrity Supply Teacher episode I teach counting to ten in Spanish by doing keepy-ups.Soyou make it fun, it opens up an exciting new world for youngsters which doesn’t involve sitting at a desk.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

leaving some attempting DIY procedures.But from June , dental practices will be allowed to resume treating patients as the government gradually begins to ease restrictions.Many dentists have been outraged that they had been forced to close at all with some questioning why they were not deemed to be essential workers.During the Covid- pandemic, people have only been able to receive emergency dental care at a handful of centres - and many have only been able to offer extractions.So far the UK government has released no precise guidance as to how practices should operate under the new normal.Guidelines have however been produced internationally which may give an indicator as to how things could look.A group, led by Professors Jan Clarkson and Craig Ramsay from Cochrane Oral Health, conducted a rapid review based on data from  other countries who have proposals in place as to what the new normal will be.From temperature screening to waiting outside, heres how your next dentist appointment may go...First of all, before a practice can reopen, staff will need to undergo training which will focus on how to stop the spread of contamination.To be able to ensure patients and staff can keep a safe m distance, surgeries will likely run at a reduced capacity - possibly as low as  per cent.This will also allow for extra cleaning precautions to take place.So, these physical changes will have to be set out before a practice can safely open.Before your appointment, patients will be called to be made aware of social distancing measures, sanitiser stations and may be asked to wear a mask.Catherine Tannahill, director of clinical dentistry at Portman Dental Care has been working on how to update procedures over the last few weeks in order to minimise the spread of Covid- and to keep staff safe.Before visiting the practice all patients will be called and briefed on the new procedures in place, so they will know exactly what to expect.We may also require them to complete anda new medical history form digitally ahead of their appointment.People will be encouraged to have used the toilet, brushed their teeth and are well hydrated before leaving the house for their appointment.Once patients arrive at the practice, they may be asked to wait outside before coming in for their appointment.Catherine Tannahill, director of clinical dentistry at Portman Dental Care said there are many things you can do to make sure you look after your oral health during lockdown.DosDonts Ms Tannahill continued: “We would also ask that people come to appointments alone where possible and to bring as minimal personal belongings as possible with them.“Patients will need to call the practice upon their arrival and either have to remain in their car or stand outside, practising the social distancing recommendations, until one of the team members unlocks the practice door and invites them in.The doors to the practice are likely to remain locked until staff are ready for your appointment.Patients who are waiting outside will be called when its time to enter the practice.Theres likely to be temperature checks on the door and people will be asked to verbally declare whether they have coronavirus symptoms or not.Once inside, patients may be given a masktheyre not already wearing one and made to wash their hands.Waiting rooms are likely to be out of bounds and items such as magazines, TV remotes, water coolers and toys will be removed.There will be markers on the floor - just like in supermarkets - to indicate m distances, but its understood most practices will ask people to wait outside until their appointment and will go straight to the treatment room.Reception staff will sit behind a perspex screen for added protection and people will be asked to use contactless payment where possible.Patients may even be asked to use their own pensthey need to sign forms andnot a pen will only be able to be used once, its understood.If a patient needs the toilet once inside they should only do so with the permission of staff, as the area will need to be deep cleaned.Before patients enter the treatment room, they will be asked to leave their coat and bag in a box provided.They will then be asked to wash their hands once again and depending on the treatment, patients may be asked to swill with a hydrogen peroxide solution for one minute.Dental staff will be in full personal protective equipmentas they will be working within the safe social distancing recommendations.Once the procedure is over, patients will be asked to sanitise their hands once more before leaving the treatment room.The entire room will then have to be cleaned and disinfected before seeing the next patient.Its thought appointments will have a - minute gap to allow time to safely sanitise between appointments.The report states: Patients’ appointments should be spread between - minutes to allow for enough time to disinfect all areas and avoid cross-infection between patients in waiting rooms.One of the main reason dental practitioners have not been allowed toto work is due to a lack of PPE.Many of the tools used by dentists, such as drills, can spray germs widely so adequate protection is vital.Face masks can cost anything from £-£ and NHS England says FFP face masks are needed for all aerosol-generating procedures.One dentist said a lot of practices are rushing to get PPE orders in order to allow time for fit testing.While the cost of most PPE has soared, protective gloves have also doubled in price from some suppliers.Not all staff will have to wear gloves - receptionists will only have to wear surgical face masks.Despite this, the use of PPE is dferent in every area and some hospitals in London have been using two sets of gloves for protection.Other forms of PPE include disposable gowns and these can range between £-£.NHS England states that clinicians should wear disposable plastic aprons for non Aerosol Generating Procedures .While the advice ied for patients who were suspected to have Covid, the general consensus of the report what that clinicians needed to wear a higher level of PPE than usual in order to protect themselves.Ms Tannahill added: “As dentists we obviously can’t carry out social distancing when performing routine check-ups and treatments, so the teams will be in full PPE gear and minimal colleagues will be in the treatment rooms, which will then be fully cleaned and disinfected after each patient.“This means that there will be longer waiting times between patients, and so practices will be on a reduced number of patients that they are able to see in a day. Therefore, patients who are vulnerable or are in need of urgent dental care will be prioritised in the first instance once we re-open.When it comes to the sort of kit dentists will need to reopen, PPE is at the top of the list. But other items have also been suggested that may help make things run a bit smoother.While there have been no studies showing that air puriers help stop the spread of the virus and some have said the costs are so low that many dentists may get them just to show their patients that they are doing all they can.Dentist Neel Kothari told Dentistry Online: There are a few glaringly obvious issues with air puriers.Firstly, we as clinicians will always be between the patient and the unit. Secondly, there is a distinct lack of evidence demonstrating effectiveness and finally,needed, what standard do we require Could we end up spending a lot of money only to be told they need to be upgraded However, to many dentists the costs of the units are a relatively inexpensive way to demonstrate to their patients that they are doing everything they can to ensure safety.This is while other parts of kit such as suction systems could set practices back over £, - and its an amount many may not be able to afford after being shut for such a long time.The systems are used to reduce the amount of aerosol used and could be a quick solution for many practices.While its clear every business that reopens after the lockdown will have to adhere to a stricter cleaning regime, its unclear as to how this will actually be implemented.The report stated that most countries were no longer using the spittoon in dental procedures.In order to avoid viral cross contamination it was also suggested that paperwork and other items in the office be kept to a minimum.It was also recommended that practitioners switch between treatment rooms in order for sufficient time to be given to disinfect each room to a high standard.Common contact areas such as handles should be covered.The report also stated: The door of the surgery must remain closed to prevent viral spread. One guidance document expands on this to state all drawers and cabinets should also remain closed.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.   Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Every day I walked down the corridor of my high school in New Zealand to that sort of abuse. “F***ing faggot.” “You poofter.” “Bum boy.” You can imagine.I became prepared for it and engineered a steely exterior. But each incident made it harder for me to be the person I knew I wanted to be and even more aware I was an outsider in a world where straight men dominate.While attitudes are thankfully changing, they still extend across many industries.One of my early bosses in newspapers told me recently that an editor had resisted hiring “the poof” .Luckily, that boss — a mentor during my career who happens to be straight — held firm and didn’t accept such blatant homophobia.I’m never one to moan about a lack of ersity or embrace identity politics — all minorities have to fight to overcome stereotypes. Taking on a victim mentality doesn’t help, which is why I never have.But it’s far too simplistic to look at Queer Eye, Graham Norton and Tom Daley then declare homophobia doesn’t strangle careers even now.That said, Adrian Chiles’ illuminating interview in The Sun this week with Luke Tuffs, who came out as a teenage player at Camberley Town in Surrey, provides reason for hope.Now manager of Ashford Town, he revealed that when he first told his team-mates in a drunken moment of madness they were “absolutely cool” about his sexuality. Of course, there’s “savage” banter in the “un-PC” dressing rooms but he explained: “I don’t think it comes from malice — it comes from love.”In fact, I’d hazard a guess the banter would be just as brutala player had ginger hair, an overweight girlfriend or a small willy. Banter is a prized part of British le and must not be wiped out by the snowflake brigade. It’s very dferent to abuse.The closeted players should also look to Phillip Schofield’s coming out announcement. What the This Morning host probably believed was going to be a le-changing event, dominating his every waking moment, has now been largely shrugged off. It was a damp squib in the best possible way.Sure, Phillip is gay. But he’s still hosting This Morning with Holly and that’s what people talk about. We don’t care who he is sleeping with.It is, of course, a deeply personal choice, but I would encourage footballers living miserably in the closet to try to change the way they think about coming out. Being the first will give them an opportunity no one  will ever have.While some archaic football fans may not be ready for it, I genuinely believe the vast majority of the country and our culture truly is.The opportunities will be limitless. The love will be overwhelming.Thirty years of fear will be turned on its head. We just need one brave announcement.Andwe’re not careful the red tape and draconian restrictions will kill off an already struggling high street.Take shoe shops, where staff will have to quarantine any footwear tried on for  hours.If you’ve worked in retail you’ll know how damn impractical that is.And,we’re being guided by the science, who the heck has ever contracted coronavirus via their toes while wearing socks Clothes shoppers will not be able to try on items in a changing room. Why not just order on Amazon then Estimates suggest these corona-ready measures will also cost companies. A lot. To the tune of £, a store, according to one estimate.Making the shopping experience miserable for retailers and customers won’t help save our economy, given recovery requires people wanting to go out and spend.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Some employers may force their workers to take the isolation time as holiday.No said that there was “already signicant financial support available” to the self employed, and that in some cases they could claim universal credit and unemployment support allowance.A Downing Street spokesman said: “We’ve had a scheme in place during the lockdown and that means there is signicant financial support available.”They added: “If an employee is not sick and can work from home they should do so as normal.“Statutory sick pay is available to those who have been contacted by the test and trace service and are unable to work as a result, and of course some employers will continue to offer their own sickness policies and offer full pay for all or some of the inidual’s isolation period.”But the Test and Trace system will fail to work effectivelystatutory sick pay is not increased unions have warned.TUC general secretary Frances OGrady said: “It will not be effectiveworkers are pushed into hardship when they are required to self-isolate.Statutory sick pay is just £ per week - and two million workers arent even eligible for that. If workers cant afford to self-isolate, then they will be forced to keep working. That will put them, their workmates and their local community at risk, and undermine the entire Test and Trace programme.Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth also called for enhanced sick pay when he was asked about the new system and people being expected to self-isolate for  dayscontacted.He said: There will be people whose work conditions and employment conditions make that dficult for them so they need that security, they need enhanced sick pay where necessary to make sure they stay at home.But, of course, it is perfectly possible that you could isolate for  days, come out, meet somebody  again who has got the virus and have to go back in. So this could be a huge burden for people.Yesterday MPs were told that local levels of the system would not be ready to roll out until the end of June after a conference call with Tracing chief Dido Harding.Labour MP Ben Bradshaw said: “Dido Harding just told me on an MPs’ conference call that Test, Trace  Isolate won’t be fully operational at local level till the end of June.Not sure where that leaves Johnson’s promise of a fully operational “world beating” system by Monday.”But NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson said it was never going to be the case that the UK would have a world-class test and trace system in place on Monday.Mr Hopson said that while work on introducing the system was progressing at pace, the UK is weeks behind where we really ought to be.He said: There has been good progress, things are being put into place, but they are going to take time.

too.Twenty-six per cent have followed advice “well but with a couple of lapses”, while just under five per cent say they have either followed the rules “fairly loosely” or not at all.Fourteen per

a lover.The Government’s scientic adviser, Neil Ferguson, had to resign after it emerged he had broken lockdown rules to meet his lover.Half say they have met friends or family and a similar number left their home more than once a day during the first eight weeks, before restrictions were loosened.A quarter of the rulebreakers have made non-essential journeys, while around one in ten admits to leaving the home while or within seven days of showing coronavirus symptoms.Four per cent of those breaching the regulations went to a funeral.Almost five per cent surveyed say they have been reported

the empty roads.Many people insist they broke rules — or bent them — for reasons they believed were fair, such as visiting vulnerable parents or keeping relationships alive.Mr Cummings insists he was

Drinkers have been disappointed so far with no firm date for their locals to reopen as experts feel that social distancing would be almost impossible to enforce in a crowded boozer. But today top Tory Mr Eustice gave a glimmer of hope that beer gardens could present a way of drinking safely. Hetold Sky News: The sectors that are going to have the greatest challenge getting back to work, which we recognise, and Iaposm sure the Chancellor recognises this too - the hospitality sector and some of those other ticketed venues, in particular cinemas and in particular theatres, restaurants and pubs, will also face a challenge getting back in to operation.

The government said pubs would not be able to reopen until  July at the earliest. Yesterday the Prime Minister announced an easing of a number of the lockdown measures. He said that all five of his tests to move into the next phase had been met, allowing schools to begin reopening and greater contact to be permitted from Monday. Mr Johnson on Thursday said people would be able to see both parents at once, or both grandparents at once in what he said would be a long-awaited and joyful moment for many as he said people would be allowed to meet outside in groups of six. In Scotland, a gradual relaxation begins on Friday with a similar plan to allow outside gatherings, though First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is permitting groups of up to eight people. Her Welsh counterpart, Mark Drakeford, is set to announce that outdoor meet-ups can resume from Monday, but he will unveil new stay local guidance to not travel more than five miles. The easing of restrictions begins re-opening the economy, with outdoor retail and car showrooms opening in England from Monday ahead of a greater opening of non-essential shops.  Chancellor Rishi Sunak is set to announce fresh details over the next phase of the furlough scheme designed to prevent lay-offs in the coming days. Treasury sources did not deny reports that the Chancellor is set to ask employers to contribute % of wages, as well as National Insurance and pensions contributions from August. Mr Sunak is facing calls, including from a cross-party group of  MPs, to extend the scheme supporting self-employed workers past Sunday or risk leaving many without work and without support. At the daily Downing Street briefing, chief scientic adviser Sir Patrick Vallance stressed there is not a lot of room to ease measures, with new Covid- cases still around , per day. He warned that with the rate of transmission, or R value, close to one, the test and trace system must be effective in order to prevent exponential spread ing.  Chief medical officer for England Professor Chris Whitty stressed that although groups of six would be able to meet up outside to socialise and even enjoy barbecues people from dferent households must keep two metres apart. Prof Whitty said the more than one million people deemed extremely clinically vulnerable must continue shielding, but offered a glimmer of hope when he said that the infection level may be sufficiently reduced to allow their freedom relatively soon.

The Prime Minister confirmed that all five tests required for the next phase of restrictions to begin have been met, meaning more pupils canto school and outdoor retail and car showrooms can open from Monday in England. Mr Johnson outlined that people would be able to see both parents at once, or both grandparents at once in what he said would be a long-awaited and joyful moment for many.  Englandaposs primary schools will widen the number of pupils they are taking.The plan will see classrooms reopen in stages, beginning with reception, Year  and Year . Years  to  wouldlater in June. More than two dozen councils with more than , primary schools between them have warned they may not reopen on June . And the government has admitted schools wonapost open in a unorm way across the country. Soyou are in any doubt, you should check in with your childaposs schools about their plans. Secondary pupils in years  and , could go back in some limited form a few weeks later, but secondary schools are not expected to open fully until September. Shops  June Outdoor markets Car showroomsThis will happen from June  onwards, as soon as they are able to meet the COVID- secure guidelines to protect shoppers and workers. June  ALL other non-essential retail can reopen from this date including :Clothes shops Shoe shops Toy shops Furniture shops Bookshops Electronics Tailors Auction houses Photography studios Indoor marketsFriends and family   From Monday, groups of up to six people can meet outside. Those from dferent households must stay two metres apart from each other, in line with social distancing rules. People will also be allowed to meet in gardens and other private outdoor spaces. Boris Johnson said that, to best control the virus, people should avoid seeing people from too many households in quick succession. He also reiterated that people should not be inside the homes of their friends and families, unless it is to access the garden. The Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said thatpeople needed to use the toilet while in someoneaposs garden then all surfaces shwould be wiped down afterwards.He also warned about the importance of washing hands - especiallypeople are potentially handing items such as during a BBQ.ShieldingJohnson said it was too early for the most vulnerable, who have been asked to shield themselves to avoid infection, to be allowed greater social interactions. He said they were looking at how to make the lives of the clinically vulnerable easier and was hoping to have more to say soon. Chief medical officer for England Professor Chris Whitty offered the prospect at the Downing Street briefing on Thursday that infection levels may be low enough for them to leave home shortly. And we will get to a stage, we hope relatively soon, where the absolute risk of people has gone down to a low enough level it will be possible in stages for people to leave shielding, he said. Prof Whitty stressed that it was number of infections that need to come down rather than the R rate of transmission in order to reduce the risk of infection to the vulnerable.

Cafes and restaurants and other so-called higher-risk businesses and public places must remain closed until the beginning of July at the earliest, the latest official guidance says. They may be able to reopen slightly soonerthey have outside seating areas that can be properly distanced. But the vast majority will be closed for some time. The current social distancing rules of m make it almost impossible for many of these outlets to operate.Although some have switched to providing take aways.   Despite earlier advice that pubs would have to wait longer than even restaurants and cafes, pubs were thrown a leline last week. Environment Secretary George Eustice said he wanted pubs to tentatively start gradually opening in July with social distancing in place. Meanwhile, scientists have warned some social distancing rules may have to remain until thereaposs a vaccine, making much of pub le impossible. Staycations  The Government do however have hopes holidaymakers might be able to take UK staycations from July.

Labour has also called on the Attorney General Suella Braverman to apologise after giving her backing to the Prime Ministeraposs aide before the police had commented on the case.Yesterday Durham Police said officers would have turned back Mr Cummings during his -mile round trip to Barnard Castle which he claimed was to check his eyesight before making the longer journey back to London. Speaking to Channel Four News last night, he said: It looks on the basis of what Durham Police have said that Dominic Cummings has got away with it. Adding: I think he unquestionably broke the law. Today Labouraposs shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds called on Ms Braverman to apologise saying she had not acted properly. And he said that Mr Cummings - who helped draft the guidelines - should never have been in a position where he would have required advice from the police as to their interpretation. Ms Braverman tweeted on May : Protecting oneaposs family is what any good parent does. The DowningStreet statement claries the situation and it is wholly inappropriate to politicise it.  Some have argued that by publicly supporting Mr Cummings, she effectively tied the hands of the police. Mr Thomas-Symonds told Radio Fouraposs Today programme: The Attorney General was wrong to be out making public statements about an inidual case before even the police had made a public statement and particularly given her role as superintendent of the Crown Prosecution Service. She shouldnapost have been commenting on an inidual case in those circumstances, thataposs to misunderstand the role of the Attorney General to give unnished advice to government without fear or favour and as a bared minimum she should apologise for that.  Mr Thomas-Symonds, himself a lawyer, argued that because no further action would have been taken by the police had they stopped Mr Cummings on his journey did not mean he was acting lawfully. He explained: Durham Police statement was clear in that respect. They say theyaposre not taking any action because they do not take action retrospectively which has been applied across the country.We know Dominic Cummings in regard to the spirit of the guidelines broke them - nobody interpreted the instruction to stay at homeyou were in a household where there was someone experiencing covid symptoms that you could travel  miles around the country in anticipation of perhaps needing childcare. Pressed on whether the PMaposs adviser broke the law, Mr Thomas-Symonds replied: The guidelines that were set up he broke them and we know that because the police have told us in that statement had he been intercepted on that journey from the property in Durham to Barnard Castle he would have been stopped and we know the likely advice he would have been given is toto his house.

He added: The reason, by the way, the outcome would have only been a piece of advice isnapost to do with breaking or not breaking the law or breaking or not breaking the guidance, it is because the police were taking, quite sensibly in my view, an approach of explaining and encouraging and engaging before they moved to enforcement, so thataposs why he would have been given a piece of advice, we donapost know whether he would have complied with it or not. This is the Prime Ministeraposs chief adviser who was central to the drawing up of the guidelines in the first place.

This is an important milestone on the journey back to normal le. It means friends can be reunited and families can once again see relatives they have been separated from. Shops will soon start to reopen and Premier League football is coming back. The fact we have reached this stage is a tribute to the resilience and sacrices by the vast majority of the country. It is a shame the same dedication has not been shown by those in the Government. The UK has the highest death rate of any comparable nation. Boris Johnson promised we would have a world-beating test-and-trace programme in place by June . As it stands, it is unlikely to be fully operational until the end of next month. The missteps and mistakes by ministers stand in contrast to the huge collective effort made by the public. Ruled out If you are a rule maker, you shouldn’t be a rule breaker. That concept is understood by everyone apart from the occupants of No. Dominic Cummings “may” have breached lockdown laws by travelling to Barnard Castle. Anyone with an ounce of dignity would have realised this would be a resignation matter. Any PM who cared about standards in public le would have regarded this as a sackable offence.

It only opened in December last year and staff were ramping up production on the new DBX when it had to close its doors. But with the majority of staff at the car plant now back at work, the company has followed Government guidelines on how toto work safely - as well as implementing its own initiatives. Remarkably, every employee is given THREE dferent facemasks on their first day back at work. .  Thataposs not part of government guidelines, says James Stephens, Director of Government and External Affairs at Aston Martin, but we think where there is a small chance of stopping additional spread of infection, we will issue all our staff with face masks. On day one, you are issued with three: one for the morning, one for the afternoon and one for the following morning. On day two you would put your mask on before you get out of your car.  The car giant is also implementing the new measures listed in the official government advice for firms. They have instigated one-way systems. There are two-metre spaces as staff queue up at the entrance to the plant. Hand sanitisers are provided at the door and throughout the building, and the canteen has adapted to only serve pre-packaged food.  People are also encouraged to check their temperature before they go to work and stay homethey have any symptoms of the virus. “Security and health and safety staff will take your temperature from a safe distance,” says James. If it’s high, staff are asked to sit aside before being retested. “Some people might cycle to work and might have a slightly elevated temperature for that reason.” The Government has issued advice for workplaces to reduce the risk of infection, including keeping staff in fixed teams, staying a safe distance apart and limiting face-to-face contact. Regular cleaning, increased hygiene and floor markings are also advised.  Walking, cycling or getting to work by car is ideal, butworkers have to use public transport they should travel off peak, use contactless payment, wear a face covering and maintain a -metre distance. Staff should also wash or sanitise their hands before and after commuting, as well as frequently throughout the working day. Before Covid- hit, Aston Martin encouraged staff to car share to reduce CO emissions, but they’ve had to pause this. Once staff get to work, the parking bays are staggered to maintain distancing."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus live pandemic uk updates","story":"NewsCoronavirus LIVE updates: UK hospital death toll reaches , after  more fatalitiesMeanwhile Chancellor Rishi Sunak is expected to announce three big changes to the coronavirus furlough scheme this afternoon, in a move which could affect millions of British workersShareByJoseph WilkesReporterMilo BoydUpdated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video londoners-gather-near-st-thomas-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

If it goes above  new restrictions could be put in place as it means the outbreak is increasing. Ministers had refused to publish a breakdown by region but Labour’s Manchester Mayor Andy Burnam released them today. The data was compiled by the Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Follow all coronavirus updates on our live blog here Mr Burnham tweeted: “In the absence of a Government commitment to do so, I promised to publish regular updates on regional R numbers.“So here’s a table published today. Not a great deal of ‘room for manoeuvre’, as the Chief Scientic Adviser told the @DowningStreet daily briefing. Officially the UK as a whole has an R of between . and . but Chief Scientic Officer Sir Patrick Vallance has said a slight increase could be dangerous. All regions were deemed to have infection rates either “decreasing” or “likely decreasing” apart from the South West.The region tends to have an older population and less NHS capacity. The data will spark fears about an influx of tourists to hotspots such as Cornwall as lockdown is eased. Originally the South West had the lowest number of Covid- cases but infections have taken longer to fall. It comes during a crucial phase with lockdown measures being lted from Monday allowing groups of up to six to meet outside, including in gardens. In Wales people from two dferent households will be allowed to meet up from Monday but people are expected to stay local. In Scotland two households can meet up from Friday.  The reproduction, or R number, is a way of measuring the ability of a disease to spread. It is the average number of people that one infected person will pass the virus on to.mayors for Manchester and Liverpool called on Boris Johnson earlier this month to urgently release regional R rates.

Durham Police did however say there might have been a minor breach of lockdown.The survey also found that people largely struggled to stick to the rule meaning we could only leave our house once a day - with % saying they left home more than once a day.

Schools, nurseries and colleges closed almost  weeks ago in a bid to stop the rapid spread of coronavirus - only remaining open to vulnerable pupils and children of key workers. However, parents and teaching unions have expressed their concerns about thein England amid safely fears and the ability to maintain social distancing throughout the school day. In his briefing yesterday, the Prime Minister said a sustained and consistent fall in the daily death rate has been witnessed, meaning the second test of a five stage process out of lockdown has been met. However Dr Mary Bousted, Joint General Secretary of the National Education Union described the situation as frightening and dficult. She added: “Time and again we have had to ask for the scientic thinking behind wider school opening. Time and again we have not had the answers. But what could the reopening of schools actually look like and how might your child be affected  Weaposve answered some of these questions here - including how dropping and picking up children could change for parents. Follow all coronavirus updates on our live blog here     What pupils can   The government has said children in England of reception age, year one and year six couldto school. Boris Johnson yesterday said the first test of five had been met when it comes to easing lockown measures - in the R rate, rate of infection, had shown a sustained and consistent fall. He said: Itaposs thanks to the caution youaposve shown so far that all five met are being met. The result is that we can move forward with adjusting the lockdown in England on Monday. Year six children are thought to be on the list of those able toas their final year in primary is crucial for their preparation for a move into secondary school. How will classes change   Classes will be restricted to  pupils - with a further need to social distance even after scaling back to smaller groups. Pupils will likely be directed with tape and signs as to where they can sit - with desks and large areas of a classroom and other school spaces being cordoned off. The smaller class sizes mean pupils are likely to either be in school for the morning or afternoon, as opposed to a full day. Pupils will attend school on a rotation basis, effectively halving the number of students in the school at any given time. However, Dr Mary Bousted, Joint General Secretary of the National Education Union, said for some  pupils in a small classroom would still make social distancing an impossibility. She said: Fteen pupils to a class makes social distancing an impossibility in our small classrooms and in particular with very young children who will not understand the concept. How will drop off and pick up change  Drop-off and pick-up times at the school gates are also likely to be subjected to stricter rules. Parents may have to wait in a queuing system to collect their child, reducing the number of adults who are on the site at any given time. Where appropriate and safe, children many be asked to walk or cycle to prevent adults mingling at school entances. Playtime  Teaching unions have spoken out about the importance of break and playtime to the school day - however said social distancing during these times would be almost impossible. However plans to stick to social distancing rules as much as possible could include scheduling staggered breaks for the children and advising youngsters to stick with a small gang of friends. Children are also likely to be prevented from playing with children from other classrooms. Lunch times could also be spent in the classroom as opposed to gathering a larger group of children from all classrooms into a hall. Toilets Strict hand washing policies will be in place when children arrive at school, use the toilet,from play and before and after eating. Younger children are likely to be have non-intrusive supervision in toilets to ensure they are washing their hands properly. Games and songs could be brought into the teaching day to help children learn to habitually consider their hygiene throughout the day, The new guidelines state: “Consider how to encourage young children to learn and practice these habits through games, songs and repetition.”  Equipment Childrenaposs access to equipment is likely to be drastically reduced as libraries and classroom book shelves could be blocked off. Teachers will encourage equipment such as books and stationary to be used by one child for the entire day. Artwork from walls will be taken down throughout schools. Younger children will not have access to things like building blocks, Lego, counting beads and other toys. All equipment will need to be washed after each use by a child. Teachers  Teachers could be encouraged by a school or council to wear PPE while in class - including transparent visors where possible to ensure children can see their face. However, many teachers have expressed their concerns about the hige challenge of delivering the curriculum to children while also social distancing. More than two in five teachers say there are not enough sinks in schools for children to regularly wash their hands, a survey suggests. Health and safety issues facing schools in England will growheads are asked to admit more pupils as part of a wider reopening from next week, the National Education Unionhas warned. Already more than a quarterof teachers are concerned that pupil numbers are too large to allow social distancing when moving around their school - and a similar proportionsay hand sanitiser is not available in all classrooms and at entrance and exit points, according to a poll by the NEU.

We do want people to be able to see their friends and family, we do want people to see two grandparents at once but itaposs got to be socially distanced, thereaposs got to be a maximum of six people. He added: We donapost want people to stay overnight, we donapost want people to go to other households and stay there, Iaposm just afraid weaposre not at that stage. What you certainly can imagine is there could be meetings of families in a garden, you could even have a barbecue provided you did it in a socially-distanced way, provided everyone washes their hands, provided everybody exercises common sense.

A white police officer, Derek Chauvin, , put his knee on the back of Mr Floydaposs neck for about eight minutes as the -year-old unarmed black man lay face down gasping for air and pleading I canapost breathe. A bystander shouted youaposre killing him. Mr Floyd was arrested after he allegedly tried to use a fake  bill at a corner shop on Monday night, and police claim he was under the influence in the driveraposs seat of a car. Witnesses have disputed the Minneapolis Police Departmentaposs claims that he was resisting arrest.to get the Mirroraposs biggest and best stories delivered straight to your inbox at www.mirror email. A witness captured video of Mr Floyd begging to be freed as police pinned him to the street and witnesses screamed get off him before he lost consciousness. He was later pronounced dead in hospital. The footage was posted on social media and quickly sparked outrage and calls for the officers to be charged with murder. Protests have taken place in Minneapolis every night since Mr Floydaposs death and the National Guard has been activated to try to restore order in the Midwest city after peaceful rallies gave way to gunfire, arson, looting and vandalism. The fallout from Mr Floydaposs death has overshadowed the man himself. Who was George Floyd   Mr Floyd lived in St Louis Park, a suburb of Minneapolis, and moved to the state of Minnesota from Houston, Texas, where he lived most of his le, about six years ago.Known as Big Floyd to family and close friends due to his ft in frame, for five years he had worked as a security guard at Conga Latin Bistro, a restaurant and live music club that was shut due to the coronavirus outbreak.Mr Floyd, described as a gentle giant by family, was a father whose two daughters, aged six and , from a previous relationship and granddaughter lived in Houston. He never met his granddaughter before his death. In the video, he is heard calling out for his mother, who died about a year ago. His siblings and his fiancée, Courteney Ross, have called for the four officers involved in his arrest to be charged with murder.His brother, Philonise, told CNN: Knowing my brother is to love my brother. Heaposs a gentle giant, he donapost hurt anybody.He was a very loving person and he didnapost deserve what happened to him.Ms Ross, his fiancée, told CBS News: “He stood up for people, he was there for people when they were down, he loved people that were thrown away. We prayed over every meal, we prayedwe were having a hard time, we prayedwe were having a good time. “He came to Minnesota to get a fresh start, and Minneapolis to him we like this place where people were just kind and open to him.Mr Floyd was friends with former professional basketball player Stephen Jackson, who described him as his twin in an Instagram tribute.Why was Mr Floyd arrested   Four Minneapolis Police Department officers encountered Mr Floyd after a  call from a worker at the Cup Foods corner shop just after pm on Monday night.Owner Mahmod Abumayaleh, who was not there at the time, told CBS News that one of his employees called the emergency line because Mr Floyd tried to use a fake  bill to buy cigarettes.According to a transcript of the  call, a staff member claimed a customer passed fake bills and was sitting on a car parked outside after leaving the store.  The caller said the man refused to give the cigarettes back and was awfully drunk, not in control of himself and not acting right. After taking a description of the man and the car, the  operator tells the staff member: All right, I’ve got help on the way. If that vehicle or that person leaves before we get there, just give us a call back, otherwise we’ll have squads out there shortly, OK  Despite it being a non-violent alleged offence, Mr Abumayaleh said his employee followed protocol by calling the emergency line. What happened when police arrived   Minneapolis police said its officers responded to a forgery in progress and found Mr Floyd, who was with two other people, inside a parked car. Following Mr Floydaposs death, the force claimed he appeared to be under the influence and physically resisted as he got out of the car. Footage captured by a witness shows a struggle as Mr Floyd is dragged out of the driveraposs seat of the car and handcuffed. CCTV from the Dragon Wok restaurant shows him handcuffed and sat against a wall as police speak to him and the two other people - a man who got out of the front passenger seat and a woman who exited the back.  An officer lts Mr Floyd back onto his feet, and he is seen speaking as he is marched across the street towards police vehicles outside Cup Foods. The man and woman who were with him are spoken to by police. Mr Abumayaleh, the owner of the shop, told CBS News CCTV from his store shows Mr Floyd was not resisting officers during the incident. He said he has been asked not to release the video to the public. Rashad West, who owns the Dragon Wok restaurant, told CNN after reviewing his CCTV footage: Did not see any resistance, not at all.  CCTV footage obtained by Fox  shows handcuffed Mr Floyd falling to the floor along the driveraposs side of a waiting patrol car after being taken across the street. A second police vehicle blocks the view of the surveillance camera. Video taken by witness Darnella Frazier, who began recording moments after Mr Floyd fell, shows him pinned to the floor next to the rear passenger side of a police vehicle. In footage taken from a dferent angle, three officers are seen pinning him down while a fourth stands close by. For about eight minutes, Chauvin kneels on the back of Mr Floydaposs neck as he repeatedly gasps please, I canapost breathe before losing consciousness.

And when it comes to this breakfast of kings, the contents are pretty consistent. Youaposve got bacon, sausages, egg, beans, mushrooms, tomatoes, toast, a hash brown or two and possiblyyouaposre so inclined, black pudding. But one woman has ided the internet after sharing a snap of her plate, which contained a rather unexpected item.The home cook, known only as Jessica M, decided to add a portion of peas to her breakfast. Her snap was shared on the popular Twitter account, Rate My Plate and itaposs fair to say people had a lot of thoughts.The tweet garnered , likes and hundreds of retweets. A good number of people were firmly against the addition of peas. One person wrote: Itaposs a criminal offence to consume peas before noon. PS. Especially when you have beans. Beans are your aposmorning peaapos.  Another commented: Peas and beans on the same plate  For Breakfast  You should be on a register for this. A third Twitter user was very unforgiving, saying: Peas on a breakfast commands a  year sentence in a hard labour camp and a further two years for aggravating my OCD. Someone  replied: Peas have no place on that plate. A dferent person described the breakfast as sacrilege.  Even Birds Eye, who are known for selling bags of frozen peas, got involved in the debate. They posted: We admit that peas in an English breakfast is a bit rogue, but we also admire the attempt at making it healthy.

The technician was carrying test samples of three suspected Covid- patients when the bizarre incident is believed to have happened in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, India. But the monkeys reportedly snatched the specimens and fled from the Meerut Medical College on Friday.The samples had not yet been tested, Times Now reports. Locals filmed what they say is one of the monkeys sat in a tree chewing one of the sample collection kits. Fears are mounting about the virus spreading amid reports the monkeys are carrying the samples around nearby residential areas.  Amir Haque, Lucknow Bureau Chief, said in an interview with Times of India that during the attack, a monkey snatched one of the test samples.He described the incident as very, very dangerous. While animals cannot be responsible for carrying this disease,they are carrying these sample tests and they move away from the medical college to residential areas then definitelythere are contaminated kits there, then theycan spread the infection further.Therefore itaposs a very serious alarm for health authorities as well as the local administration involved. He said aposa troop of monkeysapos around the college have been reported previously for creating aposnuisanceapos but that this was apossomething newapos. Mr Haque said the medical college was looking into the matter and trying to trace the samples.

There will be classes for the main breeds, young handlers will have their own sections, and all the videos will be posted on the show website for everyone to view.There are full instructions on how to take part at www.scottishagriculturalshow so get involved, start halter training that heer or walking your goat. You’ve got until midnight on June  to enter and stand a chance of winning ’s only show in town.We’ll have a beer tent where you can meet up with folk, and while you might not be able to touch all the new tractors and combines, the country’s main dealers and businesses will have trade stands to pore over while you wait for the judging to be completed. We’re not forgetting farming heritage either, which will be represented with a class for vintage machinery.The food and drink tent will act as a shop window for all our top-class agricultural produce, and chefs will give cookery demonstrations and offer tips on how to make the most of Scotland’s delicious larder.And once you’re inspired to start baking you’ll find all the details of how to enter the cake competition on the website.DC Thomson is throwing all its weight behind organising Scotland’s first virtual agricultural show, a move which the company’s head of newspapers, Richard Neville, said was in response to a desire from readers and advertisers for a way of maintaining some sort of show presence this summer.“We hope that all exhibitors and entrants enjoy the experience and hopefully it will show that there can be a digital alternative to even the oldest and most traditional events in our packed agri-business calendar,” he said.Getting the mighty Royal Highland Show’s unqualied support has been a huge boost, and one of the show directors, farmer Kay Adam from Angus, gave the online event her enthusiastic backing.“Excellent judges have been lined up to take part and I hope many of the breeders who had hoped to parade in the shows this summer will feature on the small screen in this show,” she said.Our main sponsor is EQ Accountants, one of the leading providers of accountancy, tax and business advice to Scotland’s agricultural industry. Also on board so far are Rural Scotland , ANM Group , Samaritans , Netherton Tractors , Angus Timber Cabins , Mackays Dundee , Red Poppy , Bon Accord Soft Drinks , Balgownie , Stewart’s Resort , Gin Bothyand  Brewing .EQ partner Graeme Davidson emphasised how much the agricultural community would miss the traditional show season this summer.He added: “We enjoy welcoming clients and friends to our stands at the Fe, Angus and Turrf Shows. We’ll miss that this year but hope that the virtual show provides a way of supporting those communities in an interesting and innovative way.”The Tele is Dundee Born and Read, and is committed to providing news to our communities.Right now that’s more important than ever, which is why our key content is free.You can chose to support us and access premium content by subscribing to the Eveningfrom just £. a month."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53920876-242x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53920876-501x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53920876-759x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53920876-242x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"coronavirus live your key updates on may 29","story":"Keep up with the latest updates as the coronavirus pandemic continues throughout Scotland and the UK.Reporters from across the DCT Media titles will keep you up to date with the latest closures, cancellations, health information and more.We’ll bring you all of the news as it happens throughout the day:The Tele is Dundee Born and Read, and is committed to providing news to our communities.Right now that’s more important than ever, which is why our key content is free.You can chose to support us and access premium content by subscribing to the Eveningfrom just £. a month."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53920876-242x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53920876-501x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53920876-759x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53920876-242x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"george cran schism spfl","story":"IT feels very much like there’s a schism opening up in Scottish football over when to get back to action – the cans and the cannots.Various start points have been suggested – July, August, October, January and beyond.What is becoming increasingly clear, though, is there are clubs who can’t afford to play in front of empty stands without financial aid from where.But there are also clubs who can’t afford not to be playing as soon as safely possible, empty stands or not.In each of the bottom three leagues, there are teams on either side of this ide.And it’s a ide which could have serious lasting effects on the long-term future of the SPFL.The Premiership clubs have already stated they’ll be looking to start training again next month and a start date in August seems to be the target.Of course, without a vaccine, it very much looks like there will be no punters there to cheer their teams on from the stands.Sky Sports, though, want something to put on the air and, with a chunky new deal to kick off, the top flight can’t afford to consider any kind of mothballing, despite the immense costs to continually test personnel for Covid-.For Dundee United, that means they’ll kick off their long-awaitedto the top table quietly.It’s not ideal but I’m sureyou offered Arabs the deal that their team would be back in the Premiership but they wouldn’t be there to see it, they’d take it.As has been said often, these are unprecedented times and compromises have to be made.Across the road, though, things are much more uncertain.Dundee want to get back playing, behind closed doors or not.The Dark Blues are in a relatively stable place financially right now but they’ll be back to paying a full squad’s wages in October when the furlough scheme ends –there’s no football by that point, they’ll be paying big wages for no work.However, other Championship clubs are clearly in a dferent position – my club Queen of the South have said it would be financial suicide to play behind closed doors for them – and they aren’t the only ones.It doesn’t seem like there can be a compromise between these two stances. What happens then Will we see the ‘cans’ come together to form their own league temporarily and leave the ‘cannots’ to their mothballs We’ve all railed at the self-interest that has forever governed the SPFL – this all seems a more reasonable discussion but one that could, evenonly temporarily, see some clubs leave others behind in the dust.GORDON Strachan fairly rattled a few cages with his views at the start of the week.The Dundee technical director takes exception to some clubs in the lower leagues surviving for survival’s sake.From a man who has played and managed at the highest level, he’s certainly one whose views should be taken into account.He called for more professionalism throughout the leagues and to get away from the part-time mentality.I agree.But there is also an assumption there that being part-time is somehow a choice for clubs in the lower isions.These teams have to scrap for every penny so they can try to be competitive on the pitch. Cash isn’t exactly flowing, even in the Championship.On the former Scotland manager’s opinion that we don’t sell our game nearly as well as we should, I wholeheartedly agree.We hold ourselves back as a group by thinking only about ourselves – change that and the money will filter down the leagues and, hopefully, bring more professionalism.CLUBS across the country are releasing their players.It’s normal for the profession at this time of year but this time is dferent – players now can’t find new employment.Dundee, as well as Falkirk and Ayr, should be applauded for resisting the urge to cut costs by granting the players at least a few weeks more pay.When you see a club like Dunfermline release  players, it puts it into perspective.I don’t think  will be the highest number we see either.I was disappointed to hear my team Queen of the South release almost their entire squad.Pretty much only Stephen Dobbie and Kevin Holt remain.It’s a business decision but there is also a human aspect of looking after your staff.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"jiving-gis-glasgows-george-square---ve-day-memories","story":"BONFIRES so hot they cracked tenement windows.

This has included harrowing statistics about the lack of representation in sport and how a club like Taexali would be considered illegal in many countries across the world.Mr Skene said: “It’s been really interesting to do a lot of research around this and find out how lucky we are to be living in Scotland, but at the same time realise how many people in the world are still not free to be who they are.“We found out that Aberdeen Taexali would be illegal in  countries across the globe under ‘Propaganda Laws’. This is crazy when you think how much we’ve done this week – and throughout the year to promote our club and the community we represent.”In addition to facts and stats the club has also shared recipes, workouts, Netflix recommendations, hosted video chats and created Pride playlists, as well as share support from other Caledonian Rugby Clubs and even professional rugby league player, Keegan Hirst.“I contacted Keegan on Instagram to seehe would be interested in sharing a video message and he jumped at the chance,” Mr Skene added.“Keegan is a real inspiration as the first openly gay rugby league player, and we were thrilled that he sent a message of support. He touched on the fact that Pride represents a collaborative and supportive community, and sport echoes this. Something that is firmly felt across our team.“Our mission is to help break down some barriers that exist for some people who ordinarily might not get involved in rugby for whatever that reason might be, whether that be sexual orientation, race, gender, age or experience. We want to provide a safe, inclusive and active space in the sport of rugby union.“Whilst our players are predominantly LGBT+ we also have straight players who are just as much part of the team. Sexual orientation is not a barrier – we welcome anyone regardless of how they might identy.”Aberdeen Taexali’s Pride Week will come to a conclusion tomorrow when they take part in a live QA on Grampian Pride’s Facebook page at noon.For more information about Aberdeen Taexali and to view their Pride activity, visit aberdeentaexali or the team#s Facebook page here.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/05/70365342-376x564.jpg ","title":"car parks to be turned into pubs as aberdeen moves out of lockdown","story":"Car parks could be turned into outdoor seating areas for pubs and restaurants as businesses takes their first steps out of lockdown.Aberdeen City Council today urged licence holders to get in touch #as soon as possible# so that arrangements can be put in place in time for Scottish Government lockdown rules being relaxed.It comes as the city council unveiled its phase one plans for easing restrictions, including the reopening of recycling centres, parks, leisure activities and contact between households.Some pubs in the north-east are aleady making preparations to expand seating areas into their car parks and more are expected to following in the coming weeks. vw, px\"  Stephen Cruickshank, owner of The New Greentrees in Dyce, said he was in a fortunate position because the pub already has decking area outside, but he#d been keen to expand into the car park and use marquee.He added: “We’re going to be using our outdoor area and put a marquee up in the car park and put some tables and chairs under it. We’re just waiting for it to arrive.“I’m going to take away three tables from the decking and put them at the marquee, we should have about   covers. We just need to make sure we do it properly and safely so people feel comfortable coming.“We’re excited to get going again.”Simon Cruickshank, co-owner of The Ploughman and The Richmond Arms in Peterculter, said he would be happy to see more outdoor seating at The Richmond Arms, and would also consider the possibility of extending outdoor areas into the car park at The Ploughman,allowed.He said: “We took over The Ploughman last year and we spent a lot of money on it. We have a seating area for  people that will % be opening, but it would benefit the Richmond Armswe were allowed to extend onto the pavement and could put tables and chairs out.“It would be a great thing for businesseswe were all allowed to do this.

We’re all geared up to go.#Councillor Marie Boulton, Aberdeen City Council#s licensing board convener, said teams were standing by to process and evaluate applications for outdoor seating.She said: #Some businesses have outdoor areas, there will be those trying to open some that will require people to put in occasional licenses.“Certainly we recognise businesses needs at the moment, and we’ll be working very closely to facilitate what we can, but we need to be mindful there are people on the streets, and there are those businesses that are in a heavily residential areas.“I have been on calls with the licensing team to make sure we are in a good position in terms of processing them.“Normally for an occasional license, which is what they would be applying for, you put the dates for when it starts and finishes, that’s a bit dficult at the moment but we’re going to ask businesses to guess dates.“Our roads teams, our planning teams, licensing teams are all ready to go with applications.“We’d encourage peoplethey would be interested in going down that avenue to put an application in as soon as possible,they want outdoor seating or to use their car parks. We’re ready to action any requests we get.#Council co-leader Douglas Lumsden said: #We are looking forward to the next stage, which is hopefully going to see restaurants and pubs opening again in some capacity.#Work has already started on making sure that can happen and we would urge businesses to get in touch with us as soon as possible to make sure we can get the appropriate licences or changes to planning permission in place.#We want to make sure, when the time comes to move to phase two and they can open again, that they are ready. There is a lot of work ahead of us to make sure businesses are prepared.# vw, px\"  Paul Clarkson, operations director at PB Devco, which owns bars such as Soul, The College and The Howff, as well as many others in the city, said: #It’s definitely worthwhile and can benefit us getting back to business.“We’re lucky as we have outdoor seating at Soul when they are allowed to sit there, but we’ve got the Howff where there isn’t really that option. We’re kind of joint tenants with the old Bruce Millers, maybe potentially we could use that space. It would be greatit would be allowed at College Bar as well, being so close to Union Street.”Meanwhile Peter Argyle, deputy leader of Aberdeenshire Council and a member of the licensing board, said: “We probably will receive more applications, I know particularly coffee shops will be wanting to do stuff like that.#It will be tough as there’s a lot of narrow streets and narrow pavements, but it is something that will be looked at as part of our engagement with town centres. I think it’s something we would look at on a case by case basis, what things can be done, but as far as I know, we have no plans to do this yet.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53920876-242x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53920876-501x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53920876-759x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53920876-242x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"number of covid 19 cases in north east increases to 1269","story":"Another fteen people have died in Scotland due to coronavirus, with  new cases confirmed in the north-east.The latest Scottish Government figures also show the total number of confirmed Covid- cases across Grampian have increased to ,.There are  people in hospital in the region, with five in intensive care.The latest Scottish Government figures also show the total number of confirmed Covid- deaths across Scotland is ,, up from , yesterday.Around , people in Scotland have now been tested for the virus, with the total number of confirmed cases sitting at ,.The Greater Glasgow and Clyde area has the highest number of cases in Scotland with ,.The Evening Express is committed to providing news to our communities.Right now that’s more important than ever, which is why our key content is free.You can chose to support us and access premium content by subscribing to the Evening Express from just £. a month."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53909297-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53909297-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53909297-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53909297-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"work to transform aberdeens union street to begin in coming days","story":"Work to transform a major Aberdeen street to help deal with Covid- could begin within days, council chiefs have revealed.Aberdeen City Council has been awarded more than £. million of funding from Sustrans to make changes to Union Street.The plans will see the thoroughfare become completely car-free, with lanes normally used for traffic reallocated for pedestrian use.Council chiefs hope the proposals will allow people to walk, cycle and queue for buses and shops safely as the UK begins to move out of lockdown.Sandra Macdonald, Aberdeen City Council#s transport spokeswoman, said: #This is going to be rolled out over the next few weeks.

More details of the competition and the prizes on offer at the bottom of this page.To be clear, features we#ll run on the contenders for Aberdeen#s Greatest Goal, followed by a closing poll to determine the winner, won#t necessarily focus on goals of signicance which have secured silverware or qualication, like John Hewitt#s header in Gothenburg or Darren Mackie#s finish in Dnipro.What we are talking about is goals of technical brilliance, made either inidually or as a team, some of which could be meaningless in terms of competitions and silverware.Jess had not long destroyed Rangers at Hampden with a fantastic showing in the  League Cup semi-final, which the Dons won -.The narrative following that game was how ordinary the Pittodrie youth academy product had made English superstar Paul Gascoigne look, famously performing keepie-ups during the match.Three weeks later, Jess # playing in an attacking midfield role # would make another blockbuster contribution in a league game in Glasgow.On  minutes, the Portsoy native controlled the ball on halfway before driving ferociously towards the Gers# goal. The defenders, in reverse, didn#t know whether to jockey or go towards Jess until it was too late, and he proceeded to smash an absolute hammer of a shot into the top-left corner of Andy Goram#s net from  yards.We want youngsters to have a go at imitating our Aberdeen#s Greatest Goal contenders, with the club agreeing to give away a kids# home kit and kids# away kit for the two best efforts as chosen by our  of judges. Those two winners will also receive a £ Smyths voucher each to get some football equipment, kit your garden out with a set of goals, or just spend any way you like!There will also be £ Smyths vouchers for two runners-up.All you need to do to be in with a chance of winning is to send your clip to eecompetitions@ajl via WeTransfer with the subject heading #Dons Goals#.

Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

By adding night-scented plants and soft lighting, along with pale-coloured flowers and foliage that appear to glow in the fading light, your garden will become an enticing ‘room’ to sit in at the end of the day.White flowering plants # like big blooms of hydrangeas # have a lovely glow in the evening garden reflecting the last of the light which makes them appear brighter than other plants.  Pale blues and lilacs also look their best in fading light, so sea holly with its tiny blue flowers that sit in rosettes of silvery-grey bracts is a great addition.Bright foliage also creates an evening glow in the garden. Light-coloured, iegated and silver leaf plants reflect any available light. Lambs Earis a popular ground cover plant that has the most wonderful soft, furry, silver-grey leaves.  It’s fairly drought resistant so a good choice for a dry, sunny border.Many beautul flowers only produce scent at night and often have a stronger aroma than their daytime counterparts.  Fragrance is released from night-scented flowers as the heat of the day lingers into the evening.  Petunias may seem be a strange choice for a night garden, but they are night scented. Some smell during the day, but not to the same intensity of the night scent. Night Scented Stocks do just that and have a pastel colour flower palate.It’s best to plant scented night garden flowers where you’ll brush against them or come close to them. Try planting them around doors and paths.  If you are planting in pots make sure you arrange them round seating areas to provide a heady aroma or position them near doors and windows so that the fragrance drts inside.Even though planting the right night-flowering plants in the right place will give you stunning effects,you want to really enjoy your garden after dark, some form of garden lighting is essential.  Try not to floodlight your entire garden. Instead, pick out specic plants and trees to showcase. Up lighting, either set on spikes or recessed into the ground, showcases plants beautully at night.But it’s not just at night time you want your garden to look good so here are some tips for this month from the Royal Horticultural Society."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 15 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A big thank you to whoever has tidied up Ardrishaig Community Garden, mown the grass and repaired and painted the fences.Such a peaceful place to call into while out exercising.

They are doing the same to support other temporary NHS services across Scotland.Our people have worked around the clock with health boards across the country to offer new, technical solutions to help frontline health workers get on with their jobs during this crisis.Our frontline staff in contact centres across Scotland – including Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow and Greenock – have risen to this unprecedented challenge. We’ve received a huge surge of customers asking for faster connections to help with home working, home schooling and running their businesses remotely.These colleagues – most of whom can now work from home when they want to – have performed a critical role keeping our customers, including frontline health workers and vulnerable people, connected.The people in our two  contact centres in Scotland are also playing a critical role, answering lesaving emergency calls.I couldn’t be more proud of how my colleagues have responded to these challenges and their desire to help us all through this crisis.Jane Wood, BT Group director in Scotland, Edinburgh.COVID- is seriously not a jokeGlobally kills thousands of folkYou start coughing, you can#t breatheWithout a respirator, this earth you#ll leaveSocial distancing is now in placeKeep two metres apart, not face to faceWash your hands frequently and well hours on surfaces it can dwellShop infrequently, for essentials onlyDon#t mix with othersyou#re lonelyKeep in touch by text and phoneDon#t put yourself at risk, stay aloneIt#s hoped soon this contagion will peakThen we canto normal, so to speakDon#t travel to other towns by carIt can spread the virus near and farSports, socialising and most work on holdThe alternative could cause damage untoldSupport the NHS, essential workers and neighboursThen we#ll defeat this virus by all our laboursDugald MacGilp, Lochgilphead.Sir,We are looking for people who have the passion to bring communities together, believe in the power of co-operation and who hold the well-being of their community at the forefront of their mind.The successful #Member Pioneers# will receive full training and business support as they help groups and iniduals during the coronavirus pandemic and beyond.

Mindfulness concentrates your mind on the ‘here and now’ and is a proven way of dealing with mild depression or anxiety.Focus on what the plants feel like – not just their fragrance when touched – from leathery and lacey to soft and smooth. You can also mix plants that are great to touch with tactile hard landscaping elements such as a water feature, smooth polished round pebbles or the glazed ceramics.Some top touching plants and features to considerLeaves # try Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Lamb#s Ear. Its soft, downy, furry silver-grey leaves are a favourite among gardeners who tend to use it for ground cover in rich soil. As a contrast there is Acuba japonicawhich has smooth, glossy leathery leaves.Flowers # who can resist touching a bottlebrush Callistemon cintrinus – bundles of tiny delicate stamen flowers form a brush that’s soft to touch – or the soft paper-thin petals of a poppy Papaver orientale.Grasses # run your hand over the arching, thread-like leaves of feathery Stipa tenuissima also known as Mexican feather grass or the more robust drought proof ornamental Festuca glauca with thread-like blue foliage that forms dense mounds.Bark – tree bark can also provide a tactile experience especially when it’s the stunning flowering cherry Prunus serrulate with mahogany coloured bark that peels away in bands round the trunk.Landscaping – you can easily y the textures in your garden by choosing dferent hard landscaping options. If you have smooth pebbles surrounding a water feature that you can run your hand over and through, you could place lichen-covered rocks in another area of the garden.Our general well-being is intrinsically linked to the natural world which is why Thrive – the gardening for health charity – has developed the Thrive Gardening Club.For fortnightly tips on getting the most out of your garden, whatever your age or ability, and information on how gardening can keep you healthy and feeling good visit www.thrive.org.uk get-involved keep-in-touch subscribe-to-gardening-clubThrive is the UK’s leading provider of social and therapeutic horticulture programmes using gardening to bring about positive changes in the lives of people living with disabilities, ill health or mental health issues, or who are isolated, disadvantaged or vulnerable."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 22 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,Mental Health Awareness Week, now in its th year, runs from May  to May .This year, the theme for the week is kindness and across the country, people will be celebrating kindness in digital and creative ways within social distancing restrictions.The last couple of months, with all the uncertainty of the virus and the impact of lockdown, have been an extremely stressful and worrying time for many people across the Highlands and Islands. People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

the lockdown.But even this is reliant on two key factors -the scientic andmedical advice confirms it can be done in a way that will not disrupt efforts to control the virus andthere is sufficient PPE and other hygiene measures in place.Following Ms Sturgeons announcement in parliament, the Scottish Government published its strategic framework for the re-opening of schools.Here, well detailwhat parents need to know ahead of their childsto the classroom.When will schools re-open Schools in Scotland are set to re-open on August .This is earlier than planned for some schools - but the universal approach is being advised by the Scottish Government.Teachers are set toto the classroom by June to plan and prepare for the new blended model of learning.Some pupils set to start P or S may also receive some in-school experience in late June, to help ensure they are supported to make the next steps in their education.Critical childcare will continue until August to ensure the ongoing provision for key worker and vulnerable children.How will the blended model work Under this approach, children will have a mixture of in-school and in-home learning.According to the framework, this is reliant on consistent and easy-to-use in-home materials which are \"intended to support and complement, but not replicate\" in-school learning.To help disadvantaged pupils, a further poundm was announced to provide laptops and other technology for the home learning.However the document notes: \"No matter how well planned in-home learning is, it is not the same as having effective learning and teaching within the school environment, led by teachers.\"The blended model will be kept under constant review.How will pupils social distance For the first phase of re-opening, schools are being asked to assess the maximum numbers they can accommodate, with guidance including:Pupils being taught in smaller groupsThese groups will not be mixed, where practicableSeating positions will be re-organised to allow for m gaps between pupilsOutdoor space will be used moreThere will be staggered arrival and departure times, so parents will avoid congregating in playground areasBreaks will be staggered by class to avoid contact from dferent classesTeachers, rather than pupils, will move around classrooms where possibleThere will be enhanced hygiene practices across all schools, including additional cleaning,params: .pushExpanding the learning estateLocal authorities are being advised to look for ways they can maximise the capacity for pupils to benefit from in-school learning as much as possible.One such way they are doing this is through expanding the learning estate.This would mean seeingclassrooms could be made fromoutdoor space,libraries, community halls, leisure centres and conference centres.It might also include taking short-term leases of vacant business accommodation.Who will be prioritised for in-school learning As set out above, there is likely going to be a finite number of daily places for in-school learning.As a result, to support NHS capacity and other essential work, a priority will be given to the children of keyworkers - but this is only in circumstances where absolutely necessary with no other option for childcare within that household.The remaining allocation is to be distributed across all year groups to ensure every pupils benefits from in-school learning where possible, according to the framework.Local authorities are being advices to use their knowledge of local circumstances to prioritise any groups where need is greatest.Speaking in the Scottish Parliament on Thursday, the First Minister said: ldquoThese arrangements will not represent a completeto normality by August.ldquoBut we judge them to be the most sensible approach we can plan for at this stage.Later in the session, the First Minister said the Scottish Government wants to ensure pupils will be back at school ldquoin a way that allows them to be children.She added: ldquoNone of us relish the prospect of seeing kids, particularly young kids, socially distancing or be as aware of these risks as we will undoubtedly have to require them to be.ldquoTrying to get, for

He tried to play in a country style while I preferred jazz, and while knocking the numbers about came up with, I suppose, Scottish rockrsquonrsquoroll.In  Harvey won a newspaper competition to find Scotlandrsquos answer to Tommy Steele: his charisma and musical talents put him miles ahead of the  other hopefuls. A sequence of bands ensued, culminating in the Alex Harvey Soul Band, who were dynamite on stage and released an album in .

At school, he proved to be academically gted - his boyhood interests included ornithology and the work of the French Impressionists ndash and though Glasgow could be rough , it would prove pivotal in his musical development: it was in Glasgow that he picked up his first guitar and learned how to play it. Hamish Imlach was a considerable influence on the young Martynrsquos guitar abilities. Martyn graduated to some of the local folk clubs. At , London beckoned: and in October  he released his debut album, London Conversation. A second album, The Tumbler, followed  months later. It was the birth of a remarkable career full of outstanding achievements. Martyn died, aged , in January .-- CLOUDSTHE story of progressive rock in this country owes much to this adventurous Scottish trio ndash Ian Ellis , Billy Ritchieand Harry Hughes . Initially known as --, they supported Jimi Hendrix at two London gigs in May . David Bowie was an early fan and hung around with them. ldquoWersquod just been signed by Brian Epstein and David thought we were the next big thing, as did we, Ritchie recalled in . Re-named Clouds in , they signed to a major label and released three albums. They were years ahead of their time but, despite their musical gts and favourable reviews, Clouds didnrsquot get the success they deserved. They did, however, influence several key prog-rock bands. ldquoWe simply werenrsquot showmen and distrusted those who were. But Irsquod have to concede that all those other bands took something clever and non-commercial ndash us ndash and made it more popular and successful, Ritchie said.THE INCREDIBLE STRING BANDTHIS ground-breaking and hugely influential group emerged from the Scottish folk scene. Robin Williamson, Clive Palmer and Mike Heron released a debut album in  music we wanted to listen to, Heron would later say, but then Williamson and Palmer went abroad. Multi-instrumentalists Heron and Palmer reformed the ISB as a duo and made a series of visionary albums, including The  Spirits or The Layers of the Onion, and The Hangmanrsquos Beautul Daughter. Led Zeppelin, David Bowie and Paul McCartney were all admirers. As author Rob Young observes in his book, Electric Eden, the duo had by the decadersquos end become a cult hit with fans and critics, one broadsheet writer going so far as to say that they now rivalled the Beatles in being ldquothe most important influence in songwriting.

The group had impressed the Rolling Stones manager, Andrew Loog Oldham , and they found themselves part of Jagger  corsquos circle. The song, which can be heard on YouTube, is replete with -string guitars and tambourines, and was ahead of its time. ldquoThere had been nothing like it in pop before, says Brian Hogg in his History of Scottish Rock and Pop. Subsequent Poets singles maintained the bandrsquos original style of making music.THE BEATSTALKERSThere are those who take the view that this Glasgow sixties beat group are the story of Scottish music. Occasionally billed as the lsquoScottish Beatlesrsquo, they were an exciting live act, blessed with strong songs. They famously caused a riot with a free, open-air lunchtime concert in Glasgowrsquos George Square in June,  . Their song, You Better Get a Better Hold On, shows what they were capable of. The band recorded songs with David Bowie and shared stages with such acts as Marc Bolan and the Kinks.MARMALADEINITIALLY known as Dean Ford and the Gaylords, then the Gaylords, Marmalade were a key act of the era. Their early songs -Itrsquos All Leading up to Saturday Night,Canrsquot Stop Now,I See the Rain- got them noticed. With the singles, Cant Stop Now There Aint No Use in Hanging On, and I See the Rain, the band \"captured the experimental aura of s flower-power summer\", says Brian Hogg in the History of Scottish Rock and Pop. \"These records may not have been the freak-rock of a Soft Machine or Family, but they were exemplary, exploratory pop and have remained as fresh, light and inspired as they were whe first recorded\". Marmalade went on to have a Number One hit with a cover of the Beatles Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da in , and a top  hit with Reflections of My Le, \"a more serious work which ably reflected their underused compositional skills\" .

However, the rules of the council, inexplicably, forbid us from making any comment or statement, evenit is only to clear up factual inaccuracies and glaring errors. That seems absurd and perverse.ldquoHad we been able to speak and to cross-examine officers, I am confident that councillors would never have reached this ridiculous decision and that neither ourselves nor the council would have ended up in court.The retail park, around . miles from the town centre, currently has a number of home and DIY stores on site.However Dutch firm Promontoria Holdings applied for planning permission to extend it and develop a number of other leisure and shopping outlets.The councilrsquos planning committee approved the plans in June last year but Bridges Antonine decided to take the matter further.They claimed that, as the council had failed to carry out a Retail Impact Assessment, officials ldquoacted unreasonably and perversely in concluding that the Westway proposal could be developed without detriment to Cumbernauld Town Centre.Lord Burns agreed and found that the local authority failed to properly assess the impact the proposal would have on Cumbernauld town centre, adding that the centre had problems with ldquoretail contraction and vacancy issues.He also found that councillors were not provided with sufficient information to make their decision.The council could now be forced to pay Bridges Antoninersquos legal costs in the case, as well as paying for their own legal fees at the expense of the taxpayer.This is likely to run to tens of thousands of pounds.It is understood that the guidelines preventing Bridges Antonine from addressing the planning committee were introduced in .Mr Tyler added: ldquoWe consistently attempted to alert the council about errors in the processes but were thwarted. It is vital that the protocols the council follows in future allow proper communication with the committee to avoid future costly failures.ldquoSurely it makes sense for North Lanarkshire issues to be heard in North Lanarkshire and not at the Court of Session in Edinburgh.A spokeswoman for North Lanarkshire Council said: ldquoThe council adheres to Standing Orders in relation to how committees operate.

In addition, the fact that he drove to and from Barnard Castle to test his eyesight, which had been giving him problems, again accompanied by his we and child, and drove the  miles back to London, without any mishap occurring, was also more good luck than good judgment.Given that Mr Cummings would appear to trust more to luck than judgment, is he really the kind of man who should be in charge of running the country Ruth Marr, Stirling.WHILST the First Minister has accepted that mistakes have likely been made and ndash when this is over ndash it will be necessary to undertake a review on all aspects of its handling, I have yet to see such contrition or indeed any such constructive comment from the Prime Minister.What is simply not acceptable, as he is currently attempting with his Dominic Cummings dficulty, is to \"move on\" to address other issues in which he is interested ndash EU withdrawal and more.As a member of the public, I am certainly not content with applauding the heroics of the NHS staff and yet see them being deprived of the tools to do their job.This has been an early warning of what might come at a later date.

Wherever the coronavirus has achieved signicant infection rates, grim death rates in care homes have followed, often accounting for  per cent or more of total deaths. On cursory examination England currently appears to be exhibiting a lower rate but when \"excess deaths\" are fully accounted the rate there will not only likely be comparable, as indicated by the recent LSE study, but the overall death rate per head of population looks like it may be the highest in Europe, and possibly the highest in the world, through this first phase of the pandemic.Jackson Carlaw and Richard Leonard have now both decided to point their political fingers at the Scottish Government for embarking on a UK-wide approach of accelerated early discharge from hospitals, especially of the elderly, at a time when hospitals were expected to be overwhelmed with Covid- patients . Following the advice of clinicians some were discharged into care homes subject to Government regulations and guidelines. Certainly at the time none of these politicians was disputing this logical action, but perhaps everyone has been naiumlve about the day-to-day ing of care homes, especially those governed by the aims of private investors. Staff moving in and out of care homes, many of which were not properly prepared for a pandemic and initially not fully supported by their management in the purchase of appropriate PPE, may have been the primary carriers of Covid- into these homes.How many were are in the unenviable position of effectively working under zero-hours-contracts with little or no income should they suspect they may have the virus and feel compelled to work on, especially in situations where residents in their care are already suffering because of reduced staffing numbers and the torture, for some, of isolation Stan Grodynski, Longniddry.I AM in complete agreement with David Stubley . If folk think that this crisis is going to changes attitudes, they are living in a dream. Many little people are going to emerge much sadder, but I doubtmany of those in power will emerge any wiser. The Prime Ministerrsquos blustering performance of avoidance last night , in the face of measured and reasonable questions from his colleagues was simply cringe-worthy.The Rees-Moggs, the Goves, the Johnsons of this world, in their vanity, their arrogance, their greed and their disdain only see the current situation as an opportunity for profit, be it financial or political. The offshore accounts will remain, as will the tax-evasion schemes, but oh, what a shame for those who have lost their jobs or businesses.Does anyone remember the Panama Papers  Were there any signicant repercussions  No.John NE Rankin, Bridge of Allan.Read more: Letters: It is no wonder the people are baying for blood"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-no-time-thinking-indyref2","story":"This surprising result, at least to me, suggests that a majority are looking for such a referendum to be held during a time when we will be faced with continuing to cope with the ongoing profound financial, economic and health consequences of the pandemic and the signicant adjustments of ious kinds necessary due to our exit from the EU with or without a trade deal. Negotiations with Brussels are not apparently going well at present. The time would be patently out of joint for such a Scottish political initiative.My reaction, to the poll finding, is similar to that once given by the tennis legend John McEnroe to an umpire during a match: \"You cannot be serious.Ian W Thomson, Lenzie.IT is heartening to read that Neil Mackay has become a ldquojaded Yes voter, giving ample evidence of the woeful record of Nicola Sturgeonrsquos regime, prior to and during the Covid- pandemic .As he is a declared Yes voter, he might want to dedicate a number of Herald articles on the costed, credible, economic and financial case for an independent Scotland, especially on the financial support received from Westminster during this time. I am confident these figures, which SNP politicians never want to discuss, will prove that an independent Scotland cannot survive on emotion and sentiment alone and is best placed as a strong, properly managed devolved nation within the substantial economic strength of the UK.Had Scotland become independent following the referendum in , outwith the UK and definitely not part of the EU due to inability to meet economic criteria, where would Ms Sturgeon have gone for financial support during the pandemic It is morally indefensible to base the future of a separate Scotland on Braveheart emotion without providing ldquothe people of Scotland with real facts and figures ndash these should be very revealing.Douglas Cowe, Newmachar.IN business it is wise to copy the policy of successful competitors.Had an independent Scotland invested, as Norway did, in a sovereign wealth fund, we would have been able to provide our NHS with every penny to combat and survive the Covid crisis and emerge with plenty left for recovery investment.The lesson is clear.J Hamilton, Bearsden.I FULLY endorse the sentiments aired by Emily Maitlis about Dominic Cummings on Newsnight, however, the BBC was perfectly correct to reprimand her .Dare we hope that this signals a new departure for the corporation.

However, we are asking you, for now, to please stay within, or close to, your own local area. And don’t use public transport unless it is absolutely necessary.”The first steps out of lockdown could only involve “careful and cautious” changes, she said.In Orkney, this means that travel on public bus and inter-island ferry and air services will continue to be for essential reasons only during Phase One, with passenger numbers severely restricted as a result of and in line with social distancing requirements.Across Scotland it is assessed that social distancing will reduce transport capacity by  per cent –  per cent and this figure is very much in line with the assessment in Orkney for our ferries and local bus services.During Phase One, there will be no changes to the current timetables for local bus, ferry and inter-island air services.For Orkney Ferries, the aim is to help protect residents in the isles from the risk of infection – along with the crews who operate the service – and to ensure that the ferries can continue to run and deliver freight and other essential supplies.The Scottish Government’s new guidance, published on Tuesday , will help public transport operators and passengers prepare for the further lting of lockdown restrictions at a future date.Detailed information from the government on the newly announced Public Transport Guidance has been sent to the council. Careful consideration is being given to how this might apply locally when the move to Phase Two begins.The guidance does state that people should wear face coverings when using public transport and further information on the council’s expectations on this will be provided in due course.The government has acknowledged that there will be geographic challenges in implementing the guidance and that there can be no ‘one size fits all’ to the approach taken across Scotland.The government’s latest travel advice is available here: https:www.transport.gov.scot coronavirus-covid- transport-transition-plan advice-on-how-to-travel-safely copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We remain committed to supporting the work of the management group to co-ordinate a range of goose management measures as soon as feasibly possible.”Alan Corrigall, Orkney NFU Scotland chairman said: “We are disappointed that the momentum which had been gathering to find new ways to control the resident geese population has come to a halt.  However, hopefully marksmen shooting later this summer can still go ahead as planned, and the other agreed control measures can be trialled next year.”Land managers can still control greylag geese under the General Licence to prevent agricultural damage, provided they can comply with the Government’s COVID- restriction rules. The General Licence was amended this year so inidual licences to carry out shooting or egg oiling during closed season are no longer required.Greylag goose meat sales have also been consented under a General Licence for Orkney. As a result, land managers on Orkney can now, under food hygiene legislation, sell the greylag goose carcasses they generate,they are satisfied they comply with the COVID- suppression rules.

There were , Armed Forces personnel stood at readiness to assist civil authorities, of which nearly , have already been deployed.Military reservists have also been mobilised as part of the COVID Support Force and used in a range of activities, from providing medical and logistical support to deploying their own professional skills, such as accounting and construction.The help from the UK’s armed forces during the Coronavirus outbreak has taken a number of dferent forms. The Armed Forces have deployed dozens of military planners across the UK, which has seen them working with Local Resilience Forums and Partnerships, alongside the Emergency Co-ordination Centres in Scotland and Wales supporting public services, local authorities and emergency services.The UK Armed Forces’ efforts have included working with specialists from Boots Pharmacists to train testing personnel, the provision of military testers to regional testing centres and the delivery of vital testing equipment. Military personnel are also currently working to distribute PPE to NHS trusts and organisations across the country.Up to May , Armed Forces personnel had helped to deliver over . billion items of PPE to NHS staff in England. Six military specialists have also been deployed to assist NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde with the fitting of FFP face masks.A new COVID Aviation Task Force has been established.

From the inability to spend time with family and friends to the impact on businesses, the effect has been profound and far-reaching.  Thanks to those efforts, however, we have seen a downward trend in new cases of infection that has enabled the Scottish Government to begin easing restrictions.“Despite this initial relaxation of the rules, however, I was pleased to hear the First Minister reiterate that travelling to the islands, other than in exceptional circumstances, is still not possible for now.  It is a dficult message, but absolutely the right one at this time.“We know that many people across the UK, and further afield, look forward to visiting Orkney at this time of year.  However, the safety of our community remains paramount and there is still some way to go before we can begin welcoming visitors again.“The First Minister’s message though is a reminder of the signicant economic impact that the shutdown of the tourism sector has on Orkney.  The grant support provided by the UK and Scottish governments to mitigate this impact has been welcome, but too many local businesses still find they are falling between the cracks.“I will continue to work with Ministers to ensure that gaps in support are closed.  Meantime, I would urge the public to keep following the advice of the government and hopefully it won’t be long before we can look forward to visitors ing to Orkney”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

That is crucial.#You should also avoid touching the same hard surfaces as they do.#And please — don’t go indoors. Being in someone ’s house should still be avoided, unless of course you are providing support to someone who is vulnerable.#There is no #legal limit# on the distance people should travel to meet another household but the public should use their #good judgement#.She admitted to feeling #nervous# as phase one of the #route map# out of lockdown was announced.#I worry that the limited changes we are making to these rules, the very careful changes, might lead to much greater change in reality. And so I really need your help to make sure that is not the case.#I am sure there are going to be lots of emotional reunions this weekend.

We ask those who are local to beaches to continue to be aware of the inherent dangers and to avoid taking risks. Our strong advice to the Scottish public, who are not local to a beach, is to exercise locally and not to travel to the coast.#Scotland’s air temperature may be warming up but the sea temperature remains consistently chilly all year, jumping or falling into cold water or spending longer periods than normal submerged in the water can lead to, potentially fatal, cold water shock.”Michael Avril, Scotland’s water safety lead for the RNLI and chair of Water Safety Scotland said: “The Scottish public need to remember the following safety advice: Stay in familiar surroundings,follow Scottish Government advice of remaining within five miles of your home, don’t put yourself, your family and emergency services at risk by taking risks or assuming it ‘won’t happen to you’. If you do see someone at risk call  and ask for the Coastguard.”The message from the RNLI in Scotland is clear, an easing of lockdown does not mean an instantly safer coast and water temperatures remain dangerously cold.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

THAT shouldn’t be necessary should it  But, in true B J fashion he is resorting to make do and mend bluster. I am mindful of the blind leading the blind.Let decisions be made by scientists not ill equipped dabbling politicians.That little pat on the head should appeal to you !!But never mind Nicola is letting us out exercise twice a day. It is a shame we are all being channelled into the same crowded places, through the same gates and chokepoints whilst the wide-open spaces and beaches of Shetland are closed down to the majority!!In the present serious crisis she is in full agreement with Wales and Ireland but not with England. How fortunate that is.Britain is no longer ruled by England now that devolution has taken place. Boris Johnson claimed to be PM of 🇬🇧 Britain.He surely meant🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 not 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Scotland or 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿Wales.Westminster is reluctant to let goIt is extraordinary sad news from Care Homes and Care Workers, but not unexpected. It takes months of training and years of experience to Barrier nurse to prevent cross-infection. Even the use of PPE requires extensive training. Our most vulnerable people conjugated into crowded homes was an accident just waiting to happen. Hopefully, next time, our care workers will have extensive professional training cross infection control with qualications and wages to match. Our most vulnerable, not all be herded into care homes but perhaps into a chalet system where separation and quarantine would be so much more effective..What is the R rate for Shetland  Looks like zero The politicians # all of them can #go away# .Do your gardening, go fishing, go for a walk whenever and where ever you want. Get the kids back into school. Get our economy open and people back to work.This is my opinion.Dive, e , e # incoming!!!What do you want  A Country with a minimised death toll but teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, or a country that#s suffered a higher death toll, and while perhaps shaken somewhat financially, is still resilient enough to continue without any great undue hardship for the survivors.England at present seems to be trying to steer an admittedly somewhat shaky course towards the latter, the rest of the UK, unfortunately seem hell bent on taking the direct route straight to the former.You cannot sustain increased Governmental expenditure and decreased Governmental income for any longer than the very short term, it called burning the candle from both ends#. We#ve been doing it now for  weeks### Very soon the time will come when Governmental leaders will have to make decisions on how many deaths are acceptable collateral damage to allow them to provide the services the majority need and keep their country afloat. The longer they leave it to make that decision, the more rushed, and by consequence, less appropriate, it is likely to be.There is no vaccine, there is no #cure#. Unfortunately some are going to have to take a hit for the team.It’s unfortunate that three centuries of free-market capitalism hasn’t generated enough wealth to feed the country for more than three months without going bankrupt but don’t worry Michael. Many people share your concerns about the economy and the government is onto it:A confidential Treasury assessment of the coronavirus crisis leaked to Theargues that it will require measures including a two-year public sector pay freeze in order to “boost investor confidence# in the British economy. So, a round of grateful applause for the NHS Staff, Care Workers, Police and everyone at London Transport.I hope the nurses are enjoying all the clapping and rattling of pots and pans every Thursday because that is all they are going to get.It is reassuring to know that things really are ing to normal.At least a public sector pay freeze will not discriminate. It will apply equally across the board and affect everyone from care home cleaners on minimum wage to the head of health and social care at Labour controlled North Lanarkshire council, salary £,“Some are going to have to take a hit for the team.”Yes Michael, in more ways than one.Well put, Malcolm.Incidentally, there is no freeze on public sector wages. Typical nonsense and  information being leaked, another left-wingPR leak from socialist civil servant perhaps I think it was the the Argntine president when speaking about Covid  said, #you can recover from a drop in GDP, you cannot recover from death#Fernández makes a good point. The Argentine economy is taking a battering and so is our own but we need to see things in perspective:Last month, Morningstar ran an article about the likely effect of the Coronavirus lockdown on share idends to be paid out by U.K. companies listed on the London Stock Exchange.It set out four possible scenarios, best-case, worst-case, and two “realistic” estimates within that range. In the best-case scenario, overall idends fall % to £. billion, and in the worst they more than halve to £. billion.More recent comments in The Financial Times suggest that we are heading towards a midway point between the best-case and worst-case scenarios while Reuterswarned of a possible % drop in idends “ the situation continues to worsen.”If the economy can afford idend payments of £ billion during the lockdown, I suspect that it is strong enough to recover. Of course, the FT and Reuters are known to be simmering cesspits of socialist subversion, so possibly more fake news.p.s.For the avoidance of any unnecessary tantrums:“The Morning Star” is three words with two spaces whereas “Morningstar” is just one word with no spaces.The simple fact is unavoidable this virus is here to stay. One day we will all meet it. The single most important thing is to keep the numbers down, so ICUs are not swamped, learn the best therapies to reduce the death toll as much as is practical and research for treatments and a vaccine. Try and avoid peak outbreaks, especially in winter, when the flu   covid combination will be nasty. Isolate our most vulnerable, maybe for a very long time and leave people to chose. I am approaching  years old and have no intention of isolating forever. In due course, I will get this virus and take my chances. I would instead rather enjoy my time than clamber fearfully into a sterile hole forever!!! As for Sturgeons exercise twice a day, she can stick that where the sun does not shine. The simple fact is being fit is perhaps my and everyone best chance for survival, twice a day exercising and the rest of my time on my sweet derriere is stupid, just as Nicola#s latest dictates!!!Ian#s reply to Malcolm#s well reasoned contribution oddly fails to address it.Why I’m reminded of the proud mother watching her son taking part in the passing out parade at Sandhurst.She noticed that everyone was out of step apart from her son!Oh dear, did I just read #BO JO#s policy actually worked# Thats plainly pants, pure and simple.Briefly, to Michael#s point, it is only recently that we paid off our war debt to the USA, so some financial mechanisms will be found.But I think I heard Portugal went into lockdown straight after their first COVID  death, whereas the UK waited for over a hundred. Plainly things could have been very dferent, very much better, and acting quicker would have been far cheaper, with far less loss of le, and a quickerto a ing economy.But it would have also required people being put before profit right from the start.So it really had been business as usual from the bottom feeding disaster capitalists that run the UK.#BO JO#s policy actually worked# indeed.That would be laughableit wasn#t so tragic.Sadly without vaccines and anti-virals, it is that simple. The fact is it has only just started and will be with us until we are all immune or dead. Let us pray for the former and immunity by vaccination. To coin a cliche, it will be total isolation for the most vulnerable until herd immunity develops, as with every infectious viral disease in human history! Development of immunity and resistance is what will stopCovid  eventually, nothing , as withPolio, Smallpox, Measles, Herpes et alNo. We need to keep as many people alive as possible until vaccine is developed.People are not simply expendable.Effective PPE supplies and speed of sufficient testing is critical to this.The Tory led, Tory delayed UK response has been woeful on these.No scope for argument there.Thousands have died that need not have.No scope for argument there either.It has been an ideologically misled catastrophe. genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #But now that you point out about all those genetic iations, we probably ought to phone them and tell them to call of the hunt since they#ve probably not thought of that. Best just let nature take its course and get the economy on track with hundreds of thousands of deaths, a swamped NHS and a profoundly sick and worried population.Bo Jo#s policy was actually endorsed and followed to the letter by all the devolved Governments of the Uk until we got our knickers in a twist about a slogan. I never realised Nicola was a # bottom feeding disaster capitalists # for endorsing Bo Jo#s policy for so long. She only on Sunday became confused and what a fuss out that she made. On the bright side, we may legally exercise twice daily now, what outstanding leadership!Ian your unwavering faith in BoJo the clown, in the absence of any logical rationale or evidence for doing so, is truly astonishing.Robbie, I have no faith in any politician, but I do find Bo-Jo so much better than the other clowns in the circus. I love the way he routed the remoners, destroyed the Socialist horror of Corbyn and so antagonised, confounded and confused his opponents. Most are left with nothing by puerile and infantile comments to make, such as Bo-Jo the Clown. Is that Robbie the level of your wit and argument Again, Tory apologist spin from Tinkler. From mid-Jan through Feb Boris missed  COBRA meetings on COVID  to which Sturgeon was not invited.Yes the UK#s other parliaments fell into line once the Bullingdon Club realised there was to be no Britains Open for Business, herd-immunity-now approach. Elements of that thinking lingered on and are resurfacing now, not the least within the twisted outpouring of local eugenicists.Best information as of   .On that basis I think we need Nicola Sturgeon down here in England as well!Act in haste, repent at leisure seems to sum up such weakness.I am trying very hard toto see things from your perspective, but I cannot ignore the indicators and commentary that indicates that the UK economy will officially be in recession by the end of  Q.GDP has fallen by % in the first quarter of this year and predicted to be possibly as high as % in the second quarter.The Bank of England has tried to put a brave face on things by saying #the impact is likely to be temporary with activity rebounding strongly once social distancing measures are lted#. The question is when will social distancing be lted.Are you advocating that we just wait and see how things pan out, maybe the idea of a V shaped recovery will happen in the rd and th quarters, a vaccine will be developed in time and the world can go back to the #old normal#A simple warning from history # Recession , Depression, War.Recession, depression, war. Exactly. We know that the mortality rate is roughly .%. UK population is approx  million. Let#s say we just let the virus take its course, albeit slowed due to some adjustments to how we work and % of the population catch it. An effective treatment or vaccine is by no means guaranteed. % of  million is . million. .% of that is about , deaths. Then there are the hundreds of millions of working days lost to people off sick with the virus. Then there are the people suffering long term consequences of the virus and the cost of caring for them. How is this a recipe for a healthy economy  How will this level of death and suffering motivate investment or spending  Where does this assumption that we can just get going again like things were before come from  The world has changed. I know it feels good to bury our heads in the sand and think we can just go back to how things were and let a few old folks die. But that is profoundly naive. There is no simple answer. Except Mr. Tinkler#s. Make of that what you will.Ali asks: # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #I don#t know Ali.I#m not a dentist.To my understanding there does not need to be an exact genetic match for vaccines to be sufficiently helpful, but as I can#t trace my male line back over countless generations maybe Ali should consult a bard or a sage instead.There is, and has been, something of a medical research race on for understanding of transmission, for patient management treatment and for vaccines.Prompter action would have kept more folk alive longer whilst progress was made. The usual suspects are welcome to argue that and which way they may like, but it won#t change matters.There has been medical research and hard work for years into a reliable vaccine for corona viruses. How are they doing on that front  You don#t need to be a dentist to find that outYes Ali, but you do need to know the dference between a Virus and Venus, RNA and DNA, a vaccine and socialist vacillation, that is where humanists and left-wing ideologues come up a little short!!As I#m not a puller of teeth its a challenge to tell Ali how this virus dfers from the common cold, or why the research may be getting more funding and focus than the industry and government gave previously.You stated that you don’t need to be a dentist to find that out but, to be fair and reasonable about this , someone with medical training is likely to be better equipped than someone without to come up with insights which could be useful. In all probability Ian will not strike gold but how thankful we would behe did !!Fake news  Trump tried to buy Moussa and replace the old stone buildingswith a shiny new tower and Miss Sturgeon will use the proceeds to building a border wall.The deal came unstuck when China claimed Shetland as part of its North Sea and Atlantic territorial waters. It is understood that Miss Sturgeon has been learning Madrin while Scotlandis locked upOwen Jones has denied that he supports Identity politics, woke culture and he is not a social justice warrior.CNNhires Greta Thunberg to appear on a  as an expert on Covid .Best not to bother with why UK has biggest obesity problem in Europe. Such inquiry requires social science, some sociological imagination and a grain of empathy.Much easier to blame those poor plebs who haven#t got a grip.No need to invest on ending intergenerational deprivation and increasing opportunity too.Playgrounds for schools in poorer parts of our cities Why bother.Simples Peter, integrate #Care# for young and old into the NHS. That would include a voucher towards joining a gym or active participation sports club for every citizen irrespective of wealth. Those who chose not to use it, be it on their heads, it is their own health and wellbeing which will suffer. Covid  is ruthless with the obese and unfit,blame and empathy are not part le and death struggle of potentially fatal illness.Ian#s suggestion does nothing to end intergenerational deprivation, aka poverty. Poverty, and other social ills, can result in obesity in ious ways.Obesity simply is not automatically a #lestyle choice#.To suggest so is to indulge in inflammatory victim blaming and victim shaming.Not all single parents on benefits, depending also on whatever the Foodbank might provide, can easily promote healthy lestyles for all of their children.Many are struggling with issues beyond Ian#s limited appreciation.Seven year olds don#t generally make lestyle choices. Fat cells, once over produced in response to whatever unwelcome stimulus, don#t simply disappear. They hang around calling to be filled.Not all parents have time or money to afford Shetland Recreational Trust#s offerings.They dont all have the ability to get their children to the leisure facilities.It is only #simples#you take an uncaring and simplistic approach. Ian knows this intellectually as it has been pointed out more than once. Yet he persists. Odd. A little more fellow feeling might stem his approach.All I am suggesting Peter is an attempt to control excessive eating of Junk foodswith integrating our NHH with free access to all to a gym or active participation sports club for every citizen irrespective of wealth. Just how can that be #to indulge in inflammatory victim blaming and victim shaming. #Where are you getting your figures on childhood obesity in Shetland from Ian  Surely not from the newspaper article you’ve linked below, which is from  and quotes figures for adults from  If Ian imagines free education and access to the NHS has equalled le chances this is going to be a walk in the park.If Ian imagines the Welfare State to be thriving why so many Foodbanks  On another planet does not just describe Boris and Dodgy Dom today.There are also undernourished children in Shetland and across the UK, and parents going without in order that their children can eat. Ian might be interested to research the number of food banks before the era of Conservstive austerity and see how well the number has grown since. Quite an achievement for his #thriving welfare state#. Soon unemployment numbers will be thriving too thanks to the ghastly response to Covid  fromBoris and chumsThirty thousand deaths a year is a pre-covid figure we now have obesity as a % factor in covid  deaths!!If we were talking drug deaths running a food bank would be an offence. Perhaps that is a little tongue-in-cheek but this year obesity will be a factor in about , people dying prematurely. Surely about time for gyms, fitness and participant sports organisationsto be granted by integrated into the NHS with a free or subsidised entry for all.Sorry Peter, Boris and his chums were working with Nicola and her chums on Covid  . All in harmony which must be a first!Covid  was away with the fairies, another socialist ideal.!It is mildly reassuring that Ian Tinkler has #no faith in politicians# presumably including BoJo the Clown. This Government has bungled it#s handling of the Covid- crisis on an industrial scale. Exercise Cygnus in October  highlighted serious shortcomings in the UK#s Emergency Preparedness Resilience and Response Plan to a pandemic. Since then PPE stock levels were run down by %. Being made aware of the virus in December  no preparation was started until March when the herd immunity strategy was quickly jettisoned. Britain refused to participate in the EU procurement scheme for PPE leading to farcical attempts to obtain PPE from some guy in Turkey who made T shirts. Unsurprisingly the PPE was unusable. Rather than get ventilators from established manufacturers The Government ignored their offers of help and went to Tory donors like James Dyson who managed to produce  of the  needed. Flights bringing  people a day into the Uk without test or quarantine only stopped  months after lockdown. People being placed in care homes without being tested. Unbelievably lockdown is being eased in England without test track and trace being implemented. We have the second highest death total in the world.England does not have the highest number of deaths in Europe, and England has a far higher recovery rate than many in European nations.The Care homes in England have about half the death rate of their Scotish counterparts and the Death Rate per capita in England is considerably less than in Scotland. Just to keep you up to date, Nicola has just today,reversed her political decision on lockdown. The statistics are available online however, ferreting the Scotish records is problematic. For some reason, the SG is far less transparent with the Data than the English. Figures below are slightly out of date but show the comparison.The population of England. ,, No of deaths. , Death ratio. .So in summary, the gospel according to Ian Tinkler is that BoJo the clown hasn#t put his size  feet in it at all as the death rate is higher in Scotland than in England.Ian, I think your calculations are the wrong way round and show what you might call a #survival ratio# rather than a death ratio. There#s also a decimal place error but for the purposes of comparison that doesn#t really matter.If you work it out in deaths per million of population you can see that Scotland has a lower death rate.England:  from      per mPlease do not put words in my mouth Robbie. What is happening in Scotland is down to The SG and Nicola, as theFM and former Health Secretary. Trying to make political capital out of people dying is morally reprehensible, obnoxious and malign. Bo-Jo and Nicola have equal responsibility for any mistakes, they both shared and followed the best science they could. For once they were in harmony and agreement. The NHS was not overwhelmed, lives were saved, be thankful for that. Fortunately, the injection of disinfectant, we will leave to a real clown who is now mainlining hydroxychloroquine!!! Perhaps Darwinism will step in soon! God save America.Oh this is too funny to pass by! Mr Tinkler creates his own, entirely , Coronavirusfigures to make a political point and is immediately shot down. He then states that only an idiot would try to use coronavirus figures to make political points. Well, on that we totally agree # only an idiot would.Ray try and understand the dference between political comment and malicious point-scoring.ian seems to be using dferent measurement criteria between scotland and england and even dferent data within scottish figures. on  may he has scottish figure  but on  may it has gone up to .the lower figure is the one for deaths from positive test cases, the higher one is all deaths where covid is mentioned on death certicate.in his original calculation for england he uses positive test figuresthus for accurate comparison he should use the lower scottish figure also. this is what alan leask has done and produced an accurate comparison.The vaccine is focusing on a very small sequence in the S viral protein which enables it to bind to the ACE receptor on human cells in mucosal linings and infect them. There isn’t much room for mutation there without the virus losing its ability to bind to that receptor. Other mutations mentioned, in other parts of the virus, enable “strains” of virus to be tracked. Reproduction is subject to errorand billions upon billions of virus are being produced, so mutations will take place. However the critical site for immunity is probably conserved.I did read it Ian # that’s how I know it’s completely irrelevant. Now you’ve produced aarticle from ! So, just to be straight, your reasoning for easing the Coronavirus lockdown in  is a  year old newspaper article about obesity  I don’t think that’s the real reason is it now  Could it be that you’re putting your political prejudices first again  Not that it matters of course. Now even the FMs most recent slight adjustments to lockdown only allow five-mile car run to a place to exercise. That does not get a Glaswegian far from the centre of Glasgow. It just does exactly the worst thing, concentrates people together in highly populated areas. The counterargument regards spreading the virus into new areas is fallacious. Just in case our FM had not noticed, the virus has already disseminated widely and in the great outdoors of Scotland Social Distancing is a lot easier than in Glasgow or any other city.So, the death ratio in Scotland from Covid , according to the self-proclaimed STE expert is .. That, I believe, is patently incorrect, not to mention entirely absurd, and would mean that . people from  person had died from the disease. As an analogy, based on a notional teeth count,someone had, let’s say, ten teeth and subsequently had one removed then the ratio of teeth removed to those not having been removed would be  , or %. The “survival ratio”, as someone referred to, ie the teeth remaining, is the remainder as a proportion of the whole, in other words  out of , or %, assuming that the dentist extracts within remit. The two equations are not inter-changeable. This, however, from the statistical and other real experts acknowledged in their fields is very interesting: A good point and as always I appreciate a good dental analogy to illustrate the dference between death and survival rates. I know here we like to fight tooth and nail about such things, but it is good to see someone #filling in# the gaps here. And as for Mr. Tinkler, he certainly puts the effort in and even though we may disagree, it keeps things on here lively. He deserves a plaque.Michael Inkster, Try .Decimal point one, not  to  . Actually maths was wrong recalculation above. Simples absurdly so, evenmental arithmetic was a little rusty first time round!!Since it appears to be much more virulent and deadly than flu the future would seem to be less than rosy.In fact, depressingly gloomy and all the statistical information so diligently presented will be consignedto no more than being purely academic and capable of making not a scrap of dference.I am more intrigued into the sources of  major viruses having a global impact from China, and what is the Chinese Government doing about the health and safety of food products and the, apparent, lack of any proper procedures in which to prevent further outbreaks  What is the WHO doing in regards to monitoring potential infections from China and or limiting the movements of live animals in poorly developed hygiene conditions, allegedly We hear the origins of such viruses, but no information regarding preventative measures taking place to restrict and confine such health hazards within an area and to stop this from spreading further afield  Why has there been no ban on the sale and transport of certain foods from China Is the whole process of live animal meat production having to be totally reviewed by the Chinese government or is it a case of waiting until something even greater forces them to act Should we enforce our own standards of Health and Safety onto other countries in terms of a trade agreement or should market forces have a free for all without any restrictions, including Health and Safety  Should this be reviewed JOSEPH NIVEN has hit the nail squarely on the head. The statistics are not clearly put and blaming one UK politician, BoJo or Sturgeon is wrong. The SNP and Torie parties pretty much followed identical policies until last week.If Ian imagines free education has eliminated inequalities of opportunity he is mistaken.inequalities of opportunity frequently come down to ambition. The opportunities are there for all, not everybody wishes to take them.Sure good sound parentage and background help promote ambition, but the old adage you can take a horse to water but!!! If you wish to destroy ambition, try extreme socialism. The good old USSR and present-day Venezuela give good examples.I don#t know where to start with this statement Ian, and I#m not sure it will make any dference to youI do.There are multiple stories on just this very subject, but since you are not a big fan of the arts, you might not have read them, seen them or heard them.You can have ambition, and even a great education, but still be knocked back by the old boy network, or because you are not white or not male. These inequalities still exist.There are statistics to show that Eton boys get the top jobs still, and the only way to get a better leader for this country will be to do away with privilege and try to level the playing field. New Zealand for example have a great leader and it is refreshing to see someone lead who has her role on merit.I know nothing of the countries you mention but I am sure they still have ambitious and educated people despite your partisan viewpoint.Well it’s a surprise to see that the Scottish government aren’t being blamed for poverty and suffering this time # turns out it was the underprivileged’s own fault all along. I’m sure a sharp word will snap them out of it and everyone will be a CEO or a government advisor in no time. Just need to put the effort in old boy what what! I’d always thought the morally bereft who profit from misery and desperation who have a lot to do with keeping the poor poor have a lot to answer for though you know payday lenders, gambling companies, private dentists with a monopoly#Ian might as well say the poor are frequently to blame for their lot. Oil rich Norway does not tolerate UK levels of inequality.Neither do many other poprer countries.Quite what the USSR and Venesuala have got to do with it is likely apparent to Ian.Others will see their inclusion within what passes for his argument as a clear attempt at distraction. The possible impacts of being brought up in poverty by others who have had the same dficulties are many.The opportunities for such children are not easily compared to, say, those enjoyed by the young Boris Johnson.Ian is again indulging himself in victim blaming.UK policy has not set out to create level playing fields for socio-econmic participation. It should, but won#t for as long as #One Nation# English Conservatives like Boris Johnson continue to serve the interests of those of Ian Tinkler#s outlook over those of all. On th of May Ian described intergenerational deprivation as #relevant to Victorian times#.NY pretending ambition alone can help all children born into poverty to escape it Ian is demonstrating Victorian attitudes of his own. Seven year olds brought up in bedsits should choose better parental lestyles.I was unaware Thatcher, Blair, Cummings, Callahan, Wilson et all went to Eton. Mind you, Tony Ben, Sir Antony no less went to Westminster college!!!! Quite what that has to do #With the price of tea in China # rather like your former comments, escapes me!Johan, Ian#s not just a contrarian, compelled to rile others, but does so to share his quite unpleasant world-view. He talks of intergenerational deprivation as being a #very trendy left-wing academic hypothesis, relevant to Victorian times# but it#s a known fact that many a bairn raised in poverty, enjoying few opportinities will go on to live in poverty and have few opportunities. If they become parents, the likelihood of their bairns being able to do better lessens generation by generation without purposeful government action designed to level the playing field.The concept used here is social mobility and many governments globally take pains to increase it. Where those with disadvantageous starts in le go on, on average, to do better than their parents,social mobility is high. Where their lot is likely to be fixed at birth social mobility is low. Scotland has a long running research project to monitor it. In addition to the factors you cite, cards can also firmly stacked against children raised by semi-literate, or drug dependent parents, or in situations of domestic violence or sexual violence as well as other non-lestyle factors. Ian knows obesity can have complex causes, but doesn#t care. Its quite tragic.Poor parenting is really not a class thing whatever are trendy humanist academics may say. Just feeble attempts to justy socialist ideals. However, that has nothing to do with my attempt to deal with excess fat and obesity., #cards can also firmly stacked against children raised by semi-literate, or drug-dependent parents, or in situations of domestic violence or sexual violence. # Well apart from the semi-literate bit that sounds a little bit like an Etonian upbringing, so typical of the Aristocracy!!! I love the bit about #Scotland has a long-running research project to monitor it.# .What a shame it is run by a load of left-wing academics, perhaps that is why Scotland#s performance falls so far short of England#s with regard to social mobility!! As for the complex causes of obesity, it is really simple Peter, it is not even class-related. It is simply eating more than food than your body needs. Whatever socio-psychological hogwash you may spout, in the final analysis, comes down to eating too much. It is that simple..."},{"url":null,"title":"calls to save shetland tourism industry with 12 month covid 19 support package ","story":"Shetland politicians and business leaders are ramping up pressure on governments to provide better support for the struggling tourism industry during the Covid- crisis – and beyond.MSP Beatrice Wishart has added her voice to the growing chorus of calls pushing for the UK and Scottish governments to help the hospitality businesses survive.Ms Wishart#s calls for a -month support plan for the industry follow comments made by isles MP Alistair Carmichael in Westminster earlier this week.At a meeting in Holyrood, Ms Wishart said tourism businesses might survive  just three months without support.She asked tourism secretary Fergus Ewing about working with the UK government to consider a -month support package to tide the tourism and hospitality sector over into next season.Ms Wishart was told the problems had been recognised problems but a -month fund had not yet been considered.After the meeting she said: “In Shetland the tourism season is shorter compared to other areas of the UK.

August date is a week earlier than previously scheduled for the - Highland school term.Early Learning and childcare settings will open over the summer, while teachers – currently delivering lessons from home – will from June be allowed into schools to prepare and plan for the new way of working and welcoming pupils back.While the school gates will open again, parents have been told to expect a mix of classroom and home learning to continue.The agreement reached between councils, professional associations and parent representatives means:Skye councillor John Finlayson, who chairs Highland Council’s education committee, said Mr Swinney’s announcement was broadly in line with the expectations of the authority’s education recovery group.However, he said he was pleased that local authorities would be given flexibility in their approach.He said: “Clearly the challenges each authority faces will be signicantly dferent and within Highland itself we will have dferent challenges in urban and rural areas.“Local authorities have been given the flexibility to plan and deliver ato education in a manner that suits local circumstances and the council’s education improvement team, supported by other officers, in consultationwith school leaders and school staff, will look to implement approaches that enable pupils to get back to school.“A blended approach to learning will continue for a while yet.

Much of her adult le was spent in Lanarkshire, though she remained a frequent visitor to Skye, and was last on the island just three years ago.She said she continued to keep up with events in Skye by reading the West Highland Free Press every week.Mrs Parker’s son, Phil Dibdin, said his mother’s piano playing had lted everyone#s spirits in the home.“They are really well looked after in there.

The move is vital to secure a stronger future for the business which is urging politicians to support its drive to produce , hydrogen buses in the next four years.The  staff that remain would be more than a ten-fold increase in the number of employees inherited by the management team when it bought Wrightbus out of administration in October , with hopes to grow the workforce to , by the end of .“When we saved Wrightbus from administration last year, there were only about  employees, and since then we have grown the workforce to ,” said Mr Atwal.“The decision has been taken to trim the workforce to the size we believe we will need to see us through to the end of the year.”The redundancies are a necessary measure given the economic slowdown as a result of the current Coronavirus crisis. However, it has not altered the long-term vision of prosperity for the company.“Throughout the COVID- pandemic, while we furloughed a large section of the workforce, we also kept about  engineers, designers and sales staff working to make sure we can take future orders of buses and work on long-term projects, which will provide security and stability for Wrightbus in the coming years,” said Mr Atwal.The Wrightbus factory has created the world’s first hydrogen-electric double-decker bus, which emits only water and there is a great belief that in the coming years this will see a large number of orders come in.There are already strong sales for the delivery of buses in London and Aberdeen this year, with more cities due to follow suit.Mr Atwal said: “We see the future in zero-emission hydrogen and battery-electric transport and have positioned the business accordingly. Our vision is to have , people working for us by the end of  and we hope to be in a position to re-hire some of those who have been made redundant.“We believe green fuel is the future and will bring a brighter future to Northern Ireland over the coming years.”A consultation will begin with staff on Monday, May , and Wrightbus will be supporting staff throughout the process, eventhis has to be done virtually due to current Government guidelines.

The announcement by management is therefore profoundly regrettable.“Management plans to make redundant  employees and to bring forward a phased-process of reducing agency staffing affecting up to  workers. Every job lost is a heavy blow for the inidual concerned, their household, the wider community and economy – especially in the face of the current Covid- pandemic.“Ahead of this announcement being made, I spoke to senior management to call on them to utilise the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme to protect jobs and retain skilled workers the prospect of workers being thrown onto the dole queues at this time is unacceptable.“Management confirmed they will be proceeding to a -day consultative period on their proposals but that they will consider furlough as an option. They sought to reassure us of their ambitions for Wrightbus in Ballymena and its centrality to their plans.“Instead of reducing employment, we need to ramp up production of hydrogen-buses to curb greenhouse gas emissions and transition to a more environmentally-sustainable economy. “The Wrightbus workforce is perfectly positioned to make a vital contribution to that they have the skills to build the buses at the heart of any future green transport policy.“The request for furlough will be top of Unite’s agenda in the consultation process. Having played a lead role in securing the transfer of Wrightbus, which faced liquidation, to the Bamford group we are determined to bring as many jobs as possible to Ballymena as a result”, Mr Brash concluded.

Having grown up in the era when the river was dominated by the huge red brick edice of the Braidwater Mill, Rodney points out that its path is more exposed to public view than ever. “When you look back, it was pretty much enclosed space from McNinch Footbridge to Harryville Bridge.  “People had no reason to be in that area unless they were mill workers.“Nowadays we have great views right along this section and I personally feel that there has to be a joined up approach to making full use of this fantastic potential.“With the opening of the retail park it has now opened the area up to everyone and the nature and beauty around the river with wildle such as swans, ducks, otters, kingfishers and other wildle regularly seen on the stretch from Sainsbury’s down to Harryville bridge,” he said. But he acknowledges that not not everyone will see the beauty associated with the area. “There will always be some who will still treat it as a dumping ground and continue to put the wildle and the environment at risk by dumping their refuse into the river. “These people need to be told in no uncertain terms that this will not be lolerated by the local community - we have the ability to impose fines on those who continually flaunt regulations and I would call for such monetary penalties to be used more frequently.”But Rodney beleives the real driving force behind the naural rejuvenation of the area must comes as a united push.“ I feel that the authorities responsible for this area and the retail park owner have to take seriously the issues associated with this stretch of water and listen to the concerns of the community groups and members of the public who regularly use the pathways around the river for daily exercise.“My opinion is that things weren’t thought through properly at the outset and the environmental issues weren’t taken into account when the retail park was being planned. “The aim now should be to preserve the beauty of this stretch of the river Braid and that means taking steps to make sure this happens.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3138061.jpg--.jpg?1590480464000\n","title":"opinion moral necessity to support local business in post virus world","story":"By the Very Rev Dr Norman Hamilton OBEThese last weeks have seen contrasting trends as we battle with coronavirus. On the one hand we have come together in our communityto clap for carers on a Thursday evening, and to make ‘scrubs’ for those in the front line of care in the NHS and in care homes. But with most of our local shops, family businesses and services closed, we have also looked to multinational companies and the big supermarket chains to provide us with what we need . They have done much for which we must be genuinely grateful – perhaps best shown in the huge effort to deliver groceries to homes where people are vulnerable. And many companies have prospered. For example in mid April, Jeff Bezos who is the founder and boss of Amazon, saw his personal wealth swell by pound billionafter soaring demand for online shopping sent the firms share price to a new high. This cemented his position as the worlds richest man with a fortune of well over pound billion. As they say – it is an ill wind that blows no one any good. PATTERNSThese changed patterns of le – evident community spirit and massively increased internet shopping – will bring big moral dilemmas when the pandemic is under control and some degree of normality s. Will community spirit be relegated to the back benches by the need for so many of us to rebuild the patterns of our own everyday lives  And crucially, will we have become so content with buying on-line and having the parcel delivered to our front door, that we will be less committed to buying locally, and supporting local business  I must confess to having real fears on both questions. When the focus moves away from carers and the NHS, what community need will fill the gap  It is very dficult to think of an example which affects every one of us, and to which we can bring such loyalty. And will the obvious convenience of having that parcel delivered to our front door be set aside to go shopping locally on a cold November morning or a wet February afternoon Personally I feel that it is a moral necessity to support our local businesses and shops as best we can – evenit costs a little more to do so. They of course will be well aware of the threat from the big international companies, and must play their part in quality of service and show the ‘personal touch’ that will make it attractive to do business with them in its own right. And there would be a great added bonus that such support on an ongoing basis would be a quite new and important expression of community spirit.I have absolutely no dficulty with the owner of Amazon seeing new opportunities to expand his business. But I have real dficultyordinary citizens like myself in our local area see it as acceptable to give his company so much of our limited income that many of the businesses in our neighbourhood go into serious decline. The Biblical command to ‘love your neighbour as yourself’ has a new and crucially important relevance.

There is a flicker, a flame of perseverance. It might look small, but it is giant at heart, fuelled by our spirit that never wavers, whatever comes our way.“We are a land that, in times of need, stands together, stands strong and will not falter.”He adds: “Ours is a giant spirit forged by our surroundings. A spirit filled with relentless creativity descended from legends that shines through cold winds with warm smiles and open hearts.“We’ll get through this, just like everything .

Increased infection will place our health workers under extreme pressure and will kill people in our community - that is both the brutal and sad reality.”Mr Maskey said that both young and old had a responsibility to protect the vulnerable in their communities.“As we approach this weekend, I am appealing directly to young people to please be part of the community Covid- response and to follow the guidelines.“You can enjoy the good weather and meet up with up to six friends outdoors while adhering to social distancing but large crowds are not permitted for the benefit of your health and our community.”The MP also called on parents and s to keep in touch with their children and know their whereabouts.“Only by working together will we overcome this, he said.Meanwhile, the RNLI have advised caution to those planning to attend beaches this weekend as no leguards will be on duty until later in June.“As we move to a gradual relaxing of restrictions as advised by the Northern Ireland Executive and we experience the good weather, we expect many people to be eager to visit the coast.” said Karl O’Neill, RNLI Lead Leguard Supervisor.“We ask those who are visiting beaches to continue to be aware of the inherent dangers and to avoid taking risks.

There will be thousands of job losses, he said.I#ll be proposing that a task force is set up to focus on how best we get the city back up and running. I#d like to see a memorial built to all those who have lost their lives from Covid-.In an exclusive interview with the Belfast , the next Lord Mayor talked about being the first single dad in the job.The SDLP is set to nominate its poll-topping Ardoyne councillor, Paul McCusker, as Deputy Lord Mayor. A nurse in the Mater Hospital, he is a community activist known for his work with the homeless.Covid- will make Monday#s mayoral installation ceremony very dferent from those in previous years. Social distancing means there can#t be a full meeting of all  councillors. Instead, each party will nominate a small number of representatives to attend.The practice of the outgoing Lord Mayor and Deputy Lord Mayor placing the chain of office around the shoulders of their successors will be suspended.Mr McCoubrey succeeds Sinn Fein#s Danny Baker and Mr McCusker takes over from Alliance#s Peter McReynolds.The next Lord Mayor hopes that, despite the restrictions, his mother and five children can watch proceedings from the public gallery in City Hall.Mr McCoubrey will also not have the crowded diary of public engagements that usually awaits new Lord Mayors. It#s very frustrating, he said. Once restrictions ease, I want to be out thanking our NHS and care workers, and those who have been delivering food parcels to the old and vulnerable.Mr McCoubrey, who has been a councillor for  years, said his working-class roots would be to the fore during his mayoralty.I grew up in Springmartin and I still live there. We had nothing. We were no dferent from the people in Springhill across the peace line. I#m a proud unionist but I want to be a Lord Mayor for the people of Springmartin, Springhill and all in this city, whatever their politics.Asked about his attitude to gay marriage, which his party opposes, he said: Same-sex marriage is legal here, and I#ve always taken the approach of live and let live. As Lord Mayor I want everyone to feel welcome in this city regardless of race, religion or sexual orientation.Mr McCoubrey was first elected as a councillor for the Ulster Democratic Party , the UDA#s political wing. He joined the DUP in . When I walked into City Hall in , I was totally overwhelmed. I was the youngest councillor there and the sole UDP one. I went in as a super-Prod from the Shankill, determined to fly the flag high. I#ve learned a lot over the years.In those early days Sinn Fein councillors Fra McCann and Tom Hartley would sit down for a chat. They represented areas with the same problems as mine. Sinn Fein members in City Hall fought tooth and nail for everything they#ve achieved for their communities. Nothing was given to them. I decided to do the same for mine, evenit meant being a thorn in the side of the council establishment.Mr McCoubrey said he#d joined the UDP because the mainstream unionist parties felt remote to someone from my class. He said: I knew it was the political wing of a paramilitary organisation but it was trying to bring peace and stability to the community, and I was up for that.Askedhe was a UDA member andhe condemns its terror campaign, he said: I was never in the UDA. I condemn every murder in Northern Ireland. They were all wrong. None were, or can, be justied.Mr McCoubrey#s term of office as deputy mayor in  was marred when he shared a  with UDA members Johnny Adair and Michael Stone at a loyalist culture day event on the Shankill, which ended with masked men firing shots in the air. He said: Had I known what would happen, I#d not have been on that stage. Things spiralled out of control and I was caught in the middle of it.I remember at the next council meeting, the Sinn Fein group leader got up and said, #I#ve no doubt the deputy lord mayor is a reasonable person but...# and I was bombarded with criticism. Every nationalist councillor wanted me removed.I continued in office but it left a very sour taste for the Catholic community. Had I been able to turn the clock back, I#d have done it in a heartbeat.Mr McCoubreygrew up the eldest in a family of four in Springmartin. His mother was a guide helping on buses taking disabled children to school in west Belfast. His father, who was a fitter in Belfast Gasworks, fell to his death from a roof when Mr McCoubrey was .A lot of responsibility landed on my shoulders, he said. I had just started working as a painter and decorator and I did as much overtime as I could get to help pay the bills. My mum took a second job in the Royal Victoria Hospital laundry as well. Times were tough.Mr McCoubrey has three grown-up children from his first marriage. He has brought up his two sons, Frankand Kyle , as a single dad since his second marriage broke up over a decade ago. It was a steep learning curve for me but I#ve now perfected my cooking, cleaning and ironing skills, he joked.Some times of the year were hard - putting the boys to bed on Christmas Eve and knowing they wouldn#t have two parents there in the morning like most other kids. But summers were always great. I#d a caravan in Portrush and we#d head down there for weekends of fishing, walking on the beach, and Barry#s.The boys are my best friends. I was offered the Lord Mayor#s position four years ago but didn#t take it because they were too young.They don#t need me just as much now. They#re so excited about me becoming Lord Mayor. It#s been a battle getting them to keep it a secret and not tell their mates.Last September, Frank Jnr was the victim of a sectarian hate crime when he was beaten up by nationalist youths as he walked home from school.I was cooking dinner and he walked in, bleeding, bruised and shaking. His jaw was broken. I was devastated. I#ve brought both my boys up to not care about somebody#s religion and I didn#t want this to change them.That night, Arlene [Foster] visited us. She sat with Frank and told him that he must rise above the assault and not let it poison his mind.Mr McCoubrey said the attack had knocked the stuffing out of his son. He played football for Berlin Swts but he hasn#t been back since, and he#s in counselling. But we got phone calls and #get well# cards from right across the community, including from Sinn Fein people, and that was a big help. I want to build on that cross-community spirit as Lord Mayor.

then known as the Long Kesh Internment Camp - a record three times.He was part of the first group of detainees in December  through to June , then again from April  to April , and was one of the last internees to be released in December .Solicitor Kevin Winters, of KRW Law, confirmed the action follows Mr Adams successful appeal against two convictions for attempting to escape from the camp in  and .He had been interned with trial, a policy introduced at the time as violence raged in Northern Ireland.The Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the ICO for Mr Adams was invalid because the Secretary of State at the time, Willie Whitelaw, had not personally considered it.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseGerry Adams speaking in Belfast after his convictions were quashed by UK judgesPA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappGerry Adams speaking in Belfast after his convictions were quashed by UK judgesHis detention and convictions for attempting to escape from lawful custody were therefore held to be unlawful.Similar actions already initiated by  former loyalist internees are also being stepped up on the back of the Supreme Court decision.The elderly Protestants are suing the Northern Ireland Office, PSNI, Ministry of Defence and Secretary of State, alleging they were imprisoned without trial in a bid to even up the score.Nearly , people were interned over a four-year period, most of them being Catholic.The ex-loyalist internees allege British Government abused its power by locking them up because of their religion, and to demonstrate internment was not just focused on one side of the community.Mr Winters said their case was due to be heard at the High Court in Belfast this month, but was put on hold because of the Covid- crisis.The adjournment could not have been more timely given the prospective signicance of the Adams ruling on both sets of cases, the solicitor stressed.From initial assessment on some of the papers it seems the necessary protocol was not in place, including, crucially, an absence of the signature of the Secretary of State on the ICOs.He added: We have today filed a summons in the High court to amend the pleadings in the lead internment challenge to take into account the Supreme Court ruling.We expect the case to be heard later this year when the full impact of that ruling will be made known.That in turn will be of huge relevance to all internment cases collectively.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland updates: Executive agrees further easing of lockdown as two further deaths announcedFurther relaxation of NI#s lockdown proposed: What can be lted, when and why it may not happenHollywood star Matt Damon leaves Ireland after three-month lockdown but says he’ll ‘absolutely’ be backCoronavirus: Northern Ireland shoppers warned a world of change is on the way after lockdownIreland rugby star Jacob Stockdale uses lockdown time to work on  Mustang motor,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Adhering to social distancing, they have been going door-to-door to capture portraits of families going about their daily lives under the extraordinary circumstances. Trevor Benson, who has been taking photographs of residents in Castledawson, said the reaction to the project has been very positive. He said: “People have been contacting asking ‘what time are you going to be up round this way ’ or ‘are you going to do our area ’ so it’s been good. “They have been sitting waiting, some at the windows or on the doorstep. I think it’s just giving them something to look back on. googletag.cmd.push “Some have said they’ll save it on Facebook and they’ll get a memory every year about it.” Much like the pandemic that inspired it, the project has taken on a worldwide appeal, with Kilrea photographer Carol McLaughlin first seeing it mentioned in America. “A girl from America, I think, started the idea of the doorstep project,” she said. “I’m in a group on Facebook called ‘Women in Photography’ and people said they were doing it in their areas, so I thought it would be really nice to do in our town. “I put a message up on my personal page because more people in the town would be on it, and got a really good response, so we went for it.” googletag.cmd.push As well as providing a record for future generations of what le was like during the  pandemic, the project has helped people to feel connected at a time when distance is in vogue. Photographing in Magherafelt, Joseph Cullen said the idea of connecting people really appealed to him. “A lady contacted me saying she was in England and she hasn’t seen her parents in Magherafelt since January and she was heartbroken about that. “They’re not very good at technology, so I went to their estate and took a nice photograph of them and recorded a video message from her parents to her in England. “It gave them a real sense of things going back to normal and being able to see them again. To be able to do that for people is brilliant.” Re-creating that feeling of connection for older people without access to social media led to John O’Neill going a step further. The Ballinderry photographer reached out specically to the village’s elderly population, with the help of some comprehensive local knowledge. “The third photograph in was Charlie Collins, who had a list made out of  people in the parish who were over , so it went on a bit from there,” he said. “I would say I was calling in an area on a certain day and people would get in contact. I arranged rough times that I would call so they were watching or a family member was keeping an eye out. “They were contacting me looking photos done. Because it was creating a buzz, I was getting phone calls from people not on social media. “A lady beside me said her phone lit up the next day and she was entertained all day by people phoning, saying they had seen her photograph on Facebook, so that was lovely. “They are sitting in the house on their own and a bit of a conversation on the phone was keeping the boredom at bay.” In keeping with the Loughshore parish’s unique character, local residents made sure to put their own spin on their portraits. “The black and white seemed to work well for the older generation. Some of them were putting their stamp on it,they were known for something or were a bit of a character,” said John. “I did Patrick McGuckin’s on Saturday evening and I jokingly said to one boy’ ‘I’ve to go up here and get Patrick and the we’s photo’ and he said, ‘I hope he’s on the sit-on lawnmower’. “Patrick cuts the football field, and sure as could be, Patrick was on the sit-on lawnmower whenever I went up! “There was the odd one needed a wee warning to get spruced up and that’s why I put the call out. They don’t want to be caught short – especially with no hairdressers at the minute!” With reasons to get dressed up currently at a premium, residents of all four areas took the opportunity to don the glad rags, with some going to extreme s. “In one family, the dad came out with make-up on and he was dressed up as a princess – clearly that’s what he’s been doing with his daughter in isolation!” said Carol McLaughlin. “There were a few that threw on a bit of tan and got dolled up. I had said to come whatever way they wanted, so they could get dolled up or come out in their jammies – whatever way they normally spend their days.” Joseph Cullen, who is a member of Mid Ulster Photography Club along with Trevor Benson, said the residents of Magherafelt were also keen to impress. “Sometimes, everyone is dolled up to the nines, has their hair done and are in their best Sunday outfits,” he said. “We’ve had kids getting dressed up in superhero outfits and that kind of stuff. One family all wore matching outfits and some have got their pets involved.” With Covid- affecting work for photographers everywhere, all four that we spoke to were delighted to get out and about and taking pictures again. “My daughter came out with me and we went round the town for three days,” said Carol McLaughlin. “It actually worked out really well, and we got good weather, which helped. It was so nice getting back out with the camera again. “It was a nice, community thing to do. Everybody got involved and it was lovely to see it all at the end – everyone’s pictures of their time in isolation. “What made me want to do it was that it was a moment in history. It will always bring people back to that crazy time when we were all stuck indoors.” In the nostalgia-fuelled reminiscence of le under lockdown, Joseph Cullen feels traditional photography can play a role in preserving memories of the pandemic for posterity. “With the rise of camera phones, people don’t pay as much attention to traditional photography but actually going out of your way means you get some great photos,” he said. “People will forget, in a year or two, all the stuff they went through at the time and having photos helps.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He continued: “There are those who would like the Police Service of Northern Ireland to be run into the ground and be so constrained that would be incapable of dealing with public order and the many challenges that it faces.” The North Antrim MLA and former finance minister said poundm was allocated to the new medical facility in Derry. “When anyone looks at the current estimates for the running - the capital and the resource - of that project, the cost will be in excess of pound million. googletag.cmd.push “Some people are hanging their hats on the City Deal providing the additional money, but there is no doubt that it will have recurring costs that have to come back to the Executive,” he added. Ulster University previously told the Derry News that when fully operational with  students per year the medical school will cost approximately poundm per year. Mr Storey went on to say that a ‘deal is a deal’ and in the New Decade, New Approach document there is an agreement to fund a medical school, and, on the opposite page, a commitment to increase police numbers to ,. It leads to the question, he said, what was the process to remove the medical school from the Department for the Economy and the Department of Health and move it to the Executive Office  “Why did that happen, given the fact that responsibility for the delivery of that project lay primarily in those two departments ” TIME RESTRAINTS In responseSinn Feacutein Finance Minister Conor Murphy said: “First, in relation to the PSNI bid and the members view that it was part of a deal. “If it was part of a deal, it is not the responsibility of the Finance Minister to go in and demand that the Justice Minister brings forward a proposition. There is a party leaders forum, which, I think, was set up as a consequence of NDNA in order to discuss issues that might be outside the day-to-day workings of Departments. “If there is an argument that that commitment is not being met, I suggest to the member that that is the area in which to raise it and, hopefully, then secure an agreement. I am more than happy to play my part in that.” With regard to the Magee campus and Ulster University situation, the finance minister said there was a ‘time pressure on agreements’ that needed to be made about matched funding of the inclusive future fund and also about the intake for the graduate-entry medical school. “There was a lack of agreement between both departments on which one would have lead responsibility for that.” He concluded: “In those circumstances, correctly, the Executive Office and the offices of the First Minister and deputy First Minister stepped in to try to arbitrate and find a way through that. “That is how it ended up in that department.” DERRY REPRESENTATIVES During the sitting, SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin said she met with senior representatives of Ulster University and left the meeting with the sense that they were in the dark about what happens now in terms of progressing the business case for the medical school. “We need to know what is going on. We need more detail, and we need greater transparency. That applies to the British Governments plan for Brexit, but it also applies to the plans of our Government, the Executive Office and senior officials when it comes to the Magee medical school. “The medical school is due to open its doors in September . “Like every other elected representative and everybody in the city, I was delighted by the announcement, but a lot of work needs to be done for that to take place. It needs to be done very quickly, with a sense of urgency, and I urge the joint First Ministers to proceed at pace.” Sinn Feacutein MLA Karen Mullan commented: “You have two Derry representatives speaking one after another. “Not only are we obviously very passionate about where we come from but we are passionate about delivering the projects that have been worked on for many years. “The recent announcement of match funding for the Derry City and Strabane strategic growth plan and inclusive future fund, alongside the Executive commitment to open the medical school at Magee, are examples of what can and should be done.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Its fair to say that this crisis has made many of us pause for thought and re-evaluate not just our own behaviour but also many of our previous beliefs. Our new heroes are the cleaners, carers, delivery drivers, shop workers, taxi drivers, bus drivers, nurses and many other professions now commonly described as frontline workers. I was getting a few tyres on my car this week and when I asked the guy had they closed he said no we couldnt as we have a contract with the Ambulance Service and needed to be there to provide help for them and others who needed to go to work.” googletag.cmd.push Without these people putting their own lives at risk the death toll caused by coronavirus would have been off the charts. Prior to all of this, most people took for granted the work done by many of these iniduals. We never really gave it much thought. Now, however, we hail many of them as heroes. We clap for them and we now recognise how much better our society is because of their effort. As I said earlier, a global pandemic has really caused us to pause and reflect and hopefully recalibrate what we as a society should see as important. So, what should we learn from this crisis and what should we build on as a society after it  googletag.cmd.push I used the word recalibrate deliberately because I hope its not a temporary outpouring of sentiment for these many professions followed up by a speedyto the way things were before. Prior to the crisis we saw for example the care sector attract little of our attention or interest. Its a key sector with hundreds of thousands employed right across Ireland and the UK. Salaries are often minimum wage or just above. The work of caring for our loved ones and ensuring they have a good quality of le is often classed as low skilled. Their working conditions and pay never interested many of us or the press media but in this crisis their dedication to care for the most vulnerable members of our society has been astonishing. Their treatment by this government in regard to PPE and testing has cost the lives of hundreds of care workers. Weve clapped for everyone in the NHS and the care workers on many Thursday evenings in March and April. Hopefully after this crisis passes, we will support their right to be paid fairly for the essential frontline work they do. I could say the same for the thousands of cleaners who are on minimum wage and whose efforts kept hospitals and many other facilities open throughout the crisis. Also, think of the hospital porters and canteen staff who are often paid low salaries who risked their own exposure to the virus to care for others. The doctors and consultants are front and centre of this fight and their effort too has been exemplary but the vital effort of many others on the fringe cant be forgotten. And it hasnt just been the workers within the public sector or the low paid within the private sector that have stood out in this crisis. Without a doubt the contribution of charities, community enterprises, social enterprises and co-operatives right across these islands has been remarkable. From delivering vital food parcels to the needy, to making much needed PPE their effort in the midst of this crisis has been remarkable. Thousands of peoplein this city have seen first-hand and benefited first-hand from their efforts. Quite often the support they have given was only possible through thefinancial support from the public sector. This crisis should teach many within the public sector that these partnerships can bring real positive outcomes and should be built on rather than withdrawn after this passes. Many people in broader society see social enterprises often in a bad light. This is partially due to the narrow view of business being solely for profit and TV shows like theDragon’s Den dont help. In reality, Derry has many profitable well runsocial enterprises throughout the city and during this crisis many of them have stood with the community. Hopefully when this crisis is over, we wont allow ourselves to forget the people who kept the economy and society going. We will stand with them and support their calls for better pay and conditions. This week we already seen attempts by the Tories to make migrant NHS workers pay the surcharge be met with a public backlash. It forced the Tories to do a U-turn on the policy. People power does work. We really have to mobilise it more. And its not just me who thinks that this crisis provides the perfect  to build a fairer society. Jamie Dimon, the billionaire CEO of JP Morgan, said last week that the coronavirus pandemic must serve as awake-up call to build a better society. He added: It is my fervent hope that we use this crisis as a catalyst to rebuild an economy that creates and sustains opportunity for dramatically more people, especially those who have been left behind for too long.” Jamie Dimon wrote this in a memo issued before the JP Morgan Annual Shareholders Meeting. He went on to say: The last few months have laid bare the reality that even before the pandemic hit, far too many people were living on the edge.” Mr Dimon is a billionaire banker andJoe Biden wins the US Presidency many believe he will the next Treasury Secretary of the United States. Im not a huge fan of a billionaire banker but I cant disagree with his sentiment. In the US the pandemic showed that the largest economy in the world had far too many workers living from pay cheque to pay cheque. So, as we move forward out of this crisis dont forget who the heroes in the economy were. This will of course mean us putting a higher value on the work that manyof them do.Its a national disgrace how we treat, pay and value the work that carers do. Is it too much to pay them more than pound. per hour to look after our mothers and fathers and grandparents  If you asked  people this question, Im sure the vast majority would agree that care workers are underpaid and undervalued. As a society we need to change this. Im optimisticthat the public sector will see the benefits of real partnerships with the social enterprise sector. The oftenreported public private partnership is not the only option. This crisis has shown that often the private sector is not able toin the same way as a social enterprise can. Finally, I hope that any attempt by politicians to short change or ignore the plight of the workers who held the frontline will be met with a swt backlash from the public. If paying public sector workers more means more taxes, then Im all for that. If increasing the minimum wage to pound per hour means increased prices, then the upside is a fairer society.

It signalled the start of the countys , but on a national level they were nowhere close to toppling Kerry. This week, Michael McMullan trawls back through the record books. The  All-Ireland was the model title. An underage production line, with  clubs represented on Chris Browns starting team brought Tom Markham back north. It was a performance that warmed the cockles of the Derry fans. Expressive football, mixed with Michael McGoldrick, Gerard OKane and Joe Keenan leading a defence that broke the hearts of forward lines across the land. googletag.cmd.push The following year, with six of the team underage, the Oakleafers were tipped for glory again until Damian Daisy McDermotts goal grabbed victory for Tyrone in the first round. It began a tale of woe for Derrys minor grade, which petered off after Magheras  Hogan Cup win and MacLarnon Cup win  months earlier for St Columbs Derry. Like decades before it, school and county minor success drip-fed into the overall pick for senior managers, an addition to the clubs pathway. The county U team didnt push on like it needed to either. The All-Ireland minor final of  was a rare highlight in a -year drought. Aside from that run, the county registered only three other first round wins –  ,  and until Damian McErlains side sparked the current resurgence. googletag.cmd.push At school level, there was also a blip. St Pius Magherafelt and St Pauls Kilrea both won All-Irelands in , but that was the end of the line until Maghera rose from the ashes again. Derry won back to back Buncrana Cups at U level, but were shocked by Fermanagh at minor level in  when it was their minor time, as the rut continued. In the senior ranks, the county were in a strong position. A NFL title came to Derry in , with a run to the final the following year – both against Kerry. There was a run to the Ulster U final. Ballinderry, Greenlough and Lissan all reaching Ulster club finals at their respective grades, with Shamrocks minors picking up a fourth minor title at St Pauls. Not pushing on from here, as a county, was a missed opportunity. Things began to fall away. Three years in Division  followed, before a rise back to the top level and another league final and a hammering by the all-conquering Dubs. Then came a free-fall from the top. Score dference saved Damian Barton from a drop to Division  in  but this was followed by back to back relegations before Damian McErlain steered them back from the basement. Macker has since stepped down, to be replaced by Rory Gallagher, but before Covid- brought sport to a standstill, Derrys chances of ato Division  were unlikely at best. Looking back at Derrys comparison with Kerry, the Kingdom have won two All-Ireland U U titles since Derrys  triumph. Former Kerry senior boss Eacuteamonn Fitzmaurice was on the winning team in  and and lack of silverware at that grade worries him. Fitzmaurice handed  senior debutsto players from the minor teams of  to . Peter Keane, a minor selector under Mickey Ned O Sullivan in  and  before succeeding Jack OConnor as manager for the remainder of the five-in-a-row, took the number to  when appointed as senior boss. Fourteen have played in the championship. In the same time window, playing two and three tiers below Kerry,  Derry players have made it through to senior level. Paul McNeill, Peter Hagan and Danny Tallon played under Richard Ferris in , the rest were part of Damian McErlains minor tenure, with  in all graduating to championship level. The staggering statistic is the contrast with Kerry, in scoring power, from players who have came through. Derrys  minor team was a well-organised unit. Shane McGuigan was the reason they won the Ulster title and he still remains the best forward in the county by some margin. He has scored - in  senior games. With - in  outings, Danny Tallon is a long way back in second place. Paudie McGrogan , Conor Dohertyand Alex Doherty, with -, are next. Compare that to Kerry. Seaacuten OSheas  games brought him a tally of -, David Clfordhas scored -. Killian Spillane, with three of his Templenoe club-mates, bridged the gap from minor to the senior  by playing in the Kerry junior team. Last year, in his debut senior season, Peter Keane handed him a fth championship start in an All-Ireland final and he bagged -. Dara Moynihan, Miceaacutel Burns and defender Tom OSullivan have all contributed to the scoreline. Stats are indicators and dont always tell the full story. Style of play is an influence. Rory Gallagher was slated before a ball was kicked with Derry about his defensive brand of football. From watching games this year and under previous Derry managers, Rory is no dferent. Two men and sometimes one stay up front. There is a link player and everyone  appears briefed with flooding the middle and keeping possession. From watching the teams Derry come up against, what  are you supposed to do. Louth and Tipperary came to the muck and clabber of Celtic Park and parked the bus. Maybe even two or three. Damian McErlain found the same. And every manager before him, struggling to play against the blanket. Remember the  Division  league final  Derry went through a spell of giving the ball away cheaply. Against a Kerry or a Dublin they wouldve got hammered. From talking to Kerrys Eye Sports Editor, Sylvester Hennessy, an analyst under Peter Keane, who is now helping with Limerick. He points out the dference is night and day, once you go down the isions. You still need killer forwards to play attacking football at senior level. Much is talked about youth football, but the Derry club scene isnt coming down with enough candidates. I am thinking of Derrys trip to Paacuteirc Esler. They were squeaky clean in possession. In fact, their setup was spot on. With another steady head and an eye for a score, theyd have beaten both Down and Leitrim. Thats the reality. Organisation and brawn will only take you so far. Finishers win prizes. Even Donegal, who were so negative in the McKenna Cup clash with Derry, are expressive when they head out of Ulster. Hennessy, like Eacuteamonn Fitzmaurice, speaks of the attacking brand of football in Kerry. Fitzmaurice stresses how kids want to be the next Gooch, Clford or Mickey Sheehy. He mentions the way football is played allows forwards to develop their craft. Both men mention the  U Paul McGirr final, a thriller won by Pobalscoil Chorca Dhuibhne after extra-time. Fitzmaurice remembers and asks about the blondie fellaup front for Maghera. Hennessy was covering the game and also enquired of Dohertys progress. Eacuteamonn refers to Magheras impressive Hogan Cup final performance in  and Danny Tallons name comes up in the conversation. Conor Converys nine points in the  semi-final win was enough for Fitzmaurice to have his prize defender Brian Oacute Beaglaoich keep tabs on him in the final. “I would have often have seen a lot of similarities between the Derry style of play and the Kerry style of play,” offers Fitzmaurice of his playing days. “That is dferent over the past couple of years for sure, I wouldve thought in the past that the forward culture wouldnt have been that dferent between the two counties.” Going forward, it has been encouraging to see Paul Cassidy and Matthew Downey at club level in the past year. Cassidys performance to save Derry Us from defeat against Armagh was tantalising. Shane McGuigan is crying out for help. As a trio, it could be a decent foundation. Behind this, schools, club and county coaches must produce more of the same from the wheelie bin type coaching of lockdown. With it, needs to come a pressure to change the outlook. Defensive football is perfect for stabilising a team. Derry and Kerry minors were the perfect example. Niall Keenan marked their  dangerman Conor Geaney out of the game, but up popped the unknown quality of Michael Foley to sink Derry. As for the Kingdoms  and  model, they would just give you nightmares. The elephant in the room, one that cant be ignored is the colossal turnover of players. From the start of Damian Bartons tenure, in , Derry have used  playersin league and championship, with  featuring in the latter. To give the numbers some context, Donegal reached three Ulster finals, winning two, during this same spell, using  players in league and championship. Monaghan have used  players. This is something that Derry are going to have to nail,the current underage development is going to bear any fruit. Between players leaving , managers having dferent opinions and the lure of the US in the summer - its impossible for anything to blossom. There is a culture of expectation to be a starter and when players are not making the cut, pressure comes from club managers about wasting their time with the county. Granted, it is easier for a  player to hang around many of the top counties with the chance of winning silverware and the carrot of maybe a team holiday at the end of the season for getting to a final. Another huge issue is a lack of midfielders. When Down pushed up on Derry in Newry, there was nobody to pluck a ball from the skies. A qualier a few years ago against Laois was the same. There is not much you can do without the leather. Hand in hand with this, comes the debate about AFL. Conor Glass, Callum Brown and Anton Tohill were not the finished article. There is Kealan Friel coming through, a late bolter, as termed by U boss Mickey Donnelly, having not progressed through the county minors. The days of the short kick-out are fading. It does have its place, but without any size at midfield there can be no plan B. Like the lack of scoring forwards, ato producing midfielders needs to figure high up any coaching plan for the future. One that must start now. Unless club, school and county are united, and properly, then little change can be expected. And Gerard OKanes team of  and Derrys  senior team will be as far away as ever.

It signalled the start of the countys , but on a national level they were nowhere close to toppling Kerry. This week, Michael McMullan trawls back through the record books. The  All-Ireland was the model title. An underage production line, with  clubs represented on Chris Browns starting team brought Tom Markham back north. It was a performance that warmed the cockles of the Derry fans. Expressive football, mixed with Michael McGoldrick, Gerard OKane and Joe Keenan leading a defence that broke the hearts of forward lines across the land. googletag.cmd.push The following year, with six of the team underage, the Oakleafers were tipped for glory again until Damian Daisy McDermotts goal grabbed victory for Tyrone in the first round. It began a tale of woe for Derrys minor grade, which petered off after Magheras  Hogan Cup win and MacLarnon Cup win  months earlier for St Columbs Derry. Like decades before it, school and county minor success drip-fed into the overall pick for senior managers, an addition to the clubs pathway. The county U team didnt push on like it needed to either. The All-Ireland minor final of  was a rare highlight in a -year drought. Aside from that run, the county registered only three other first round wins –  ,  and until Damian McErlains side sparked the current resurgence. googletag.cmd.push At school level, there was also a blip. St Pius Magherafelt and St Pauls Kilrea both won All-Irelands in , but that was the end of the line until Maghera rose from the ashes again. Derry won back to back Buncrana Cups at U level, but were shocked by Fermanagh at minor level in  when it was their minor time, as the rut continued. In the senior ranks, the county were in a strong position. A NFL title came to Derry in , with a run to the final the following year – both against Kerry. There was a run to the Ulster U final. Ballinderry, Greenlough and Lissan all reaching Ulster club finals at their respective grades, with Shamrocks minors picking up a fourth minor title at St Pauls. Not pushing on from here, as a county, was a missed opportunity. Things began to fall away. Three years in Division  followed, before a rise back to the top level and another league final and a hammering by the all-conquering Dubs. Then came a free-fall from the top. Score dference saved Damian Barton from a drop to Division  in  but this was followed by back to back relegations before Damian McErlain steered them back from the basement. Macker has since stepped down, to be replaced by Rory Gallagher, but before Covid- brought sport to a standstill, Derrys chances of ato Division  were unlikely at best. Looking back at Derrys comparison with Kerry, the Kingdom have won two All-Ireland U U titles since Derrys  triumph. Former Kerry senior boss Eacuteamonn Fitzmaurice was on the winning team in  and and lack of silverware at that grade worries him. Fitzmaurice handed  senior debutsto players from the minor teams of  to . Peter Keane, a minor selector under Mickey Ned O Sullivan in  and  before succeeding Jack OConnor as manager for the remainder of the five-in-a-row, took the number to  when appointed as senior boss. Fourteen have played in the championship. In the same time window, playing two and three tiers below Kerry,  Derry players have made it through to senior level. Paul McNeill, Peter Hagan and Danny Tallon played under Richard Ferris in , the rest were part of Damian McErlains minor tenure, with  in all graduating to championship level. The staggering statistic is the contrast with Kerry, in scoring power, from players who have came through. Derrys  minor team was a well-organised unit. Shane McGuigan was the reason they won the Ulster title and he still remains the best forward in the county by some margin. He has scored - in  senior games. With - in  outings, Danny Tallon is a long way back in second place. Paudie McGrogan , Conor Dohertyand Alex Doherty, with -, are next. Compare that to Kerry. Seaacuten OSheas  games brought him a tally of -, David Clfordhas scored -. Killian Spillane, with three of his Templenoe club-mates, bridged the gap from minor to the senior  by playing in the Kerry junior team. Last year, in his debut senior season, Peter Keane handed him a fth championship start in an All-Ireland final and he bagged -. Dara Moynihan, Miceaacutel Burns and defender Tom OSullivan have all contributed to the scoreline. Stats are indicators and dont always tell the full story. Style of play is an influence. Rory Gallagher was slated before a ball was kicked with Derry about his defensive brand of football. From watching games this year and under previous Derry managers, Rory is no dferent. Two men and sometimes one stay up front. There is a link player and everyone  appears briefed with flooding the middle and keeping possession. From watching the teams Derry come up against, what  are you supposed to do. Louth and Tipperary came to the muck and clabber of Celtic Park and parked the bus. Maybe even two or three. Damian McErlain found the same. And every manager before him, struggling to play against the blanket. Remember the  Division  league final  Derry went through a spell of giving the ball away cheaply. Against a Kerry or a Dublin they wouldve got hammered. From talking to Kerrys Eye Sports Editor, Sylvester Hennessy, an analyst under Peter Keane, who is now helping with Limerick. He points out the dference is night and day, once you go down the isions. You still need killer forwards to play attacking football at senior level. Much is talked about youth football, but the Derry club scene isnt coming down with enough candidates. I am thinking of Derrys trip to Paacuteirc Esler. They were squeaky clean in possession. In fact, their setup was spot on. With another steady head and an eye for a score, theyd have beaten both Down and Leitrim. Thats the reality. Organisation and brawn will only take you so far. Finishers win prizes. Even Donegal, who were so negative in the McKenna Cup clash with Derry, are expressive when they head out of Ulster. Hennessy, like Eacuteamonn Fitzmaurice, speaks of the attacking brand of football in Kerry. Fitzmaurice stresses how kids want to be the next Gooch, Clford or Mickey Sheehy. He mentions the way football is played allows forwards to develop their craft. Both men mention the  U Paul McGirr final, a thriller won by Pobalscoil Chorca Dhuibhne after extra-time. Fitzmaurice remembers and asks about the blondie fellaup front for Maghera. Hennessy was covering the game and also enquired of Dohertys progress. Eacuteamonn refers to Magheras impressive Hogan Cup final performance in  and Danny Tallons name comes up in the conversation. Conor Converys nine points in the  semi-final win was enough for Fitzmaurice to have his prize defender Brian Oacute Beaglaoich keep tabs on him in the final. “I would have often have seen a lot of similarities between the Derry style of play and the Kerry style of play,” offers Fitzmaurice of his playing days. “That is dferent over the past couple of years for sure, I wouldve thought in the past that the forward culture wouldnt have been that dferent between the two counties.” Going forward, it has been encouraging to see Paul Cassidy and Matthew Downey at club level in the past year. Cassidys performance to save Derry Us from defeat against Armagh was tantalising. Shane McGuigan is crying out for help. As a trio, it could be a decent foundation. Behind this, schools, club and county coaches must produce more of the same from the wheelie bin type coaching of lockdown. With it, needs to come a pressure to change the outlook. Defensive football is perfect for stabilising a team. Derry and Kerry minors were the perfect example. Niall Keenan marked their  dangerman Conor Geaney out of the game, but up popped the unknown quality of Michael Foley to sink Derry. As for the Kingdoms  and  model, they would just give you nightmares. The elephant in the room, one that cant be ignored is the colossal turnover of players. From the start of Damian Bartons tenure, in , Derry have used  playersin league and championship, with  featuring in the latter. To give the numbers some context, Donegal reached three Ulster finals, winning two, during this same spell, using  players in league and championship. Monaghan have used  players. This is something that Derry are going to have to nail,the current underage development is going to bear any fruit. Between players leaving , managers having dferent opinions and the lure of the US in the summer - its impossible for anything to blossom. There is a culture of expectation to be a starter and when players are not making the cut, pressure comes from club managers about wasting their time with the county. Granted, it is easier for a  player to hang around many of the top counties with the chance of winning silverware and the carrot of maybe a team holiday at the end of the season for getting to a final. Another huge issue is a lack of midfielders. When Down pushed up on Derry in Newry, there was nobody to pluck a ball from the skies. A qualier a few years ago against Laois was the same. There is not much you can do without the leather. Hand in hand with this, comes the debate about AFL. Conor Glass, Callum Brown and Anton Tohill were not the finished article. There is Kealan Friel coming through, a late bolter, as termed by U boss Mickey Donnelly, having not progressed through the county minors. The days of the short kick-out are fading. It does have its place, but without any size at midfield there can be no plan B. Like the lack of scoring forwards, ato producing midfielders needs to figure high up any coaching plan for the future. One that must start now. Unless club, school and county are united, and properly, then little change can be expected. And Gerard OKanes team of  and Derrys  senior team will be as far away as ever.

He is now in his second year as Principal of Dingles Pobalscoil Chorca Dhuibhne, who he managed to successive Hogan Cups. He handed senior debuts to  players who played minor against Derry. He spoke to Michael McMullan... *** A  minute phone-call to Eacuteamonn Fitzmaurice is time well-spent. The former Kerry boss is as interested as he is interesting. Calm. Concise. A listener and a talker in equal measure. “No problem,” comes the response earlier in the week, to a request for a Kerry angle on an Ulster minor football feature. A peek into the county who know it better than most. A county where football chat ebbs around every corner and silverware is the only currency. googletag.cmd.push Derry went  years without an Ulster minor title. Gradually the wheels of change are beginning to turn. We start our conversation with Kerrys shortfalls. From  until the golden minor generation, Tom Markham didnt set foot inside Kerry. In the senior ranks, by the time Liam Hassett lted Sam, it was  years since  skipper Tommy Doyle carried it into his native Annascaul. A real famine in these parts. - Opinion: Sideline View measures Derry up against the Kingdom. More... As the noughties began, Sam came to visit more often. “There were senior All-Irelands being won and there were no minors being won, so it wasnt as much of a concern,” Fitzmaurice said of the his playing career at the start of the millennium. googletag.cmd.push One or two players coming off a minor production line added to an already strong senior core. Its above that where his concern rests. At U level, a grade where Fitzmaurice, the player, annexed two All-Ireland U medals and found the net in the  win over Laois. “It is a better yardstick for players in terms of making it to senior afterwards,” he adds, looking through the eyes of an ex-senior manager. A sole title since, in , is a concern for him. The minor success was still great, he continues. Of the  players from the winning teams to have already tasted the senior championship, Fitzmaurice and Peter Keane dished out an equal number of debuts. Another eight have played in the league. “I think it is a case by case basis,” Fitzmaurice replies, when prompted about the decision to bring them in. Tom OSullivan, Barry OSullivan and Brian Oacute Beaglaoich, from his Hogan Cup winning team, were first. It is a delicate balancing act, he concedes. Finding the middle ground between giving players exposure and risking long-term prospects. “You have David Clford and the Seaacutenie OShea, they are the exception rather than the norm, who can come through and make an impact straight away,” he points out. Diarmuid OConnor played in the league once he stepped out of minor, just one game. Clford is the only one from the five minor teams to become a fully-fledged Kerry senior in his first year out of underage. “What you find with a lot of the other players, it does take a couple of seasons training with the senior squad,” he added. Five seasons passed before Peter Keane made Shane Ryan the regular senior goalkeeper, reaching an All-Ireland final in . Liam Kearney, minor captain in , wasnt a regular until this season. Another  graduate, Miceaacutel Burns, couldnt nail down a starting berth in the Dr Crokes team that defeated Slaughtneil in , but is now a Kerry regular. Killian Spillane went the scenic route via the All-Ireland junior winning team. “It has probably taken longer than they wouldve anticipated themselves to come through, but it is such a big jump up from minor to senior.” Fitzmaurice chips in with Dublins U success. The politans have won four titles in the last  years and lost last years final. “It takes a couple of seasons to come through and get ready to be at the level where you can really impact...to get used to the level of training, to be physically developed and mentally and emotionally be ready,” he believes. *** Kerrys minor run had to start somewhere. It was a collective, according to Fitzmaurice. Development squads were a big factor, as well as having former Kerry players teaching in the locals schools. The local influence was massive. Jack OConnor is in Colaacuteiste na Sceilge, Liam Hassett is Deputy Principal in St Michaels Listowel. Marc Oacute Seacute is in The Green in Tralee. “They are willing to give time to develop the school teams,” stresses Fitzmaurice, who also has help from an unlikely source in Chorca Dhuibhne. Back in , when Fitzmaurice was Kerry U manager, he knew the season was going to clash with the schools football season. Tommy Grfin runs a pub in Dingle and the hours were never going to clash with school training. Plus, with many of the pupils coming from Tommys native Dingle, the local club would benefit. He gladly agreed. “That was a big factorand other schools have done that, where people were available and were happy to come in to help - it was completely voluntary. It was a coup and a half for us, that someone like that would get involved.” Donal Daly is another link. He played with Fitzmaurice on Kerry teams and operates a hands-off approach in his role as Kerry GAAs Games Manager. He uses his experience from the county scene to oversee and trust people. Allowing them to paddle their own canoe, yet pull the strings together at the same time. “Thats been very effective and has worked well,” Eacuteamonn comments, while also acknowledging the efforts of clubs. “When you put it all together, then a lot of very good players have been developed over the last  or  years and it has certainly worked.” Relationships are important. The school versus county minor loggerheads is a common scenario. But, with Jack OConnor at the helm with the minors in  and , it was the perfect scenario. Fitzmaurice had a good working relationship from playing under Jack with Kerry, and later alongside him as a senior selector. “We had an arrangement that the players spent most of the time with us , played most of the football with us and when the dferent Kerryteams got knocked out along the way, they spent more time with the minors,” Fitzmaurice explains.  Mark OConnor and Brian Oacute Beaglaoich show off the Hogan Cup Four days after the  Hogan Cup final win over Maghera, Kerry played their first minor championship game, a comfortable win over Clare. OSullivan and Oacute Beaglaoich lined out in defence. Current AFL player Mark OConnor and Barry OSullivan were at midfield, Cathal Bambury was in attack, with Tomaacutes Oacute Seacutecoming off the bench. “That was certainly a challenge for the minor management,” he concedes. “They had a bunch of players coming in, who they not seen a huge pile of. “That became the model for other years when Peter Keane became involved , Tommywas a selector with him so there was crossover and co-operation.” St Brendans Killarney followed up with two Hogan Cups. In Fitzmaurices opinion, there was no masterplan, yet it worked. Co-operation, communication and trust, the three words he rolls out. The minor management knew the players would be primed for action. “It has definitely stood usin good stead at colleges and minor level, thankfully it has worked out from our perspective.” *** Trotting down the Cusack Stand corridor, with swapped jerseys slung over their shoulders, the Kerry minors chiselled physique matched their silky skills of the previous hour. When asked about the provision for strength and conditioning, it was done within the school with advice from the minor setup. Given the size of Kerry, pooling for central sessions wasnt feasible. Again, Fitzmaurice drops in the word balance. Between conditioning for the minor season and playing in the schools performance phase and knock-out football. “We got advice on what the minors were doing and what we could do in the school. In the winter time, we did gym work in school and took it into the minor season.” Chorca Dhuibhne could avail of Tomaacutes Oacute Beaglaoich, a teacher in the school. Though not fully qualied , he had knowledge, which he mixed with the advice offered by the county experts and supervised the sessions. “It is an awkward balancing act. We fed into it and tried to do it as best we could. In The Sem , they had Arthur Fitzgerald, who had been involved in the strength and conditioning with Kerry minor and U teams,” Fitzmaurice explains. “I think, across the county, there is joined up thinking from the development squads right up to senior level as to what the best route way is for players and the best way to manage it. “It is a challenge because of all the football players get to play, to balance that with physically developing them. It worked out quite well for us, in that a lot of it was a common-sense approach.” *** One aspect of the school versus county situation across Ulster, was the clash of the MacRory and MacLarnon Cup players and U squads, due to the changing of grades to U and U. It forced players into making choices and balancing spinning plates. Fitzmaurice feels that it is always fair to give new ideas a chance and allow experimentation. Two years down the track, he can now make up his mind. “I think the older age groups , for me, worked better,” he answers, with the experience of the pathway both as a player and manager. “The way it is now, you have a lot of lads doing their leaving cert, they are playing Us and Im not convinced it works. “I think U is a better age-group, by the time they are finished they have a good grounding at the end of the development phase and getting ready to make their mark at senior level.” Comparing the Derry and Kerry minor teams of -, the scoring s and a better balance to Jack OConnor and Peter Keanes teams was the game-changer. “Forwards dont tend to be a huge problem for us, they seem to be part of the identy of Kerry football,” states Fitzmaurice, while feeling the county needs more steeliness in their defence. A couple of hard as nails defenders, he jokes. Does he feel this attacking flair comes from the standard of club football, tradition down through the years or more expression being encouraged  After a brief pause, he feels its a combination of all three. “The standard of coaching and club football is very good here. Every generation growing up, they are looking at Mikey Sheehy, then you are looking at Maurice Fitzgerald, then the Gooch and now Clford. There is always someone to look at and to learn from, so that helps.” The Kerry style of play, he continues, does allow forwards to express themselves more - particularly at younger age groups. All emphasised by the county board coaches around the schools. Fitzmaurice feels the standard of coaching, all over Ireland, is of a high standard, with resources and clinics for coaches to improve. “At the younger age groups there would be a huge emphasis on skill development, getting all the basic skills and going up through the grades, particularly as they get older, the players themselves get more competitive. “It is not enough to have the skills, they need the grounding, the basics and fundamentals at a good level so they can start to aim at winning things. It becomes a bit more serious and tactical, but at the younger age groups there would be a lot of freedom.” The conversation heads to a conclusion, with his impression of Derry. From playing, managing and being at the coalface of underage at school. Alex Dohertys performance in the Paul McGirr final gets a mention. Growing up, do Kerry players have a better chance to flourish  “The way football is played down here , they have a bit more time to develop their craft whereasyou are playing a very defensive-orientated culture it is hard. “Playing against Derry myself, and watching Derry in the recent past they have played a bit more defensive. “There was a time when Derry,you think back  years ago or certainly when I was playing, they were very much a strong physical team and they were a kicking team. They had a great forwards, they had the Bradleysand they were hard to contain. “That is dferent over the past couple of years for sure, I wouldve thought in the past that the forward culture wouldnt have been that dferent between the two counties.” The Kerry man would have often likened the Derry style of play to Kerry. And people down here know their football. The roll of honour reinforces that. RELATED - Fitzmaurice on the lure of Australia More... - Opinion: Sideline View measures Derry up against the Kingdom.

He is now in his second year as Principal of Dingles Pobalscoil Chorca Dhuibhne, who he managed to successive Hogan Cups. He handed senior debuts to  players who played minor against Derry. He spoke to Michael McMullan... *** A  minute phone-call to Eacuteamonn Fitzmaurice is time well-spent. The former Kerry boss is as interested as he is interesting. Calm. Concise. A listener and a talker in equal measure. “No problem,” comes the response earlier in the week, to a request for a Kerry angle on an Ulster minor football feature. A peek into the county who know it better than most. A county where football chat ebbs around every corner and silverware is the only currency. googletag.cmd.push Derry went  years without an Ulster minor title. Gradually the wheels of change are beginning to turn. We start our conversation with Kerrys shortfalls. From  until the golden minor generation, Tom Markham didnt set foot inside Kerry. In the senior ranks, by the time Liam Hassett lted Sam, it was  years since  skipper Tommy Doyle carried it into his native Annascaul. A real famine in these parts. - Opinion: Sideline View measures Derry up against the Kingdom. More... As the noughties began, Sam came to visit more often. “There were senior All-Irelands being won and there were no minors being won, so it wasnt as much of a concern,” Fitzmaurice said of the his playing career at the start of the millennium. googletag.cmd.push One or two players coming off a minor production line added to an already strong senior core. Its above that where his concern rests. At U level, a grade where Fitzmaurice, the player, annexed two All-Ireland U medals and found the net in the  win over Laois. “It is a better yardstick for players in terms of making it to senior afterwards,” he adds, looking through the eyes of an ex-senior manager. A sole title since, in , is a concern for him. The minor success was still great, he continues. Of the  players from the winning teams to have already tasted the senior championship, Fitzmaurice and Peter Keane dished out an equal number of debuts. Another eight have played in the league. “I think it is a case by case basis,” Fitzmaurice replies, when prompted about the decision to bring them in. Tom OSullivan, Barry OSullivan and Brian Oacute Beaglaoich, from his Hogan Cup winning team, were first. It is a delicate balancing act, he concedes. Finding the middle ground between giving players exposure and risking long-term prospects. “You have David Clford and the Seaacutenie OShea, they are the exception rather than the norm, who can come through and make an impact straight away,” he points out. Diarmuid OConnor played in the league once he stepped out of minor, just one game. Clford is the only one from the five minor teams to become a fully-fledged Kerry senior in his first year out of underage. “What you find with a lot of the other players, it does take a couple of seasons training with the senior squad,” he added. Five seasons passed before Peter Keane made Shane Ryan the regular senior goalkeeper, reaching an All-Ireland final in . Liam Kearney, minor captain in , wasnt a regular until this season. Another  graduate, Miceaacutel Burns, couldnt nail down a starting berth in the Dr Crokes team that defeated Slaughtneil in , but is now a Kerry regular. Killian Spillane went the scenic route via the All-Ireland junior winning team. “It has probably taken longer than they wouldve anticipated themselves to come through, but it is such a big jump up from minor to senior.” Fitzmaurice chips in with Dublins U success. The politans have won four titles in the last  years and lost last years final. “It takes a couple of seasons to come through and get ready to be at the level where you can really impact...to get used to the level of training, to be physically developed and mentally and emotionally be ready,” he believes. *** Kerrys minor run had to start somewhere. It was a collective, according to Fitzmaurice. Development squads were a big factor, as well as having former Kerry players teaching in the locals schools. The local influence was massive. Jack OConnor is in Colaacuteiste na Sceilge, Liam Hassett is Deputy Principal in St Michaels Listowel. Marc Oacute Seacute is in The Green in Tralee. “They are willing to give time to develop the school teams,” stresses Fitzmaurice, who also has help from an unlikely source in Chorca Dhuibhne. Back in , when Fitzmaurice was Kerry U manager, he knew the season was going to clash with the schools football season. Tommy Grfin runs a pub in Dingle and the hours were never going to clash with school training. Plus, with many of the pupils coming from Tommys native Dingle, the local club would benefit. He gladly agreed. “That was a big factorand other schools have done that, where people were available and were happy to come in to help - it was completely voluntary. It was a coup and a half for us, that someone like that would get involved.” Donal Daly is another link. He played with Fitzmaurice on Kerry teams and operates a hands-off approach in his role as Kerry GAAs Games Manager. He uses his experience from the county scene to oversee and trust people. Allowing them to paddle their own canoe, yet pull the strings together at the same time. “Thats been very effective and has worked well,” Eacuteamonn comments, while also acknowledging the efforts of clubs. “When you put it all together, then a lot of very good players have been developed over the last  or  years and it has certainly worked.” Relationships are important. The school versus county minor loggerheads is a common scenario. But, with Jack OConnor at the helm with the minors in  and , it was the perfect scenario. Fitzmaurice had a good working relationship from playing under Jack with Kerry, and later alongside him as a senior selector. “We had an arrangement that the players spent most of the time with us , played most of the football with us and when the dferent Kerryteams got knocked out along the way, they spent more time with the minors,” Fitzmaurice explains.  Mark OConnor and Brian Oacute Beaglaoich show off the Hogan Cup Four days after the  Hogan Cup final win over Maghera, Kerry played their first minor championship game, a comfortable win over Clare. OSullivan and Oacute Beaglaoich lined out in defence. Current AFL player Mark OConnor and Barry OSullivan were at midfield, Cathal Bambury was in attack, with Tomaacutes Oacute Seacutecoming off the bench. “That was certainly a challenge for the minor management,” he concedes. “They had a bunch of players coming in, who they not seen a huge pile of. “That became the model for other years when Peter Keane became involved , Tommywas a selector with him so there was crossover and co-operation.” St Brendans Killarney followed up with two Hogan Cups. In Fitzmaurices opinion, there was no masterplan, yet it worked. Co-operation, communication and trust, the three words he rolls out. The minor management knew the players would be primed for action. “It has definitely stood usin good stead at colleges and minor level, thankfully it has worked out from our perspective.” *** Trotting down the Cusack Stand corridor, with swapped jerseys slung over their shoulders, the Kerry minors chiselled physique matched their silky skills of the previous hour. When asked about the provision for strength and conditioning, it was done within the school with advice from the minor setup. Given the size of Kerry, pooling for central sessions wasnt feasible. Again, Fitzmaurice drops in the word balance. Between conditioning for the minor season and playing in the schools performance phase and knock-out football. “We got advice on what the minors were doing and what we could do in the school. In the winter time, we did gym work in school and took it into the minor season.” Chorca Dhuibhne could avail of Tomaacutes Oacute Beaglaoich, a teacher in the school. Though not fully qualied , he had knowledge, which he mixed with the advice offered by the county experts and supervised the sessions. “It is an awkward balancing act. We fed into it and tried to do it as best we could. In The Sem , they had Arthur Fitzgerald, who had been involved in the strength and conditioning with Kerry minor and U teams,” Fitzmaurice explains. “I think, across the county, there is joined up thinking from the development squads right up to senior level as to what the best route way is for players and the best way to manage it. “It is a challenge because of all the football players get to play, to balance that with physically developing them. It worked out quite well for us, in that a lot of it was a common-sense approach.” *** One aspect of the school versus county situation across Ulster, was the clash of the MacRory and MacLarnon Cup players and U squads, due to the changing of grades to U and U. It forced players into making choices and balancing spinning plates. Fitzmaurice feels that it is always fair to give new ideas a chance and allow experimentation. Two years down the track, he can now make up his mind. “I think the older age groups , for me, worked better,” he answers, with the experience of the pathway both as a player and manager. “The way it is now, you have a lot of lads doing their leaving cert, they are playing Us and Im not convinced it works. “I think U is a better age-group, by the time they are finished they have a good grounding at the end of the development phase and getting ready to make their mark at senior level.” Comparing the Derry and Kerry minor teams of -, the scoring s and a better balance to Jack OConnor and Peter Keanes teams was the game-changer. “Forwards dont tend to be a huge problem for us, they seem to be part of the identy of Kerry football,” states Fitzmaurice, while feeling the county needs more steeliness in their defence. A couple of hard as nails defenders, he jokes. Does he feel this attacking flair comes from the standard of club football, tradition down through the years or more expression being encouraged  After a brief pause, he feels its a combination of all three. “The standard of coaching and club football is very good here. Every generation growing up, they are looking at Mikey Sheehy, then you are looking at Maurice Fitzgerald, then the Gooch and now Clford. There is always someone to look at and to learn from, so that helps.” The Kerry style of play, he continues, does allow forwards to express themselves more - particularly at younger age groups. All emphasised by the county board coaches around the schools. Fitzmaurice feels the standard of coaching, all over Ireland, is of a high standard, with resources and clinics for coaches to improve. “At the younger age groups there would be a huge emphasis on skill development, getting all the basic skills and going up through the grades, particularly as they get older, the players themselves get more competitive. “It is not enough to have the skills, they need the grounding, the basics and fundamentals at a good level so they can start to aim at winning things. It becomes a bit more serious and tactical, but at the younger age groups there would be a lot of freedom.” The conversation heads to a conclusion, with his impression of Derry. From playing, managing and being at the coalface of underage at school. Alex Dohertys performance in the Paul McGirr final gets a mention.

The armed forces have been helping out across the UK building emergency hospitals, delivering vital supplies and much more. UK government staff based all across the world have also been helping UK citizens to get home to the UK during the global Coronavirus outbreak. Today we look at how members of Government departments have been helping solve some of the problems created by the coronavirus outbreak.  HELPING HANDS: Members of the  Logistic Brigade of the British Army deliver a consignment of medical masks to St Thomas’ hospital in London. googletag.cmd.push On March , the Defence Secretary announced a COVID Support Force to assist public services with their response to the coronavirus outbreak. There were , Armed Forces personnel stood at readiness to assist civil authorities, of which nearly , have already been deployed. Military reservists have also been mobilised as part of the COVID Support Force and used in a range of activities, from providing medical and logistical support to deploying their own professional skills, such as accounting and construction. The help from the UK’s armed forces during the Coronavirus outbreak has taken a number of dferent forms. The Armed Forces have deployed dozens of military planners across the UK, which has seen them working with Local Resilience Forums and Partnerships, alongside the Emergency Co-ordination Centres in Scotland and Wales supporting public services, local authorities and emergency services. googletag.cmd.push The UK Armed Forces’ efforts have included working with specialists from Boots Pharmacists to train testing personnel, the provision of military testers to regional testing centres and the delivery of vital testing equipment. Military personnel are also currently working to distribute PPE to NHS trusts and organisations across the country. Up to May , Armed Forces personnel had helped to deliver over . billion items of PPE to NHS staff in England. Six military specialists have also been deployed to assist NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde with the fitting of FFP face masks. A new COVID Aviation Task Force has been established. This includes two RAF Puma based in Kinloss Barracks to help the NHS in Scotland and Northern England. Support has included training key workers in ious locations around the Western Hebrides in medical evacuation procedures and supporting NHS staff, plus helping with five medical evacuations in England and Scotland.  MERCY MISSION: Members of the UK Armed Forces work with NHS medical staff and Air Ambulance Service crews onboard a Puma HC helicopter at Thruxton Aerodrome in Andover, England Special charter flights bring , British travellers back home More than , British travellers have ed to the UK on  special Government charter flights from  dferent countries and territories since the outbreak of coronavirus. Foreign and Commonwealth Office staff have been working around the clock with the airline industry and host governments across the world to help bring back British travellers. Up to pound million has been made available for special charter flights to priority countries, focused on helping the most vulnerable travellers. So far, charter flights have ed British nationals to the UK from countries ranging from Bolivia to Bermuda and New Zealand to Nepal. Government staff have also helped ensure travellers on commercial routes can get home, including , passengers who have ed from Spain. Around  British nationals have ed from Kenya on five commercial flights, which would not have been possible without the work of our High Commission in Nairobi. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has also helped more than , British passengers who were aboard  cruise ships disembark. A package of measures to support British nationals who are still waiting toto the UK has also been put in place. The support package addresses financial issues, healthcare concerns and visa extensions, as well as loans for those who cannot afford flights to the UK where they have exhausted all other options. Working to end extreme poverty across the world The Department for International Developmentleads the UK’s work to end extreme poverty. The UK is an international development superpower, and we are also a scientic and medical world leader. UK-based scientists, such as those at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine are playing key roles in the global response to this deadly new virus. Through the DFID aid budget, the UK is the largest single national contributor to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations international efforts to find a vaccine.

On Monday, five of Derry City  Strabane District Council’s  household recycling centres reopened after being closed for a period as a result of the COVID- emergency legislation. Long queues formed outside the centres before they opened as people who were in lockdown attempted to dump and recycle materials that had accumulated. Derry’s centres do not charge people to get rid of their waste. In Donegal people must pay for some items at recycling centres while others are free.  googletag.cmd.push At the most recent meeting of the council, DUP Alderman Maurice Devenney said the use of the dumps by people from Donegal was a quite serious problem which needed to be examined. Alderman Devenney said that given the costs being faced by the local council as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, they should not be footing the bill for people from a dferent jurisdiction to get rid of their rubbish. He suggested that when the dumps are re-opened the council should look at new measures to prevent people from outside the council area using the facilities. Alderman Devenney asked for a report to be prepared in a bid to try and establish how many vehicles with southern registrations are using the local dumps. googletag.cmd.push Addressing the issue of cross border waste, a council spokesperson this week said that it is aware of ‘some cross border waste’ being brought to its recycling centres by members of the public and that its centres are designed to handle the volume of waste which passes through daily. She said: “This issue is reviewed on an ongoing basis with elected members recently requesting a full report on usage that will come before them for review and discussion at the next Environment and Regeneration Committee. “Council acknowledges the fact that there are many instances where users of the amenity sites live outside of the Council area, for example they may own a property within the Council area. “Council continues to remind people from outside of the council area that where possible they should limit travel and should use services and facilities in their own areas.” The Council spokesperson added that they experienced a high volume of users at the sites when they reopened on Monday and encouraged the public to hold off and avail of the services later in the week. Five centres at Pennyburn, Glendermott Road, Strathfoyle, Claudy and Strahan Road in Strabane are all open from am to pm Monday to Friday, am to pm on Saturday, and Sunday opening from  to pm for Pennyburn, Glendermott Road and Strahan Road sites only. The public are reminded that the council’s regular refuse collection service is fully operational throughout this emergency period and that additional support to deal with excess waste has been provided through a bespoke COVID Waste Helpline –    - and a free Bulky Waste Collection Service that can be booked online on the councils website.

Patricia McCallion, who owns her own hair and beauty salon in Waterloo Street, agreed to be stripped of her make-up and lashes to take part in Pretty Single which airs on Monday. The series sees siximage-concious singeltons embrace the natural lookto try and finda love connection that is more than skin deep. Patricia kicks off the showbygoing on five dates with five dferent guys, while her co-starswatch the dates unfold from the comfort of their sofa – providing supportive and humorous commentary throughout. googletag.cmd.push Mum-of-one and self-confessed romantic, Patricia admits she hides her true self behind make-up to boost her confidence. “It’s putting on a mask in the morning, it’s covering the flaws that you don’t like about yourself, she said. People often say to me you look like you workin the beauty industry and I do like to look the part. I have to look at myself in the mirror all day at work so I want to look mybest. Each of the five suitors have been specially matched to Patricia but she could only take one to dinner. The dates were one after the other and then you had to whittle it down to two and decide which one to take on a proper date, explained Patricia. googletag.cmd.push If I was going on a normal dateId have my make-up done because you want to impress, but the funny thing was the fellas didnt even notice we werent wearing make-up. I felt like I was putting myself out there and it was scary, but at the same time I felt like they were getting to know the real me because I was more vulnerable. Patricia remains tight lipped about who she chose for her date, but revealed she was given the option of going bare faced or wearing make-up. I kind of went for a bit of both, she laughed. She is now looking forward to seeing the show for the first time when it airs on Monday. The trailer came on the other night after Eastenders and I was jumping around the room, she admitted. I kept rewinding it to watch again. Narrated by Derry Girls star Saoirse-Monica Jackson, Pretty Single is a Stelly Media production for BBC One Northern Ireland and BBC Scotland. It begins on BBC One Northern Ireland on Monday  May at .pm. All six episodes in the series will be available on BBC iPlayer after the first episode is broadcast.

However, concern has been raised about a group of young people who are harassing workers on the site. The construction of the new centre had to be stopped because of the lockdown restrictions. However, work has now recommenced following the easing of some aspects of the restrictions. A spokesperson for Shantallow Community Centre, however, said it was important that the contractors were allowed to get on with the project in peace. Unfortunately they are being harassed by a handful of local young people, the spokesperson said. googletag.cmd.push I am asking all parents and any adults to make a point of walking through the Donkey Field - community centre area when you can - out doing their daily exercise, walking the dog or just to check the site. This centre belongs to you. Don’t let a handful of people spoil it. We cannot risk the contractors having to leave the site again because of a couple of people who are hanging round the Donkey Field and think its a laugh to hassle the builders! googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Emma McClughan hopes to raise over pound, from selling prints of her painting, which has captured the imagination of her friends and colleagues. Her image captures the worry felt by the crews in the ambulance and on the Air Ambulance in the form of aangel and hope is represented in the form of a rainbow. The Magherafelt woman initially posted her painting on social media and was overwhelmed by the response and positivity of the comments, with people offering to buy the painting outright. googletag.cmd.push Having worked closely with the Helicopter Emergency Medical Service , Emma decided to donate any money raised from the sale of the prints to Air Ambulance NI. Breige Mulholland of AANI welcomed the donation and reiterated the importance of fundraising activities for the charity. “We are so touched that Emma has used her talents in such a heartfelt and positive way in recognition of all that NIAS and AANI do  days of the year,” she said. “As a charity, we need to raise poundm a year to keep the HEMS operational. Due to the virus all fundraising events in aid of AANI have been axed and our community are no longer able to support in the usual ways. googletag.cmd.push “Yet trauma incidents continue to occur, and public support is crucial. We thank Emma for her creativity and generosity.” NIAS Chief Executive, Michael Bloomfield, also praised Emma’s generosity. He said: “The fact that Emma’s first thoughts were that this should be sold to raise money for the Charity Air Ambulance speaks to her as a person. “It reflects a generosity of spirit which is so common among our young people and which is getting a chance to shine, like a rainbow, in these dark days. “I am constantly in awe of NIAS staff. Every day they give their all for patients and many go over and above what is expected of them. “They are all being asked to give more at this time and I am so proud of the manner in which they have risen to the challenge. But over the past couple of months, we have all been lucky to have been given an insight into some of their other talents – musical, dancing, poetry and now artistry. “This image is one that has touched the hearts of many in the way in which it shows that we are all in this together and that there will be brighter days for us all to enjoy again.” Prints of Emma’s painting can be purchased from the Air Ambulance website – www.airambulanceni.org.

The company has confirmed it has started to unfurlough some of its staff this week to prepare to reopen the majority of its six stores in Northern Ireland, including the store at a business park in the Waterside. Homeware was included in the list of businesses permitted to remain open under the legal restrictions which came into law in Northern Ireland on March . The regulations in England were subsequently updated on May  to include homeware as an essential business, prompting Matalan to begin a phased reopening of its English outlets. The company initially furloughed  staff in the north, but it has now confirmed that it will reopen its stores in Northern Ireland. googletag.cmd.push A Matalan spokesperson said:“Following the change in government guidance to include Homeware as essential retail on May st, Matalan, as a Clothing and Homeware Retailer with a signicant Homeware business,has been preparing carefully for asafe andphased re-opening stores, culminating in the successful re-opening of a select group of trial stores in England in recent weeks.

St Mary’s have been involved with Ronan McLaughlin of Sustrans NI this year and it has continued during lockdown. His challenges incorporated into their weekly timetables for online learning.

Former professional cyclist and current sports presenter Daniel Lloyd called for the jersey to be made. Eurosport presenter Orla Chennaoui, a past pupil of St Mary’s, was ready to place her order. In no time, French blogger Justin Velo brought the design to le, prompting an increase in demand for the jersey to be made. Interest flooded in from all over the world. Conan had his hands full communicating with admirers from far and wide. Offers flooded in from a number of interested sporting bodies, wanting to bring his topical cycling jersey to le. googletag.cmd.push Conan is thrilled to announce that the famous sports design company Pactimo will produce his cycling jersey. Their clothing is worn by professional athletes, national champions and Olympians. Principal Corinne Coyle assures us, they are in good company with our Conan! “I was so excited when my jersey was being retweeted by so many people,” Conan told the County Derry Post “When I was designing the top, I thought the Covid- message, Keep your distance would be equally good for cyclists, as I know they often worry about how close motorists get to them when they are out on the roads. “So, as well as saving lives against the virus, the message could also save lives on our roads. My sister Cadhla is looking for some credit, as I used her markers to colour the jersey!” Pactimo have agreed to initially make two copies of the original design, one for Conan and one for the school. Exciting discussions are currently underway with Pactimo to decide how this brilliant design can best reach a wider audience and benefit others in the process. As this project continues to unfold, excitement is at an all-time high at St Mary’s PS Draperstowns Learning Hub. We can’t wait to see how this story develops and we anticipate many more adventures in June.

DUP Alderman Graham Warke said many people from the local area travelled  miles to Lisburn to visit the Lagan Valley Leisureplex which has a number of swimming pools and state-of-the-art facilities. He said Derry City and Strabane District Council should be looking to create a similar facility. Alderman Warke was speaking today at the councils monthly meeting during a discussion on the future of local leisure facilities. Sinn Fein councillor Aileen Mellon brought a motion before the meeting asking the council to note the public disappointment at the lack of progress to date to advance the construction and re-development of Templemore Sports Complex in Derry and Riversdale Leisure Centre in Strabane. googletag.cmd.push The motions stated: “This motion calls on Council to prioritise the development of those long outstanding projects by bringing forward a report to the Council meeting in September to include the identication of all funding options available and a timetable towards completion so that the Council can consider its options.” Alderman Warke told the meeting his party would support the motion but added that he believed the council should use the opportunity to look at ways of improving its leisure facilities even further. He said he had travelled with his family to the Lagan Valley Leisureplex because of the facilities. He said he knew other local families who had done the same. googletag.cmd.push Alderman Warke said the council now had an opportunity to look at creating a similar leisure facility which could attract thousands of people. He added that the council should aim big. In relation to Cllr Mellons motion, SDLP councillor John Boyle proposed an amendment which would replace the word prioritise with the word accelerate. Cllr Boyles amendment proposal was supported by  councillors and opposed by ten. The reworded motion was then passed unanimously at the meeting.

All admission to gardens and parklands will be by pre-booked ticket only. National Trust Director-General, Hilary McGrady, thanked members and supporters and urged them to help make the reopening a success. She said: “I am so thankful that our members and supporters have stood by us as we work through these unprecedented times. “We know they desperately want toto our places, and we need their support to do our vital conservation work to look after the coastline, countryside, rivers and properties in our care.” “Reopening is the first phase of our recovery, and we need our members and supporters to help us make this gradual transition a success so we can get back to offering nature, beauty and history for everyone.” Tickets can be booked on inidual property web pages and can be accessed via the National Trust website.

They are open from pm to pm, Monday to Friday.ldquoWhile we are open again we are operating under strict guidelines with one-ways systems in place, designated seating areas and a maximum of eight people in the church at any one time, he said.ldquoI had hoped to reintroduce a limited number of sacramentals such as confession and benediction in Kilcoo, as this parish have had very little in the way of services over the last few years due to a shortage of priests. However, diocesan officials have cautioned against it, just now.Fr McKinley, who has been parish priest at Kilmegan for ten years, continued: ldquoThe virus came upon us out to the blue. It was a whopping surprise to all of us. Thirty years of the Troubles didnrsquot close us down but I suppose we all just have to put up with it as these are unprecedented times.Despite the first steps being taken to open churches Fr McKinley cautioned it could be quite some time before the parishes could resume their normal schedule.ldquoSt Malachyrsquos in Castlewellan holds over  people. I foresee it wonrsquot be any time soon before we are able to facilitate anything like that number, said Fr McKinley has had to reschedule  weddings and postpone First Communions and confirmations until later in the year.He added: ldquoIt is an eerie and uncomfortable feeling to celebrate Mass in an empty church and I long for the day we will see our churches full to capacity once more.ldquoHowever, while the obligation to attend Sunday Mass has been temporarily lted Masses are still available on the parish webcam for everyone to view.Magheradroll Church of Ireland Church in Ballynahinch will be open for one hour each Thursday, starting next week.Canon Warren Russell, rector, said: ldquoI welcome the reopening of the church in line with the recommendations made by the Northern Ireland Assembly.ldquoWe will open from am to noon on a Thursday which coincides with market day in the town.ldquoWe want to reassure people that all possible safety measures will be in place to facilitate the opening and provide a quiet space for prayer and reflection once again.ldquoThere will be masks, disposable gloves and hand sanitiser available at the back of the church for people to use.Canon Russell, who has been rector for the past  years, added: ldquoWe will measure the response and review it again in a few weeks.

But with the COVID- restrictions Irsquove decided to take the challenge on Zwt to avoid any risk of burdening the health service.Proceeds from the challenge will go to the mental health charities Aware and Ballynahinch Counselling Services, also known as The Hub.ldquoOur lives have been turned upside down with the COVID- pandemic and many people are finding it dficult to cope with the changes, health concerns and isolation of it all, Alan continued.ldquoMental health issues can affect anyone and looking after our mental health is key to our overall emotional and physical wellbeing.ldquoSo far Irsquove raised almost pound and would really like to get to pound.

He then raised the alarm with their parents, Valerie and Declan senior, who rushed to be with their son.Paramedics were quickly on to the scene, but on the way to Belfastrsquos Royal Victoria Hospital , the teenager needed a le-saving blood transfusion due to his major internal injuries.The ambulance was met in Greyabbey by a doctor and the emergency helicopter team where the procedure was carried out before Declan continued on to hospital by air.The Year  student from St Patrickrsquos Grammar School, Downpatrick, later underwent eight hours of surgery to save him.Two and a half weeks later, Declan was back at home recovering with his family and vowing to get back on to a tractor as soon as he is fit and able.Eoin, who also attends St Patrickrsquos Grammar School in Downpatrick, wants to give another person a chance of survival.He has started a Just Giving appeal to fund the provincersquos helicopter emergency medical serviceand raise at least the pound, it costs to run it per day. The family has now raised nearly pound,, including gt aid for the service as their thanks for saving Declan.Mrs Keating says her son has a ldquolong road to recovery with rehabilitation and further surgery down the line but they are ldquoforever indebted to the air ambulance and the entire hospital team who cared for Declan. She said surgeons told her that he was ldquoextremely lucky as the accident could have had fatal consequences.Reliving the morning of the accident when Declan mdash whose nickname is lsquoThe Milkmanrsquo mdash and Eoin had just left home to go their unclersquos farm for the milking at am, is still traumatic for Mrs Keating.She said: ldquoI donrsquot like to think about what happened to Declan. For what happened and how it happened, itrsquos nothing short of a miracle for him to be here. We were told thathis injuries had been one centimetre one way or the other, it could have been a lot worst. There were terrible injuries but at least there was no injury to his head or spine head.ldquoIt was just a freak accident and hopefully nothing like this will ever happen again. However, Declan has told me that he will be back in the tractor as soon as he can walk.Mrs Keating said Declan had passed his tractor driving test late last year and was used to driving their tractor to her brotherrsquos nearby dairy farm.ldquoThe boys had set off from home and were literally just yards down the road when the accident happened,ldquo she continued. ldquoWe are not sure how but Declan said that one minute he was driving and the next he was flung out the side door onto the road and the tractor ran over him.ldquoThe tractor continued moving and Eoin managed to get it stopped and immediately checked on Declan and called his daddy.ldquoDeclan was fully conscious and realised he was badly injured. He checkedhis legs and arms worked. He thought that his pelvis was broken and wanted to seehe was paralysed and somehow managed to get himself up and walk over to the other verge before his legs gave way. He was sitting up when me and his father arrived at the scene.Mrs Keating said that while both Declan and Eoin were naturally shocked by what had happened, she was proud of both her sonsrsquo presence of mind during the horric accident.ldquoEoin called us  seconds after the accident and we were there within minutes, she said. ldquoDeclan was alert the whole time when the ambulance and paramedics arrived.Mrs Keating and her husband followed behind the ambulance as Declan was rushed to the RVH. An emergency doctor met the ambulance in Kircubbin before continuing on. However, the parents feared the worst when the ambulance pulled over at the tennis courts in Greyabbey.ldquoThe doctor jumped out of the ambulance and told us not to worry, Declan was OK. He was going to give him a blood transfusion as he was losing blood internally and the air ambulance was on its way. Literally, it seemed the helicopter arrived just seconds later and Declan was transferred by air then to the hospital.Mrs Keating said that the blood transfusion was vital to Declan at that time, adding: ldquoFor remote communities where we live, the air ambulance is an essential service. They only have started carrying blood supplies earlier this year. If he hadnrsquot have gotten the blood, he may not have been here.Declanrsquos injuries were found to be signicant. He sustained a broken pelvis, perforated bladder and bowel, a collapsed lung, three broken ribs, internal bleeding and bruising.Mrs Keating said: ldquoThe accident and emergency doctor said he would have expected anyone  to be in a critical condition with the range of injuries but Declan was in a serious condition which showed us what a fighter he was and he wasnrsquot letting it get the better of him. We took some comfort from this at that time.She said that three teams of specialist surgeons operated on Declan for more than eight hours to deal with his major injuries.ldquoThe surgeons were extremely worried about Declan and I kept askinghe was going to be OK. The surgeon would only say that he was out of immediate danger and that the next - hours would be critical, she said.Declan spent three nights in intensive care before moving into another ward. Mrs Keating said that the care Declan received was ldquofirst-class and spoke of how caring the medics were to their plight.ldquoDeclanrsquos father and I wanted to be with him through the night. At one point the ward sister called us over and offered us the sleep room the surgeons use for rest during their sht. They gave up that room for us for three nights so we could be with Declan and we saw just how busy they all were. We thank them from the bottom of our hearts for their kindness.The family say they were overwhelmed by the support and well wishes they received from their local community and their donations to the appeal.Mrs Keating added: ldquoDeclan will recover and he canrsquot wait to be up again at am every morning to help on the farm as he just loves the farming le. The air ambulance was the legacy of Dr John Hinds [the late emergency medicine specialist] and it would be remiss of me not to remember him and what he did for others during his le and his campaign to get the service. We are forever indebted to him and the air ambulance service for saving Declanrsquos le.ldquoRegarding farm accidents in Northern Ireland, we know we are one of the more fortunate families and we are so thankful. I hope people continue to give money as itrsquos a vital service for the whole of Northern Ireland.To donate go to www.justgiving fundraising eoin-keating..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th May 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C May 27%2C 2000  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH ndash Residents at a Ballynahinch housing estate are due to hold talks with a range of key officials this morning in a bid to raise the profile of the area.People from the Hillcrest Drive area in the town are due to meet with senior officials from the Housing Executive, Down Council and the Department of Environment.The meeting comes in the wake of recent vandalism attacks in the Windmill Street area which damaged a number of cars, homes and business properties.Prior to this morningrsquos meeting, residents met with local councillor Anne McAleenan to discuss their concerns and prepare for the crucial talks with the representatives of the statutory agencies.Last weekend, the local councillor discussed with residents their concerns and advised them to draw up a strategy and work closely with the ious agencies who could provide them with key assistance.One of the main concerns is an area at the top of Hillcrest Drive which residents would like to see the Department of Environment cleaning up to enhance the image of the area.In addition, residents are calling for environmental improvements and also believe sealing off the rear of the estate from the lough area could prevent trouble at weekends.KILLYLEAGH ndash The impact a young Killyleagh footballer is having on the international soccer stage was praised at Monday nightrsquos meeting of Down Council.Killyleagh councillor Sam Osborne highlighted the achievements of  year-old David Healy who marked his Northern Ireland debut with a brace against Luxembourg and another strike against Malta.Mr Osborne said the young Manchester United star was a great ambassador for the area and last week received the international personality of the year award at the annual Northern Ireland soccer writers awards sponsored by Guinness.The local councillor said Healyrsquos success for Manchester United and the Northern Ireland team was a great boost for the area.ARDGLASS ndash An Ardglass couple are waging a war against hostile waters in an attempt to circumnavigate Ireland for charity.Rhonda and Vincent Kearney set sail in their -foot boat, Invinceable, on Saturday to make their way around Ireland in a bid to raise pound, to help buy a new leboat.And while the duo is no stranger to challenge, both sailors admit they face a fearsome feat.Vincent is a former Red Arrow and a stunt motorcyclist, while his we, Rhonda, is the former British clay pigeon shooting champion, but nothing, they say, could prepare them for the journey they are now making.ldquoWe only concocted the plan three months ago and thought we had better act quickly before we have time to think about what we are letting ourselves in for, said Vincent.ldquoI have been sailing on and off for about  years and have owned boats for quite some time, but it will still be extremely dficult, particularly with the dreadful weather forecasts we have been given.

Even so, there is a palpable sense of joy among the golfing fraternity.St Patrickrsquos Golf Club in Downpatrick resumed last Wednesday and the captain, Robert McCausland, said he ldquowas absolutely delighted.ldquoThe club is very pleased to be up and running again, he remarked.ldquoWe are very grateful to our green keepers who continued with their work during the lockdown and have delivered a golf course in magnicent condition for the members to enjoy.Mr McCausland said the club was now open to new members and that there were a ldquonumber of very attractive offers in place for those who may wish to take up the game of golf.He added: ldquoThe time sheets over the last few days are quite full and the car park has been busy with lots of smiling, happy faces about the club.Wednesday also saw the reopening of Ardglass Club and Paul Vaughan, the clubrsquos director of golf, said the course has been full up ever since.ldquoOur members have been playing in three-balls and going off every  minutes. We havenrsquot had a spare space since we re-opened, he said.ldquoEveryone is delighted to be back and itrsquos great to see so many people about. I think our members were glad to get out of the house and back on to the golf course.ldquoWe have a marshal at the front gate and the members are obeying the all the guidelines so that they can play casual golf.Mr Vaughan said the loss of visitors represented the loss of a major source of income for the club, but hoped this would be offset by new members.ldquoWe have had a lot of enquiries about new members, but visitorsrsquo green fees are a huge part of our business, he said.ldquoHopefully, we will be able to salvage something towards the end of the season and things willto something near normal next year.At Spa Golf Club, near Ballynahinch, which re-opened on Friday, the captain, Gordon Martin said everyone was ldquoexcited at the expectation of getting back playing in a sport we love so much.He went on: ldquoI am very aware of the sacrices many people have made in our communities that allows us to get to this point. May I on behalf of Spa Golf Club members and their families thank all the heros in out communities.ldquoSpa recognises the great responsibility golf has in being one of the first sports to re-open after the lockdown and fully intends to adhere to all the protocols agreed by our governing body.He said the club had been fortunate to be able to keep some greens staff working at the club over the lockdown period.ldquoThe driest April on record put extra burdens on green keeping staff in terms of additional watering and essential maintenance. But we are pleased to say the course is looking just magnicent.Mr Martin also said it has been a dficult period from a financial point of view with not many golf clubs being eligible for any signicant assistance under the ious Covid finance packages.Bright Castle Golf Club, which is privately owned by the Ennis family, has also been busy since it re-opened last Thursday.ldquoThe course is looking magnicent and the members are enjoying it, said Linda Ennis.ldquoItrsquos been a tough few months, but wersquove worked hard to keep the course maintained to a high standard and itrsquos really looking the part.ldquoThe members are glad to be out playing and itrsquos great to see so many happy faces.ldquoThe last time the course was closed this long was about six or seven years ago and that was because of heavy show. It was a bit disheartening having the place empty in April and earlier this month when the weather was lovely.She added: We rely on visitors and societies for a good portion of our income, but we have had enquiries about new memberships, which is good news for us.Crossgar Golf Club president Paddy Bell heaped praise on the clubrsquos green keeping staff for having the course in great shape and also revealed there has been a surge in new members.ldquoWe have had a big uptake in new members in the past few weeks, which will help compensate for the lack of green fees, he said.ldquoWe re-opened last Wednesday and itrsquos fantastic to see people playing again. It gives you hope that everything may soonto normality.ldquoThe course is in great condition and thatrsquos due to the green keeping staff who have worked hard during the lockdown. All praise is due them.Temple Golf Club has also been inundated with membership enquiries. Since it re-opened last week it has welcomed  new junior members.Owner Tim Martin said the pandemic lockdown couldnrsquot have come at a worse time with membership subions due on April .ldquoAs like every other club, our income disappeared overnight. We depend heavily on the income from the restaurant and bar and our cash flow dwindled rapidly, Mr Martin said.ldquoWe were only able to continue paying our staff each week because of some of the loyal members who paid their fees on time. To them we are very grateful. This kept us ticking over until the government job retention scheme kicked in.Mr Martin said the members had been very accommodating and were adhering to the guidelines and protocols.ldquoWe look forward to progressing into the next stage, but will have to make sure it will be financially viable to open the restaurant and bar when the time comes, he added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th May 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Loughinisland man Gerry praises Move More initiative  ","story":"THERE are not many who have been to the top of the majestic Efel Tower in France.But Loughinisland man Gerry Morgan is one of the lucky few who have made it to the summit to snatch a birdrsquos eye view of the stunning Parisian landscape.That was  years ago when he opted for the easy option by popping into the lt and by-passing the , steps.

We also do sit-ups and squats.After the exercise regime it is time for a coffee and a chat, which all the Move More participants thoroughly enjoy.ldquoWe are literally one big family as many of us have been through cancer and fortunately come out the other side. In a way, illness has brought us together, continued Gerry.But everything changed in March when the arrival of the coronavirus forced Newry, Mourne and Down Council to close all its leisure centres and public buildings.To keep everyone involved, Laura mdash one of  Move More coordinators funded by Macmillan in every council area across the province to support those living with cancer mdash created an app to enable people to keep in touch remotely and exercise at home.She also recently unveiled a new initiative encouraging people living with cancer to virtually climb their way around some of the worldrsquos top landmarks to stay active during the coronavirus pandemic, without leaving the comfort of their own homes.Laura said that while Move More members were not able to physically travel the world at the moment, there was no limit to their imagination.Participants were given the choice of a number of buildings to scale, including Londonrsquos imposing Big Ben.Not surprisingly, Gerry opted to head back to the top of the Efel Tower, only this time he didnrsquot have to leave his front door during the virtual challenge. He set off at a leisurely pace and over three days and, with a little je nous said quoi, made it to the top.ldquoI could have completed the climb in two days, but decided to do it over three instead, he joked. ldquoI really enjoyed doing it, but miss being with my Move More friends.Gerry is pleased that while face-to-face classes and appointments are not possible, Laura has been working on positive, fun and interesting ways to keep programme participants motivated and active in the comfort of their own surroundings.He is also looking forward to getting back to the Down Leisure Centre when it is safe to do so and the pandemic is no more.Recalling the first time he went to the centre following his referral, Gerry admits that he was a little apprehensive.ldquoI distinctly remember driving to Downpatrick and was so nervous that I almost turned the car around to go back home, he said. ldquoBut I continued on and am so glad that I did. It has been an overwhelmingly positive experience for me, one that I thoroughly enjoy.ldquoI was a bit down for a few years after losing my lung and the chemotherapy, but getting involved with the Move More programme changed everything.

are recommending that a proposal for a major new housing development comprising  new homes at an  acre site on the outskirts of Ballynahinch should proceed.Their recommendation to approve plans for a mixed development comprising a range of detached, semi detached and townhouses on the Lisburn Road will be discussed at next weekrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Planning Committee.This particular committee has not met since March as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and to comply with social distancing requirements, the planning meeting will be held at Newry Leisure Centre next Wednesday.In papers submitted ahead of the meeting, the proposed development site mdash which comprises a number of fields mdash is described as ldquoirregular in shape, with the recently constructed Lime Trees, Edengrove and Kinedale developments in close proximity.Planners say that the site earmarked for the new homes is located on the ldquoinner edge of Ballynahinchrsquos development limits, with the area zoned for housing in the Down Area Plan.It is also confirmed in the planning papers that initially, plans were lodged to build  homes, but the figure was subsequently revised after planners expressed concern.The Department for Infrastructure is also content that the proposed housing scheme can be accommodated within the existing roads network.Northern Ireland Water said there is available capacity within the existing sewerage system to cope with the planned new homes, while planning permission has been granted for a new sewage pumping station on adjacent land.The papers indicate that the planning application was submitted in March  and that a number of objections to the proposed development were lodged.Other objections to the proposed housing scheme centre around traffic and access arrangements, claims that the application had not been properly advertised and insufficient neighbourhood notication.Objectors also pointed to the lack of a so-called planting buffer and the ldquolack of effort to integrate an open space area adjacent Ballynahinch River into the proposed development.Another objector highlighted the schemersquos ldquoinappropriate density, arguing that it is greater than other developments closer to the town.The detail of a noise impact assessment submitted to planners has also been questioned, but Newry Mourne and Down Council environmental health officials have expressed satisfaction with the document.The planning papers reveal that an acoustic mound has been incorporated in to the proposed development, with landscaped proposed throughout to mitigate any noise impact on adjacent land uses.In addition, the papers confirm that there is a Tree Preservation Order covering the site and while a number of trees have already been felled, this issue is the subject of an enforcement case.Planners say the proposed development is ldquoappropriate to the character and topography of the site and that ldquoadequate provision is made for public and private open space and landscaped areas as an integral part of the development.They also state that where appropriate, planted areas of discrete groups of trees will be required along site boundaries ldquoin order to soften the visual impact of the development and assist in its integration with the surrounding area, with adequate provision made for parking.Planners say that the development will not have an ldquounacceptable, adverse effect on existing or proposed properties in terms of overlooking, loss of light, overshadowing, noise or other disturbance.Next weekrsquos planning committee meeting takes place two days after the local authorityrsquos annual meeting when it is expected that Rowallane councillor, Robert Burgess, will be

It will help boost the entire thoroughbred industry.ldquoWe very much understand that racing will be behind closed doors for the foreseeable future and will work diligently to comply with the very strict protocols put in place to ensure the safety of all those attending.The July date was announced by the Board of Horse Racing Ireland, which met recently and agreed a number of fixtures for theof race meetings.The first meeting is at Naas on June , with National Hunt racing resuming at Limerick on June .For the first three weeks, racing will be restricted to nine racecourses which are more centrally located to minimise travel distances and which also have higher stable capacities given the requirement for one stable per horse under the new protocols.All the fixtures will take place under the strict protocols published by Horse Racing Ireland.Brian Kavanagh, chief executive of Horse Racing Ireland, said: ldquoWe are grateful to everybody for the patience they have shown during this very dficult time and we will provide every opportunity for essential personnel to fully understand and implement theto racing protocols.ldquoWe expect there to be signicant demand for horses to run once we resume, and we will aim to provide opportunities across the spectrum of age, gender and ability.ldquoWe will have missed  weeksrsquo racing which will take some time to catch up. We intend to do this over the course of the rest of the year rather than immediately.Meanwhile, golf has ed after a two-month lockdown.The Stormont Executive gave clubs the green light to open up last week subject to strict guidelines. Clubhouses remained closed and no visitors are permitted.Tennis clubs have also been given permission to re-open, again subject to protocols being put into operation.However, other sports remain shut down.Restrictions on Gaelic games are likely to stay in place until July  and there will be no inter-county games until October at the earliest.The start to the cricket season has been delayed, but this week the Northern Cricket Union said it hoped to be in a position soon to announce the first step in ato training..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th May 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Restrictions begin to ease  ","story":"THERE will be a major easing of lockdown restrictions across the district from today.A number of country parks, harbours, tennis courts and beach car parks will be reopened by Newry, Mourne and Down Council, but strict social distancing measures remain in place with the local authority warning thatthey are not observed, the facilities will be closed.The move to ease some lockdown measures comes after the local authority recently reopened the districtrsquos household recycling centres.But despite the easing of some measures, council campsites, public toilets and cafeacutes across the district remain closed, while mobile vendors are also banned from trading at beaches and forest parks.At last weekrsquos online meeting between the councilrsquos senior management team and the leaders of the local authorityrsquos main parties, agreement to start easing some of the lockdown measures was agreed.Also from today, mountain bike and horse riding trails and the car parks at Castlewellan Forest Park and Tollymore Forest Park will reopen.Public access to the forest parks was agreed two weeks ago, but the car parks remained closed, sparking complaints from residents who live close to both facilities about the number of cars parked along approach roads, hampering sight lines which posed a health and safety risk.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is taking direction from the Northern Ireland Executive on how it slowly starts to ease the lockdown, insisting that progress is determined by public health advice.Two weeks ago, the NI Executive published a five-phase blueprint for lting restrictions but it did not include a timeframe, insisting that it will be guided by scientic and medical advice before it agrees to lt any further restrictions.Local politicians say that they are keen to seen the pathway to recovery progressed, but are reluctant to move too quickly as the virus still has a presence.They are also conscious that with the warm weather predicted to stay, soaring temperatures could place pressure on the districtrsquos hotspots where visitor numbers could increase, as was the case in Newcastle last weekend.With the exception of people who are shielding, visits to immediate family are allowed indoors where social distancing is possible, with churches permitted to open for private prayer, with appropriate social distancing and cleaning of shared contact hard surfaces.However, with groups of four to six people who do not share a household now able to meet outdoors while maintaining social distancing, the local authority feels it is time to allow access to beaches, country parks, harbours and tennis courts.Politicians say they are conscious that easing the lockdown restrictions in one go could push up the all-important R-number, which measures the average rate of transmission.Councillors say the last thing they want is for a situation to arise which would result in having to reimpose lockdown measures and lose the hard won gains that have been made to date.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke and his Rowallane counterpart, Billy Walker, have welcomed the progress being made, but issued a reminder that there will be no leguard facilities at Tyrella beach. However, signs will be in place advising people where it is not safe to swim.The politicians say that council staff will be on duty at beaches, country parks and harbours to ensure required social distancing measures are adhered to. In addition, the number of visitors at the ious facilities will also be monitored, with staff carrying out regular cleaning duties.Cllr Clarke confirmed that local authority staff will be present to engage with the public around guidelines on social distancing and facility information.He said: ldquoWhile these measures will no doubt be welcomed, I would encourage people to be responsible and show consideration for others by continuing to follow the public health guidelines on social distancing and hand hygiene.Cllr Walker said the past two months have been particularly dficult for people across the district.ldquoIt has not been easy and we all hope that people will act responsibly when the beaches, country parks and harbours are reopened. The onus is on them to obey the rules in place which are designed to keep them safe and help prevent the spread of the virus, he continued.Cllr Walker said there were plans to put one-way systems in place, where appropriate, but that all public toilets would remain closed.He added: ldquoI hope that over the coming weeks other facilities will reopen. The fact that we can open beaches and country parks is as a result of local peoplersquos commitment to stay at home to prevent the spread of coronavirus.ldquoWe are making progress and for that to continue it is essential that people continue to adhere to public health advice.

I help my clients achieve their goals by finding that balancebetween nutrition, diet, and exercise.ldquoSome clients, and a lot of men actually, have come to me with problems with anxiety and gut health. For everyone to look after their gut health is something Irsquom verypassionate about.ldquoLast week was Mental Health Awareness Week and I would like people to understand the connection thatwe are feeding our bodies processed food, it can directly impact on our brains and our mental health.Apart from working on her own health and studying to understand what diet and nutrition works for her mdash shersquos vegetarian and stays away from grains, apart from oats and barley mdash Stacey was heavily influenced by holistic approach to health during her late fatherrsquos illness.Mr John Murtagh died in  at the age of  after being diagnosed with oesophageal cancer.He was initially told that he has only six months to live and Stacey and her family believe that he helped extend his le through his devotion to nutrition, juicing, mediation and his deepreligious faith.ldquoOnce we heard the news, we researched everything we could to help him nutritionally and holistically, explained Stacey. ldquoWe believe  per cent his faith and his dedication to nutrition and meditation was definitely pertinent to his added time with us. His oncologists thought he was a miracle.ldquoI think it was through what we experienced with my father and my own journey that I knew I wanted to help others nutritionally and how to find their inner happiness and peace.In , she and her brother, Jonathon, climbed Mount Kilimanjaro in memory of her dad to raise nearly pound, for Marie Curie.Staceyrsquos own gut health problems were finally diagnosed while she was working in Dubai where she was able to avail of private health service through her job.ldquoI eventually found out that I have visceral hypersensitivity which is typical of IBS and means that the nerves endings in my intestines are exasperated by stress, she said.ldquoMy doctor was very interested in holistic therapies and when he found out that I was doing a lot of HITT [high intensity interval training] but still not losing weight, he recommended switching to lower intensity training such as yoga and Pilates. The dference it has made to my le, along with yoga and a balanced nutritional diet had been incredible.According to Stacey, an open mind and a willingness to test out certain foods to see what triggers your condition are essential for clients to get the right outcome.ldquoJust traditional medicine alone ndash and I would never encourage anyone not to go with traditional medicine ndash is not always the answer. Itrsquos a partnership approach with traditional side and holistic. But most importantly its listening to your own body and what feels right, said Stacey.ldquoClients need to bring a huge trust in the coaching and we really need to work between three to six months and delve quite deep into the personrsquos le to see how we can work together.ldquoIrsquom a big advocate for staying away from fad diets mdash they never worked for me. I believe you have to work to be happy and content within yourself and this is helped by making the right lestyle choices for yourself. Itrsquos about finding balance and what works for you as an inidual and settling into that lestyle.After having a fixed-term contract as a marketing manager before the lockdown, Stacey is no longer working and thinks that this might be the time to push through with yoga and heath coaching full-time.While offering free online yoga classes , Stacey is also offering a complimentary -minute health coaching interview.For further information visit www. staceymurtagh..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th May 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Supporters’ club members select their favourite Man Utd team  ","story":"LOCAL Manchester United fans have picked their favourite Reds team of the Premier League era.Members of the Downpatrick Manchester United Supportersrsquo Club were asked to pick their favourite players since the start of the Premier League in .They were tasked with selecting a best eleven along with five subs.

The Passionist Community provides free access to the trails for the benefit of the local community and this is greatly appreciated by the people of Crossgar in particular.Cllr Andrews described Tobar Mhuire as a ldquohaven of peace and tranquillity and appealed to people to stay away from the areas highlighted.He continued: ldquoNo one would want to see public access to the grounds prohibited and the Passionist Community has made this clear.ldquoIt is important that visitors recognise that Tobar Mhuire is home to elderly and vulnerable people, some of whom are self-isolating, and must not do anything that would potentially put their safety at risk. People can continue to use these beautul grounds, but they must recognise the needs of the people who reside there.Cllr Andrews said people in Crossgar were delighted that members of the Passionist Community lived among them and hoped that by everyone following public health advice, it would not be long before some ldquosemblance of normality is restored for everyone..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th May 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"UUP’s McKee takes vice chairman role  ","story":"ULSTER Unionist councillor Harold McKee has been selected as the new vice-chairman of Newry, Mourne and Down Council.The race for the deputyrsquos position was between the Mournes councillor mdash a former South Down MLA ndash and Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess.Cllr McKeersquos appointment comes weeks after the SDLP confirmed that another Mournes councillor, Laura Devlin, would be the districtrsquos new first citizen, succeeding Sinn Feinrsquos Charlie Casey.Cllr McKee said that it was an ldquoimmense privilege to have been selected as the local authorityrsquos vice-chairman and is looking forward to his new role.First elected to the former Newry and Mourne Council in , Cllr McKee said he has a proven track record of delivery for the benefit of the local community.ldquoI believe in hard work, honesty and accountability in working with local people to raise and solve issues that they care about in their daily lives, said the incoming vice-chairman.ldquoI know that the community is living through unprecedented times and many people are under huge pressure.

Unfortunately many other projects Ashling had planned for this year have currently been placed on hold.She said: “Last year I received an ACES award from the Arts Council and I’ve been using that to develop my own picturebook texts in Irish and English. The Covid- pandemic has meant that the publication of those is now delayed but on the positive side, it has given me the time to think about how my experiences and skills may be able to help others.”Thanks to the Arts Council and the National Lottery players Ashling is planning to develop a series of online videos showing the art process behind her work, painting, drawing, and printmaking.She explained: ‘‘The point of this project is to skill share, show some of the process, and engage with the community through free digital content that is easily accessible for people remotely.”Damian Smyth, head of Literature, Arts Council of Northern Ireland added: ‘‘Artists have been among the hardest hit groups, with projects delayed, venues closed and events cancelled for the foreseeable future. All of this is having a major impact on our cultural and creative lives. ‘‘Over the next few months, I’m really looking forward to seeing how Ashling’s project develops, encouraging others who maybe have an idea they wish to develop or perhaps want to reconnect with their creative side to, quite literally, get back to the drawing board.”*Ashling’s tutorials will be available on www.ashlinglindsay. \"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

in one of his articles that such a progressive town as Penarth was without an operatic and dramatic society, writes Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Societypresident, Mary Gardner.The response to his outcry was quickly taken up and within three weeks the Penarth Operatic Society was formed.The Societyrsquos first production was Gilbert  Sullivanrsquos Iolanthe, played at The Hippodrome which later burnt down, and what a glittering opening evening it must have been as the audience wore evening dress.The review featured next day read, ldquoBrilliant Initial Performance.More newsVale council issues

new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One,

a special delivery of a food pack to Bro Thomas Alderdice in Kilkeel : Other rd PartyDistrict and private lodges have provided food hampers for its own members and other vulnerable people in the community, donated to frontline NHS staff, raised cash for charity and boosted PPE provision in the area.Right Worshipful Brother Denis Watson, county grand master, said: “The money we’ve raised has gone towards assisting all communities and, as the largest community-based organisation within Co Armagh, it shows that the institution is so much more than just a parading body and has had a very positive impact in all areas of the county.“Almost as soon as the impact of the coronavirus pandemic became known and lockdown was implemented, the  district lodges and many private lodges in Co Armagh made spontaneous and impressive efforts to assist in their local communities.Rt Wor Bro Denis Watson, County Grand Master, and Wor Bro Jeffrey Lawson, Deputy County Grand Secretary, presenting the cheque for £, to Jane McKimm, Head of Communications, and Helen ONeill, Director of Finance.at the Southern Health and Social Care Trust, for specic use at Craigavon Area Hospital : Other rd Party“The tremendous response from the County Grand Lodge was immediate and the monies came from existing funds, with no member asked to contribute, unless to do so in a voluntary capacity.”Support included preparing food hampers for elderly and vulnerable brethren, and others in the community, making donations of food and goodies to frontline hospital staff, making monetary donations to charities, and providing PPE to nursing homes and community nursing services.A substantial donation of £, was made to the Southern Health and Social Care Trust, specically for Craigavon Area Hospital.Mr Watson said: “One of the first things put in place by the County Grand Lodge was the issue of a daily prayer from our County Grand Chaplain, Wor Bro Rev Dr Alan McCann, to members by email and posting on the Museum of Orange Heritage at Sloan’s House, Loughgall Facebook page.County Grand Lodge Officers made a donation of £, to the Southern Area Hospice as they are currently unable to fundraise, and this was presented to Anne Dalzell, hospice representative, at Sloan’s House : Other rd Party“The response has been very favourable in these trying times, with the daily reach on Facebook being between  and over ,.”He added: “The museum at Sloan’s House was very proud to display the Grand Lodge banner of support for the NHS and other frontline services on the front of the building and encouraged young people to send in rainbow pictures for display on the front windows of the premises. “The County Grand Lodge central committee has been able to liaise by having regular Zoom conference meetings and this has proved very beneficial in maintaining contact and co-ordination.” Reflecting on the work he said: “It’s a very commendable effort by the Orange brethren of Co Armagh and of course this is being replicated in other counties within the jurisdiction of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland.”\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\"

virtually.By The NewsroomThursday, th May , : pm\"\"The proposal to look at the feasibility of hosting certain events remotely was raised at Tuesday evening’s virtual meeting as members discussed a report recommending all Council led events are cancelled until the end of August.Council’s Head of Tourism, Artsand Culture, Brian Johnston, advised members there will be a further report in June that will give consideration to events held until the end of December .The report, circulated to members before the meeting, states that at present, events involving gatherings of people are not permitted and it is anticipated that when they are, other controls such as social distancing will be required.Some of the events recommended for cancellation include Buskfest in Banbridge Town Centre on June , Armed Forces Day in Banbridge Town Centre and Rugby Club on June  and the Seven Hills Blues Festival in Armagh which runs from August -.Other events for later in the year, including the Georgian Festival in Armagh and Halloween events across the borough and Christmas and twilight markets are all marked for further consideration.When asked by Banbridge Sinn Fein councillor, Kevin Savage why an estimate of council savings was not includedin the report Mr Johnston said Council would have spent £, on the events it now proposes to cancel.However, he did advise that not all of that will be saved by Council as some contractual obligations will need to be met.SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon raisedthe possibility of holding some of these events virtually.“We are encouraging businesses to do things online,” said the Armagh representative.“If we could look at some of these events happening between now and Christmas and seethere is an opportunity to do similar with them, could we have that explored and brought back in due course ”Lurgan councillor Liam Mackle said: “I would be very happy with some virtual events taking place in the months ahead.”The Sinn Fein representative then proposed that Council officers explore this idea and report back in due course with the proposal seconded by Councillor O’Hanlon.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading
