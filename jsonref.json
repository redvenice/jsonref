But a few — such as Paula — won’t.Dr Irshaad Ebrahim, a specialist neuro-psychiatrist and clinical director at the London Sleep Centre, says Paula is far from alone in suffering from ‘sleep inertia — a condition in which the brain’s drive for sleep overwhelms the drive for wakefulness’.‘There could be a number of causes, from an underlying disorder, such as sleep apnoea, or problems with sleep quality so that the brain feels it needs to stay asleep to get a sufficient amount,’ says Dr Ebrahim.‘Otherwise, it might be down to a circadian rhythm disorder, which puts those affected into a deep sleep phase — which usually happens in the first two to three hours of the night — at the wrong part of the sleep cycle.’Paula did seek help from her GP a couple of years ago, after sleeping through a day’s work when Mark was not around to wake her, and after blood tests came back normal, was given a clean bill of health.Since then, she’s tried everything from going to bed early, to exercising in the evening, meditating, using a sun lamp and even leaving the curtains open. Nothing works.         She finds it hard to accept the severe fatigue syndrome syndrome because once up and about, she is very active, working as a fitness coach, mentoring women in their homes, via the internet, all over the worldMost evenings, she turns in at around 10pm and has to be physically dragged from sleep ten hours later, at 8am, often after music producer Mark, 41, has spent more than an hour trying to wake her.Paula has had problems waking for as long as she can remember. Her mother says that, even as a baby and toddler, she could ‘sleep round the clock’ and it was always a huge problem getting her up for school in the mornings.Although her loved ones try to be understanding, her nocturnal habits have been a source of great tension over the years.Six years ago, Paula had enjoyed a night out with her sister, Petra, who was staying with her, and a group of friends. Towards the end of the evening, Paula — who hadn’t been drinking — was ready to go home, while Petra wanted to stay a little later. So Paula caught a taxi home, fully expecting to still be awake by the time her sister returned, so she could let her in.When Petra got back, however, Paula was already fast asleep and, despite banging on the door, until a neighbour threatened to ring the police, and calling her mobile 50 times, Petra could not rouse her.‘There were no hotels nearby, so my poor sister ended up spending the night in a photobooth at a nearby train station,’ says Paula, still shamefaced at the memory. ‘It was January and by the time I opened the door to her the following day she was like a drowned rat and frozen to the bone.‘She was so angry she slapped me across the face and didn’t speak to me for weeks. In fact, it’s still a bone of contention between us as she can’t understand how anyone could sleep through all that.’         Paula Stewart, 38, is \u0027entirely reliant on my partner to physically wake me, otherwise I would, quite literally, sleep all day\u0027. As a student, she managed to sleep through an alarm and evacuation of her residencePaula has also left her business partner, Layla, in the lurch by sleeping the day away, instead of turning up for meetings she has arranged at their offices.‘Layla has always been understanding, up to a point,’ says Paula. ‘But it’s so embarrassing having to admit that the reason I’ve let people down is because I can’t do that most basic thing that others seem to find so easy and wake up in the mornings.’Left to her own devices, she can sleep for an unbroken 36 hours, although she says she never wakes feeling refreshed.One weekend last year when Mark was away, she slept through the whole of Saturday — going to bed at 11.30pm on Friday night and not waking until 9.30am on Sunday. She was shocked to discover she’d lost a day when she came to.She felt dehydrated, and needed the loo, but neither of those discomforts had disturbed her enough to wake her.Paula has always assumed she was alone with her sleep problems, but it turns out there are others like her.Mother-of-two Liz Dowse, 38, from Chelmsford, Essex, says chronically heavy sleeping has dogged her entire life. Even as a toddler she would sleep until midday.Every night she sets 15 alarms on her mobile phone, which she keeps right beside her bed, then sleeps through each one in turn.It is only because husband, Matt, 42, a manager for a dry-cleaning machinery firm, repeatedly shouts at her until she’s physically up and standing by the bed, that she manages to function, and embrace the day at all. The whole process can take up to an hour. ‘Thankfully Matt is understanding of what we refer to as my “condition”.         ‘Other people may think I’m just idle, but when I fall asleep it’s honestly like I go into an unconscious state and, when I finally wake up, I’m in a sheer panic, with no idea what day or time it is.’Unsurprisingly, it fell to Matt to wake his wife to feed their children — Teddy, 13, and Francesca, eight — when they were babies.There have been embarrassing episodes when she’s been away from home, too. One night, Liz — who hardly ever drinks alcohol, in case it exacerbates her sleep problems, and is not on any medication — was working away and staying in a hotel where the fire alarm went off.While every other guest came to — it’s hard to imagine how anyone wouldn’t, given that it was also accompanied by the bedside phone ringing and ceiling lights flashing — and evacuated the hotel, Liz was totally oblivious.‘I finally woke to find several firefighters around my bed,’ she recalls. ‘It was so humiliating. I could see from all the missed calls that my boss at the time, who was also staying at the hotel, had been repeatedly calling my mobile.’Liz, a size 6 to 8, has had various blood tests and health checks to rule out such things as an underactive thyroid or anaemia, which could make her tired and has been told by one doctor that she has ‘severe fatigue syndrome’.Having Googled it and only been able to find ‘chronic fatigue syndrome’ — a condition said to render sufferers exhausted the whole time — she finds it hard to accept that as a possible diagnosis because once up and about, she is very active, working as a fitness coach, mentoring women in their homes, via the internet, all over the world.Dr Neil Stanley, resident expert for Sleepstation, an online programme to tackle insomnia, has another theory. When we sleep, we go through various cycles of deep and lighter sleep.While most people are difficult to wake during their deep sleep phase, when the body and brainwaves slow down, these normally occur in the middle of the night, and few experience it so close to the end of a cycle.         There is an increasing number of women who suffer sleep (stock image) inertia - \u0027a condition in which the brain’s drive for sleep overwhelms the drive for wakefulness’, according to Dr Irshaad Ebrahim, a specialist neuro-psychiatrist and clinical director at the London Sleep Centre‘So it may be that these women are not in deep sleep but in dreaming sleep and the signal from their alarm is not sufficiently intrusive to wake them, because they might just incorporate that noise into their dream,’ says Dr Stanley.Lynette Morse, 38, from Glasgow, who has missed foreign holidays and family funerals — as well as sleeping through an earthquake — feels she has tried everything in her power to be able to get out of bed in the mornings.Having been to her GP numerous times about her problem, to no avail, kept diaries of everything she does and eats, changed her routines, including the times she goes to bed and aims to get up, she is wholly reliant on partner of eight years. Cameron, a careers adviser, to wake her.He sets an alarm for ten minutes earlier than he needs to get up and dedicates that time to waking Lynette. ‘I’ve had alarms on my mobile phone, ones that vibrate and radio alarms, but none of them wake me,’ says Lynette who, like Paula and Liz, rarely drinks alcohol and is not on any medication. ‘I need someone repeatedly calling my name, and taking the covers off me, until I eventually come to.         Problems with sleeping (file image) mean an inidual\u0027s brain might feel it needs to stay asleep for a sufficient amount or they could suffer an underlying condition such as sleep apnoea, Dr Irshaad Ebrahim added. Circadian rhythm disorder, which puts those affected into a deep sleep phase usually happens in the first couple of hours ‘Cameron puts music on, continues shouting my name and then lets our cat in, who’s big and climbs on top of me and starts pawing at my face, so it’s a mixture of these things that finally means I can put my feet on the floor.‘I think Cameron thought I was exaggerating the extent of my problem at first and, maybe in the first couple of months he got frustrated, but now he accepts that I cannot wake up without his help. I’m hugely grateful to him but being so totally reliant on someone else makes me anxious. I often think: “What would happen if he became ill in the night? How long would it be before I was aware?”.‘I’m always Googling to see if there’s some new pill or technology to help people like me and I once joined an online group for heavy sleepers, but got frustrated and left because no one had any solutions.’Like Paula, Lynette, who runs a web-based business from home, selling baby clothes, told Cameron early in their relationship that she didn’t want children, partly because of her ‘sleep problem’ which she says would make motherhood ‘very challenging indeed’.When she was living alone, Lynette missed a family holiday to Tenerife, waking three hours after the flight had taken off, despite countless calls to her mobile from her frantic parents at the airport.When her cousin died, Lynette was ‘utterly mortified’ to sleep through the 11am funeral. She was also horrified when a neighbour told her that she’d caught a would-be burglar trying to kick in her front door the previous night — Lynette had slept through it.More alarming still, years ago when on holiday Lynette was dead to the world when an earthquake struck in Marmaris, Turkey, causing her hotel to rock on its foundations. Fortunately, she was with her parents who insisted the manager unlock her hotel room door so that they could wake their daughter during the evacuation.\u0027It’s gone down in family folklore that not even an earthquake, measuring a terrifying 5.6 on the Richter scale, can wake me.’So next time you’re tossing and turning in the middle of the night, cursing the fact you can’t get back to sleep, spare a thought for the super slumberers — who’d give anything to be able to wake up. "},{"url":null,"title":"Heavier new cars pump CO2 older models","story":"Share this article Mid-size petrol SUVs, which covers vehicles of the size of the Nissan Qashqai, rose by 20.4 per cent – up from 157.6gkm to 189.8g.The worst-performing group were the large petrol-hybrid cars, which are the size of the BMW 3 Series. These recorded an average increase of 31.7 per cent – up from 89.2gkm to 117.4g.

They are loaded with 200kg, with the air-con and radio switched on, which better reflects everyday use.         The small petrol cars category, which covers those the size of a Ford Fiesta or Volkswagen Polo, saw an average increase of 11.2 per cent – up from 131gkm to 145.7g (stock image)On a positive note, the Which? analysis found emissions linked to harming human health – NOx (oxides of nitrogen) and CO (carbon monoxide) – have reduced dramatically. In petrol cars, the level of CO emissions has dropped by 40.6 per cent. Across all diesel vehicles, the decrease in NOx was an average of 84 per cent.The editor of Which? magazine, Lisa Barber, said: ‘It is shocking to see our tests uncover increasing levels of carbon dioxide emissions for the latest cars that are being built and sold to UK consumers.‘Manufacturers must ensure that they are doing everything in their power to create cleaner vehicles that are fitter for our planet and its future.’But the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders rejected the findings. Chief executive Mike Hawes said: ‘Only the official, Europe-wide WLTP test... can be relied upon by consumers to accurately compare vehicles on a like-for-like and repeatable basis.‘This shows that new cars emit, on average, some 29.3 per cent less CO2 than models produced in 2000, the effect of which drivers can see at the pump.’"},{"url":null,"title":"UK schools close TWO MONTHS plan contain coronavirus","story":"Share this article            David posted a picture of his wife, Sally, also getting treated.

Mr Levy\u0027s interview came at the time of the poisoning in Salisbury of Russian Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. Pictured: Crime scene investigators walk in hazmat suits in the town\u0027The television in reception was showing the news and there was a report about the Novichok poisoning in Salisbury.\u0027As Ms Udalova-Surkova greeted Mr Levy to take him downstairs to the room where the interview was going to take place, he made a comment to the effect of, I hope you aren\u0027t going to poison me.\u0027He did not make reference to her Russian nationality and was not directing the remark at her personally, but was prompted to make what he saw as a joke by the news report.\u0027Ms Udalova-Surkova was taken aback by the comment but said nothing in response and the interview went ahead without further reference to it.\u0027Mr Levy (was) interviewed, though he was then not offered the position.\u0027Going on to the age discrimination issue, the judge said: \u0027Mr Levy asserted that this was direct discrimination in that the firm rejected him because he was too old and they wanted a younger candidate.\u0027The firm undoubtedly did not offer Mr Levy the job he applied for and so the heart of the case revolved around the question: if there was less favourable treatment, what was the reason for it?

Even though the stolen jewellery was not in the safe, the plans could have made the luxury home a target for thieves.A source close to the heiress said she was deeply upset by the suggestion that she might have unwittingly helped burglars break into the home.Mester, 47, denies conspiracy to commit burglary and concealing criminal property and was remanded in custody.Savastru, 29, has not yet been arraigned and will appear on Thursday 5 March at Isleworth Crown Court. "},{"url":null,"title":"Pope Francis slightly unwell cancels public appointments","story":"Share this article His speech to them from the Apostolic Palace was to have been streamed to guests at a Rome conference on ethics in artificial intelligence. The pope usually spends mornings making speeches to groups and meeting heads of state in the Vatican\u0027s Apostolic Palace. But unlike previous popes, he chose not to live in its spacious papal apartments and opted for simple quarters in Santa Marta. Yesterday Francis called off a scheduled visit to the St John Lateran basilica across town, where he was due to meet with Rome clergy.        Pope Francis has cancelled his events and is feeling \u0027slightly unwell\u0027, two days after he was pictured coughing and blowing his nose during Ash Wednesday Mass         Pope Francis caresses a child\u0027s cheek as he takes part in his weekly general audience at the Vatican, a day before missing an engagement due to illness         Some worshippers were wearing face masks as a precaution amid a severe outbreak of coronavirus in Italy         The faithful wear face masks as they wait for Francis arrival in St. Peter\u0027s Square at the Vatican for his weekly general audienceThe pope had been seen coughing and blowing his nose during the Ash Wednesday Mass this week.  The same day, he shook hands with worshippers in St Peter\u0027s Square as he voiced his sympathy with coronavirus victims. Only a few of the 12,000 or so faithful who turned out to see him on Saint Peter\u0027s Square were wearing face masks.But the 83-year-old Francis did not shy away from shaking hands with members of the congregation - and even kissed some of the children present.However, some clergymen seemed reluctant to kiss his ring or embrace him.  Francis is in generally good health and has undertaken a series of gruelling foreign trips in his seven years as leader of the Catholic Church.He lost part of one lung as a young man because of a respiratory illness.           Pope Francis kisses a child at the end of his weekly general audience in St Peter\u0027s Square in Vatican City         Pope Francis poses with faithful from Iraq in St. Peter\u0027s Square during his weekly audience         Several people in the crowd wore face masks to protect themselves against infection as they waited to see Francis on Wednesday         Earlier in the day Francis had met with crowds in St Peter\u0027s Square where he touched hands and kissed faces, despite warnings over coronavirusItaly is in the grip of the worst coronavirus outbreak in Europe, which has infected 650 people in the country so far.  Seventeen people have died in an outbreak centred on northern Italy, although a few cases have been detected in Rome. All of those who have died so far in Italy were either elderly or had pre-existing medical conditions. Twelve regions have reported at least one case of the virus, including Sicily at the country\u0027s southern tip. Hotel bookings in the northern city of Milan have plummeted to 20 percent, compared with nearly 90 percent normally at this time of year.Even in Rome, more than 50 percent of bookings have been cancelled until the end of March, hotel association Federalberghi said. The government has stopped all movement in and out of 11 towns in two regions in the north - Lombardy and Veneto - in a bid to stop the contagion spreading. Some Lent Ash Wednesday services were cancelled or limited in areas of northern Italy hit by the spread of coronavirus.     "},{"url":null,"title":"Auschwitz museum bans visitors countries infected coronavirus","story":"Share this article          In a message posted on its website (pictured), the museum near the tourist destination of Krakow in south Poland said: \u0027To date, we have not observed any disturbing situations, but the Museum is monitoring this issue on an ongoing basis\u0027A further 120,000 visited from the USA.The Museum has said that it will update their website with coronavirus news when available and has urged potential visitors to \u0027keep track\u0027 of information.The Polish government has said that so far there are no confirmed cases of the virus in Poland.Minister of Health Lukasz Szumowski said on Thursday: \u0027There are no cases of coronavirus in Poland.

The book is set in Sokcho, a city so close to South Korea’s impenetrable northern counterpart that it is possible to take a day trip over the border.Dusapin’s unnamed narrator has returned to her home town from university in Seoul. Working as a live-in receptionist and cook at a dead-end guesthouse run by the grumpy Old Park, she has resisted opportunities for further study abroad as obstinately as she holds out against an anticipated engagement to her vacuous model boyfriend. Winter has encased Sokcho like a snow globe: in this precarious frozen landscape, figures move as languorously as the crabs and octopuses occupying the glass tanks of its vast fish markets.The unexpected arrival at the hotel of a guest from France, a comic-book artist called Kerrand, stirs a frenzy in the young woman, in whom he takes a sporadic but intense interest. Kerrand is old enough to be her unknown French father. “Western face. Dark eyes. Hair combed to one side.” While he invites the narrator to assist him in his search for ‘authentic’ Korea, he is curiously averse to her offers of local cuisine, preferring western takeaways, and constantly citing an aversion to “spicy” food. She has studied French he talks of Maupassant, Monet and the “grey and dense” light of his native Normandy. For the narrator, the contrast with Sokcho seems stark: “You had to be born here, live through the winters. The smells, the octopus. The isolation.”These brief conversational asides contrast with the book’s omnipresent viscerality: the narrator’s mother, an expert at cooking the potentially deadly fugu or pufferfish, has a fish market stall where scales and blood are routinely trod underfoot, like the painful collective memories of a ided country. Body dysmorphia abounds, from the narrator’s frequent cycles of overeating and purging to the hopeless quest for perfection manifested in the swollen, bandaged face of a female hotel guest who has undergone plastic surgery. Identity is in crisis, with the toweringly obvious symbol of a land ided hanging over it all.Dusapin’s terse sentences are at times staggeringly beautiful, their immediacy sharply and precisely rendered from French by Aneesa Abbas Higgins: “the rain hammered down, the sea rising beneath it in spikes like the spines of a sea urchin”. Oiled with a brooding tension that never dissipates or resolves, Winter in Sokcho is a noirish cold sweat of a book.• Winter in Sokcho by Elisa Shua Dusapin, translated by Aneesa Abbas Higgins, is published by Daunt (RRP £9.99).

Shelton has cast doubt on the desirability of, and legal basis for, Fed independence, saying last year, “I don’t see any reference to independence in the legislation that has defined the role of the Federal Reserve.” And she has argued for “a more coordinated relationship with both Congress and the president”. If Fed policy were “coordinated” with Trump, then it is fairly clear who would be calling the shots.Of course, one new Fed governor could not upturn decades of practice. But there are suggestions that if appointed, Shelton could replace Jay Powell when his term comes up for renewal in 2022, leaving a fox in charge of the chicken coop.It is not only in the US that central-bank independence is under threat. In Turkey, the president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, fired his governor last year, saying that “we told him several times to cut interest rates” but he did not oblige. In India, the government asked the Reserve Bank to hand over some of its reserves and the governor, Urjit Patel, resigned “for personal reasons” and his key deputy followed soon after with a broadside directed at the prime minister Narendra Modi’s administration: “Governments that do not respect central bank independence will sooner or later incur the wrath of the financial markets.”Are these prophets of doom correct? Will we soon see control of interest rates back in the self-interested hands of finance ministries? In the words of the song, was central bank independence just a silly phase we were going through?I think not. The most recent global survey, by the economists Nergiz Dincer and Barry Eichengreen, though admittedly conducted in 2014, shows that there is still a “steady movement in the direction of greater transparency and independence over time (and) little indication these trends are being rethought”. One may have some grounds for scepticism about the measures of independence they use – according to their model, Kyrgyzstan boasts the world’s most independent central bank – but they can find no cases where changes to legislation bringing the central bank back under political control have been implemented.In the west, while Trump has huffed and puffed, he appointed Powell, a man with conventional instincts and a backbone. The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, resisted the temptation to appoint a Brexit supporter to the Bank of England and named a veteran BoE insider, Andrew Bailey, who has independence in his bones. In the eurozone, a similarly neutral choice emerged as Draghi’s successor and a change in the ECB’s status would require a new EU treaty. The chances of that are vanishingly small. EU leaders show no indication of taking the risk of opening up the constitution to further referendums, as would be necessary in some countries. Furthermore, some of the political pressure for action has diminished. Trust in the ECB fell sharply after the eurozone crisis almost a decade ago but has recovered in most countries in the last couple of years. Even in Greece, the ECB is trusted more than the national government.There has, it is true, been a change in political rhetoric. After a long period in which governments resisted any commentary on interest-rate decisions, some have become more vocal. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Conservative who is the leader of the House of Commons, dubbed Mark Carney, the outgoing Bank of England governor, a “second-tier Canadian politician” who failed to get a job at home, after Carney disagreed with Rees-Mogg’s economic judgment on the costs of Brexit. And Trump has characteristically weighed in with tweeted criticism of the Fed.Should central banks regard this renewed disputatiousness as a bad and dangerous thing? They may, if they wish, but I suspect they are pushing water uphill. We have moved into a less respectful age, which is not surprising, given the mistakes made by central banks (and others) in the run-up to the 2008 crisis. Instead of bemoaning the surge of comment and challenge, central banks need to raise their game, enhance their transparency and get better at explaining and justifying their actions and decisions.• Sir Howard Davies, the first chairman of the UK’s Financial Services Authority, is chairman of RBS.

Bubonic plague is thought to have been carried to this remote corner of Derbyshire from London back in the 1660s by infected fleas, trapped in a bale of fabric ordered to make costumes for a festival. The sickness spread fast, killing dozens of villagers and leaving many on the verge of fleeing in panic – but then something extraordinary happened.The rector of Eyam, believing it his duty to spare neighbouring towns from infection, persuaded his parishioners to take the astonishingly self-sacrificing step of sealing themselves off from the world. They would live or they would die, but nobody would leave until the sickness had burned itself out. One mother is said to have buried six of her children, yet by staying must have saved countless other women from the same fate.It’s impossible to read the story of Eyam without wondering who on earth would be capable of such selflessness now. When it came to the crunch, how many of us would secretly have more in common with the local squire, who fled after the first few deaths and left his neighbours to their fate? Compared with 17th-century peasants, modern Britons simply aren’t enormously used to the idea of sacrifice for the supposed collective good.Doing whatever is necessary to stop the virus spreading is, much like vaccinating your kids against measles, not just about protecting your own interests but putting the wellbeing of the herd first. The trouble is that we all know what has happened to vaccination levels across the west, as a minority of parents seemingly decided the herd was someone else’s problem.Are we really ready for a pandemic? Not so much for the virus itself as the personal sacrifices and inconveniences that might follow a serious outbreak: for lockdowns and school closures, empty streets and cancelled holidays, perhaps even factory shutdowns and shortages in the shops if there is serious disruption to global supply chains. The word “quarantine” sends a particularly medieval shiver down the spine because it means being trapped where the infection is – like the tourists now confined to a Tenerife hotel after an Italian guest tested positive – when instinct tells you to flee. But even self-isolation, or voluntarily shutting yourself away at home, as the government recommends here for those potentially exposed to the virus, will be hard on self-employed people who don’t get sick pay, and those in jobs so precarious they don’t want to risk taking 14 days off.If NHS beds come under intense pressure, difficult choices may have to be made. Yet it’s hard to imagine the spirit of Eyam prevailing when ministers have already had to invoke draconian emergency powers to prevent a man rescued from coronavirus-stricken Wuhan leaving quarantine in a Merseyside hospital.China’s solution to this dilemma has been the kind of brutally sweeping measures that perhaps only the most authoritarian of states could muster: sealing off whole cities, banning travel, knocking up new hospitals in days and reportedly even nailing victims’ front doors shut, in some cases, to stop them venturing out. The virus now seems to be peaking in China. Yet what can be made to work in a society where everyone fears the consequences of disobeying authority, and where the concept of collective sacrifice for the communal good is drummed in from childhood, won’t translate easily to European democracies.So far, Britain has opted more for keeping calm and carrying on, bearing in mind the World Health Organization’s warning that this is about containing the social and economic damage caused by mass outbreaks, as well as saving lives. Japan is closing all its schools but the health secretary, Matt Hancock, was clear, when briefing MPs on Wednesday, that this government would seek to keep schools open wherever it could. The scientific advice is seemingly that the economic and social disruption caused by widespread closures, which stop parents going to work, isn’t worth it at this stage.The unspoken fear is obviously that there may be more than enough economic disruption as it is, with efforts to contain the virus hampering the free movement of goods and people around the world. The modern equivalent of Eyam’s bolt of cloth is lorry drivers shuttling between factory depots, or middle managers flying to and from meetings, meeting and greeting and sneezing and coughing as they go. Airlines freezing recruitment, restaurants reporting cancellations and factories running low on parts are only the most visible signifiers of what may be to come.But when the WHO urges countries to step up preparations, it isn’t just talking about hospital beds and economic resilience and endlessly reminding people to wash their hands. This isn’t just a test of clinical resources but a test too, in some ways, of Britons’ willingness to put ourselves out for others. Thankfully, this isn’t another Eyam. But we have a choice about whether to be vicars or squires, all the same."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d254cfdabc75cd5bb4653ee6fbab562efa41a9c9/0_83_3914_2349/master/3914.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=602edcd1d88b5f853899360c97050954","title":"eu british sovereignty britain single market","story":"Access to the single market should be balanced by guarantees on fair competition. That way, we can forge an ambitious future• Amélie de Montchalin is France’s secretary of state for European affairsOn 31 January, the sovereign and democratic choice of the British people came into force. Brexit happened it is now behind us. What did not happen, though, to our mutual relief, is a much-dreaded “cliff-edge”, “hard Brexit”, or “no deal”. In spite of all the drama of the past months, we managed to find a compromise together.Now that the UK has “got Brexit done” I hope that, after such political and media passion, we can go back to reason and restore enough trust in our partnership to build an ambitious relationship. Now that the United Kingdom has left the EU, it has to deal with another fully sovereign power: the European Union. Now that the political phase of Brexit is over, our citizens, our businesses deserve a more pragmatic approach.When we hear Boris Johnson explain with much emphasis how he intends to “take back control”, regain leeway and make UK interests prevail, how should we Europeans respond? Just like British politicians, our responsibility as European public decision-makers is to protect our citizens, who are legitimately concerned about the impact of Brexit.Our 47-year proximity is, and will remain, de facto, a “special relationship”. The UK may seek to develop such ties elsewhere, but the bottom line is that our mutual relationship is irreplaceable. The UK companies I meet tell me just that. They do not want to sever their ties with the EU internal market and its 450 million consumers.How do we meet the expectations of our citizens and industries? In choosing Brexit, the UK unilaterally decided to withdraw from the single market and from many European Union policies. Again it is your choice, but this choice comes with consequences.Like any free trade agreement between sovereign partners, our future relationship has to be a balance of rights and obligations. Unfettered access to the single market can only be granted if balanced by a series of guarantees to maintain fair competition.This is not ideological. Our aim is not to constrain UK sovereignty. Our aim is to provide fair competition to our companies, especially in the fiscal, social, environmental and agricultural domains. To put it bluntly, you do not want American chlorinated chicken entering your market, and we do not want it either.If we want to achieve this together, first do not underestimate our unity as sovereign Europeans. I am not addressing you today as a French minister, but as a European voicing a European position. The 27 member states did not accept any “cherry-picking” or “mini-deals” from the UK side during the first phase of the talks. We stand and will stand behind chief negotiator Michel Barnier on this. The only way to reach a fair agreement is to deal with the EU as a whole.Likewise, we think sustainability is more important than deadlines, and we will be very vigilant about including a sound governance mechanism, to mitigate any potential future violations. We will not lower our level of ambition to meet an artificial deadline. The 10-month deadline is only relevant in terms of the British political agenda. For Europeans, substance is more important than deadlines.From now on, what we need most is mutual trust. It is a precondition for everything else. To us, an important signal in the coming months will be the implementation of the withdrawal agreement, including citizens’ rights, the Northern Ireland protocol and effective controls in the Irish Sea. We are talking about an international treaty: I have no doubt that the UK will fulfil its commitments.We French are among your closest European neighbours. Take this other “special relationship” as an opportunity to build the UK-EU partnership. Let’s not create fake oppositions, let’s not revive artificial fights through the media. Our shared history shows just how much our two nations can achieve when we work together. Without the joint steering forces of France and the UK, we would never have had the Channel Tunnel or Airbus. On both sides of the Channel, we need to make sure that having such common ambitions will be possible in the future.• Amélie de Montchalin is France’s secretary of state for European affairs"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0b12ef4d73937d51ec1bebcef4a305e1cffa920/75_0_1407_844/master/1407.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8bd962d8deaff9344400ec5f6f99952b","title":"humanities british government culture","story":"The strain of conservatism that has now taken up residence in Downing Street is tireless in its identification of enemies. The BBC and Channel 4 were put on notice during the latter stages of the election campaign, and the government is now openly pursuing the termination of the BBC licence fee. Dominic Cummings’ long-harboured resentment towards civil service mandarins is driving Whitehall reform, imperilling its independence.The vanguard of rightwing thinktanks and newspapers is redoubling its attacks on universities, with a pitifully thin Policy Exchange report on the topic this week earning a Times headline decrying these “sneering” institutions. Meanwhile, a bogey-ideology known as “wokeness”, constructed by conservative commentators and “free speech” advocates, now serves as an all-purpose bin into which any form of activism, complaint or critical theory can be thrown.These various hostilities are often lumped together as symptoms of a culture war, in which the demographic and educational isions that came to light around Brexit are amplified and exploited for political gain. But we can be more specific than that. The new conservative ideology coalesces around one theme in particular: hostility towards the modern humanities, and their elevated status in British public life.The 20th century witnessed a distinctive model of interlocking political, educational and artistic institutions, with the humanities at their core. Public bodies such as the British Academy and the BBC set the template for the optimistic, post-1945 era of public investment in the arts and humanities. The state actively supported their expansion after the war via such icons of mass cultural modernity as the Arts Council, BBC2, the Open University and the new redbrick universities. By the 1980s, this project had borne such fruits as the South Bank Show, the Birmingham School of Cultural Studies and Channel 4. Threaded through all of this was the principle that there was a public interest in understanding ideas, artefacts and events.Cummings has never hidden his contempt for humanities subjects, forged partly out of his own experience of studying history at Oxford. He has been a long-term advocate for an expansion of Stem (science, technology, engineering, maths) in the school curriculum, and for attracting more Stem graduates into the civil service. His notorious blog-cum-recruitment ad, which sought to attract data scientists and “weirdos” to Whitehall, was also notable for its dismissal of “Oxbridge English graduates who chat about Lacan at dinner parties with TV producers”.More fundamentally, the humanities play a pivotal ideological role for contemporary conservatism: they sit in the crosshairs of both Thatcherite neoliberals and nationalists. It is often difficult for free marketeers to find common ground with nationalists, especially on issues such as immigration. The possession of a shared enemy provides coherence to an otherwise unwieldy coalition. The figure of the publicly funded humanities graduate, whose cultural privilege grants them access to the London elite, fuels a paranoid fantasy that is now central to conservative ideology.The neoliberal position is that a humanities degree is a simple waste of money, as revealed in the earnings of graduates. To people of this mindset, the benefit of the post-2010 tuition fee regime, allied to a host of league tables and audits, is that it exposes latent inequalities in higher education that were previously concealed by public funding. If somebody chooses to study art history (and not, say, computer science), then this is a high-risk investment, which they should be personally liable for. The recent announcement by the University of Sunderland that it would be terminating all its history, languages and politics courses, and replacing them with vocational alternatives, therefore represents progress.The nationalist concern is very different, and stems especially from the perceived influence of continental philosophy over the past 50 years. For those who buy into rightwing conspiracy theories about “cultural Marxism” or the milder anxiety surrounding postmodernism, humanities graduates are an enemy within, a segment of the liberal elite that lacks national loyalty.Opposition to public institutions such as the BBC has been incubated by Rupert Murdoch and his newspapers for many years. More recently, Brexit has given nationalists the confidence to cast suspicions upon a wide array of independent public bodies, from universities to the Bank of England. One thing that neoliberals and nationalists can agree on is that anyone whose education and career has been spent in publicly funded liberal institutions, telling a story about “the public interest” is a fraud. The popular appeal of Johnsonism lies in its antipathy to this elite.But in favour of what exactly? The Cummings plan is for esoteric forms of rationalism to topple the humanities: not just data scientists but game theorists, cognitive scientists, software developers and “people who never went to university” should shape government thinking. This is a vision of society as a programmable machine, a form of post-humanism, which denies that culture or history require any specialist interpretation, but merely provide more data to be fed into predictive mathematical models. The social sciences and humanities will eventually be taken over by physicists.If Cummings wants to accelerate away from the 20th century, then conservative traditionalists want to reverse it. If, as the economics professor Thomas Piketty argues, we are returning to a form of oligarchy last seen prior to the first world war, one can easily envisage how the arts and humanities will be sustained: via the patronage of the rich and the indulgences of their children. The brief historical period, when learning about literature or, yes, Lacan, was a gift from the state, accessible to all regardless of background, is firmly over.It is telling that, while Cummings wants to hire people who use “analytical languages: eg Python, SQL, R”, Boris Johnson is just as likely to lapse into Latin. The liberal humanities are being caught in a pincer movement, between hyper-modern futurism and pre-modern classicism. Taken to extremes, the dream of wiping away modern culture in the name of some distant future and some primordial past has inspired the most hideous of rightwing regimes. Even at its mildest, this is a project that sees little intrinsic value in a public library, a primetime documentary or a history degree.The 20th-century cultural establishment has plenty of failings, which are readily exposed by its opponents. It has never been as inclusive as its rhetoric pretends, and it is far from democratic. Resentment towards cultural and political elites has clearly been brewing for decades, especially among non-Londoners and non-graduates – an electoral goldmine for Johnson. Too often, these elites have reflexively countered the attacks of Thatcherites and the Murdoch press by closing ranks, relying on the power of their contact books, free tickets and charm, but only deepening the sense of metropolitan luvvies doing favours for each other. The defence of universities and the BBC is going to be an important test case for how much of that establishment survives this government.• William Davies is a sociologist and political economist.

The seminar was on the north-south ide, and the word was London. It was obsessive. Why does London keep taking our best people, everyone asked? Why do our children all want to get to London?This week’s report by Lord Kerslake on the north-south ide presents the problem in graphic terms. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) shows Britain with the widest regional inequality of any advanced nation. London’s economy is growing at between two and four times the rate of the north. It is blessed with better health, better trains, better skills. The south-east has largely escaped austerity, its public spending rising £2bn in a decade. The north’s has fallen by £6bn. Fixing this gap will require action “on a level with Germany post-unification”, the report says, when trillions were spent over decades on the former east.Some of this gloom is misleading. Surveys claim London is the least happy region in the land, the north far more content. The OECD and the Institute for Fiscal Studies have also shown that inequality in Britain is less between north and south than between particular places. Leeds contrasts with Rotherham. East London is poorer than Harrogate.Kerslake is aware of the need, but he does not address the issue obsessing my Mancunians. To them the issue was London, seen as exciting, creative, rich – an existential menace. Rulers since Elizabeth I have tried to reduce its appeal. She tried to send her courtiers back to their country estates, and failed. London has always been the goose that lays Britain’s golden eggs, and is still – now more than ever.My economics tutor used to warn us that much of what he taught might one day be proved wrong, but he hoped at least to have showed us how to recognise nonsense. A case in point must be Kerslake’s solution to the north, which tallies with Boris Johnson’s old-Labour cliche of “levelling-up”. It lies in vast dollops of public investment in infrastructure, in interconnectivity, skills and “cross-governmental, ministerially led” coordination. This is the same language used by Harold Wilson, Margaret Thatcher, Tony Blair – every prime minister– usually in the year after an election.None of this addresses what Manchester understands, that you will not level up the north without levelling down London. The capital has to reduce its appeal to the north’s most precious resource, its creative talent and entrepreneurial zeal. This requires big regional cities to develop “creative critical mass”. They must treasure their heritage, their converted mills, their historic districts – anything to distract their young people from craving a move to London. This may involve sucking energy from their surrounding towns – as Leeds has from Bradford. Cities such as Frankfurt, Toulouse, Milan and Barcelona have established a cultural self-confidence that has succeeded in resisting the magnetism of their country’s capital. The only city outside London to come near such magnetism is semi-autonomous Edinburgh.In the case of demagnetising London, the task is near insuperable, but it must be attempted. Revival will come from small steps, not giant infrastructures. These steps will never work if they depend on London, on its taxpayers, its civil servants, its government. Dependency economics has been the curse of Scotland and Wales. There is no such thing as public spending-led growth – as has conspicuously failed in eastern Germany. Growth comes from employers and investors being stimulated to exploit local skills and talents. They should pay local taxes and run local government. Northern cities will flourish only when London stops stealing their people, their ideas and their power.If the regions are to rise, London must in some degree fall. It must stop gorging on infrastructure investment – as, mercifully, it may now do on Heathrow expansion. It should stop drawing ever more commuters into its centre, which is what Crossrail and HS2 (now running only to the Midlands) are about. It must stop cramming itself with students, the one truly energising factor in many northern city economies. London’s student fees should soar, and northern ones plummet. The capital should stop receiving the lion’s share of arts subsidy.Kerslake rightly acknowledges that Britain must decentralise government power. But how many times must we hear this trotted out? Experience abroad advises accountable local mayors, delegated taxes, borrowing powers and no more reliance on begging from Whitehall.I believe this will never happen until those with power are physically ejected from the capital. Civil servants and politicians (and journalists) must go north. The increasingly dysfunctional Houses of Parliament should abandon their billion-pound gilded temporary outposts in Westminster, and go north for five years. It would refresh them and it would certainly refresh the nation.Demoting London to promote the regions would not necessarily mean a richer Britain, though the present imbalance must be damaging to national prosperity. Wealth is not the issue. Brexit has shown it is now subservient to populist slogans such as patriotism and group identity. One such “identity” is the north, and it has shown itself politically toxic. The north-south ide must be countered. This will happen only if the “levelling” is real. London should ready itself for a hit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9997ea560fc87a592c73a1c3a05925d132f4023b/1041_1089_8846_5309/master/8846.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02d657db834714109f17cd5ffb4e9fe3","title":"art and commerce a history of the art of advertising in pictures","story":"A new book examines the artistic development of advertising and the innovative ways that ads combined images, text and product to communicate and attract potential customers.

Oxford, Sussex, Manchester and Warwick were among the few to employ enough senior black academics to show up in the official statistics.Male professors continue to outnumber females by three to one, or 15,700 to 5,700 in 2018-19. The number of female professors has increased by 1,200 in the five years since 2014-15, and the number of males by half that amount.Hesa data published in January suggested that no black staff were employed at the most senior levels of leadership in British universities in 2018-19, which ministers described as “unacceptable”.The latest statistics show that just 75 people on university governing bodies identified as black, out of 3,600 governors in England, Wales and Scotland, including staff and non-staff. Hesa also released figures showing that the dropout rate for first-year students continues to rise, which the Office for Students described as concerning.The breakdown by inidual institutions showed that some alternative providers had very high dropout rates, including the UK College of Business and Computing based in London, which had 80 of its 165 undergraduates fail to continue after their first year.Michelle Donelan, the universities minister for England, said: “With high numbers of students continuing to drop out, this data shows progress is slow from some institutions to tackle the issue. I want universities to step up and take action as we cannot let these students down and let talent go to waste.”Nicola Dandridge, the chief executive of the Office for Students, said: “English higher education enjoys internationally high completion rates, but an increase in the proportion of students dropping out is a concern.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bcd9b41bbaf5c61bc029e4fe48485e5b8a48e474/0_51_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79a53d4b559a2eb8d1f096eeec352588","title":"ucl eugenics inquiry did not go far enough committee say","story":"Nine members argue inquiry should have investigated recent meeting on eugenics An inquiry into University College London’s historical links with eugenics has issued its final report, despite the fact that a majority of its committee refused to sign it because they felt it did not go far enough.The report of the inquiry, which has taken a year and a half and had an independent external chair, calls for the names of scientific pioneers who supported the discredited science, including the Victorian scientist and “father of eugenics” Francis Galton, to be erased from buildings and lecture theatres at the university.Nine members of the 16-strong inquiry team refused to sign the report, arguing that they should have investigated a much more recent secret meeting on eugenics run at the university.The group argue that the report ignores many expert testimonies and contains scientific and historical inaccuracies. They plan to distribute an alternative set of recommendations at a UCL town hall meeting on the inquiry on Friday evening.The inquiry did not investigate London Conference on Intelligence meetings on eugenics, which were run at the university by James Thompson, an honorary senior lecturer who has now been stripped of his title. Speakers at these meetings included white supremacists and a researcher who had previously advocated child rape.Andrew Sabisky, the former No 10 adviser who was forced to step down last week because of a furore around his comments on race and intelligence, was listed as a speaker at an LCI meeting at UCL in 2015. Toby Young was forced to resign as a director of the government’s New Schools Network after it was revealed that he also attended one of the meetings.Joe Cain, a professor of the history and philosophy of biology at UCL and one of the dissenting members of the inquiry committee, said: “I tried really hard to get the London Conference on Intelligence on to the agenda of that committee but I met with a brick wall. We absolutely should have talked about it – but we just didn’t.”The university says it conducted a separate inquiry into how Thompson was able to book meeting rooms without its knowledge – which it is also publishing on Friday – and procedures have now been tightened up.But a second member of the inquiry committee, who asked to remain anonymous, said: “We definitely should have talked about these meetings. But the big issue is not how a member of staff booked a room, but why someone with his views was a member of staff at all.”They added: “I refused to sign the report largely because of its tendentious focus on race. I have no issue with addressing racism, but the fact is that the early eugenicists at UCL were far more focused on targeting people based on things like poverty or disability.”Cain is also concerned that the inquiry did not probe sufficiently deeply into teaching at UCL. He says that although the report asserts that eugenics is not being taught anywhere in the university, the inquiry team did not investigate whether this was the case.“My God, I hope that’s true, but the fact is we didn’t look. I’m sure students would let us know if the sort of crazy eugenics you see in the LCI meetings were being taught, but eugenics can also be much more subtle than that.”Galton coined the term eugenics and endowed UCL with his personal collection, along with an endowment that funded the country’s first professorial chair of eugenics.Cain was one of the first to call for the renaming of university buildings and already refuses to teach in the Galton lecture theatre. He said he was pleased that the inquiry has instructed the university to issue a “meaningful and effective apology” for the hurt that UCL’s involvement in eugenics had caused BME students and academics.“The history of eugenics reminds us about stigmatisation. It says to members of our community ‘you don’t belong here and you aren’t normal’.”Responding to the inquiry’s recommendations, UCL said it was taking action including the funding of new scholarships to study race and racism, a commitment to ensure all UCL students learn about the history and legacy of eugenics, and the creation of a two-year research post to further examine UCL’s history of eugenics.Prof Kalwant Bhopal, the director of the centre for research in race and education at Birmingham University, said the inquiry must not be used as a sticking plaster for racial inequality. “It’s no good just ticking boxes and changing a few names. How will everyday lives change?” she said.Dr Adam Rutherford, a science broadcaster who teaches at UCL and has just written a book on race, said: “What I’m concerned about is that the gloss of renaming buildings will overshadow the big structural issues that really matter, like why is there such an attainment gap between BME and white students? And why are there so few senior BME academics?”Sandy Ogundele, the black and minority ethnic officer at UCL students’ union, said the report’s recommendations were “a significant first step in a long-term process for UCL to make amends for its deeply troubling ties to eugenics.”Prof Michael Arthur, UCL’s provost, said: “We acknowledge that UCL has a problematic history with eugenics which has, and continues, to cause significant concern for many in our community. This past should not be hidden but openly and critically discussed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d85f4abe56cd050574a881179b78cd6c8cf8e85/0_232_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d0863212c77ee7ff8d3b2b58cffceeb","title":"california water wells dry sgma","story":"Years of pumping, drought and a thirsty agriculture industry have taken a heavy toll on the water supply – and new plans are leaving vulnerable residents behindWhen Carolina Garcia’s well began pumping sand and air instead of water in 2016, she didn’t know where to turn.The Garcias had been living in Tombstone Territory, a quiet four-street community in California’s San Joaquin Valley, for 10 years. In the middle of the state’s historic drought, many of the farms surrounding Tombstone Territory had installed new wells and deepened existing ones. Despite being just two miles from the Kings river, Tombstone was drying up.Garcia, her husband and four children spent four days without water that first time.They resolved to lower their water pump. It worked for a few months – but then, again, sand and air. When they repaired it again, they were told the new fix would only buy them a couple more years.Sitting at her kitchen table one recent afternoon, Garcia was soft spoken as she remembered the facts of this crisis. But her large dark eyes filled with tears as she recalled the pain of sending her children to school unshowered, begging neighbors to fill jugs of water and going to the bathroom outside.“We are still taking care not to use too much water,” Garcia said in Spanish. “We live with the fear that it’s going to happen again.”At the height of the drought in 2014, California passed the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (Sgma), regulating groundwater for the first time in the state’s history. Sgma was meant to limit industrial use of groundwater while protecting the rights and resources of rural residents who depend on shallow wells. But as the new agencies tasked with managing the water drafted their plans, residents were largely left out. Many of the plans meant to protect groundwater would actually cause residential wells to go dry as the water table continues to drop until Sgma’s 2040 sustainability deadline.“They’re making a decision to let farmers keep pumping at the expense of thousands of families’ wells going dry, which this whole process was supposed to prevent,” said Amanda Monaco, water policy coordinator at the not-for-profit Leadership Counsel.With Sgma not shaping up to be the groundwater fix many clean water advocates had hoped it would be, other projects and state funding appear poised to fill some of the gaps. But the approach is still largely reactive: disadvantaged communities are left to suffer first before help comes.“The urgency might not be there for folks in the city,” said Monaco. “But every single morning, folks in Tombstone Territory wake up fearing they’re going to have to spend another four months without water.”As many as 2 million rural California residents rely on private domestic well water to drink, cook, bathe and flush toilets. Those wells are an artifact of a time long gone, when groundwater was plentiful and clean, and having one’s own access to it meant being self-sufficient.When Ray Cano’s grandparents built the third house in Tombstone Territory, they looked forward to the day when it would become a part of the nearby town of Sanger. Until then, the house would rely on its own pump to deliver groundwater to the sinks, showers and hoses on the property.Tombstone grew, but Sanger didn’t extend its borders, or its municipal water system. Cano, 48, inherited the home and its well and moved in in 1988. At first, being disconnected was fine. “The water used to have almost like a sweet taste. It just tasted good,” he said.In the years since, he watched neighboring farms switch from grape vineyards to growing almonds and install newer, deeper groundwater pumps. After his well first failed in the spring of 2015, he paid to have it lowered from 60ft to 105ft. Now it’s sputtering again, pumping air between bursts of water that Cano filters three times before each use.According to the clean water advocacy not-for-profit Community Water Center, nearly 12,000 Californians ran out of water during the 2011-2017 drought. And because inidual wells are private property, residents were ineligible for most government aid programs that would have helped repair them.Those who could afford to, like Cano, installed new pumps, dropped their wells or dug whole new ones, at a cost of upwards of $20,000. Landlords, in many cases, passed their costs on to renters. Residents who couldn’t afford new wells began to rely on bottled water deliveries arranged and paid for by local aid groups. Years later, many in Tombstone are still surviving on those deliveries.When it passed in 2014, Sgma was supposed to protect the rights of domestic well users to access their fair share of California’s groundwater. The law ordered the establishment of management agencies that would oversee the health of the Central Valley’s already overdrafted underground resources. The agencies were to monitor the area’s water table, plan for groundwater recharging, institute pumping restrictions for agricultural users – and protect rural residents.But in over five years of planning since, groundwater sustainability agencies established under the law did not commission analyses of how management strategies might affect those residents, to compare well depths with projected groundwater depths as pumping continues. According to engineering analyses of well data and sustainability plans commissioned by Leadership Counsel, Community Water Center and Self Help, another local advocacy group, and submitted to groundwater sustainability agencies, upwards of 8,000 wells would go dry if the San Joaquin valley’s current plans were approved. In essence, the law that was supposed to protect well users could codify their wells going dry.Many agencies still lack accurate data on the most vulnerable groundwater users. The Central Kings management plan, which oversees Tombstone Territory and its surroundings, states that new domestic wells are close to 350ft deep. According to state data, the average domestic well nearby is actually shy of 190 feet. Some of the pumps in Tombstone Territory are still set at just 60ft.Angel Hernandez calls places like Tombstone Territory “lost communities, hidden communities, forgotten communities” left behind without the lifeline of water. Even when those communities can drill deep enough, the water may be too toxic to drink.Hernandez, 46, and his neighbor Isabel Solorio sit on a rural community advisory committee for the groundwater sustainability agency that oversees their community of Lanare, south-west of Fresno. Lanare is home to roughly 550 people who lived for more than a decade with water tainted by dangerous levels of the heavy metal arsenic, which has been tied to cancer, cardiovascular disease and cognitive development problems in children. That arsenic is natural in the clays deep underground, where it has seeped into lower levels of the water table that may have been in the aquifer for tens of thousands of years.Rural residents across the Central Valley are plagued with a host of water-borne toxins. Aside from arsenic, water across the valley is also tainted with nitrates from fertilizer and animal waste associated with a variety of adverse health impacts 123 TCP, an ingredient in pesticides which has been linked to cancer hexachromium six, an industrial chemical linked to cancer and other health problems and uranium, which like arsenic is leeching into groundwater more extensively because of increased pumping.Solorio, 53, lives across the street from the Lanare community center and defunct water treatment plant, now also the site of two new deep wells established with $3.8m in state funding. Last year, those wells began pumping clean water through pipes and into homes across long-plagued Lanare – the clean water that Solorio, Hernandez and others fought for for years.But in Sgma, they are less hopeful. Their local agency has planned for a recharge basin to benefit three disadvantaged residential communities in the area. But, like in other parts of the valley, the agency’s plans will threaten shallow wells. Solorio feels it’s not enough. Her friend at the end of the block, she says, already has a well running dry.“The priority of this new Sgma law is to protect communities too,” said Solorio. “But this board doesn’t want to talk about that. Their purpose is so different.”Sgma’s passage in 2014 may have been inspired by rural communities running dry across the Central Valley, but it won’t be the answer for beleaguered residents who have lived without clean water for years.“Sgma is incredibly important. The situation was out of control,” said Jessi Snyder, community development specialist at nonprofit advocacy organization Self Help. “But there’s going to be this really challenging period between now, when the plans are finalized, and 20 years from now, when we have to achieve sustainability.”“A lot of damage can be done in that amount of time,” said water activist Lucy Hernandez.While sustainability agencies haven’t planned to mitigate the impacts of lowered water tables over the next two decades, the passage of a new Safe and Affordable Drinking Water Fund could bridge some of the gap. Hernandez and other water activists fought for the fund for years before it was finally signed into law in July 2019. “There’s been a lot of progress, but we need long term solutions,” said Hernandez, 51. “Delivering water bottles is not a long term solution.The $1.4bn fund will provide support for much-needed small community system infrastructure and treatment devices, as well as consolidation projects with nearby municipal systems. And for the first time, money will be widely available to help distressed private well owners. The California governor, Gavin Newsom, has made clean drinking water a signature issue of his administration and traveled to tiny Tombstone Territory to sign the bill.Both Snyder and Hernandez sit on the fund’s advisory committee. Both are cautiously optimistic about what it can actually accomplish in the face of such entrenched problems.“I want to make sure we get the funding and resources here in our Central Valley, because our people are on the front lines,” said Hernandez.“We are all very happy to have 10 years of really robust funding, but it’s not like we’re going to wake up 10 years from now and it’ll be done,” said Snyder. “It’s going to continue to be a challenge. It’s really daunting.”Instead of drilling deeper wells and treating the contaminated water pumped into residents’ homes, more small communities across the Central Valley are hoping to connect to larger nearby municipal systems and take advantage of water economies of scale.Maria Olivera’s purple house sits on a quiet street in eastern Tulare county, past miles of winter-ripened citrus, fat and falling off lush, well-irrigated green trees. The water here in unincorporated Tooleville is good enough for the potted plants that crowd her front porch, but it isn’t safe to drink.“Hexachromium six, and nitrate,” said Olivera, 66, who has lived in Tooleville since 1974 and holds a seat on the community water board. Tooleville has two community wells, but only one is in operation. “And in the summer there’s no pressure. But it hasn’t run out completely yet.”“It’ll spit and sputter, though,” said her neighbor and fellow board member Benjamin Cuevas, who bought his home in Tooleville less than two years ago without any knowledge of the water quality issues.Olivera and Cuevas, 61, are volunteer utility district managers, collecting monthly bill payments from their 70 neighboring properties in order to keep the tainted water on. They receive some clean bottled water – five five-gallon jugs every two weeks – from the county.“That’s included with the flat $40 a month we pay for the water we can’t drink,” said Cuevas, smirking.Tooleville is hoping to connect to the nearby town of Exeter, using grants and interest-free loans from the state. But consolidation is still a daunting challenge. “We’ve been working on trying to consolidate Tooleville with Exeter for 15 years,” said Snyder.They thought the deal was finally all but done last summer, but it fell apart at an explosive city council meeting, where the mayor said Exeter “can’t afford to take on Tooleville”. In Exeter, less than a mile up the road, Tooleville is perceived as the ungoverned and undeserving wilds. The crisis has not bred magnanimity. Scarcity has bred contention across the valley.This was once also the case in Porterville and East Porterville, just 18 miles south of Tooleville. East Porterville is widely regarded as the poster child for devastating point well failure – and a consolidation success story. In the dry heights of the drought, upwards of 500 shallow domestic wells in the unincorporated, low-income community failed before the city of Porterville finally extended its system to its neighbors in 2016.“It was a messy thing. We built the plane in the air,” said Snyder, who worked on installing meters for the new water customers. “But the city of Porterville stepped up, despite it not having been their idea.”Each home that received a water connection had to abandon or destroy its well and sign a document agreeing that Porterville could annex the property into its city limits in the future. In 2016, 756 properties signed up for city water – and 341 declined.For rural residents who don’t live within a mile or so of a community water system, consolidation is not an option at all. And even for those who do, it’s not necessarily an attractive one. Low-income residents are faced with potentially larger water bills, and with city control come city codes and regulations. But there may be no other choice, as groundwater levels continue to drop and more wells go dry.“I don’t want anyone to find there’s no value in their home or find it condemned,” said Monte Reyes, a Porterville city councilmember and an Eastern Tule groundwater sustainability agency board member. But ultimately, he thinks they won’t be forgotten communities. The board on which Reyes sits is a rare groundwater agency with municipal, not just agricultural, representation. He sees the system working, and attitudes shifting – at least in his little corner of the Valley.“We can’t just say stop, and wait and see. Everybody loses if we do that,” said Reyes. “Transparency and the measurement of every drop is coming.”But it is, to be sure, not here yet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a84cd649e594f28952de632d487735a796de1df4/418_367_2073_1243/master/2073.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a59efb1661b02655b05ad369d2b2fef2","title":"greta thunberg bristol schools shut students join climate strike","story":"Thousands joining activist for march expected to bring traffic in parts of city to a standstillSchools closed, lecture theatres emptied and offices shut as thousands of people made their way to hear Greta Thunberg speak at a youth climate strike in Bristol.Thunberg took to the stage to chants of “Greta, Greta!” from the crowds gathered. She told them: “We will not be silenced because we are the change, and change is coming whether you like it or not. Thank you and let’s march!”Teenage organisers of the Bristol Youth Strike 4 Climate insisted that Friday’s event would be well run and safe, and dismissed as “patronising” concerns expressed by police and council officials at the scale of the event.A crowd of 25,000 was expected to bring traffic to a standstill. Thunberg was due to take part in a march through the city after addressing the crowd.At least two schools, Cotham and the Bristol Cathedral Choir school, closed. Some teachers at other schools planned to take time off to escort pupils to the strike.Thousands of students from universities and colleges were due to attend. Some employers actively encouraged staff to take part in the strike, promising not to dock pay, while others turned a blind eye to absences.Coaches brought protesters to Bristol from across the UK, and rail and bus stations geared up for a huge influx of young people, some with parents but many travelling unaccompanied.The scale of the event has caused a security headache for Avon and Somerset police and Bristol city council.The council’s executive director, Mike Jackson, and Supt Andy Bennett, the city’s police area commander, issued a joint statement saying they were working to manage public safety.They added: “We want to ensure that anyone planning to attend is prepared and able to make their own safety and safeguarding arrangements. Parents are responsible for their children. The council and police are not responsible for unsupervised children.“In terms of big crowds, there is the potential for trips, slips, falls and crushing.”In a response posted on Twitter, Bristol Youth Strike 4 Climate said they had “no time for being patronised”, adding that they had arranged for 60 metres of festival barriers, more than 80 stewards and a safe zone for young children.They added: “But of course, in a public event everyone should also be aware of their personal safety at all times. Be kind to others and look out for each other.”The organisers said they were honoured to be welcoming Thunberg for their 10th strike. In a statement, they said: “September 2019’s global general strike saw approximately 15,000 gathered on College Green and Greta’s high-profile presence as a figurehead for the global climate movement brings attention back to Bristol students’ fight for comprehensive climate policies.”Thunberg’s speech was briefly delayed after organisers from the stage called for a stretcher and ambulance to help someone in the crowd.Other speakers at the event were scheduled to include Mya-Rose Craig, 17, who recently became the youngest person to be awarded an honorary doctorate in the UK for promoting greater ersity in the wildlife and conservation sectors.Some schools said they were supportive of parents who wanted to take their children, while others decided not to authorise absences. Two schools near College Green decided to shut completely.Explaining why Cotham school was closing, its headteacher, Jo Butler, said on Thursday: “Due to the unprecedented numbers of people expected to attend the climate protest tomorrow and our close proximity to College Green, we have taken the decision to close the school.” heard from children and adults across Britain, as far away as Scotland, who said they were attending.Ishmael, a 13-year-old from Bristol, said Thunberg’s visit might inspire those who did not usually attend to turn out. “Lots of us are regular protesters. However, I think this might help others feel like pulling their sleeves up and joining in,” he said.Willow, a 15-year-old from Gloucestershire, said: “It shows that it takes one person to stand up to something which is not right, and many, many people will stand with them. It shows that time is running out and we are in serious need of change. And it shows that young people should not be underestimated – we have a voice and we are strong.”Alison Thomson had brought her daughter, Emily, 10, to the event. Alison said: “I thought she might be a bit young to come but she said this would be her only chance to see her speak so I agreed.”Emily said: “I think it’s really important that people understand what is happening to the Earth.” She planned to return to school after the event to give a presentation on climate change.Isaac and Maya Swann, 11 and 15, had persuaded their mother, Karen Davies, to bring them. Isaac said: “We wanted to see Greta and to join the march.” Maya said: “We want to help make a change. She’s really brave and inspirational, giving up part of her childhood to spread this message.”Davies said: “I was against them taking time off but last night they came to me and said they felt if I was their age I would be there. They were right. I’d be in the thick of it. I sent an email to the school and they were supportive. I think many schools see it as educational.”Ed Thompson, a housemaster at Clifton college, took overseas boarders aged 11-13 to the event, as well as the school’s “green team”. He said: “We have discussed Greta’s influence in school, and she is a true icon to all ages for her passion, determination, tenacity and likability. The word ‘inspiration’ is too often used, but she is a guiding light to the next generation for peaceful but powerful activism, and encouraging love and care for our environment, which is such a strong message for young people.”It was not just very young people attending. The green energy company Good Energy, from Chippenham in Wiltshire, asked its 250-strong workforce to join the strike.One of the strikers, Johanna Pettipher, who works as an accounts specialist, said: “Going on climate strike on the direction of Good Energy’s senior team feels like a blessing. In my last job, I had to take a day off work to go to the climate strike in October. Protesting is the best way to tell the world that we are ready for better.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff2b6113f5ae74263f22a9a828ed52fdcd34885a/0_187_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=509d2f7e9986d4605014feec1dd02f4d","title":"tell us have you not bought clothes for more than 10 years","story":"We’re interested in hearing from people who haven’t bought any clothes for the last 10 years Konnie Huq has revealed that she hasn’t bought any clothes in 10 years.

It’s my mum’s birthday you see, and while she’s not much of a cake person, she’ll bite your arm off for a florentine.In the past, I’ve made proper ones – you have to make a caramel – but this easy version coats nuts in maple syrup for a much friendlier recipe. It can be easily adapted to the things you (or your mum) love: milk or dark chocolate dried fruits, nuts, seeds and candied fruits.The tart is what I will make instead of a birthday cake: half chocolate tart, half pecan pie, with a little help from some salted caramel. Too much, some might say, but this is how you celebrate a woman as full of life as this.Here’s to you, Mama there are not enough salted caramel chocolate pecan tarts in the world to say thanks.My son loves making these with me. You can swap the nuts, dried fruit or chocolate (dark, milk or white) to suit your tastes: just keep the amounts the same.200g good-quality dark chocolate, broken up40g flaked almonds40g shelled pistachios, roughly chopped2 tbsp maple syrup1 ball stem ginger, drained and roughly chopped60g sour cherries4 medjool dates, stoned and roughly chopped1 good pinch flaky sea saltFill a medium saucepan with water and put on the heat until simmering. Put a heatproof glass bowl on top, making sure the bottom doesn’t touch the water, add the chocolate, and melt. Once melted, remove the bowl and turn off the heat.Put the almonds and pistachios in a medium-sized frying pan and toast until they smell fragrant. Add the maple syrup, stir, then take off the heat. Add the stem ginger, sour cherries and dates, stir again, then transfer to a bowl.Line two baking sheets with greaseproof paper. Carefully drop tablespoons of the melted chocolate on to the sheet, creating roughly 5cm rounds, six to eight per tray.While the chocolate is still melted, scatter over a mixture of fruit and nuts. Finish with a pinch of salt and put in the fridge to set for half an hour. These are best enjoyed with your mum, or another brilliant woman.This tart needs some time to chill in the fridge, so I’d suggest making it the night before or in the morning, if you want to eat it that evening. I serve it in thin slices (it’s rich) with a little creme fraiche or natural yoghurt, and some sliced blood oranges.500g shop-bought sweet shortcrust pastryFlour, for rolling150g pecans250g golden caster sugar60ml maple syrup300ml double cream45g unsalted butter, cut into pieces50g dark chocolate, roughly chopped 1 good pinch sea saltTo serveCreme fraiche or natural yoghurtSliced blood orangeHeat the oven to 180C (160C fan)gas 4, and have ready a 25cm fluted, loose-bottomed tart tin. On a floured surface, roll out the pastry to just bigger than the tin, carefully wrap it around the rolling pin and lower it over the tin, gently pressing the pastry into the sides, so it takes on the shape of the tin. Prick a few times with a fork, then put in the fridge for 30 minutes, or longer if you have time. This will help it to stop shrinking when you bake it.Meanwhile, put the pecans on a tray and roast in the oven for 10 minutes, shaking once halfway – you want them to be nice and darkened. Leave to cool, then roughly chop.Remove the chilled pastry and cover with a sheet of baking paper, fill with baking beans (or uncooked ricelentils) and bake in the hot oven for 15 minutes. Remove from the oven, carefully lift off the paper and beans, then return to the oven for a further 20-25 minutes, until crisp and evenly golden. Leave to cool, then trim the edges.While the pastry is cooking, put the sugar, maple syrup and two tablespoons of cold water into a large pan and put on a medium heat. Once the sugar begins to melt, move the pan in a circular motion to combine – do not use a spoon to stir, or it will crystallise and be grainy. Heat for eight to 10 minutes, until it becomes more golden in colour. Take off the heat and whisk in the double cream and butter.Put the pan back on the heat and bring to a boil, whisking, for another five minutes, until thickened, then stir in the chocolate and pecans. Carefully pour into the tart case and refrigerate for at least two hours, and preferably overnight. To finish, sprinkle with a little sea salt."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d1069f471ad09079e8f3d81fa8c1341f6fc71bb/690_574_3256_1953/master/3256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=482bd4296e82aecd66755a37d525afcf","title":"what noma did next new nordic food rene redzepi claus meyer locavore foraging","story":"In our time of climate crisis and inequality, as top chefs dream less of Michelin stars and more of changing the world, the New Nordic movement is reaching beyond haute cuisine into classrooms, supermarkets and parliaments. By  Kieran MorrisFew restaurants have enjoyed as much acclaim and influence, or been as widely caricatured, as the Copenhagen fine-dining institution Noma. In its 16 years of existence, it has been at the top of the World’s 50 Best Restaurants list four times. There are three Noma books, two feature-length films and a Noma documentary series. There are Noma dissertations and dozens of “Nomaheads” – dedicated diners who follow the restaurant all over the world, from Yucatan to Tokyo to Sydney and back again. In the early 2010s, there were so many articles about hunting for wild produce with Noma’s charismatic head chef that one writer declared it “The Era of the ‘I Foraged With René Redzepi’ Piece”. There is even a 240-page travelogue, written by an Esquire editor who followed Redzepi across the world for four years.But all the attention that has been lavished on Noma’s hyperlocal, micro-seasonal food – butterflies moulded from blackcurrant leather 100-year-old mahogany clams served in their shell – has obscured the much more ambitious aims that the restaurant’s creators, alumni and allies have been trying to achieve. Noma as a traditional haute cuisine restaurant, with its elegant cookbooks and high-concept food, is being overtaken by a grander project. The people behind the restaurant are trying to expand New Nordic, a culinary movement they began in Scandinavia 15 years ago, to the rest of the globe. In doing so, they want to transform every link in the long chain of how food is produced and consumed, from the dirt up to your dinner table.The New Nordic movement is bound by a set of 10 principles that stress sustainability, locality and respect for the natural world. Those ideals may sound familiar, but the scale of what its adherents are accomplishing makes New Nordic potentially far more transformative than any previous food movement. It is reaching beyond farms and fine-dining restaurants, and into halls of power, supermarket aisles, canteens and classrooms.Pretty much anywhere in Denmark, you can walk into a supermarket and find ready meals – made with traceable organic produce by co-operative kitchens in Copenhagen – that bear the name of Claus Meyer, Noma’s co-founder. Meyer has also created a food training programme in Denmark’s prisons to reduce reciism, and he is partnering with Ikea – which feeds 660 million people a year, making it one of the 10 largest food-service operations in the world – to “veganise” its menu.Further afield, in Bolivia, Meyer has opened restaurants and cooking schools to revive the nation’s hospitality industry. In the US, Dan Giusti, a former head chef at Noma, now feeds more than 4,000 school children a day with nourishing meals, while in Albania, Fejsal Demiraj, one of Noma’s current sous chefs, runs a foundation that researches and catalogues the nation’s village recipes to give the country a documented culinary history for the first time.Followers of the New Nordic approach are also working to change food policy and production practices around the world. Building on the success of Noma and the New Nordic manifesto, Nordic governments have set up an institute to promote their region’s food policies to other nations. In addition, Redzepi has set up a non-profit organisation called Mad – it means “food” in Danish – that led a campaign in partnership with the UN in the summer of 2019 against the environmental damage of food production.There are also plans for a Mad Academy, with funding from the Danish government, which aims to become “a Bauhaus of food”, as its executive director, Melina Shannon-DiPietro puts it – a place where all the different steps in food production are taught, and where efforts are geared towards answering the most urgent questions of the day: “How do we make food sustainable? How do we make food available to all? How do we protect food cultures against globalisation?”It’s as if Fergus Henderson took his “nose-to-tail” philosophy into Whitehall, got funding from the National Lottery and ended up getting people across the British isles to butcher their own meat, instead of just feeding offal to well-heeled Londoners. What the New Nordic movement is trying to export is not a single cuisine, but an all-encompassing philosophy of food.Chefs were once courtiers then, in the 19th century, they became artisans. For a time following the deprivations of the second world war, they were relics – vestiges of lost luxury in a time of hardship and scarcity. As the age of reality television and fast money dawned in the 80s, so too did the bonafide celebrity chef: a hard-living, tortured genius who justified their wealth and fame with a relentless dedication to perfection. Then, around the turn of the millennium, came an era of techno-utopianism and the transformation of the chef into a wizard of molecular gastronomy, with its frozen foams and fluid gels and trompe l’oeil flourishes.The New Nordic movement heralded another shift in the world of fine dining. In our current era of climate emergency and brutal inequality, celebrity chefs have transformed again, from ruthless kitchen dictators such as Gordon Ramsay and Marco Pierre White, or mad scientists such as Ferran Adrià, into crusaders for a better world. Where once the dream was to cook for presidents, now the aim is to work with them. Massimo Bottura, the ebullient owner of the three-Michelin-star Osteria Francescana in Modena, was celebrated in the 2019 Time 100 for his work feeding the homeless. José Andrés, the Spanish chef once credited with bringing tapas to the US, now has an accolade far exceeding a Michelin star: a nomination for the Nobel peace prize, for his disaster relief efforts in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria. The pursuit of Michelin stars and coffee-table cookbooks has been superseded by pursuing a role in public life.Of course, there have been powerful voices challenging the mainstream food industry before. At the height of the first-wave of the environmental movement, in the 70s, Alice Waters’ groundbreaking restaurant Chez Panisse, in Berkeley, California, shone a light on the relationship between food producers and cooks, encouraging diners to reject commercialism and supermarkets, and return to the farmers and ranchers who produce their food in a more sustainable way – even if it means paying more for that produce.Even Jamie Oliver, whose TV persona has been a figure of ridicule to many for the past two decades, invested much of his time in social enterprises, most famously challenging the British government on the quality of school dinners during the heady high-point of the Blair hegemony, and founding the not-for-profit restaurant chain Fifteen, which trained, and was staffed by, apprentices from disadvantaged backgrounds.But the New Nordic movement has done more than any single chef to make doing “more than just cooking” the new normal. Redzepi could have opened up a Noma Dubai, and a Noma in the Vegas Bellagio. That’s what the old French masters, such as Alain Ducasse, Pierre Gagnaire and Joël Robuchon, did when they reached the peak of the profession: snatch up Michelin stars all over the globe for their luxurious outposts in far-flung, glitzy hotels. Instead, Redzepi is devoting his time to Mad and to a revamped Noma – often referred to as Noma 2.0 – just a couple of kilometres from the site of the now-shuttered original.Still, the movement – and the restaurant at its forefront – has its critics, who argue that it can be sanctimonious, or narrow, or inattentive to the simple notion that food should be a pleasurable experience. George Reynolds, writing for Eater, took Noma to task for its self-imposed Nordic exceptionalism, writing that “its borderline isolationist culinary philosophy doesn’t feel quite right for the present age more than ever, closing yourself off to other influences is not just unnecessarily limiting but politically unpalatable.”The fact is, though, that the rise of New Nordic means there is no longer a bright line between the chef and the activist, the test kitchen and the laboratory. Joe Warwick, the creative director of the World Restaurant Awards, believes that the people leading the New Nordic movement’s restaurants, canteens, labs, thinktanks, policy institutes and cooking schools, have “exerted influence on their industry on a scale that only a few chefs and restaurants in history ever achieve”.Two decades ago, Denmark might have seemed a rather unconducive place for a revolution in haute cuisine, let alone in food altogether. Being generous, you could have said that it was a country of open-faced sandwiches, hot dogs and overproof alcohol. But you might also have associated it with the cheapest processed pork in the EU, known for being made in a grim factory from a candy-pink slurry of something that once was a pig. “Back then, all you could get in the centre of Copenhagen was bad French food or bad Italian food,” the food writer Andrea Petrini told me. “There was no Danish food culture.”One of the New Nordic movement’s first feats was to help to transform Scandinavia from a land of herring cured in lye to the gastronomic centre of the world. In 2000, Claus Meyer, then a TV chef and one of Denmark’s most recognisable faces, had been appointed by the Social Democratic government to overhaul the country’s poor culinary reputation. He led a committee to create a special quality label for the best Danish food producers to apply for, in the manner of France’s Label Rouge system, which certifies the quality of foods such as Bresse chicken and Bayonne ham. But at the next election, in 2001, the Social Democrats fell, the initiative was scrapped and Meyer was dismissed. “I realised when the committee was demolished that working towards a better food culture was not wanted in parliament anymore,” Meyer told me. “I found that so crazy.”So Meyer bankrolled a proof-of-concept restaurant in Copenhagen that would champion Nordic produce. In 2003, Meyer opened Noma – the name is a portmanteau of nordisk mad (“Nordic food”) – with Redzepi, then a rising star with no experience as head chef, at the helm. Around the same time, Meyer corralled 13 of the Nordic region’s best chefs into an 18-hour workshop to carve out what a world-leading food culture would look like. Meyer and the chefs agonised over the precise wording, order and emphasis of what would become the Manifesto for the New Nordic Kitchen, published in 2004 – a 10-point mission statement that sought “to express the purity, freshness, simplicity and ethics we wish to associate to our region”.Noma, which had spent its first year tweaking French classics with Nordic herbs, moved with religious fervour towards locavorism, making everything as wild and Scandinavian as possible. We put the forest, or the shore, or the snow on a plate in front of you, Redzepi’s dishes often seemed to say. The hope was that Scandinavia’s restaurants would realise the potential of the region and set about regenerating a “Nordic food culture”.What took New Nordic from a local concern to a global movement, however, was Noma’s astonishing success. When Noma dethroned the Spanish restaurant El Bulli, a temple of molecular gastronomy, at the top of the 50 Best list in 2010, it represented a transition between two self-defined “eras” of haute cuisine – from the laboratory to the forest cabin, so to speak. El Bulli would close for good a year later, with its head chef, Ferran Adrià, recognising the end of his restaurant’s journey.El Bulli had always sought to push the limits of what a restaurant could be, bringing in scientific rigour and dedicated lab spaces to make its food more daring. Redzepi had been a student of Adrià’s at the height of El Bulli’s fame. Noma’s innovation was borrowing Adrià’s approach and applying it to answer the questions posed by the New Nordic manifesto: how to radically enlarge the scope of what we think of as food, while making it more ethical and accessible.Noma began attracting talents from outside the food world: anthropologists, molecular chemists and agricultural scientists who would work in its Nordic Food Lab. This lab space – which was, for many years, a rigged-up houseboat moored outside of the restaurant – developed new local products, such as miso made with Danish yellow peas, or salt from shoreline seaweeds for the restaurant to use, while doing original research into the culinary bioersity of Scandinavia.Lars Williams, who was drafted to Noma from Heston Blumenthal’s test kitchen in 2009, moved to the houseboat in 2010 to run the Nordic Food Lab for two years. “We’d be as scientific as chefs could be,” Williams said. “We’d try the same idea 30 different times, with 30 different incremental variations, and record it all to assure we’d been rigorous.” Much like the restaurant, the lab operated with solely Nordic produce, but did its best to stretch that definition: “Things from the Faroe Islands were fair game, things from Northern Norway were fair game – we didn’t just operate around a kilometre’s radius around Copenhagen.”A lot of what the lab worked with – Øland wheat flour, æggeblomme (“egg yolk”) potatoes and other native varietals – had never been tested and examined to such depth before. Through the lab’s research, crops that had all but ceased to be cultivated were finding new uses, and a reason to be grown again.At the peak of Noma’s powers, when it felt as if every other food article was about the majesty of New Nordic, Redzepi began to look beyond the restaurant kitchen. In 2011, he launched what would become a series of annual ideas conferences, the Mad Symposiums, where invited speakers – everyone from the head of the European Environmental Agency to Japan’s most celebrated soba noodle maker – would address an audience of superchefs, interns, farmers, journalists and industry figures on a patch of Copenhagen dockland.These gatherings, which straddled the line between networking events, university lectures and evangelical tent rallies, helped build the movement that is spreading across the globe today. Figures of all stripes and skills would swap business cards, applaud each other’s speeches, plan events and collaborations together, united in the belief that everyone had the destiny of the food world in their hands.In 2012, Redzepi launched the Mad non-profit, to “unite a global cooking community with a social conscience”. Aside from its larger symposiums, Mad has run pop-up salons in London, New York and Sydney, inviting local chefs and journalists to talk about topics as expansive as abandoning ego, indigenous food culture and questioning the very value of life itself. They have partnered with Yale to teach students about leadership, have published essay collections on how food cultures overlap all over the world, and launched a foraging app, VILD MAD (“wild food”), to help users find what’s edible in their local park.Around the same time that Redzepi founded Mad, Meyer, who sold his majority stake in Noma in 2013, began testing New Nordic principles far beyond Scandinavia. After mapping the countries of the world on metrics such as economic development, crime rates and bioersity, Meyer decided to open a restaurant called Gustu in Bolivia’s capital, La Paz, with another talented young Danish chef, Kamilla Seidler, at the helm. Seidler and her team used Bolivia’s fauna and flora to create the restaurant’s idiosyncratic cuisine – llama tartare, alligator escabeche and a lot of quinoa – and brought the restaurant on to the foodie radar. But more importantly, she completed the restaurant’s primary objective: training the restaurant’s Bolivian staff so she could leave Gustu in their hands.To do this, Gustu opened two Manq’a cooking schools, named after the indigenous Aymaran word for food – one based in the capital, La Paz, and one in Bolivia’s second city, El Alto. Manq’a offered general culinary qualifications that enabled all students to work in the hospitality industry exceptional students, such as Gustu’s current head chef, Marsia Taha, would be placed on a fast-track scheme to move into the world of fine dining. There are now nine Manq’a schools in Bolivia and two in Colombia, more than 1,000 alumni, three canteens for La Paz locals to eat a freshly cooked three-course meal for just over £1.50, a tour company, a catering service and a fleet of delivery drivers to order a takeaway from.Alongside this, there is now a manifesto for a new Bolivian cuisine, drawn up by Meyer, Manq’a alumni and local figures within the Bolivian food scene there is a Gustu bar selling Bolivia’s national spirit, singani, and a whole host of restaurants across Bolivia, helmed by ex-Gustu staff, continuing to reimagine Bolivian food and make use of farmers and suppliers providing indigenous produce. In 2014, President Evo Morales had the restaurant cater his third-term inauguration. The following year, the restaurant was asked to devise a recipe for special quinoa communion wafers presented to Pope Francis when he visited the country.Seidler, after Gustu, returned to Copenhagen to carry through her vision of what she calls “social gastronomy” with her latest restaurant, Lola, which operates as both a fine dining restaurant, and a job inclusion programme that trains socially excluded iniduals in cooking and hospitality skills.Others, such as Noma’s New Jersey-born former head chef Dan Giusti, have turned their efforts toward improving the food of public institutions. In 2016, Giusti opened Brigaid, a chef-led startup that brings chefs into public schools to train cafeteria staff, ensuring that pupils eat made-from-scratch food every day – beef tacos and chicken teriyaki instead of vending machine snacks or, worse still, nothing. Brigaid has now expanded into three states, feeding thousands of school children every day across 12 public schools. It’s a world away from the 40 covers a night he served at Noma.The volume of social initiatives pushed by Noma affiliates is staggering. Another former head chef, Matt Orlando, runs a scheme that teaches Copenhagen schoolchildren how to grow their own food in small urban spaces. Over the road from him in the docklands of Refshaleøen is Empirical Spirits, a distillery run by Noma alumni that has organised agronomy workshops in the Oaxacan mountain village of Huitepec in Mexico to help the community continue growing its most valuable crop, the Pasilla Mixe chilli.Roberto Flore, former head of the Nordic Food Lab, now runs a lab at the Technical University of Denmark that offers space to experiment and develop schemes addressing matters such as hunger, food waste and accessible technology for food production. One scheme, called ServedOnSalt, has developed a battery that uses solar energy, salt and water to create a cheap and clean-powered cooking stove for use in refugee camps another has been focused on improving the safety and storability of milk products across rural Ethiopia.Scandinavia now leads the world in food policy, too. In 2018, Dr Afton Halloran, one of the world’s foremost experts on sustainable food systems, published a collection of innovative food policies from around the Nordic region, the Solutions Menu. It outlined the benefits of 24 innovative food policies, aggregated from successful initiatives around the Nordic region – including universal free school meals, organic food in hospitals and schemes to help farms move towards zero food waste. Halloran and her co-authors cited Noma and the New Nordic movement as their chief inspiration.When the Manifesto for the New Nordic Kitchen was first published, in 2004, the reaction in the world of fine dining was sceptical, if not outright suspicious. The manifesto’s points were criticised for being too vague, too piecemeal, too male – all the signatories were men – and too focused on “encouraging cooperation” rather than challenging the region’s industrial food producers through legislation and policy.At the time, Camilla Plum, a Danish food writer and TV personality, was quoted in Denmark’s newspaper of record, Berlingske, lambasting the manifesto’s toothlessness. “The manifesto reminds me a little of Queen Margaret’s annual New Year’s speech,” Plum said. “There are lots of good-natured thoughts and the usual nice greetings to Greenland. They are beautiful sentiments, but they have no real meaning.”Today, though, it seems indisputable that the manifesto more than succeeded in its aims. Scandinavia now stands alongside Spain, France and Italy as one of Europe’s major gastro destinations, with Michelin stars being found as far north as Trondheim in Norway, 200 miles south of the arctic circle. Thousands of jobs in hospitality have been created and, with them, catering colleges full of new students. There are new food producers and artisans, and more diners engaged with the food of the region in which they live.That said, the desire to shake up Scandinavia’s culinary reputation seems a little bit provincial now. The movement has long since mutated into a much larger phenomenon. The aim was once for the Nordic kitchen to be seen as natural and sustainable now, anything with bare wood, organic produce and a compost bin can be thought of as Nordic.Beyond that, the movement has established a Nordic way of doing things that can be adapted anywhere in the world, to breathe new life into cuisines that are distinctly Bolivian, or Mexican or Albanian. And these are just the first initiatives that Noma and the New Nordic principles have sparked. “We’ve already seen people who have come from Noma step out into the industry and work towards change,” says Dan Giusti. “But there’s people in that kitchen right now, and more people who will come through there in future, who we haven’t heard yet. In 20 or 30 years, there’s no telling how big the change could be.”• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d10b52231be11e074c4c0b84af395d9c13b1fc3a/0_178_3276_1966/master/3276.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b9aabe452b50cd45616913a9877da1c","title":"premier league news previews carabao cup europa league draw live","story":"Europa League: It’s difficult to imagine Wolves or their supporters being particularly intimidated by anyone left in the draw, but they’ll be phappy enough to have got Olympiacos, conquerers of Arsenal in the last round.

Designed to potentially “save millions of lives and entire economies” by speedily funnelling money to nations facing pandemics.But critics say the “insanely complicated” terms of the high-interest bonds are heavily skewed towards investors, while for the victims any payouts may come too late, if at all.One economist described the bonds, payouts from which depend on how deadly the outbreak is, as “obscene”.Olga Jonas, a senior fellow at Harvard Global Health Institute who was an economist at the World Bank for three decades, said: “The whole mechanism is highly unfortunate. The objectives were to help the poorest countries respond quickly to outbreaks. Infectious disease spreads exponentially and the coronavirus has a very rapid growth rate. But the bonds only get triggered when the disease has spread for a long time.”Jonas, who has analysed the bonds’ terms, said they were “so convoluted, it is not at all clear whether they will pay out at all. It is too little, too late – and in this case, maybe never.“What’s obscene is that the World Bank set it up this way. It waits for people to die.”Funds can only be released after a certain amount of time and in accordance with complex criteria including outbreak size, growth rate, deadlines and death tolls. In the case of coronavirus, the bonds would not pay out until 12 weeks after the World Health Organization (WHO) publishes its first “situation report”, which would not be until 23 March. Another criteria is that the outbreak is still growing.The bonds, funded by donor nations Japan and Germany, deliver interest payments to investors until the conditions for an infectious disease outbreak are triggered.The value of the bonds has halved as the coronavirus outbreak has spread, raising fears investors could face losses.Meanwhile, the WHO has appealed for £520m for “frontline efforts” to contain coronavirus. The disease has infected more than 82,000 people and killed over 2,800 people in 51 countries to date, but has not yet been declared a pandemic by the WHO.Clare Wenham, assistant professor in global health policy at the London School of Economics, said: “If you really wanted to ensure global health security you would link the payout of the bonds to a decision around declaring a public health emergency of international concern or a national emergency.”Wenham co-authored a paper criticising pandemic bonds in which it was found that more money was paid out to investors than to countries facing disease outbreaks. Payments would have only been triggered in two out of more than 60 disease outbreaks analysed – Ebola in west Africa and rift valley fever in 2006, the paper found.Wenham said: “If the aim of it is to prevent pandemics, why would you wait for arbitrary numbers? Global health security is predicated on prevention rather than response, so waiting for it to get to a certain number of deaths in a certain number of countries before they pay out, is counterintuitive. It is not fit for purpose.“No one has thought about it holistically. If public health officials have made a declaration of a global health emergency of international concern, there should be some mechanism for financing so that the WHO doesn’t have to go around the houses asking for money.”Bodo Ellmers, director of Global Policy Forum’s sustainable development finance programme, said: “The idea was that it would be a quick instrument, but it was set up with such stringent criteria that the risk for investors is very low. The design, taking the number of dead people as a criteria, is very cynical.”The scheme’s “fundamental flaw” is that it was aimed at preventing a pandemic but would only pay out when a pandemic was already underway, said Ellmers.The World Bank said a PEF payout had been triggered after the Ebola outbreak of 2018 and 2019 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, providing a total of $61.4m to fight the disease.The bank added that it has rolled out a series of tools to better assist countries during critical outbreaks, epidemics and pandemic threats.It is capable of fast-tracking funds via existing projects and could fund emergency operations within three months – although in past cases, such as Ebola, it had provided support within two weeks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d652f519cfdb6f5e65190801dd70b55cf1b4242b/0_0_10638_6383/master/10638.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f928cc35b5432696c1b9ef43bd2870e0","title":"i love to travel but my reluctant partner is holding me back","story":"The last time we went away, he spent much of the time complaining.

The ex-insider said Tighe was good at his job but Patel had wanted more people in senior roles in the department whom she trusted.The Home Office did not deny the claim that Patel asked for Tighe to be sacked on Christmas Eve, nor that she had wanted him to leave.A Home Office spokesperson said: “The home secretary and permanent secretary are deeply concerned about the number of false allegations appearing in the media. They are focused on delivering on the Home Office’s hugely important agenda, which includes creating an immigration system that works for the UK, putting more police on the streets and keeping the public safe from terrorism.”Over the last week No 10 has made moves to defuse the public spat, with both Patel and Rutnam told to stop the sniping and restore calm in the Home Office.The row originally blew up when it was claimed that Patel had tried to get rid of Rutnam after he raised complaints about her alleged bullying and belittling of staff.It then further escalated with claims that MI5 had restricted Patel’s access to security information because it did not trust her, which the intelligence agency and home secretary strongly denied.The department has said there have been no formal complaints about Patel’s behaviour.Rutnam made a rare public appearance on Thursday at a policing conference but made only a brief allusion to the reports about his poor relationship with Patel.He told the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) and Association of Police and Crime Commissioners summit in Westminster: “You probably have already heard a great deal more about permanent secretaries in the last few days than you ever expected to.

At the heart of the Ophiuchus cluster there is a large galaxy that contains a supermassive black hole with a mass equivalent to 10m suns.Although black holes are known as sinkholes that consume anything that drifts too close, they also expel prodigious amounts of material and energy. These jets occur when a disk of plasma accretes around the central black hole. When the inward flow reaches a certain limit, a proportion escapes being swallowed by the black hole and is redirected into jets that blast out in two perpendicular beams at close to the speed of light.In this case, scientists think a jet would have travelled in a narrow beam for a certain distance, then hit something in space, which caused the beam to explode outwards in a burst of radio emissions. Maxim Markevitch, of Nasa’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, a co-author of the paper, compared the process to a stream of air travelling down a drinking straw and then turning into a bubble at the end of the straw.The first hints of the giant explosion were spotted by Nasa’s Chandra X-ray Observatory in 2016, which showed an unusual concave edge in the Ophiuchus galaxy cluster. However, at the time the possibility of this being caused by an explosion was discounted due to the huge amount of energy required to create such a large cavity.The latest observations combined data from Chandra and ESA’s XMM-Newton space observatory and radio data from the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) in Australia and the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) in India to provide compelling new evidence for the gigantic explosion.The observations confirm the presence of the curved edge and also reveal a huge patch of radio emissions tightly bordering the curve, which would correspond to the expected bubble. “This is the clincher that tells us an eruption of unprecedented size occurred here,” said Markevitch.Scientists think the observed explosion may have occurred due to a spike in supply of gas to the black hole, perhaps when a galaxy fell into the centre of the cluster.The amount of energy required to create the cavity in Ophiuchus is about five times greater than the previous record holder, an event in a galaxy cluster called MS 0735.6+7421, and hundreds and thousands of times greater than typical clusters.The event is thought to have taken place several hundred million years ago, with the black hole showing no signs of dramatic activity at present.The findings are published in The Astrophysical Journal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/003128bc972dfe8ca695b4e65bd1602f55cf665e/0_70_5725_3435/master/5725.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81b52cdb9de8c2bb78adf43aee58cf93","title":"tell us have you been affected by the coronavirus","story":"If you have been affected or have any information or news tips for our journalists, we would like to hear from youIf you’ve been affected by the coronavirus, we’d like to hear from you.UK schools and offices could close for up to two months if the country is hit by a pandemic.The virus has now spread to about 49 countries, with New Zealand, Belarus, Lithuania, and Nigeria (the first case in sub-Saharan Africa) reporting their first cases in the last day.

It also found no evidence that the system was associated with more people entering employment, one of the benefit’s key strategic aims.The study was based on interviews with 52,000 people of working age conducted between 2009 and 2018. It excluded people with a disability who claimed other benefits. The authors acknowledged that the study showed “observational associations rather than cause and effect”.A qualitative study published by Newcastle and Teesside Universities last year into how low-income claimants in the north-east of England coped with universal credit found that it had so profoundly affected claimants’ mental health that some had considered suicide.Responding to the Lancet study, Ayaz Manji, a senior policy officer at the charity Mind, said: “It’s wrong that the benefits system … is causing psychological distress among people who need support. We need to see radical solutions to ensure that the benefits system plays its part in helping people stay well.”Labour’s Mike Amesbury, the shadow employment minister, said the study showed universal credit was not working. “This is the latest in a long line of damning independent reports into the impact that universal credit is having on people’s lives … Our social security system should have dignity and security at its heart.”Iain Porter, a policy manager at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: “Our social security system should provide a public service people can turn to when they hit hard times. There is nothing compassionate or just about the rollout of universal credit increasing levels of anxiety and stress among low-income families.”A Department for Work and Pensions spokesperson said: “This research does not prove that people are experiencing distress due to the design of universal credit.“People coming to the jobcentre are often doing so at a difficult time in their lives, and there is a range of support available for those with mental health conditions.“We know that the vast majority of people on universal credit are satisfied with their experience.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4241bed324c80ba449fb48195100ea26e7c45df0/430_238_4654_2792/master/4654.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3969c723e8dd6a72053b9d526ea7360c","title":"dominic cummings fiddles civil service burns","story":"Government hitlist of senior Whitehall staff distracts from the toxic bullying culture facing many civil servantsLast March, when Philip Rycroft left his job as the most senior civil servant in the Department for Exiting the EU, his detox from the stress was drastic. He and his wife spent two weeks on a remote Scottish island with no mobile phone reception at all.A bit extreme, acknowledges Rycroft, but this act of self-isolation was a huge relief after the intense activity of trying to prepare the UK for Brexit. As part of his job, Rycroft came under intense political and personal pressure, as did other senior civil servants, including then Brexit chief negotiator Ollie Robbins.But looking back, Rycroft and Robbins were practically living in halcyon days compared with the atmosphere that’s pervaded the civil service since Boris Johnson became prime minister last July. This week has seen reports that three senior civil servants are on a No 10 hitlist: Sir Tom Scholar at the Treasury, because the department has been opposed to Brexit Sir Philip Rutnam at the Home Office, because he is seen as obstructive and |Sir Simon McDonald at the Foreign Office, because he fell out with Johnson when he was foreign secretary.The plans to remove senior civil servants from key departments has resulted in a “poisonous” atmosphere across Whitehall, according to union leaders. But it’s actually more dangerous even than that.The management manual has yet to be written that recommends alienating thousands of hardworking staff on whom the organisation relies to get its everyday work done. But this shoddy tactic is one that is eagerly taken up by many incoming governments keen to embark on their policies and nervous that the civil service will somehow be a blocker, despite all the evidence on how effectively it carries out the work of the elected government of the day.More worrying, though, is the rise and rise of bullying at all levels of the civil service. Accusations about Priti Patel’s behaviour towards officials at the Home Office have led to other department heads having to reassure their own staff. Matthew Rycroft, the top civil servant at the Department for International Development, has written to his staff to reassure them that the ministry has “zero tolerance” of bullying and harassment in the wake of reports about Patel.Bullying isn’t just coming from ministers. There have been long-term problems of bullying in many civil service departments for years. The most recent, shocking case came to a head this week as former Department of Work and Pensions trainee Anne Giwa-Amu was awarded almost £400,000 after having been singled out and humiliated by colleagues, who violated her dignity through the use of racist language.A bullying culture, from top to bottom, is clearly no way to run the country. Senior civil servants may be under threat, but they also need to consider the morale of the departments they run."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e46c3407cb863a08354d95d258b1ce7be621781/0_29_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cbf0b449fd2ed2ac822eec516dbf2ccd","title":"female wrestler wins state title high school heaven fitch","story":"A female wrestler has made history by winning a state high school wrestling championship in North Carolina.The North Carolina High School Athletic Association said on its website that Heaven Fitch became the first girl to win one of the association’s inidual state wrestling championships.

Now, she has four not forgetting her first ever three-figure score in the format, hit here in Canberra two days ago. Her purple patch has arrived at just the right time for her country, it seems: this effort – a 47-ball 62 – was the batting cornerstone of England’s 42-run win against Pakistan.Knight aside, it was the England bowlers who once again got the job done, eventually bowling Pakistan out for 116 with two balls of their innings going unused. The best figures of the day went to Sarah Glenn (3-15), who continued to deceive opponents with her stump-to-stump leg-spin, putting a big dent in the Pakistan chase by having both Javeria Khan and Iram Javed bowled in successive overs following the power play.That came after captain Bismah Maroof – who had top-scored in Pakistan’s exciting win against West Indies on Wednesday – became Katherine Brunt’s first victim of the tournament, her attempted ramp shot failing to come off. Anya Shrubsole – who finished with 3-25 – then helped wrap things up with wickets in successive deliveries in the 19th, including a beautiful slower ball which told for Aliya Riaz (41), the only Pakistani batsman to show much fight.The result puts England in second place in their group, with just one remaining hurdle, their remaining match against West Indies on Sunday, now standing between them and the tournament semi-finals.Nonetheless, there will be much to mull over for a side for whom reaching the semis was really the minimum expectation. England’s current eight-batsman strategy is grounded in the idea that Amy Jones and Danni Wyatt are best utilised up top, while Tammy Beaumont at No 6 allows them to ‘finish big’. Arguably that strategy failed on both counts today, with England failing to do enough to leapfrog South Africa’s superior net run rate and go top of their group.Early on, England were once again in trouble, with both Jones and Wyatt falling in the powerplay – Jones in the very first over of the innings, trapped LBW to Diana Baig. A review via DRS could not save her from another failure with the bat, with ball-tracking showing that it would have gone on to clip the bails. Wyatt was saved from a similar fate two overs later, when Pakistan wrongly decided against reviewing a ball that had rapped her on the back pad and was later shown to have also been hitting the top of the stumps but she failed to capitalise on her reprieve, sending up a catch to point to leave England 47-2 in the sixth.At the back end of the innings, a flurry of wickets also cost England the chance to finish strongly: four wickets falling for 15 runs across the space of 10 balls in the 18th and 19th overs. That included specialist No 6 Beaumont, who came and went in the space of four balls, caught on the fourth attempt by Muneeba Ali in the deep. Knight herself departed the very next ball slogging to long-on, handing spinner Nida Dar two wickets in two balls in her 100th T20 international. That dismissal, though, came only after Knight’s determined effort to prop up the innings: arriving at the crease in the sixth over, she shared a 34-run stand with Nat Sciver, followed by a half-century partnership with Fran Wilson – the England captain the dominant partner in both cases.Pakistan will be ruing a number of missed opportunities in the field: Knight was put down no less than four times, the first when she was on 32 while Wilson (who acquired a run-a-ball 22) was dropped when still in single figures. Of the Pakistan fielders, only keeper Sidra Nawaz – whose Sarah Taylor-esque stumping off a leg-side wide saw off Sciver for 36 when she looked in sight of a third consecutive half-century – was blameless in defeat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58883567a3cd1fff35bf9b3f599b48a0a83d259f/0_152_3047_1828/master/3047.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8134a7842a3b2937ce368f5d5ebc1ea2","title":"mark wood ruled out of englands sri lanka tour through injury","story":"Mark Wood has seen the pause button hit on his Test career yet again after being ruled out of England’s upcoming tour of Sri Lanka through injury.The 30-year-old fast bowler looked to have made a breakthrough in South Africa as regards his physical hardiness, playing back-to-back Tests at the end of the 3-1 series win and claiming nine wickets during second of those at the Wanderers.But now a side strain picked up during the Twenty20 series that followed means Wood is left targeting the summer’s first home Test against West Indies at the Oval on 4 June, having joined Jimmy Anderson (rib) and Jofra Archer (elbow) on the sidelines.Lancashire’s Saqib Mahmood, who has made international debuts in one-day and Twenty20 cricket already this winter, is Wood’s replacement and will be among the touring party that departs for Sri Lanka on Monday.More details to follow..."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23693c9941667210d8fe485bf5c4a424612c78fa/0_109_5414_3251/master/5414.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=37368c1f9b9da1e5a0d177b8cbe68189","title":"talking horses no such thing as too much information for punters","story":"Nicky Henderson is to be applauded for telling us about coughing in his yard before the Festival but other trainers should also do likewiseAmong the social media responses to last night’s “Epatante is coughing” story, I was stunned to see some people effectively responding with: “too much information”. The complaint seems rooted in the fact that Nicky Henderson was reporting a potential problem which may or may not become an actual problem, leaving readers wondering how to respond.I saw one suggestion that the trainer should have waited to have a clearer idea of the outcome before going public. Someone else predicted that, if Epatante should now win the Champion Hurdle, folk will complain they’ve been put away.But if that does happen, those doing the complaining will be idiots. If you have any faith in your own ability as a punter, there is no such thing as too much information. Since you know what matters and what doesn’t, you can sift through any amount of data while others get bogged down. What you should fear is a shortage of information, which tends to put you in the same situation as all other punters, judging the likely outcome from a small number of factors and all of you vulnerable to being blindsided by a result you couldn’t see coming because a key fact was unavailable.Yes, it’s unusual for us to be told when there’s a small amount of coughing in a stable. We owe it to Henderson to say thanks for this level of detail and insight in the build-up to a major festival. But we also owe it to ourselves to add: all trainers should be doing this.Perhaps we don’t know right away what to do with this news that Epatante is coughing for no evident reason while following her normal regime. But we now have a chance to work out a theory and to see it tested in a couple of weeks. It seems a pretty good way to learn about the game. I’d far rather have this situation than the converse, a trainer keeping quiet about a cougher, hoping for the best and then feigning bafflement if it runs deplorably. Fortunately, that kind of thing never happens.Curiosity is an important attribute in a punter. I sense that my daughter isn’t going to adopt my interest in betting on horses but if she does, I will strongly advise her against being the kind of punter who would rather not be told when the Champion Hurdle favourite is coughing.The past six winners of the Ryanair Chase were French-bred, whilst previous festival winners (and placed horses) and second-season chasers have a fine recent record in the race, too.

It Sure Is (3.50) may follow him into the winner’s enclosure today, at Newbury.There was a lot of promise in the way he ran on into second on his hurdles debut at this track in November, so he was odds-on at Ascot. He travelled like the best horse and possibly too strongly, given conditions. Soon after the second-last, he was beaten.A wind operation three days later is a pretty clear hint as to what connections think happened that day to the future chaser, a well-related sort who won his point a year ago. Ground conditions will not be great today but I’m backing him to break his duck at odds of 7-4 or so. Eritage sets a fair standard but concedes 6lb to a rival with more potential.Another quite impressive point winner goes in the opener. Alnadam (2.10) is a Dan Skelton runner making a step up in trip for his handicap debut. That seems sure to help and his rating looks very reasonable, so 8-1 appeals.I’m surprised to be getting 7-4 about Miss Heritage (3.40) at Doncaster, given the way she bolted up at Huntingdon a week ago. She had shown before that a testing surface is right up her street and the forecast says she’ll get it again here.

From tailoring to tea making, the success of these enterprises is inspiring other young women to follow suitby  Thaslima Begum in BarishalIn the sprawling urban slums of Barishal, where monsoons and flooding are inescapable, life for women is hard. They are more likely to miss out on getting an education, and without the proper knowledge and skill set, many struggle to make a living. As they are more likely to live in poverty, they are more affected by disasters. But despite these challenges, with the help of livelihood grants from the Red Cross, many women in Barishal are finding innovative ways to eke out a living.Rina, 37, from Palashpur, wakes up early every day to start preparing for work. From a side road of a small slum with heavy foot traffic, she has been running a successful tea stall for the last two years. Brightly coloured crisp packets hang like a banner across her shopfront, where Rina sells roughly 160 cups of tea a day at 5 taka (under 5p) a cup.She uses the money to pay for her children’s education and managed to save enough to buy a small TV, which kept her busy during the World Cup. “Everyone here loves football, so I thought it would be a good investment,” she says proudly. “Not everyone in the slums owns a TV, so when they stop to watch, they also buy tea.”Married at 12, Rina now has five children and is the sole breadwinner of her family. Her husband suffered a stroke seven years ago and is no longer able to work. “I had no money to feed my children. I’d already taken out loans and was worried about our financial situation.” But in 2018, she received a small grant, which enabled her to kickstart her own business.Rina’s customers are mostly men labourers who come to drink chai during their breaks and catch up with their friends. Though they don’t speak to Rina much, she has learned a lot from listening in on their conversations. “They discuss everything – sports, politics, economics and the weather – information I never had access to while sitting at home.”Knowledge about the weather is particularly important for Rina as flooding hampers her business. “When the water comes in, people aren’t interested in sitting around drinking tea.”As she buys her tea wholesale, grown in north-eastern districts such as Sylhet, it’s important for Rina to know of incoming natural disasters that might affect her supply, so that she can plan ahead.Mahmuda, 36, has just had a baby and is making plans on how to balance her tailoring business with motherhood. After receiving a small business loan, Mahmuda was able to establish her tailoring business, which has been going from strength to strength. Dressed in a traditional shalwar kameez she made herself, Mahmuda gently rocks baby Diya back and forth.After going into labour early and losing a lot of blood, the doctors thought both mother and baby wouldn’t make it. Mahmuda was able to use the money she generated from her business to pay for hospital fees and basic necessities for her premature baby.“My business is slowly expanding, and I am able to feed my children,” she says. Mahmuda buys materials and sews clothes for the women in her community. She recently bought a wardrobe to safely store her clothing and protect it from flooding and the smell of the draining system outside her home.Mahmuda lives with her baby and two young sons, sick husband and elderly mother – all of whom she supports financially. Her father left when she was small, so Mahmuda’s mother raised her on her own. She is happy to now be able to take care of her in return. “I am also able to maintain my sons’ educational expenses, which I couldn’t do before – it was a real struggle to pay their tuition fees every month.”Every morning, before the sun rises, Mukhal, 28, sets off on a small dinghy to the local fish market. Dressed in a black burka and face veil so as not to draw attention, Mukhal is one of the few women who can be found in a market mostly dominated by men. Over time she has been able to develop her negotiation skills, so she gets a better price for the catch. She then fills her basket and carries it back to her village, where she sells the fish to her neighbours.Mukhal has led a difficult life. Forced into marriage at the age of 12 when her father died, she became pregnant at 15, and was beaten then abandoned by her husband who took another wife. Her home is on the banks of the river and prone to flooding. “Everything I do is for my son. My only hope is to be the best mother that I can be. I don’t want my son to live this kind of life – I want him to be educated and to have a good job. He wants to be an engineer! I work hard to pay for his education, so he doesn’t have to struggle like me.”Also driven by a strong desire to help her family, Chompa, 15, currently works in an electronics factory. Her father was a rickshaw puller, but because of his old age and the flooding from heavy rain, such arduous work has become difficult. So Chompa is now the main breadwinner in her family, spending all day at a factory where she uses her small hands to put together electronic goods destined for faraway places worlds she catches brief glimpses of through the TV screens that she helps assemble.Chompa earns approximately 4,000 taka (£36.30) a month, which she puts towards rent, food and her parents’ medicines. But a few months ago, while building a fan, it suddenly switched on and the blades sliced off three of her fingers. “There was blood everywhere,” she says. “After a few seconds, I passed out.” Though the factory covered her hospital bill, and at this time she is still receiving her monthly salary, a future without able hands feels uncertain – she says she is likely to be downgraded or dismissed from her role.“What can I expect from this life?” she asks. “I have many dreams, but there are no opportunities.” She wishes she could attend school, but like many young girls from Barishal, this isn’t always an option.

That’s what conservationist Dave Fairlamb tells me as we eat homemade cake on a silver-grey afternoon, watching meadow pipits above Newtown’s salt marshes.“From a nature perspective,” he says, “everything’s converging.”Dave has just launched Natural Links, offering birdwatching breaks and courses on the island, which has been focusing on its natural assets in the past year. Two Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust projects – the Wilder strategy and Secrets of the Solent – launched in 2019 Visit Isle of Wight published a Slow Travel Guide and the whole island was awarded Unesco Biosphere status. Last summer also saw the start of a white-tailed eagle reintroduction project, with six birds released on the island’s north coast.We see no eagles but as we stroll along the harbour we spot a swirl of dunlins – “about 600,” Dave estimates in an instant – and thrill to a fly-by of overwintering Brent geese, which purr softly as they pass. Winter is one of the best times for birding on the island, with large flocks of wildfowl and wading birds converging on the wetlands, and peak numbers of ers and grebes offshore.It’s a suitably serene start to my slow, off-season exploration, which has proved remarkably easy. The island is served by a year-round hovercraft service, which crosses the Solent in 10 minutes. It’s also laced with cycle tracks and hiking trails has a programme of public walks that runs through winter and enjoys a useful bus network – some bridleways even have bus stops. Then there’s the island railway, limited in scope (one line, Shanklin to Ryde), but a paragon of recycling: it uses 1930s London Underground trains – the country’s oldest rolling stock in regular use – and although these will be retired from May, the “new” carriages will be converted 1970s tube trains.I have been making the most of all of these services to put together a winter weekend. Having caught a bus to meet Dave in Newtown, I head onwards on foot, walking about six miles to Yarmouth via the coast path. It’s lovely in the winter light: I head down lanes of skeletal trees, then alongside streaks of wave-tickled shingle, the mainland visible across the water. I see few other people, though it’s not cold, and the bare trees make spotting birds – such as the finches and tits that throng together at this time of year – all the easier. I keep my eyes peeled for red squirrels, too.The Isle of Wight has had a coast path since the 1970s but – like the train – it’s about to get an overhaul.“We want the best coast path we can get,” says David. “It’s not just about seeing the sea but taking in other aspects. This could help regenerate the coast for a very small investment.”Our route from Yarmouth to Freshwater Bay illustrates the good and bad. We’re obliged to road-walk around a holiday park, which David doubts will change – but at the Needles a tweak to the path is expected, offering the best view of the chalk stacks and the historic New Battery rocket test site. The following stretch across Tennyson Down doesn’t need alteration: it’s already brilliantly big-viewed and bracing, even in wintry mizzle.I could have walked on to Ventnor, past 18 miles of cliffs, sandy beaches and steep chines (coastal gorges) but instead I use buses to reach the town on the island’s south-east with its own microclimate – on average it’s 5C warmer than mainland Britain.The next day I walk west, heading out of town along the esplanade, via a clifftop park and the slope-tumbling cottages of Steephill Cove, to Ventnor Botanic Garden. It displays a range of ecosystems as they would grow in the wild, and curator Chris Kidd tries to garden as little as possible.“We’re fairly hands-off,” he tells me as we amble from South African fynbos to Australian eucalyptus. “It makes the garden different and dynamic. The plants don’t obey the rules.” They do, however, provide environmental commentary. “Plants are showing the state of the planet more clearly than statistics. For instance, half-hardy plants we used to bring inside for winter can now stay out year-round.”Then there are the cycads. Fossils show these primitive plants grew here 280 million years ago, when CO2 levels were naturally high. For all human history, they haven’t grown outside in the UK – until now. And they’re not only growing but potentially procreating. Chris peels back the petals of the female flower – it’s like a furry, football-size artichoke – to reveal seeds clustered inside. “You’re one of the first to see this in this country for 200 million years.” I didn’t expect to have my mind blown by a botanical garden.I’m still thinking about this as I refuel in Cantina on Ventnor’s High Street, with its onsite bakery and all-day brunch menu (there are plenty of options to eat in winter in the bigger towns, though some cafes close). I take the bus to Sandown – where I chat about marine ersity, Unesco celebrations and the future of the bay’s National Poo Museum (hopefully reopening this year) with Arc and Artecology, two businesses passionate about social and natural regeneration – then continue on the train to Ryde.I have time for one last walk, so I follow the coast trail from Ryde along un-coastal paths to reach Quarr Abbey’s medieval ruins and the 20th-century red-brick replacement. David told me he’d love the new round-island trail to run through the abbey’s grounds but the Benedictine residents aren’t keen, insisting the land remain off-limits to allow them their quiet contemplation. Monks versus ramblers – it’s a very Isle of Wight type of fight.• The trip was provided by Visit Isle of Wight.

Their story is part of a growing trendBefore Qiguang Li could pass through customs and step on to US soil for the first time, he faced a three-hour detention where he learned that he needed to be more candid about his identity. It was September 2015, after a long flight from Shanghai to Los Angeles. Li came with another man, Wei Xu, who asked a US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer whether the two of them could go through the border screening together. “What’s your relationship?” asked the officer. They said they were friends. “Then you can’t.”So Xu went first and passed the screening. He forgot one important thing, though: Li’s travel documents were in Xu’s bag. Li, 37 at the time, spoke poorer English and couldn’t properly explain to the officer what had happened. After a while of anxious waiting, Xu returned to the checkpoint to look for Li, still unaware of his mistake, and they were both sent to a room for additional screening.In the secondary screening room – commonly referred to by Chinese travelers as the “small dark room” – Xu and Li waited almost three hours, believing that they would be denied entry. An officer asked them why one’s documents were in the hands of the other. Xu kept explaining that they were very close friends, until at one point the officer asked: “Are you two partners?”And then everything changed. Xu learned that if they had said they were partners from the beginning, they would have been allowed to go through border control together, avoiding all the drama. “But we felt kind of ashamed to say that,” he recalls.The unexpected incident was the prelude to a carefully planned trip into another country where their sexuality was much more accepted than at home. There were a few other things they didn’t mention to the CBP officers. Li and Xu, a gay couple who have been together since 2007, would walk out of the airport, get married two days later in Los Angeles, and, more important, start their journey toward parenthood.From 2015 to 2018, Li and Xu made four transpacific trips as part of their gestational surrogacy processes. They traveled nearly 50,000 miles, spent more than $200,000, and went through countless days of distress, all to fulfill the dream of having their own family.An increasing number of Chinese gay men, like Li and Xu, are traveling thousands of miles and spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to pursue a dream that is impossible at home. Like Li and Xu, many of them refer to their surrogacy process as their “journey”.Xu and Li met in Shanghai on 15 November 2007. They had both grown up in rural China before moving to big cities. They’d chatted online and had a few phone calls, but when they met in person, it was love at first sight. By 2014 they owned two properties together and had just started a small business, a dry cleaners in Shanghai. Because gay couples are not allowed to marry or adopt in China, they started thinking about surrogacy. Li was 36 Xu had just turned 30.For this story, I spoke to a dozen gay Chinese men who have begun or completed surrogacy in the United States. Almost all of them started considering it between the ages of 30 and 40, and they often discussed how one needs to be extremely devoted to the idea of having his own child before embarking on the lengthy and often excruciating surrogacy journey. But they also often mentioned mianzi, the nuanced Chinese concept that literally translates to “face” but also means social standing and dignity. Li says that for many gay men, the strong push for babies comes from the elder generation. The social and cultural norm in China, inherited from thousands of years of patriarchal traditions, is that having a descendant of your own blood is necessary for a good life. Although this idea is under fierce attack from some in China’s younger generation, it still resonates with many young Chinese people, including some gay men who are asked, or volunteer, to have a child to protect the mianzi of their parents and themselves.For some of the parents, that means going as far as pushing their sons into the surrogacy journey. David Wang, a single, gay man of 28, living in the south-western province of Sichuan, says it took years for his parents to accept his sexuality after he came out in 2013. But once they had, his parents offered to pay for all of the expenses of surrogacy – if he would start as soon as possible.“My parents’ main argument was that they don’t want me to end up ageing alone,” says Wang, who was single and hesitant at the time. He eventually acceded to his parents’ wishes and made it through the bumpy surrogacy journey as a single father. In February 2019, Wang and his mother flew to Atlanta to be at the birth of his son and take him back home.Dr Guy Ringler, a physician with California Fertility Partners, tours in China to give medical consultations about surrogacy. His patients include one of the country’s most influential gay figures, Ma Baoli, founder of the world’s biggest gay dating app, Blued.“I have several patients who told me that they came out to their parents after their baby was born,” says Ringler, who is a gay dad through surrogacy himself. “And they said that it was so much easier because the parents don’t care any more. Because they have grandchildren, it’s not that big of a deal anymore.”Xu and Li were in a similar situation. Li has a brother, which significantly eased his pressure from the family Xu doesn’t, so they made the decision that their first child would be Xu’s biological son.Xu didn’t come out to his parents until midway through the surrogacy process, when, after two trips to the United States, he felt unable to conceal it anymore. It was a smooth coming out. The parents soon joined the excitement over a prospective baby. The couple’s decision to have a child became the tie between two generations.Surrogacy was still a total mystery to most of the Chinese gay community when Xu and Li started their journey in 2014. None of their friends had done it. There was no guidance about what to do. The only thing Xu could find was one personal-experience post online. He reached out with some questions, but the author disappeared after a few messages.Xu took responsibility for researching everything they needed to do. In January 2015, eight months before he and Li were awkwardly detained by US customs, Xu went on a lonely trip to America to learn from scratch, with no knowledge about surrogacy except for the name and address of a Chinese American fertility doctor in California.In the five years since Xu and Li’s journey began, information about surrogacy has become easily accessible in China. Despite the censorship of words like “surrogacy” – which is officially banned in China, although the law isn’t always strictly enforced – low-profile sharing and guidance flourish in online forums. Commercial ads for assisted reproductive technology have grown into a major sponsorship source for local LGBTQ+ organizations and apps. On the Chinese messaging app WeChat, groups for gay dads and future dads have mushroomed. Xu and Li joined the first such group chat in 2016, which has a self-explanatory name: “Group for Dads of American Babies”. In 2019, the group had more than 100 members, to whom more than 10 babies were born that year.Several American surrogacy agencies and fertility clinics told me that they’d seen a surge in Chinese clients, starting in around 2013, with gay people making up a significant portion of the clientele. The number of Chinese clients at the Fertility Center of Las Vegas “exploded” in 2013, according to Joanne Zhou, the center’s director of China operations: “Before that, we would only have a few Chinese clients annually, but from then on, we had double digits of them every month.”“Economic development in China … has created a number of middle-class people, including those who are homosexual,” observes Zhijun Hu, who, under the noted alias “Ah Qiang”, has been working as an LGBTQ+ activist in China for more than 20 years. “This group of people has brought about a strong demand for babies.”The demand has lured many American agencies and clinics to expand their outreach to China through more advertisements and offline consultations. It has also created a new Chinese domestic market that specifically helps to connect the LGBTQ+ community to resources in the United States. Intermediary companies, many founded by the early surrogacy clients, provide packages of services, including everything from translation to references for attorneys and nannies. Having an American baby through surrogacy has now become a popular and accessible life goal for urban gay men in China.The day after they made it through customs, Xu and Li went to the HRC Fertility Clinic Pasadena center for sperm collection. At the time, they already had an egg donor in mind and were working on the legal contract.Surrogacy usually involves both a surrogate mother and a different egg donor. The sperm and egg are collected, the egg is fertilized, then the embryo is transferred into the surrogate’s uterus. The egg donor is sometimes referred to by Chinese intended parents as luanmei, or “egg girl”, though the term is now seen as derogatory by some. To match with an egg donor, intended parents choose from a database of profiles, which list the donor’s age, race, medical history, education and much more.According to several surrogacy agency staff and fertility doctors, straight Chinese couples are often strict about finding Asian egg donors, since many of them wish to pretend that the baby has been conceived naturally. Most gay couples don’t have this concern and, sometimes, even like the idea of having mixed-race babies, whose looks are often appreciated in China. Being flexible on race also means significantly less waiting time and cost, because the demand for Asian egg donors in the United States far outnumbers the supply.Xu and Li signed a contract with a Latina donor who was attending college and has dark hair and dark eyes – in their words, “less westerner-looking features”. They met her in person on their 2015 California trip. In January 2016, 28 eggs were retrieved from the donor, and 17 were successfully fertilized. Thirteen of the 17 embryos, referred to as “semifinalists”, survived into their fifth day in the lab and were given a genetic test. Eight healthy embryos passed the test. They hoped that one of these “finalists” would become their baby.The genetic testing, expensive but optional, not only enables parents to prevent implanting embryos with higher likelihoods of having genetic diseases it also allows them to foresee the gender.Gender selection, though legal in the United States, is banned in China, where gender-based discrimination and the troubled history of the one-child policy have resulted in an absurdly unbalanced sex ratio at birth. According to a recent World Economic Forum report, China has a female-to-male sex ratio at birth of 0.885 – for every 1,000 male newborns, there are only 885 females – ranking last among all 153 countries studied.Many US agencies and clinics confirm that gay Chinese intended parents have a noticeable preference for sons, though some note that they see the same preference across gay men of all nationalities.Xu wanted a son. The genetic testing reported that he had five male embryos to choose from among the eight healthy ones. It also told him that he had two “super embryos” that rated 6AA in HRC Fertility’s system, indicating the highest success rate for transfer. It seemed like there were plenty of good options, considering that they only needed one. But the couple would soon learn that high-quality embryos were not always enough.In September 2016, their chosen embryo was transferred to the surrogate. They received the good news 12 days later that the implantation was successful.Another week later, different news came: it was a biochemical pregnancy – a very early miscarriage, before the embryo grew large enough to be seen via ultrasound. Two men with little knowledge about women’s health, they had learned this term only several months earlier when the agency told them that their surrogate had already had one recent biochemical pregnancy. It was an accident, the agency told them, and would not affect the mother’s health or her ability to carry their child. But now Xu and Li were nervous and wavering. Should they continue with a surrogate who’d now had two miscarriages?They decided to give it another try. On 2 December 2016, the second embryo was successfully transferred. Everything looked good in the weeks that followed. One morning seven weeks later, however, Xu received an email from the clinic: the surrogate mom had just gone to a regular examination, and no fetal heartbeat could be detected.Li was devastated. He couldn’t focus on work when he was at the dry cleaners’. How could this happen to them again, he kept thinking: was it because the surrogate was too old? Was it because she hadn’t taken as much care as the Chinese tradition requires?Two of their “super embryos” were gone. They decided not to work with the surrogate again, and went back to searching the surrogate database.Xu and Li spent a full year looking through surrogate profiles and trying to match with an ideal one. Xu would refresh the online database two or three times a week to check whether a new surrogate had been added. Some made it clear in their profiles that they didn’t wish to carry a baby for Asian parents or same-sex parents. Most didn’t live in California, the only state Xu and Li had been to at that time, but they decided not to limit their options to one state. Colorado, Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania: “For a year we just flipped through their profiles and studied the American map, from the west coast to the east coast,” says Xu.In the US, legal regulation of surrogacy varies by state. About 10 states, including California, have either clear statutes permitting surrogacy or a history of favorable court orders. New York and Michigan forbid any form of compensated surrogacy, while Louisiana only permits it for married heterosexual couples. The majority of states fall somewhere in between, with no law specifically prohibiting surrogacy. Agencies require surrogates to live in the more friendly states and deliver the baby there to avoid legal troubles.Three times, Xu and Li made up their mind and chose a potential surrogate after speaking with her via video, but then she didn’t pass the screenings. A woman in Denver was tested and her uterine lining was found to be too thick a 19-year-old was excluded because the nurse doubted whether she could handle the responsibility at such a young age a woman in Kansas tested positive for chlamydia, the second time in her medical history, posing a threat of repeated occurrences. Their fourth choice, an Atlanta woman, made it past all of the medical and psychological screenings only to get cold feet at the last minute.Ann Yous had never considered surrogacy. A woman of Latin American and African-American descent in her early 30s, Ann (who asked me not to use her real name in this article to protect her privacy) lives in San Diego with her husband – a navy officer – and five kids.Then, at a holiday gathering, Ann was chatting with an acquaintance who had recently given birth. Ann asked how the child was doing. “Oh, it’s a baby girl,” the woman replied. “She’s fine. She’s in China.”“What do you mean she’s in China?” asked Ann.“It wasn’t mine. I was a surrogate.”At the time, Ann was pregnant with her fifth child. She had lost her parents at a very young age and didn’t have any siblings. She’d always wanted a big family and still loved the feeling of being pregnant. After a little research about surrogacy, Ann told her husband that she wanted to become a surrogate to help unfortunate families. “You are kidding,” he responded. “No, I’m really serious,” Ann said. “It’s easy for me to have one. What if I were to give that gift to someone?”She went through the routine of becoming a surrogate: a psychological questionnaire with tons of yes-or-no questions two different physicians combing through her medical history. One day in late 2017, Ann was told by the agency that she had been matched with a same-sex couple in China. She downloaded WeChat. In an hour-long video chat, Ann met Xu and Li for the first time.The first meeting was a back-and-forth of questions between Ann and the couple. They asked her about her daily life and her job, and she asked them about what their journey had been like so far. “I just wanted to see if they were talkative, or, if they were, you know, happy people,” recalls Ann. “They are. They are very warm.”The couple seemed a little shy to her, but Ann also found that they could easily get her jokes. Xu and Li liked Ann a lot too. They soon started to talk every day on WeChat.In February 2018, she successfully completed the embryo transfer, a five-minute process that, as she viewed it on the monitor, Ann compared to the flash of a firework. She kept messaging the couple about her medical visits. Then one day, she sent them a recording of the fetal heartbeat.When the pregnancy reached three months, Xu and Li flew to San Diego to meet Ann and her family. This was May 2018, their third trip to the United States, after two years of struggle and disappointment.Ann took them to a 4D ultrasound screening, where the couple got to see their future baby for the first time. The fetus was moving inside Ann’s womb, not much bigger than a peanut, but the head and limbs were discernible. They went to Ann’s house the next day and met her two youngest children. It looked so nice to have a big family, Xu thought. If it weren’t so expensive to have a child through surrogacy, they would consider another one.Xu estimates that he spent $30,000 more than expected before he met Ann. The miscarriages, the surrogates who backed out at the last minute, all of those costs were paid by the intended parents. At the time, Xu didn’t know that he would also be spending a lot more after his son was born, including a $6,000 bill on phototherapy for neonatal jaundice, because the baby didn’t have medical insurance. There are only a few insurance options for surrogacy newborns, and even fewer for those with international parents, and they can come with deductibles as high as $40,000. In the end, Xu and Li spent about $200,000 in total. The high cost of surrogacy means that it remains an option only for the privileged in China.As the delivery date approached, Ann knew that this would be a new experience. Her five children’s births had all been easy. But Xu’s baby was much larger, weighing almost 9lb at birth.On Friday 12 October 2018, Ann was admitted to the hospital after being told the day before that her vitals were too high and she needed an induced labor. Xu and Li, having arrived in San Diego three weeks earlier, went with her. Ann was given an epidural on Saturday morning, but things turned scary that night. “My water never broke, so they had to do it manually. And my vitals had dropped. I was in extreme pain,” she recalls. “That’s when I suggested, ‘Are we going to have a C-section?’ And they said, ‘Yeah, you are probably looking toward that.’ I said, ‘OK, can we let Xu and Li know?’”At 4 o’clock on Sunday morning, the baby was born. A nurse took the newborn to another room to meet Xu and Li, who had been at the hospital for 48 hours. Three years of planning hadn’t prepared them for this moment. The baby was paler and smaller than Xu expected. “He still looked so tiny,” he says. Xu and Li marveled at the newborn’s cone-shaped head and tried to determine if they saw any resemblance to Xu.When Ann came out of the delivery room a few hours later, they were waiting at the door to show her the baby. “I was very happy to see Xu and Li’s faces,” she remembers. “I know I was able to give them my gift they have so longed for. You could see in their eyes.” Three months earlier, the couple had invited her to think of an English name for the newborn. Ann named him Diego, as in San Diego, the city where they met and where the baby was born.Xu and Li took on different roles after the birth. Li looked after Diego at their rented San Diego apartment, while Xu drove around to apply for all of the legal documents they needed to bring the baby home.One month later, they flew back to China with the baby. They had sold their dry-cleaning business so that they could both stay at home and attend to the baby, and they moved back to Nantong, a smaller harbor city where Xu’s parents lived. There, they were able to afford a bigger apartment, where Diego would have more space to play, and it would be easier for the grandparents to help take care of him. Xu’s parents are overjoyed with their grandson, always asking Xu and Li to send Diego over and let Grandpa and Grandma take care of him.Another reason for their move is the cheaper cost of attending dual-language private schools in Nantong. Diego automatically obtained US citizenship, and Xu wants him to learn English in case he wants to go back at some point in his life.They consult with other gay dads about how to look after and educate a child. In the Group for Dads of American Babies chat group, they ask questions about practical things like supplements and discuss the challenges of parenting, which is still generally viewed as a woman’s duty in China.Ted Zhou, a member of the chat group who is expecting his baby to be born through surrogacy in 2020, says that most gay Chinese parents are particularly eager for information about how to parent. “An overwhelming number of Chinese dads don’t know how to parent. But in a family setting like this, you cannot avoid the responsibility.”Xu and Li still have daily conversations with Ann. Because of the cesarean and other complications during the delivery, her doctor doesn’t recommend surrogacy ever again. But she is happy to have been able to help Li and Xu on their journey. On Diego’s first birthday, Ann sent them a package full of baby clothes and toys.Diego learned to walk recently. With each passing day, he is getting more energetic and more adventurous, toddling around at home and grabbing the dog food to take a bite. Li often feels the burnout as a 40-year-old new dad: “When he takes an afternoon nap, I have to take one too. Otherwise … I just don’t have the energy to deal with him eight hours straight before he goes to bed.”Li and Xu once wanted two children, but they don’t know whether they want to repeat all of the effort, the thousands of miles of transpacific trips, not to mention spending another $200,000. “But if our conditions permit a second child,” says Xu, “we might consider a girl.”This story originally appeared on the digital storytelling platform Narratively.

The ban forced the cancellation of next week’s Geneva international motor show – a major fixture on the global car industry calendar.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the outbreak of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided they are used correctly.The Nigerian case is just the third to be confirmed in Africa, something that has puzzled health specialists given the continent’s close ties to China.According to Nigerian officials, the Italian man stayed in a hotel near the airport on the evening of 24 February, then continued to his place of work in neighbouring Ogun state. He was treated on 26 February at his company’s medical facility before health practitioners there called government biosecurity officers, who transferred him on 27 February to a containment facility in Yaba, Lagos. He was clinically stable with no serious symptoms, authorities said.This month the World Health Organization warned that porous borders, a continuing flow of travellers and poorly resourced healthcare systems meant the risk of an outbreak across Africa was “very, very high” and raised significant concerns about the ability of “fragile health systems” to cope.In recent weeks testing regimes and isolation facilities have been reinforced and there has been work on public messaging.“Nigeria has dramatically improved its ability to manage the outbreak of a major pandemic since the Ebola scare in west Africa in 2014,” Folasade Ogunsola, the professor of clinical microbiology at the University of Lagos, wrote on the Conversation website. “Any of the lessons from keeping the country free of Ebola have informed the steps taken since the news of the coronavirus epidemic first broke.”There is anxiety in many countries, despite reinforced protective measures. In Kenya there has been a backlash against authorities who allowed the first direct flight from China in two weeks. The high court ordered flights from China to be temporarily suspended.In other developments on Friday:Donald Trump was upbeat about the virus for a second day, saying on Thursday night that US agencies were doing a “fine job” and in the US and China, cases of Covid-19 were going down.But where the Dow led, Asian markets followed, with markets in Australia, China, Japan and South Korea all posting heavy losses.Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, pledged to protect the economy, as the Japanese island of Hokkaido declared a state of emergency and urged all residents to stay home this weekend.Nigeria is Africa’s most populous country, with 190 million people and numerous air links around the continent and beyond.“Given these recent developments globally and in Africa, it is not unlikely that we will have importation of Covid-19 to South Africa,” that country’s National Institute for Communicable Diseases said on Friday.Separately, South Africa said two citizens who had been working on the Princess Diamond cruise ship had the virus and would remain in Japan for treatment.South Africa plans to evacuate more than 130 citizens from Wuhan city in China, where the outbreak began. Officials did not say when that would happen.There are tens of thousands of African students in China, with a sizeable community in Wuhan. Relatives have been complaining that they face soaring prices, dwindling supplies and are under severe psychological strain.Egypt had the first case of Covid-19 in Africa, announced on 14 February. Algeria said it had a case on Tuesday, an Italian adult who arrived in the country on 17 February.That prompted the WHO’s regional director for Africa, Dr Matshidiso Moeti, to warn that the “window of opportunity the continent has had to prepare for coronavirus disease is closing”.The organisation’s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the epidemic was at a “decisive point globally” and could “get out of control” if affected countries did not move swiftly to contain it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2db7be379eb632f4722a26b086d966edebcc6aa/0_333_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87fef70348f2e338624d4c987dcc270e","title":"coronavirus truth myths flu covid 19 face masks","story":"The truth about the protective value of face masks and how easy it is to catch Covid-19Most people who are not elderly and do not have underlying health conditions will not become critically ill from Covid-19. But the illness still has a higher chance of leading to serious respiratory symptoms than seasonal flu and there are other at-risk groups – health workers, for instance, are more vulnerable because they are likely to have higher exposure to the virus. The actions that young, healthy people take, including reporting symptoms and following quarantine instructions, will have an important role in protecting the most vulnerable in society and in shaping the overall trajectory of the outbreak.Wearing a face mask is not an iron clad guarantee that you won’t get sick – viruses can also transmit through the eyes and tiny viral particles, known as aerosols, can still penetrate masks. However, masks are effective at capturing droplets, which is the main transmission route of coronavirus, and some studies have estimated a roughly five-fold protection versus no barrier. If you are likely to be in close contact with someone infected, a mask cuts the chance of the disease being passed on. If you’re just walking around town and not in close contact with others, wearing a mask is unlikely to make any difference.For flu, some hospital guidelines define exposure as being within six feet of an infected person who sneezes or coughs for 10 minutes or longer. However, it is possible to be infected with shorter interactions or even by picking the virus up from contaminated surfaces, although this is thought to be a less common route of transmission.Scientists were quick out of the gates in beginning development of a vaccine for the new coronavirus, helped by the early release of the genetic sequence by Chinese researchers. The development of a viable vaccine continues apace, with several teams now testing candidates in animal experiments. However, the incremental trials required before a commercial vaccine could be rolled out are still a lengthy undertaking – and an essential one to ensure that even rare side-effects are spotted. A commercially available vaccine within a year would be quick.A pandemic is defined as worldwide spread of a new disease – but the exact threshold for declaring one is quite vague. In practice, the actions being taken would not change whether or not a pandemic is declared. Containment measures are not simply about eliminating the disease altogether. Delaying the onset of an outbreak or decreasing the peak is crucial in allowing health systems to cope with a sudden influx of patients."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e78c31b44912c934a46f8cfde703e30303d6b5e8/0_173_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20e42a86343bc0e2a9ca728e7fb19dd3","title":"red pandas are actually two separate species study finds","story":"Scientists found substantial ergences between Chinese red pandas and Himalayan red pandas in three genetic markers Red pandas, the bushy-tailed and russet-furred mammals that dwell in Asia’s high forests, are not a single species but rather two distinct ones, according to the most comprehensive genetic study to date on these endangered animals.Scientists said on Wednesday they found substantial ergences between the two species – Chinese red pandas and Himalayan red pandas – in three genetic markers in an analysis of DNA from 65 of the animals.The recognition of the existence of two separate species could help guide conservation efforts for a mammal as its numbers dwindle in the wild, they added.Chinese red pandas are found in northern Myanmar as well as south-eastern Tibet, Sichuan and Yunnan provinces in China, while Himalayan red pandas are native to Nepal, India, Bhutan and southern Tibet in China, the researchers said.International experts have estimated a total population of roughly 10,000 red pandas in the wild.“To conserve the genetic uniqueness of the two species, we should avoid their interbreeding in captivity,” said Chinese Academy of Sciences conservation biologist Yibo Hu, who along with colleague Fuwen Wei led the study published in the journal Science Advances. “Interbreeding between species may harm the genetic adaptations already established for their local habitat environment.“Scientists previously recognised red pandas as ided into two subspecies. While it had been proposed that these were separate species, the new study was the first to provide the genetic data necessary to allow such a judgment.The Himalayan red panda is the scarcer of the two and needs urgent protection because of low genetic ersity and small population size, Hu said. The Yalu Zangbu River most likely marks the geographical boundary separating the two species, not the Nujiang river as previously believed, Hu added.The two species also differ in coloration and skull shape.“The Himalayan red panda has more white on the face, while the face coat color of the Chinese red panda is redder with less white on it. The tail rings of the Chinese red panda are more distinct than those of the Himalayan red panda, with the dark rings being more dark red and the pale rings being more whitish,” Hu said.Slightly bigger than a domestic cat, red pandas have thick fur, a short snout and pointed ears, spending much of their life in trees and dining mostly on bamboo. Major threats to red pandas include deforestation and degradation of their habitat due to human development.Despite similar names, red pandas and giant pandas are not closely related. Giant pandas are one of the world’s eight bear species.Red pandas, with no close living relatives, are sometimes called living fossils as the only remaining member of the Ailuridae mammalian family. They are probably most closely related to a group that includes weasels, raccoons and skunks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c999fce77c3a90b7915bdc0c9905f89c4524fca/591_429_4058_2435/master/4058.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ebefba2ed86c19f96c881ab216c92b0e","title":"what is coronavirus symptoms wuhan china pandemic spread covid 19","story":"What are the symptoms caused by the virus from Wuhan in China, how does it spread, and should you call a doctor?It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city.The virus can cause pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.In the UK, the medical advice is that if you have recently travelled from areas affected by coronavirus, you should:More NHS advice on what to do if you think you have been exposed to the virus can be found here, and the full travel advice to UK nationals is available here.China’s national health commission has confirmed human-to-human transmission, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere.As of 25 February, the outbreak has affected 80,000 people globally. In mainland China there have been 2,663 deaths among 77,658 cases, mostly in the central province of Hubei. More than 12,000 people affected in China have already recovered.The coronavirus has spread to at least other 30 other countries. The most badly affected include Japan, with 850 cases, including 691 from a cruise ship docked in Yokohama, and four deaths. Italy has recorded 229 cases and seven deaths, while South Korea has recorded 893 cases and eight deaths. There have also been deaths in Hong Kong, Taiwan, France, Iran and the Philippines.There have been 15 recorded cases and no fatalities to date in the UK.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic.No. A pandemic, in WHO terms, is “the worldwide spread of a disease”. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people, and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact. Generally, the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest, with few cases in children."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59c182c55d1854e6002f6aeec27921f2dc935ca6/67_402_4793_2878/master/4793.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ccf00ebab0d785815a0ff400ee89c316","title":"coronavirus spreads across the world in pictures","story":"As cases of people infected with the coronavirus or Covid-19 grow rapidly in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the rest of the world is bracing for a pandemic"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c930ea46a4151552515cba21f52362d1626759c/0_0_5760_3840/master/5760.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=f2268916e8e3d5fc67f61b9426a87906 1440w","title":"coronavirus live updates latest news china wuhan stock markets update","story":"First case in Wales Nigeria, New Zealand and Lithuania also report first cases as WHO says epidemic could get ‘out of control’.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillAfter seven years of Liffey cycle scheme stalemate, cyclists and campaign groups were for the most part relieved, if not totally delighted, when last April the National Transport Authority (NTA) announced its chosen route.Any joy was short-lived, however, when it emerged a few months later the project would not be in place until 2024 at the earliest.Dublin’s cyclists must be used to disappointment by now, particularly when it comes to the Liffey scheme.It’s hard to fathom how a 5km cycle route could possibly take so long to install, given almost half of it, the section from the Custom House heading east, is already done. Also, it just needs to run on an existing road beside a river – essentially a straight line.For five years Dublin City Council couldn’t manage to design a scheme everyone liked, and so failed to choose any scheme at all.Quays ersionsThe council’s transportation department presented eight different “preferred routes” for the path from 2012-2017, but couldn’t secure the sanction of councillors for any of them. Some were discarded because they would inconvenience drivers with ersions off the quays, others would have taken cyclists away from the riverside for a distance, which campaigners felt detracted from the integrity of a “Liffey” cycle route.Some of the eight options were sensible and workable, some were terrible and shoddily planned. The worst being the one, proposed in 2015, that involved erting buses through an apartment block under construction in Smithfield. One of the few apartment complexes being built in the city at the time, it is now completed and occupied.In 2017, after more than €360,000 had been spent on the project, the NTA called a halt and said it would take over the decision-making. It took them until 2019 to come up with a plan, essentially the same as one discounted by the council several years ago that had cycle lanes on both sides of the river.Route trialSome campaigners weren’t happy with this option, favouring a two-way northside-only route, but were even less happy when it emerged the project wouldn’t be in place until 2024. Last month, they called for the city council to trial the two-way route for eight to 12 months.But the council, showing unexpected backbone as far as this project is concerned, has decided to put in place as much of the NTA’s plan as possible, barring the expensive engineering works such as boardwalks and instead of a short trial, keep those measures in place until the NTA project is completed.It’s not perfect, and it is particularly disappointing large sections of the south quays are excluded. However, given a recent Garda report found the quays to be among of the most dangerous roads in the State, it is very encouraging the council is stepping up and putting a basic framework in place, until the NTA gets around to building on it."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4181069.1582312165!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"waste materials to be airlifted from mv alta wreck","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe MV Alta, a 77m Tanzanian registered cargo ship which had been abandoned and drifting in the Atlantic Ocean for 17 months, washed up on rocks near Ballycotton in east Cork last weekend.

Particularly, she said, to what extent cost and environmental concerns were informing decisions.She said of particular concern was the need for an ecologist to examine local sea life for signs of pollutants.“It’s a simple thing. Maybe they have done all of this but there isn’t enough information available, and if they haven’t done it, why not?”Keep awayMs Dubsky said despite local restrictions, efforts would be made by environmentalists to examine limpets, a marine mollusc, on rocks in the area to see if they are falling off.Members of the public have again been urged to stay away from the wreck which is on a dangerous and inaccessible stretch of coastline and in an unstable condition.As part of the operation, access to a local cul-de-sac road has been restricted to residents. The council has also said that lands along the shoreline are private.Under law, it is an offence for anyone to interfere with a wreck or to attempt to board it.A Revenue official has been appointed Receiver of Wrecks by the Department of Transport, a function necessary to manage the possession and disposal of vessels which wash ashore."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4185547.1582834321!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus what we know so far about how ireland is affected","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPassengers wearing protective face masks arrive at the Hongqiao railway station in Shanghai.

Especially those who may be returning?Two Irish-German passengers who were on board the Princess Diamond cruise ship docked off Yokohama, Japan, tested positive for the coronavirus. They are not normally resident in Ireland are being treated in hospital in Japan.Elsewhere, a hotel on the island of Tenerife was placed under quarantine when an Italian doctor staying there tested positive for the coronavirus. The Irish Department of Foreign Affairs is providing consular assistance to a number of Irish citizens in the area.Two other Irish citizens were quarantined in Liverpool in England after being evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship moored off Japan. Both subsequently left quarantine and reported they were healthy and safe.But does all this mean we should avoid overseas travel?The Department of Foreign Affairs has advised against all non-essential travel to China, and against all travel to the Chinese province of Hubei.It has also advised Irish citizens not to travel to Japan, Hong Kong, Iran, Singapore, South Korea, as well as four regions in northern Italy where restrictions have been imposed, and which have direct flights with Ireland.What if I’ve recently been to an affected area?Anyone who has been to an affected region (mainland China, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Iran and four regions in northern Italy) in the last 14 days and is experiencing symptoms should self-isolate and call their GP.The same applies to anyone who has been in close contact with a confirmed case of the virus in the last 14 days and is experiencing symptoms. Anyone who has been to an affected region in the last 14 days, and are well, should visit hse.ie for advice.So is this going to mess a lot of people’s holiday plans up?A number of secondary schools across Ireland have decided to cancel school trips to Italy in light of the latest travel advice.Alexandra College in Dublin confirmed it had cancelled the school’s annual trip for transition year students to Italy after a teacher, who organised the trip and is from Italy, consulted with local Italian authorities.Irish holiday makers are also reportedly cancelling trips to Italy. In some cases, these included bookings for holidays that are not due to take place until the summer. Travel agents have also said that, for now, Irish people are stalling on making bookings.Is that affecting airlines? And what about other businesses, and our tourism industry?The airlines are feeling the pinch alright. Earlier this week, investors began ditching stocks that they believed were vulnerable to a European outbreak. One of the biggest was Ryanair, whose shares tumbled 13.4 per cent in Dublin.Ryanair says all its flights are operating as normal but added that it would follow any public health instructions that were issued. The same is true of Aer Lingus.Elsewhere, Junayeo Air confirmed last week that it had decided to postpone the scheduled launch of its proposed Dublin-Shanghai service on March 29th until further notice.It’s not just the airlines either. Many Irish companies have operations in affected regions or depend on them for supply lines, and they are also dealing with some of the fallout. For example, one of our biggest companies, Kerry Group, said sales in China are set to fall by about 30 per cent in the first quarter of the year.What are we going to do about citizens from affected regions coming here?The DAA, which operates Dublin Airport, has said it is currently “business as usual” at the airport with flights from affected regions landing as normal.The Government is doing what it can to limit mass influxes from affected regions. The surge in cases in Italy has forced the cancellation of Ulster’s Pro14 rugby game against Benetton in Treviso due to take place on Saturday.Minister for Health Simon Harris has also called for the Ireland’s Six Nations rugby match against Italy on March 7th to be called off. Minister for Sport Shane Ross has said more sporting fixtures could be cancelled if necessary to prevent the spread.Could we not just screen people as they arrive in Ireland?No. Entry screening for Covid-19 “doesn’t work, wouldn’t work” and would be a “waste of resources”, the chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan has said.Fair enough. Can expect other big events, like the St Patrick’s Day Festival, to follow suit then?The cancellation of mass gatherings, such as large conferences with a significant number of participants from a highly affected area, “may be justified in exceptional circumstances” according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.Decisions to cancel however will be co-ordinated with organisers and public health authorities on a case-by-case basis. But it’s possible we will see more major events cancelled.What about schools?During a containment phase, school closures “are not justified”, the European Centre for Disease Control said.“There is also no data to support informed decisions on proactive school closures in terms of their anticipated effectiveness in mitigating the ... epidemic, due to the unknown level of transmission of this virus among children.”However, should transmission of the virus become widespread, school closures “may be necessary”, even though they probably would not reduce the impact of the epidemic. For now though, it seems unlikely.What are the chances of someone testing positive for the virus here and what happens then?Harris has said the outbreak in Italy and in neighbouring countries means the chances of an Irish case in the coming days or weeks has increased significantly.He has designated the virus as a notifiable disease, which means doctors will be obliged to routinely notify the HSE when a case is diagnosed.The Department of Health is also understood to be looking at bringing the condition under legislation that would allow for a person with the virus to be detained and isolated."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4185565.1582725192!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"what is coronavirus and what should i do if i have symptoms","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCoronavirus: Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficultie.

Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city.What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?The virus can cause pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?In Ireland, the medical advice is that if you have recently travelled from areas affected by coronavirus, you should call the HSE to inform them. If you are well and have not been in contact with coronavirus, you will be told to watch out for symptoms over the next 14 days. You can continue with your daily life and go to work as usual.If you have had close contact with a person who has coronavirus, you will be monitored for 14 days. A doctor will phone you daily to make sure you remain well. You will be asked to stay separate from other people as much as you can for 14 days. This includes not going to work.If you’ve been to an affected area in the last 14 days and have a cough, fever (high temperature), feel short of breath or have difficulty breathing people are advised to phone their GP or emergency department, stay indoors, avoid contact with other people, follow this advice even if your symptoms are mildMore HSE advice on what to do if you think you have been exposed to the virus can be found here.Should I avoid overseas travel?The Department of Foreign Affairs has advised against all non-essential travel to China, and against all travel to the Chinese province of Hubei.\u0026nbspThe full travel advice to Irish nationals is availablehere.Is the virus being transmitted from one person to another?China’s national health commission has confirmed human-to-human transmission, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere.How many people have been affected?As of February 25th, the outbreak has affected 80,000 people globally. In mainland China there have been 2,663 deaths among 77,658 cases, mostly in the central province of Hubei. More than 12,000 people affected in China have already recovered.The coronavirus has spread to at least other 30 other countries including Japan which also had hundreds of cases from a cruise ship, Italy, South Koream Hong Kong, Taiwan, France, Iran, the UK and the Philippines.Why is this worse than normal influenza, and how worried are the experts?We don’t yet know how dangerous the new coronavirus is, and we won’t know until more data comes in. The mortality rate is around 2 per cent in the epicentre of the outbreak, Hubei province, and less than that elsewhere.For comparison, seasonal flu typically has a mortality rate below 1 per cent and is thought to cause about 400,000 deaths each year globally. Sars had a death rate of more than 10 per cent.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic.Have there been other coronaviruses?Severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals. In 2002, Sars spread virtually unchecked to 37 countries, causing global panic, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing more than 750. Mers appears to be less easily passed from human to human, but has greater lethality, killing 35 per cent of about 2,500 people who have been infected.Is the outbreak a pandemic and should we panic?No. A pandemic, in WHO terms, is “the worldwide spread of a disease”. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people, and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact. Generally, the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest, with few cases in children. – "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4187197.1582833494!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"what should you do if you think you might have coronavirus","story":"At a media briefing in Dublin the HSE has said that  there have been 90 suspected cases of  Covid-19 tested here, but none have been positive for the virus.

Or were you in a hospital where coronavirus patients were being treated?If you fit any of these criteria, call your GP. Do not call to the surgery in person.The GP will question you as per a normal medical consultation. Based on the outcome of this discussion, he or she may then contact the local public health doctor for further consultation.If the GP decides you need to be tested, he or she will contact the emergency department of your local hospital, where staff will be informed that a person requiring testing is arriving. Staff will make the appropriate arrangements, such as donning protective gear.New protocolThe protocol from this point on changed earlier this week. Before that point, people requiring tests were transported by ambulance to hospital. This will still apply in cases where people are very ill, but in cases where the person is deemed to be fit and able to travel, he or she can be brought to hospital by someone such as a partner or other household contact.On arrival the person is tested and clinically assessed. If necessary on clinical grounds, they may be hospitalised, but those deemed to be fit to go home will be sent home.Once home, they will be contacted by a public health specialist providing advice about self-isolation.The test is sent to the National Virus Reference Laboratory in UCD where a result is ready within 24 hours. Effectively this means samples received in the afternoon will not receive results until the following day.If the test is negative – as all in the Republic have been to date – the person is free to resume normal life, but advised to keep an eye on any symptoms.If the result is positive, the person would be taken to hospital, mostly likely the national isolation unit at the Mater hospital in Dublin, and treated there."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Chief medical officer says it is \u0026lsquolikely\u0026rsquo more cases will be importedAlexandra, Heidi, Hollie and Odhr\u0026aacuten grew most in popularity last year\u0026lsquoNightmare\u0026rsquo life in Dublin home prompted one accused to do \u0026lsquosomething terrible\u0026rsquo, court heard\u0026lsquoSmall number\u0026rsquo of those in contact with woman with coronavirus in NI identified as at risk43-year-old was \u0026lsquotrusted member\u0026rsquo of Patricia O\u0026rsquoConnor\u0026rsquos extended familyWhen charged by garda\u0026iacute the 50-year-old replied \u0026lsquono thanks no\u0026rsquoSeven men aged between 18 and 20 are arrested, released on bailNational emergency group chair warns current operations to deal with floods may be suspendedASTI insists Department of Educaton circular aimed at resolving row is \u0026lsquounacceptable\u0026rsquoDepartment is planning to \u0026lsquofrontload\u0026rsquo 10,000 special needs assistants to mainstream schoolsHighly critical review commissioned by Ratoath College is likely to be influential\u0026lsquoSmall number\u0026rsquo in contact with infected person are at risk, says chief medical officerLiving nightmare for Clare family in elevated home surrounded by floodwater for mileX-ray reviews show \u0026lsquono concerns\u0026rsquo for Irish children fitted with Magec scoliosis deviceAdult patient travelled from Italy through Dublin into Northern IrelandStation will open to public 7am-9pm but will run \u0026lsquofull operational 24-7 policing service\u0026rsquoNew HSE figures show rise in payment made to public residential centresCitizenship ceremonies put on hold last year following ruling on unbroken residenceStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4187817.1582892589!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"baby names 2019 emily and jack retain top spots","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAlexandra, Heidi and Hollie were the girls’ names growing most in popularity last yearJack and Emily were the most popular baby names registered last year, according to the Central Statistics Office (CSO).

Photograph: Michael McHughPA WireNorthern Ireland’s chief medical officer has said he is confident health authorities in Northern Ireland will be able to contain the spread of coronavirus. The first case on the island of Ireland was confirmed on Thursday in a woman who had flown to Dublin from northern Italy and then travelled on to Belfast. She followed the advice from the Public Health Agency (PHA) and contacted her GP and then “self-isolated” at home while awaiting the results of tests. The “presumptive positive” result has been sent to laboratories in England for verification. The PHA has said she is receiving “specialist care”. Dr Michael McBride said at a press conference in Belfast on Thursday that a “small number” of those in contact with the patient had been identified as at risk. Speaking on BBC Radio Ulster on Friday, he said he was “confident that the steps that the inidual took upon return to Northern Ireland, based on advice that was relayed, and indeed the prompt and rapid action by PHA colleagues, will ensure that we’re able to contain this,” he said. “What we do not have in Northern Ireland at this point in time, and this is really crucially important, we do not have cases in Northern Ireland that have occurred in Northern Ireland,” he said. “We don’t have community transmission in Northern Ireland.” “Basically speaking, that has enabled the authorities to put in step everything that has been planned and prepared for to limit spread of the virus to the wider community,” he said. On Friday, Dr John Cuddihy, the director of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, told journalists in Dublin that “each of the stages of this person’s journey have been identified and all relevant contacts in all of those stages of transport have been contacted (and) traced.” People who sat within two rows of the woman on the plane have been contacted. It is not clear whether she travelled from Dublin to Belfast by public transport, but both Iarnród Éireann and Translink have carried out a “sanitising clean” of the Dublin to Belfast Enterprise trains as a “precautionary measure”. A special isolation unit has been established at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast. Travellers who have recently returned from high risk areas, including specific parts of northern Italy, should self-isolate at home and contact their GP by phone, the PHA has advised. “Washing your hands regularly will help prevent flu and other viruses spreading,” the PHA said. Anyone who becomes unwell and suspects they may have been exposed to coronavirus should stay at home and phone their GP for advice.

Photograph: Paula BronsteinGetty ImagesAs I sat waiting for my flight at Los Angeles International Airport, it was hard not to notice the number of prospective passengers wearing surgical masks. A mother and her adult son sat across from me and I watched as the son pulled his mask up above his mouth in order to slurp a pre-flight meal underneath it. By the time I had returned home to Dublin, the internet was plastered with images of people in airports wearing not only surgical masks but also plastic water jugs over their heads. The new strain of coronavirus has spread rapidly and people seek to protect themselves any way they can. The masks that many are now wearing have their origins in the development of antiseptic surgery in the 19th century and the 1918 influenza pandemic. There is debate over the efficacy of the masks to prevent the transmission of minute viruses, with some medical professionals arguing that regular hand-washing is much more effective. But there is a sense of comfort in a mask: it feels as though it is filtering the air you breathe in. It was, however, originally designed to filter the air you breath out. The mask was intended to protect the patient from the surgeon rather than the other way around.Joseph Lister is usually credited with the introduction of antiseptic practices in surgery during the 1860s and 1870s, at least in Britain and Ireland. The discovery of living germs as the causative agents of disease by Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch suggested to Lister and others that these germs might also cause sepsis in wounds. Carbolic acidLister introduced the washing of hands, instruments and wounds in carbolic acid. By the turn of the century, even further measures to maintain a clean surgical environment were introduced. Among these was the surgical mask (which had in fact been invented many decades before).If we think of a surgery today, we imagine the staff in scrubs, masks and gloves in a bare, clean room. Yet the scrubs and masks were actually introduced much later than other antiseptic methods. In 1898, an Edinburgh surgeon was only imagining a time in the future when “everyone concerned in an operation . . . shall cover each natural orifice of the body with an antiseptic mask, and clothing themselves in raiment scientifically pure, shall pass into an atmosphere freed from germs”. Instead, the surgeon often pounded across permeable wooden floors, his clothes covered with a non-sterilised linen “overall” and was often joined by a number of spectators. In 1905, the Irish doctor J Rupert Collins performed a series of experiments to prove that exhalations from the mouth (especially when singing or talking) contained bacteria to demonstrate that masks should be worn in the surgery. In 1914, another doctor felt that further demonstrations of the mask’s effectiveness were required.By the time the influenza pandemic began in 1918, however, surgical masks seem to have been in more regular use. And so the idea of using the mask to protect doctors (and nurses and family and friends) from patients grew in popularity. A great successDoctors wrote in to the British Medical Journal declaring that the surgical mask was a great success in preventing the spread of the disease. One claimed that a crowded ship of thousands of soldiers kept down the cases of influenza through isolation and the use of masks. Others cited the experience of using masks in outbreaks of pneumonic plague and other diseases spread by coughing. State public health services promoted the use of masks by those nursing the sick, but soon the wider public also began wearing masks.Photographs taken during the “Spanish flu” of 1918 to 1920 attest to the popularity of the gauze mask: policemen, typists, commuters, and even baseball players can all be seen wearing masks in an effort to ward off the disease. At the time, health professionals worried that these masks gave the wearers a false sense of security: to be effective they had to be cleaned (or changed) regularly and worn constantly. People rarely met these stringent conditions. Surgical masks have continued to appear in public every time there is a serious outbreak of a respiratory disease. Diseases like coronavirus cause us to look at the inside of a crowded airport terminal or a bus in the way that pioneering surgeons looked at operating theatres they wanted to keep clean: instead of harmless air they saw a soup of invisible germs.Dr Juliana Adelman lectures in history at Dublin City University"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4187687.1582883737!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus uk confirm 19 cases as more countries report first infections","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEmployees from a disinfection service company sanitize a subway station in Seoul, South Korea, on Friday.

Because the trajectory is not stable, 2020 CD3 will eventually be flung away from the planet.The new moon is thought to be between 1.9 and 3.5 metres across.Kacper Wierxchos, a researcher at the NASA-funded Catalina Sky Survey, made the discovery with colleague Theodore Pruyne.He hailed the rare sighting as big news, tweeting: It\u0027s a big deal as, out of one million known asteroids, this is just the second asteroid known to orbit Earth.A spokesman for the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory\u0027s Minor Planet Center, which collects data on minor planets and asteroids, said: Orbit integrations indicate that this object is temporarily bound to the Earth.No link to a known artificial object has been found. Further observations and dynamical studies are strongly encouraged.The spokesman added: The story of 2006 RH120 is not without controversy, however, as its orbit appears similar to some Apollo-era spent rockets boosters, and therefore some scientists believe it may be an artificial object.”Meanwhile, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the car-sized object was not the Telsa Roadster he launched into space in 2018, which is now orbiting the Sun.

We\u0027ve known for years that the next great pandemic was going to come from a virus that leapt from animal to man. I wasn’t surprised when bats at a meat market in Wuhan, China were implicated in the latest scourge. It wasn’t a question of if but when. Nor am I surprised by the sluggish response we’ve seen from authorities around the world.Although the coronavirus’ suspected mortality rate of  2 per cent sounds low, it’s about the same as that of the Spanish flu of 1918 and that virus killed between 40 and 100 million people. To contain coronavirus, therefore, we must be vigilant, perform far more tests, and we must not cut corners.Before I became a doctor, I spent years studying the viruses that live in bats, everything from Ebola to rabies to Nipah Virus, because my research team suspected that bats were the linchpin for the next outbreak. We feared bats because they have a unique trait: the ability to suppress their immune system in the presence of an infection (this is thought to help cope with the stress of flying). It means bats can live with pathogens that kill humans.We knew to be fearful of these flying mammals. Around the time I became an infectious disease specialist in the United States, a federally-funded program called PREDICT was assembled to monitor infectious diseases in bats all over the world. Scientists used many of the techniques I helped to develop 15 years ago, gathering information that could be used to create vaccines, new medicines, and inform crucial public health decisions. PREDICT was shuttered in October, and I am unaware of any such programs operating elsewhere.It’s clear we took our eye off the ball. Now we\u0027re scrambling to catch up. But how? As the novel coronavirus sweeps the world - we\u0027re at more than 80,000 cases and counting - the virus has crept into 47 countries so far. Expect that number to rise. But where will it go next? A truism in epidemiology is that the more you look, the more you find, and many countries aren’t looking all that hard. The countries that have done the best job in containing the virus - Singapore among them, where recoveries are now outpacing new cases - were swift to ban inbound flights from China, quick to quarantine potential victims, and crucially, have conducted rigorous early testing.This is key. While leaders focus on quarantines, vaccines, and new medicines - all of which are important - we rarely hear about the development of new tests to detect deadly pathogens once an epidemic begins. This failure happens with every outbreak and it must change.China made major strategic mistakes at the onset. Once they identified a cluster of pneumonia associated with the meat market in Wuhan, they closed the market, citing “renovations”. Then, when they discovered how the virus was transmitted, they didn’t immediately reveal that it could be spread from one human to another. After eventually sharing this finding, they swung in the other direction and undertook a severe quarantine the largest in history. The World Health Organization initially said this was a mistake but eventually acknowledged the quarantine helped. The rest of the world needs to be proactive. Other countries must aggressively test people to indicate just how prolific this virus actually is. In Iran, of the 139 cases reported, 19 have died. This suggests we’re missing far too many patients, perhaps thousands.It\u0027s useful to take a look at how testing is done to understand why it’s failing in some countries. During any outbreak, the first step is for the government to quickly develop a new test (in this case, it took China about four weeks) then produce a lot of them. The testing relies on a form of nucleic acid amplification that’s rather straightforward once the virus has been sequenced. Private companies and academic laboratories can generally step in to manufacture them but must follow strict quality controls. This system usually works (in the US, it didn’t earlier this month the tests which the FDA sent to 50 states were found to be flawed and had to be recalled - which means we are very much in the dark as to the true scale of the spread there.)Things are looking more encouraging in the UK. The NHS has already tested more than 7,000 patients, 15 of which have so far been positive, and has now started piloting a home-testing scheme which means high-risk iniduals don’t have to leave self-isolation to undertake it. Select hospitals in the UK have been instructed to test a broad swathe of patients, including patients with flu-like symptoms who have no known link to a coronavirus case or travel to China, South Korea, or Italy. These are important steps they will hasten diagnosis, ensure patients are properly triaged, and will help contain this pandemic. Coronavirus is scary because there\u0027s so much uncertainty. We still don\u0027t know exactly where it came from, we don\u0027t know how long patients may remain asymptomatic after infection, and we don’t know where the virus is heading next. In many industrialised nations, including the United States, we still don\u0027t have the means to rapidly and efficiently diagnose coronavirus. As a result, the true extent of this pandemic remains a mystery. Some, including Harvard epidemiology professor Marc Lipsitch, predicts that by the end of the year, anywhere between 40 to 70 per cent of people will be infected with the virus globally - though this does not mean everyone will be severely ill as a result. We do not know how many people have only suffered mild symptoms and not sought medical treatment. Again, without proper diagnostics, we cannot understand the full scope of the problem. And downplaying the spread of a virus when it first hits is not the answer.Next time a bat passes one onto a human (and it will happen), we must get proper diagnostic testing up and running before we focus on anything else. It\u0027s a lesson we continue to relearn. Matt McCarthy is Assistant Professor of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine and the author of “Superbugs: The Race to Stop an Epidemic.”The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

He had a first class brain and, rather like Robin Williams\u0027 character in Dead Poets Society, an uncanny ability to command pupils\u0027 attention.Colleagues admired how students excelled under his tuition, remembering him as the reason that a string of pupils from an ordinary Worcestershire school had gone on to study at Oxbridge.But while some students no doubt benefited from his academic attentions, others claim there was a high price to pay. Three of his former students have told The  he was a predator who used his position to groom female pupils for sex.They have decided to speak out now because they say the MeToo movement has helped them realise that what they had previously characterised as a relationship with an erudite older man was actually a wholly abusive breach of trust on his part.They hope it will embolden other women in similar positions to speak out about abusive former teachers.One alleged victim, Kerry, said: He would have sex with us or sexually assault us in his office on the school premises.She was just 15 when they first had intercourse, she claimed, saying: He saw me flirting with boys and he was concerned I was going to lose my virginity, so he wanted to get in there first.Mr Wilkinson told The  he did not acknowledge any of the alleged relationships. He said the allegations were turning into a nightmare for him, but that he had no further comment to make. I don\u0027t want to say anything … I have nothing to say about it. I\u0027m sorry, he said.According to his alleged victims, the grooming would start with him putting stickers on their locker, playing footsie under the desk or inappropriately placing a hand on a knee at the theatre.They claimed he would hold private study groups at his house, offer students lifts home and invite his favourites to use his school office. Some of the alleged relationships would last for years, the women have said.One former student, who claimed she first had sex with Mr Wilkinson when she was 16, said: I would have a relationship with him as a boyfriend … it was always at his house. We never went anywhere else because it was a secret.After the relationship ended, she said, she put it in a box and never really dealt with it.The three women claimed he went to great lengths to keep the relationships secret. Kerry said he even encouraged her to move to a different school to ensure that he was safe.But he still engineered situations in which they would be alone together, she said. He is alleged to have sexually assaulted her in his school office. He also offered her private tuition to get her into Cambridge (which she eventually did), charging her parents for two-hour lessons that were largely spent in bed, she claimed.Kerry alleged that he seduced her by reciting poems about his lover\u0027s deep velvet amber eyes and her lips learning, yearning.She believed they were written for her, but said she later learnt she was not the only conquest to whom he recited them. He allegedly recycled the verses for another woman he started dating after she left school and would go on to marry and later orce.He also loved to discuss his favourite books, notorious pornographic novel \u0027The Story Of O\u0027 and \u0027Lolita\u0027, Vladimir Nabokov\u0027s infamous tale of a middle-aged professor who believes he is seduced by an underage child, Kerry said. They were his manuals for living, she added.Enthralled by him, she did everything he asked, and alleged their abusive relationship continued until she was 18, by which point, she said, they\u0027d had sex hundreds and hundreds of times.Speaking from her home in Sydney, she described how he would ask her to pose for pornographic pictures and, she claimed, once borrowed a school video camera to film her naked. She was later humiliated to learn that his other lovers allegedly saw these pictures.But she was not the only one he was said to have slept with. He allegedly entered a sexual relationship with another student while he was abusing his position to have a relationship with Kerry.He was married to a fellow teacher, Susan Wilkinson, when he started teaching at the school. Ms Wilkinson left him after she became pregnant with his child, and he allegedly moved on to another colleague. Before the marriage disintegrated, one of the school\u0027s male teachers tried to warn Susan of Mr Wilkinson\u0027s behaviour, telling her that putting David in the sixth form is like putting him in a sweetshop.One other alleged victim recalled finding a trove of mementos: Polaroid photographs, letters and cards from girls who looked to be aged around 16. They were in their underwear – they weren\u0027t naked, but it was clear there was a sexual kind of scene to them, she said.Mr Wilkinson allegedly targeted very bright girls. The three who spoke to The  also admitted that they tended to come from difficult backgrounds. Some were still at school when the relationships began, they said. With others, Mr Wilkinson allegedly waited until after they completed their A-levels.According to the women, he would have sex with them at every opportunity.Kevin O\u0027Regan, who became head teacher in 1997, after Mr Wilkinson retired, recalled some hearsay about an incident with a sixth-former that had taken place before 1985 but was told it had been dealt with.Mr Wilkinson was so adept at ensuring his behaviour was kept secret that head teachers in charge at the school for the near-quarter of a century he was there say they were entirely unaware of any alleged abuse.When approached by The , one former head said he remembered Mr Wilkinson as an excellent, brilliant teacher. He added: Nearly all the arts candidates who went to Oxbridge, and there were a number, were taught by him and he was the reason they got in. He was one of the best teachers I ever came across. Very able.What was startling about Mr Wilkinson\u0027s alleged campaign of abuse was the complexity of the web of deceit it would involve.One woman, Lucy, claimed Mr Wilkinson initiated their sexual relationship in his car after a party at his house to celebrate the end of A-levels. She later learned that he went home after their encounter and allegedly initiated a sexual relationship with another of her classmates.Lucy returned to the school the following year to re-sit some exams. He was displeased but they carried on their affair regardless, she said.She believed that formative experience set a pattern for many of her subsequent relationships. She – and every other former student The  spoke to – wept as she recounted the impact it had on her life.I\u0027m not sure that our laws are sufficiently sophisticated at this point to understand the deep and profound ramifications of this kind of behaviour – that it is not only lifelong but also generational, she said. What\u0027s happened to me has also affected my children in ways that are very hard to describe.Like Kerry, she spent most of her life oblivious to the possibility that she might have been one of a string of girls to have become involved, and believed Mr Wilkinson had singled her out early on because she was somehow special.It was only in the wake of the MeToo movement that they started to reappraise things – and the discomfort they felt crystallised into horror.Kerry added: I think of him as almost evil – as a Svengali character who used his charisma and all of the tools at his disposal, literature and poetry, for sinister ends, to get what he wanted.And I think of him as being narcissistic. Up until this whole process, I think I was still somewhat grateful to him for what I had seen as a positive impact on my life, but I now realise that any positive impact was overstated and came at a huge, huge price to me.The allegations have been reported to the police. But the women\u0027s stories do not necessarily account for all those whose lives he allegedly affected.One girl who rejected his advances – whether wittingly or unwittingly – was allegedly subjected to a campaign of bullying by the man supposed to be nurturing her.Hillary Hinchliff, who went on to have a successful career in education and became principal of a renowned school in India, wept as she recounted how Mr Wilkinson made her life hell after she turned down his offer of a key to his private office.At the end of the day, he\u0027s a sick inidual who should have been stopped, she said.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/08/22/TELEMMGLPICT000190666464_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"everyone benefits school children taught polite respectful disciplined","story":"Michaela, Britain\u0026#39s \u0026#34strictest school\u0026#34, has much to teach other institutionsVisit some of the country’s best-performing schools, and you’ll notice that many of them have one thing in common: discipline. Across the UK, dedicated headteachers have been trying all sorts of common-sense solutions to curb unruly behaviour and low-level disruption in the classroom – with impressive results.Some have banned mobile phones, asking students to place them in lockers at the start of the day. Others, like the City of London academies, have implemented lining up, with teachers quietly escorting pupils in some years to class after break and lunch. This ensures the class stays together, lessons start on time and the corridors are silent – allowing classes to continue without disruption.At Dixons Trinity Academy in Bradford, students, with the support of their families, agree to a number of learning habits, such as making sure they are in the correct, simple uniform every day, that they always respond appropriately to adults and they bring all the necessary equipment to class.And of course there’s Michaela, Britain’s “strictest school”, in north-west London. Reading and writing exercises are conducted in silence, and pupils are given demerits for things like forgetting their pens or slouching in class. Last summer, Michaela’s pupils – many of them from disadvantaged backgrounds – famously triumphed in their GCSEs.These schools are achieving great things thanks in part to the calm, disciplined and nurturing environments they have created. As part of our ambitious plans to level up across the country, I want this kind of culture to be the norm, particularly in the one in three schools judged not to have good enough behaviour by Ofsted.Improving discipline is one of our key priorities, which is why we are today inviting schools with the best records on behaviour to join a team of experts and lead a £10 million programme to improve discipline across the system.We plan to build partnerships between schools that are leading on this issue with those who want to turn their own cultures around, allowing institutions with poor behaviour to learn from those with the best. They will be led by former teacher and behaviour expert Tom Bennett, along with a team of current and former headteachers with broad experience of creating disciplined environments in their own schools.Why have we made this a priority? Well, first, because poor behaviour is dreadful for teacher morale. Our teachers are incredibly hardworking and dedicated professionals. Having to deal with unruly pupils and disruption on a daily basis adds to their workload and stress, and is driving many from the profession they love. Teachers say disruption is one of the key reasons they would consider leaving the job, while almost a fifth of those working in secondary schools said they lacked confidence in their school’s ability to deal with challenging behaviour.Those teachers deserve better, and they have the full support of the Government to impose discipline in their classrooms and create calm and nurturing environments for teaching.But, perhaps most importantly, instilling good behaviour in our classrooms would bring the most benefit to pupils themselves, no matter who they are or where they come from. Ill-discipline doesn’t just hold back the brightest pupils, but those most in need of attention, and those who are most likely to fall behind in school when their education is disrupted.Like everyone else in their class, those pupils deserve to be taught in an environment where they can be challenged so they can fulfil their full academic potential. Being taught the tenets of good manners, courtesy and respect for others is also immensely valuable for pupils as they learn to cope with complex relationships in adult society. This can also help turn around local areas as the emerging generation take on leadership roles in their communities.We already have some of the best teachers in the world, and a truly stretching curriculum. But it takes just one incident of bad behaviour to derail an entire lesson. By backing schools to tackle such behaviour, we can finally put teachers in a position to focus on what they do best – to teach.Gavin Williamson is the Education SecretaryThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Last year the country went for more than a fortnight without burning a single lump of the black stuff, thought to be the first time since the 1880s.At around 8am on Thursday, coal was supplying only 1.9 per cent of the country\u0027s energy needs. It has largely been replaced by gas, which provided 50 per cent\u0026nbspon Thursday morning, and wind, 17 per cent.However, coal is still being used for industrial purposes, such as steelmaking.Drax already burns biomass at the site, a renewable fuel which consists of plant material and animal waste. However its critics say that it causes deforestation, and encourages farmers to grow monocrops just to be burned.Mr Gardiner said: “By using sustainable biomass we have not only continued generating the secure power millions of homes and businesses rely on, we have also played a significant role in enabling the UK\u0027s power system to decarbonise faster than any other in the world.”He added that the business is still “fully committed” to the regions its operates in “and with the right regulatory and investment framework is well positioned to deliver its plans for Yorkshire and the Humber”.It came as the company said adjusted profit before tax hit £142 million in 2019, up from £37 million the year before, on revenues of £4.7 billion, up around 11 per cent.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 In Cold Blood by Truman Capote (1966)The first classic of the true crime genre was Capote’s investigation of the four murders that rocked the small farming community of Holcomb, Kansas. He spent six years fascinated with killers Richard Hickock and Perry Smith, after travelling to research the tragedy with his childhood friend Harper Lee. “No one will ever know what In Cold Blood took out of me,” Capote once said. “It scraped me right down to the marrow of my bones. It nearly killed me. I think, in a way, it did kill me.”210 I\u0027ll Be Gone in the Dark by Michelle McNamara (2018)In 2018, more than 50 rapes and 12 murders in California were finally matched to a single culprit after 40 years. It’s possible to argue the killer would have gone undiscovered forever if not for the extensive research left behind by journalist Michelle McNamara after her death in 2016, which became this portrait of obsession. A true crime enthusiast since childhood, she gave the Golden State Killer his catchy name and turned national attention back to his crimes. The most compelling passages show her holed up with evidence, compulsively re-reading the gory details. “There’s a scream permanently lodged in my throat now,” she writes at one point. 310 Happy Like Murderers by Gordon Burn (1998)Gordon Burn’s unflinching exploration of Fred and Rosemary West exposes the decay that lay at the heart of rural England. He shines a light on the brutality of the murderous couple’s backgrounds - not to make them sympathetic, but rather to show how a legacy of cruelty can curdle into violence.410 Helter Skelter by Vincent Bugliosi (1974)The best-selling true crime book of all time covers the infamous Manson murders, which have stayed in the public imagination now for 50 years. Buglioso, prosecutor in the Tate-LaBianca trials, lays out the events that inspired movies like 2019’s Oscar-winning Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Buglioso resented attempts to turn the cult leader into a mystical folk hero. In this book, he instead exposed how Manson exploited people who were already susceptible to anti-social ideas. It remains our primary source of information on a murderous motive that combined white supremacy, drug-fuelled paranoia, and Beatles conspiracy theories.510 Party Monster by James St James (1999)James St James paints an indelible picture of New York nightlife in this infamous tale of drugs, sex, fashion and murder. The 1996 death of a drug dealer named Angel kicked off a scandalous series of events that rocked the city’s party scene. As a club kid himself, the author shows us how he became the confidant of one of the killers, and experienced the dark side of a subculture that embraced total anarchy.  Formerly titled Disco Bloodbath, the novel later became a feature film starring Macaulay Culkin. 610 The Journalist and the Murderer by Janet Malcolm (1999)This unusual story focuses more on the ethics of journalism than the violent crimes of its titular murderer, Jeffrey MacDonald. Journalist Joe McGinniss befriended the man, who had murdered his pregnant wife and two daughters, and then wrote a book based on everything MacDonald had told him.710 Unbelievable by T Christian Miller and Ken ArmstrongRecently adapted for a Netflix series starring Toni Collette, Merritt Wever, and Kaitlyn Dever, Miller and Armstrong’s story of a shocking rape investigation won them numerous awards, including the 2016 Pulitzer Prize. The book’s central crime took place in Lynnwood, Washington, in 2008, and justice wasn’t delivered until other cases emerged years later and 1,300 miles away in Colorado.810 Columbine by Dave Cullen (2009)Two decades later, the Columbine shootings are as sadly relevant as ever. Dave Cullen’s 2009 examination of the massacre shows how the media storm obscured the tragedy at the time, creating myths instead of soberly investigating the circumstances. Nuance and accuracy are key to the book’s success. Cullen pushes past the image we have of the two shooters to get to the truth.910 The Red Parts: Autobiography of a Trial by Maggie Nelson (2007)Maggie Nelson is known today for genre-defying critical successes like The Argonauts and Bluets, but this 2007 book about her aunt’s murder shows an early foray into true crime. The case had haunted her since childhood, and when new DNA evidence emerged to lay blame 35 years after the tragedy, Nelson observed the new suspect’s trial closely. Through the prism of her family’s grief, the book is beautifully lyrical at times. Her mother’s perspective is particularly crucial, as she mourns her younger sister’s short, turbulent life. Nelson remains rational and skeptical throughout, however, commenting on the nature of crime and punishment in enthralling prose. 1010 The Stranger Beside Me by Ann Rule (1980)Ann Rule aspired to be a crime novelist in the 1970s, but she couldn’t have known that her best-selling debut would be inspired by the man who worked next to her. 110 In Cold Blood by Truman Capote (1966)The first classic of the true crime genre was Capote’s investigation of the four murders that rocked the small farming community of Holcomb, Kansas. He spent six years fascinated with killers Richard Hickock and Perry Smith, after travelling to research the tragedy with his childhood friend Harper Lee. “No one will ever know what In Cold Blood took out of me,” Capote once said. “It scraped me right down to the marrow of my bones.

I think, in a way, it did kill me.”210 I\u0027ll Be Gone in the Dark by Michelle McNamara (2018)In 2018, more than 50 rapes and 12 murders in California were finally matched to a single culprit after 40 years. It’s possible to argue the killer would have gone undiscovered forever if not for the extensive research left behind by journalist Michelle McNamara after her death in 2016, which became this portrait of obsession. A true crime enthusiast since childhood, she gave the Golden State Killer his catchy name and turned national attention back to his crimes. The most compelling passages show her holed up with evidence, compulsively re-reading the gory details. “There’s a scream permanently lodged in my throat now,” she writes at one point. 310 Happy Like Murderers by Gordon Burn (1998)Gordon Burn’s unflinching exploration of Fred and Rosemary West exposes the decay that lay at the heart of rural England. He shines a light on the brutality of the murderous couple’s backgrounds - not to make them sympathetic, but rather to show how a legacy of cruelty can curdle into violence.410 Helter Skelter by Vincent Bugliosi (1974)The best-selling true crime book of all time covers the infamous Manson murders, which have stayed in the public imagination now for 50 years. Buglioso, prosecutor in the Tate-LaBianca trials, lays out the events that inspired movies like 2019’s Oscar-winning Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Buglioso resented attempts to turn the cult leader into a mystical folk hero. In this book, he instead exposed how Manson exploited people who were already susceptible to anti-social ideas. It remains our primary source of information on a murderous motive that combined white supremacy, drug-fuelled paranoia, and Beatles conspiracy theories.510 Party Monster by James St James (1999)James St James paints an indelible picture of New York nightlife in this infamous tale of drugs, sex, fashion and murder. The 1996 death of a drug dealer named Angel kicked off a scandalous series of events that rocked the city’s party scene. As a club kid himself, the author shows us how he became the confidant of one of the killers, and experienced the dark side of a subculture that embraced total anarchy.  Formerly titled Disco Bloodbath, the novel later became a feature film starring Macaulay Culkin. 610 The Journalist and the Murderer by Janet Malcolm (1999)This unusual story focuses more on the ethics of journalism than the violent crimes of its titular murderer, Jeffrey MacDonald. Journalist Joe McGinniss befriended the man, who had murdered his pregnant wife and two daughters, and then wrote a book based on everything MacDonald had told him.710 Unbelievable by T Christian Miller and Ken ArmstrongRecently adapted for a Netflix series starring Toni Collette, Merritt Wever, and Kaitlyn Dever, Miller and Armstrong’s story of a shocking rape investigation won them numerous awards, including the 2016 Pulitzer Prize. The book’s central crime took place in Lynnwood, Washington, in 2008, and justice wasn’t delivered until other cases emerged years later and 1,300 miles away in Colorado.810 Columbine by Dave Cullen (2009)Two decades later, the Columbine shootings are as sadly relevant as ever. Dave Cullen’s 2009 examination of the massacre shows how the media storm obscured the tragedy at the time, creating myths instead of soberly investigating the circumstances. Nuance and accuracy are key to the book’s success. Cullen pushes past the image we have of the two shooters to get to the truth.910 The Red Parts: Autobiography of a Trial by Maggie Nelson (2007)Maggie Nelson is known today for genre-defying critical successes like The Argonauts and Bluets, but this 2007 book about her aunt’s murder shows an early foray into true crime. The case had haunted her since childhood, and when new DNA evidence emerged to lay blame 35 years after the tragedy, Nelson observed the new suspect’s trial closely. Through the prism of her family’s grief, the book is beautifully lyrical at times. Her mother’s perspective is particularly crucial, as she mourns her younger sister’s short, turbulent life. Nelson remains rational and skeptical throughout, however, commenting on the nature of crime and punishment in enthralling prose. 1010 The Stranger Beside Me by Ann Rule (1980)Ann Rule aspired to be a crime novelist in the 1970s, but she couldn’t have known that her best-selling debut would be inspired by the man who worked next to her. “They call the stuff ‘Wuhan-400’ because it was developed at their RDNA labs outside the city of Wuhan.”\u0026nbsp“Wuhan-400 is the perfect weapon,” he continues.Spotted by author Nick Hinton, the extract has since gone viral, launching a number of bizarre conspiracy theories as to the origins of coronavirus.“That’s creepy af”, one Twitter user wrote in response.Another added: “That’s crazy. He probably didn’t have a clue when he was writing it.”Koontz, a prolific US novelist best known for works including Demon Seed and Odd Thomas, has yet to respond to the viral thread.Coronavirus, meanwhile, continues to spread around the world. More than 2,800 people have been killed by the virus worldwide, leading to concerns about a global pandemic.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That’s lower activity, Mr Carney told Sky News.There’s less tourism - as you can see on our streets here in the UK.

It has largely been replaced by gas, which provided 50 per cent\u0026nbspon Thursday morning, and wind, 17 per cent.However, coal is still being used for industrial purposes, such as steelmaking.Drax already burns biomass at the site, a renewable fuel which consists of plant material and animal waste. However its critics say that it causes deforestation, and encourages farmers to grow monocrops just to be burned.Mr Gardiner said: “By using sustainable biomass we have not only continued generating the secure power millions of homes and businesses rely on, we have also played a significant role in enabling the UK\u0027s power system to decarbonise faster than any other in the world.”He added that the business is still “fully committed” to the regions its operates in “and with the right regulatory and investment framework is well positioned to deliver its plans for Yorkshire and the Humber”.It came as the company said adjusted profit before tax hit £142 million in 2019, up from £37 million the year before, on revenues of £4.7 billion, up around 11 per cent.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

So far that technology has been integrated into a range of different clothing, including Levi\u0027s denim jackets and a backpack, allowing people to skip songs or take photographs by swiping their outfits.But it now appears to be coming to football kit, as part of the tie-up with Adidas\u0027 football ision.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThat is according to a very cryptic tweet that teased an announcement on 10 March.Included in the tweet were the logos for the Fifa mobile game, Google\u0027s Jacquard fabric, and the Adidas logo. It included the message play connected.It also included the hashtag adidasGMR. A blog post from October, on the site Footy Headlines, suggested that name could refer to a special insole that would be placed inside football boots and used to track the player wearing them.WhatsApp group chats can be found on GoogleThe insoles could be used to track touch, control, speed and kicks, that post indicated.The same post indicated that the Adidas app that links with them will connect with the Fifa Mobile Ultimate Team mode, and that players would be given in-game rewards for their play in real life.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The swimmer, who won 200m gold in Rio, as well as 400m and 1,500m freestyle golds in London, subsequently asked CAS for a public trial.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSun\u0027s fellow swimmers reacted angrily after FINA initially cleared him of any wrongdoing, with Britain\u0027s Duncan Scott refusing to shake his hand on the podium at the world championships last year in Gwangju. Sun responded to the snub by firing back: “You’re a loser, I’m a winner”.The 10-hour CAS hearing was broadcasted on the court\u0027s website showed Sun to be evasive at times under questioning that was hampered by severe translation issues between Chinese and English. The CAS panel\u0027s verdict was delayed until all parties got a verified translation.The 6-foot, 7-inch (2-meter) Sun, the first Chinese swimmer to win Olympic gold, has long been a polarizing figure in the pool. Rivals branded him a drug cheat at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, and two competitors refused to stand with him on medal podiums at the 2019 world championships.Now banned until February 2028, the 28-year-old Sun cannot defend his 200-meter freestyle title in Tokyo.The World Anti-Doping Agency went to CAS after a FINA tribunal only warned Sun. The first ruling was that anti-doping protocol was not followed, making the samples invalid, and cited doubts about credentials shown to him by the sample collection team.WADA requested a ban of between two and eight years for a second doping conviction.Sun served a three-month ban in 2014 imposed by Chinese authorities after testing positive for a stimulant that was banned at the time. The ban was not announced until after it ended and he never missed a major event.That first case led to criticism of FINA for appearing to protect one of the sport\u0027s biggest stars in a key market.Live Rugby union coverage direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They believe the explosion came from the heart of the Ophiuchus cluster of thousands of galaxies: a large galaxy at the center contains a colossal black hole.Black holes don\u0027t just draw matter in. They also blast out jets of material and energy.The first hint of this giant explosion actually came in 2016. Chandra images of the Ophiuchus galaxy cluster revealed an unusual curved edge, but scientists ruled out an eruption given the amount of energy that would have been needed to carve out such a large cavity in the gas.The two space observatories, along with radio data from telescopes in Australia and India, confirmed that the curvature was, indeed, part of a cavity.The radio data fit inside the X-rays like a hand in a glove, co-author Maxim Markevitch of NASA\u0027s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, said in a statement. This is the clincher that tells us an eruption of unprecedented size occurred here.The blast is believed to be over by now: There are no signs of jets currently shooting from the black hole.More observations are needed in other wavelengths to better understand what occurred, according to the team.The findings appeared in the Astrophysical Journal.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This year, 14 states will vote on Super Tuesday, including the nation’s most populous states, California and Texas.\u0026nbspOf crucial importance, we will see the impact of former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg’s non-traditional, self-funded run, that has seen him invest up to $400m to win support in many of the states voting on Super Tuesday.In order to win any delegates (a candidate needs to amass 1,991 delegates to achieve the party’s nomination) candidates have to win at least 15 percent of the vote in the state.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThere are enough delegates at stake that a strong showing for senator Bernie Sanders could cement his spot as Democratic nominee. At the same time, should he fail to overcome his top rivals, the race could become a serious competition between two or potentially even three candidates.\u0026nbspHere’s a state-by-state breakdown to keep you informed heading into Super Tuesday.\u0026nbspAll demographic numbers are from the Centre for American Progress’ “States of Change” report.\u0026nbspThe Yellowhammer state has 61 total delegates – including 9 superdelegates – up for grabs on Super Tuesday.\u0026nbspDemographically, Alabama is one of six states – along with the District of Columbia – where black Democratic voters are the majority. Democratic voter composition in Alabama in 2016 was 71 per cent black, 26 per cent white and three per cent other races.\u0026nbspAccording to 2016 Census data, Alabama has a slightly higher than average population of iniduals 65 years of age and older – almost 20 per cent versus the 19 percent average. The state’s median household income is more than $10,000 less than the national average, $42,830 versus $53,657 nationally. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspFiveThirtyEight predicts former Vice President Joe Biden will take the state, giving him a 61 percent chance at victory in the state. Mr Sanders is the next most likely to take the state with a 21 percent chance of victory, and Mr\u0026nbspBloomberg is in third with a 17 percent chance of victory.There are 31 pledged delegates available to win in Arkansas including five superdelegates. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspDemographically, Arkansas’ Democratic voters are 69 per cent white, 36 per cent black, three per cent Hiic and two per cent other races.According to 2016 Census data, the state has a slightly higher than average population of iniduals over the age of 65 – 21 per cent versus the national average of 19 per cent – and a median household income of $41,262 more than $10,000 less than the national average of $53,657.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He was given a 38 per cent chance to win the state. Mr Bloomberg is the next most likely to win, with a 28 per cent chance of victory. Mr Biden has a 25 per cent chance to win. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThe most recent poll examining the Arkansas electorate from Talk Business \u0026amp PoliticsHendrix College Poll reported that Mr Bloomberg had a 3.2 percent lead over Mr Sanders in the state.\u0026nbspJust under 20 per cent of respondents said they’d vote for Mr Bloomberg, while 16.4 per cent said they’d vote for Mr Sanders and 18.5 per cent said they’d vote for Mr Biden.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThis is a massive prize.

The state’s median household income is $61,933, which is $2,276 higher than the national average. Despite this, the state’s poverty rate, 14.5 per cent, is slightly higher than the national average of 13.6 per cent.\u0026nbspMr Sanders is overwhelmingly favoured in polling to win California. FiveThirtyEight gives Mr Sanders an 89 per cent chance to win, with poll averages predicting Mr Sanders will win between 24 per cent and 43 per cent of the vote and win an average of the state’s 227 pledged delegates.

Police officers rescued the residents and escorted them to a nearby station for their own safety but, outnumbered, retreated as the vandalism of the mosque began.“Look at my home, the whole thing is burnt, as well as all our possessions – clothes, utensils – everything,” he said. “There were 11 of us living here, what do I do now? Where will we go?”Videos then went viral of men chanting the Hindu nationalist slogan “Jai Shri Ram” (glory to Lord Ram) as the mosque was vandalised and two flags, one of India and the other showing the Hindu deity Lord Hanuman, were hoisted on its tallest minaret.Due to confusion over the name of the neighbourhood, the Delhi police mistakenly said on Twitter\u0026nbspthat this mosque had not been targeted and that the videos were “misinformation”, prompting the major right-wing channel Times Now to run unquestioningly a prime-time segment denouncing the “fake” footage – and those sharing it – on TV.Yet the buildings around the mosque were still smoking when The Independent met with the Muslim victims of the attack on Wednesday, as well as the Hindu neighbours who tried to protect them from the mob of “outsiders”.Khursheed, who works driving a battery-powered autorickshaw, said he does not blame Hindus for what happened, but rather the heightened tensions created by the Modi government’s new citizenship laws. Critics say the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), and a planned National Register of Citizens (NRC), discriminate against Muslims and threaten India’s secular constitution.He and other residents said they didn’t recognise the attackers.\u0026nbsp“I don’t know the people who came and did this – it is all just politics,” he said. “I am just very sad for the situation my family is now in.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Yet seeing it gutted by fire was still not as painful as what the rioters did to the adjacent mosque.“We were targeted because we are Muslim,” she said. “All the shops belonging to Muslims were burnt, while none of the Hindu shops were touched. They want to single us out, to separate us from the other religions.”She said Hindus and Muslims in the neighbourhood had “never had any problems”.“We have always prayed together, Hindus and Muslims, in mosques and temples. We have always believed that we are all equal.”Like the other residents, Parveen says she bears no ill feelings for her Hindu neighbours, saying that when the mob first came from outside “they tried to save us”.I am just very sad for the situation my family is now inBut she says she doesn’t know whether the situation will calm down across the city after what happened. She is just thankful she wasn’t home to see the mosque attacked. “It is totally broken and burnt, we feel worse about that than what happened to our own homes. We were so surprised when we heard they targeted the mosque, we never thought that people could be capable of such a thing.”A little down the road from the burnt-out mosque, shattered shop fronts and piles of debris, a group of Hindu neighbours watch the clear-up and are nervous about speaking to the media.Trump to press India PM on anti-Muslim law Labour MP Abrahams denied entry to India and ‘treated like criminal’Death toll rises to 24 in Delhi riots with mosque set on fireModi on course for big defeat as Delhi rejects ‘poisonous’ campaignA 39-year-old man, who asked not to be named, said he welcomed prime minister Narendra Modi’s call for calm on Wednesday afternoon, but that it should have come on Monday.He admits the situation is “very tense”.\u0026nbsp“We have always been living together amicably here, there was no tension, we spent our childhoods together. Now these outsiders have come in and this has happened, and it is the people living here who have to deal with the tension.”He points to four armed police officers sitting outside the burnt-out mosque. “At least there is some protection now, but we were expecting it earlier. There should have been some procedure in place,” he saidFor some, though, the four officers provide little comfort. A Muslim man whose house across the road from the mosque was burnt, who did not give his name, said the violence had turned into “the most terrible outcome possible” for this neighbourhood.We were so surprised when we heard they targeted the mosque, we never thought that people could be capable of such a thingClearly nervous, he says he is only returning briefly to retrieve any key documents that – he hopes – may have survived the fire. “All the documents, all the possessions we have, we had to just leave them behind and just run for our lives,” he said. “If they are not there, how will I get a job?

An inanimate object consisting of mesh and leaves bore the full, bilious brunt of virtue-signalling nastiness from those who have probably also been hash-tagging the crap out of #bekind for the past week.“If I was Yorkshire Tea I’d be very worried about my supporters all being racist Brexiteers — perhaps their super-Brit TV ad is responsible ” said one of the politer posts. Others advocated that the brand should be boycotted.A spokesman for Yorkshire Tea responded: “On Friday, the Chancellor shared a photo of our tea.Politicians do that sometimes . We weren’t asked or involved — and we said so the same day. Lots of people got angry with us all the same.”That’s because trolls aren’t interested in the whys, wherefores or, quite frankly, any context at all.They’re simply virtue-signalling from a position of self-bestowed righteousness to try to give meaning — via their target’s legion of followers — to their own sad existence.Yorkshire Tea’s response was impressively measured, but the last line has all of us thinking: “Who are these worrying idiots ”Last week it was reported that actor Freddie Fox was spat at in the street because of something his cousin Laurence said on the BBC’s Question Time.His cousin. Not even Laurence himself, who, by the way, should also be able to walk the streets without fearing physical or even aggressively verbal repercussions from someone who simply disagrees with his opinion.When moronic irrationality is restricted to the echo chamber of Twitter, it can be switched off and ignored.But when it spills out of the Twittersphere and impacts on a victim’s family or livelihood, then surely society as a whole must unite to stop it Because, one day, it could be you. Or, worse, your children.Former Met detective Philip Grindell was called in to help politicians deal with online abuse, which rose by  per cent last year.After retiring he helped a “global icon” who was scared for their le.“It was a famous person who was getting death threats,” says Philip, , who has now started a company called Dfuse Global to anticipate and assess the risk of online abuse.He discovered the death threats were coming from someone in the UK who had mental health issues and weren’t considered a risk to the personal safety of his client.Several years ago, Sky News confronted a woman who had repeatedly trolled the McCanns after the disappearance of their daughter Madeleine in .The woman, in her s, who had, “previously grappled with mental illness”, killed herself just days after being confronted.So tackling online trolling is clearly a minefield to navigate, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try.Just because much of it comes from a place of deep sadness or instability in the troll’s le, why should that allow them to inflict damage on other people with impunity This isn’t about disagreeing with someone’s views in a rational, well-argued way.It’s about downright nastiness and threats to someone’s mental or physical well-being. And it needs to be tackled by the State, not just private companies.We have to provide full ID before we board a plane, so why not insist on it when setting up an online account which must include our real name followed by a unique number Then, currently anonymous trolls might think twice before whipping up hate about someone they don’t even know and we can all drink our teain peace.OH gawd, here it comes again – the tyranny of a “no make-up” photo posted by Hollywood glitterati.Stop. It. Now.The latest salvo was fired by Gwyneth Paltrow, who hosted a “natural” dinner party to promote her well-being website Goop and invited, among others, Demi Moore and Kate Hudson.Demi, who has spent £squillion on cosmetic surgery, looked great. As well she might.Equally, I once got in a lt with Kate Hudson, who is quite simply one of the most stunning women I have ever seen.And then we have Gwynnie herself, who has the radiant glow of a woman who spends the national debt of a small country on skin treatments and products.The reality, of course, is that there’s little meaning to this “no make-up” dinner party other than for the attendees to show how great they look.Meanwhile, those dealing only with what God gave them remain judged by the sentiment once expressed by beauty guru Helena Rubinstein.“There are no ugly women, only lazy ones.”THE McDonald’s Quarter Pound- er Fan Clubhas plans to launch a range of candles with smells such as burger, ketchup and onion.That’s as “eeeeeeew” as Gwyneth Paltrow’s Smells Like My Vagina candle.The, er, burning question is: What’s wrong with the old stalwarts of fig or gardenia A FORMER friend of paedophile Jeffrey Epstein’s right-hand woman Ghislaine Maxwell has told the FBI of a potentially relevant conversation they once had.“She said many things . . . ” reveals Christina Oxenburg.“Stuff like: ‘Jeffrey and I have everyone on videotape!’”Interesting.Could this perhaps explain Prince Andrew’s haste to cross the Atlantic and share a walk in the park simply to, he claims, break off the friendship with a man he also claims he didn’t know that well Or was it to find outthere were videos that he should be worried about from his time enjoying Epstein’s hospitality AL PACINO, , has been dumped by his -year-old girlfriend Meital Dohan.“I tried to deny it, but he is already an elderly man,” she says with refreshing candour.“So even with all my love, it didn’t last.”In other words, he’s very set in his ways, probably a little curmudgeonly at times and “the nursing years” are looming.THIS, believe it or not, is former “First Baby” Leo Blair – born when dad Tony was in situ at No Downing StreetIt feels like five minutes ago . . . but he’s now .Reasons to feel old: Part .THE maker of Barbie is bringing out three “inspirational women dolls” in the shape of ex-tennis champ Billie Jean King, hero nurse Florence Nightingale and singer Ella Fitzgerald, complete with “authentic clothing”.Nice idea, but let’s see how it pans out.Chances are they’ll end up in the “Barbie box” with all the others – dressed in a boob tube, sequined leggings and their hair in wonky plaits.Probably because we’d end up with a tuneless busker called Singy McSingface.THE WM Bar-B-Q Burger bar in Honolulu, Hawaii, has been serving its client favourite, the Royal Burger, since .Last time I looked they weren’t locked in litigation with The Queen.That’s because no one in their right mind would ever associate a burger restaurant with the British monarchy.The same, however, cannot be said of The Duke and Duchess of Sussex.One of them was born royal, they both enjoyed a breathtakingly expensive royal wedding, undertook royal dutiesand received money from the Duchy of Cornwall, which the reigning son of the current British monarchinherits.So while Harry and Meghan’s little barb that The Queen doesn’t have legal jurisdiction in the US over the word royal is correct, the notion that their use of the word isn’t inextricably linked to the British crown is patent nonsense and Her Majesty is right to insist they drop it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The mob’s targets know no bounds.  This “woke elite” have made it impossible to have civilised conversation and debate.Take the feminist Germaine Greer, a woman who has fought tirelessly for some  years for women’s liberation. She is now considered by some to be too frightful to listen to and there have been calls to no- her — ban her from speaking at events, usually universities.Even companies such as Yorkshire Tea are getting stick.  The firm was bombarded with complaints at the weekend, with people expressing outrage because the new Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, posted a photo of himself on social media making a cup of tea with the brand.Sunak’s crime is being a Conservative. Yorkshire Tea’s crime was to allow the Conservative Chancel-or to drink its tea. This bizarre, unreasonable, moral crusading of what I see as the “woke elite” is part of the explanation for the Conservative landslide in the last election.In my view, the Labour Party lost  seats, the second largest number it has ever lost in a single election, because ordinary people look at the Left and think they have all gone mad.This isn’t true, of course. It is a great shame for sensible, left-leaning people in Britain that the woke are giving them all such a bad name.Those on the Left must cringe with horror every time there is a Twitter pile-on when someone does some- thing that “offends”.The woke march around asthey are police, bullying everyone into thinking and speaking in a way that they deem to be acceptable.If you don’t agree, they will write to your employer and get you fired, or they will bombard you with abuse until you give in and beg for forgiveness.I should know — it has happened to me more than once. If I tweet something that offends the woke elite, they write to my governing body, Ofsted, demanding my resignation.Luckily, on Twitter one can block these self-righteous radicals, giving oneself some peace. But there was a time when our school received so many savage and bloodthirsty emails that one of my office staff had a breakdown from having to read them all.We have even received death threats. Why  Because the woke elite don’t like how we run our school. As a headmistress, I believe it is important to teach children to hear all sides of any debate and encourage them to form their own, independent views.Butone side is constantly shutting down debate with bullying tactics, no-ing and drowning people out, then how are our children ever to hear both sides When we were first opening our free school, social justice warriors determined to stop us would infiltrate our parent evenings and stand up as I was talking, shouting over me so the parents couldn’t hear what I was trying to say.Why did they do this  Because in  I gave a speech at the Conservative Party conference. I am not a Conservative but that didn’t bother my detractors. As with Yorkshire Tea, simple association with the Conservative Party means you must be evil.The woke cannot imagine that the Conservatives want a better world, just as they do. They simply disagree on how to get there.So frequent and angry have the calls for someone’s dismissal or “cancellation” become that those who would have once argued the case, the “anti-woke”, are just rolling over. It’s not worth the hassle, they say with a sigh.The “anti-woke” weren’t always this way. They are ordinary people who have simply become fed up of being browbeaten by these pseudo-moral liberators.If the woke have something truly interesting to say, then why don’t they make their arguments, stand up on a stage and explain why their beliefs are worthy At least that would have the effect of persuading people, rather than alienating them.  But the woke don’t care about being virtuous. They want only to signal it.In , too many people live in fear of what they can and cannot say. We are meant to be living in a free country.Let’s hope one day it can feel aswe do and we will no longer need a Free Speech Union.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Of course, they could also just have a cold.But nevertheless traders, exploration and refining unit staff were told to work remotely – something that is not possible in many businesses.Some folk are being asked to self-quarantine for two weeks simply because they went on holiday to northern Italy.It’s getting even more needlessly dramatic within education.As it stands, Public Health England are NOT advising any schools to close.But eight now have been, while another  have quarantined pupils, forcing them to stay at home with their parents for a fortnight.In the most ridiculous case so far, an Essex primary school has been shut by its headmaster because one of its teachers spent half-term in Italy. That teacher is reportedly not sick or exhibiting any of the symptoms of coronavirus.We’ve already seen the very real cost to the market of such overreach, with £ billion wiped off the FTSE  in just  hours and the shares of travel companies like Tui and Easy Jet plummeting.The government is right and responsible to consider worst-case scenarios and plan appropriately.The Sun today revealed details of an official report showing that a catastrophic outbreak could see  per cent of Brits come down with coronavirus and , die.Of the  people tested for the virus in the UK,  have tested positive and eight of those have now been discharged.The reality is that for the vast majority of healthy people Coronavirus will not be fatal.Doing the basics right now – like washing your hands regularly and using tissues – will actually do more to help curb the spread than costly grand gestures.We must be vigilant and safe, but avoid Coronavirus hysteria.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And from the reaction we saw the people think the same, too.Good luck on this adventure in America and Canada — but I don’t think it will be long before he misses this country so much that he will want to come back and become a fully fledged member of the Royal Family.I hope his self-imposed exile is short-lived, but at the moment he is doing what his we wants and that is commendable. But the grass always looks greener over in the neighbouring field.So, Harry,you get fed up of making speeches to rich businessmen and you want to come back, just jump on the first plane and come home. We will welcome you with open arms.The love this country has for him has never stopped. As far as the nation is concerned he is still their number one member of the Royal Family.Harry is one of those instinctive people who do and say the first thing that comes into their head and when I saw him hugging people in Edinburgh I remembered why the public will always love him.Just before Christmas, when he visited a school in Luton, the students were queuing up to give him a hug before he left. That’s the Harry I know and love. We will miss him.Having toured with Harry for many years, he was a photographer’s dream — even when the tables were turned on me.In a youth club in New Zealand he was asked to put his painted hand on the wall, which he did.And then he rushed across the room and planted it on my head, as you see in the picture above.When we washed up afterwards he rebuked me for telling the whole nation on TV that morning he was going bald — just like his dad.I know his father, Prince Charles, is upset that his son is leaving and William, his best friend for many years, will also be sad to see his brother go.But the Queen has given him a year to review it and he will be welcomed like the prodigal sonhe decides his future is here back in Britain in the world’s number one family.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

At the end of the last decade, men could expect to live . years and women were still well ahead on ..But in my patch, the North East of England, le expectancy for women has actually fallen a little.The report comes from a bloke called Sir Michael Marmot. He blames economic inequality and austerity for what he calls the UK’s “lost decade”.I have no doubt whatsoever that poverty shortens theof a le. And low wages — especially in the North East — mean that for too long people have been struggling by on very little indeed.But Sir Michael also has a bit of skin in the game.

The usual stuff.If you listened to the coverage of his report on the BBC, you’d think Boris Johnson and co were wandering around the country strangling impoverished pensioners as they queue up in food banks. And cackling maniacally.But is it really quite so simple as that  Is it really all about poverty Sir Michael admits that  per cent might be attributable to new flu strains which have arrived here as a consequence of increased globalisation.Bird flu, Sars and now the coronavirus.That’s not all, though. As we keep being told, the country is in the grip of an obesity epidemic.And the areas where obesity is at its greatest are also those where le expectancy is at its lowest. Being fat isn’t the consequence of poverty. It’s a result primarily of a lack of exercise and, secondly, a poor diet.Given that the NHS and Government have been banging on about obesity for a decade, might not that have something to do with it, Sir Michael Then there’s alcohol. We drink a lot of it. And by and large it’s not terribly good for us. The trend in the past  years is that women are catching up with men in their intake. I wonderthat might also have an effect on those le expectancy tables  Again, nothing to do with poverty.What about women working  Le expectancy for men always lagged behind women — and we were told that this was because men went out to work.Now that women work too, would we not expect the le expectancies for each sex to draw closer together And then this. During the past  years we have welcomed more than six million immigrants to the UK. The le expectancy in their home countries is way below that of the average in the UK —  years below in the case of Pakistan, for example, and three years in the case of Poland. Many will arrive still with the legacy of poor health treatment in their original countries. That must, surely, affect the statistics.My argument isn’t that austerity isn’t in there somewhere. Simply that there are a few more factors to take into account before we blame the Tories, once again, for killing people.The bloke had just got back from Iran, where the virus has been spreading. The experts have been warning of a possible , deaths in the UK.

All the men got out and put on these white suits.Then they went to a house and parked right by it. The police blocked off the road. They then brought someone out — they didnt seem to need help.When they got to hospital a policeman opened a loading bay and they went up in that. It was such a strange and surreal experience.In its latest message to parents, Burbage Primary School said: “We are now in a position to confirm that the parent has not entered the school site since theirfrom holiday.“School remains closed for the rest of the week as a precautionary measure as cleaning takes place.”Public Health England is contacting people who had close contact with the parent.One mum at the school told the Sun Online: “It’s very worrying because any number of people could be stricken with the bug and may not even be aware.“Who would have thought our little town in the middle of nowhere would be hit. It’s caused a lot of alarm bells and locals are quite fearful.”Another said: “Others could have caught the virus through contact with the Buxton resident and not even been diagnosed. It could escalate and that’s a concern for us.”But other parents are making the most of the “quality time off” with their kids.One dad said: “We’re blessed with coronavirus!

The children aren’t complaining.”Senior doctors from hospitals across England have said that the NHS would crumblethe number of those infected reaches pandemic levels.The situation would mean doctors having to make “tough decisions” in order to free up beds.Buxton Medical Practice, which is less than a mile from Burbage Primary School, has also closed today due to a confirmed case of coronavirus.In a statement on its website, the surgery says it will undergo a deep clean, adding it is not yet known how long it will be closed for.Burbage Primary School will also undergo a thorough deep clean in a bid to halt the bugs spread.The schools head, Anthony Tierney said: We are shut, it is just a precaution.

statement said: As the Duke and Duchess are currently recognised as Internationally Protected Persons, Canada has an obligation to provide security assistance on an as-needed basis, the government

The one that is far more biased, out of control and in need of immediate reform.But this week we were provided with a happy reminder that Channel ’s future is by no means certain.MPs close to the Prime Minister revealed a plan is on the table for the blatantly left-wing broadcaster to be privatised.That will be music to the ears of fair-minded folk everywhere who have seen the once-interesting and innovative station morph into a liberal propaganda network that believes it is there to humiliate the Tories and call out commercial media rivals.It’s a shocking anomaly that in the  broadcasting world, where choice for consumers is at an all-time high, C is publicly owned at all.The sort of quirky, culturally relevant, groundbreaking and erse programming that once made the channel worth having is a distant memory.Instead, we are left in the truly odd situation where one Government-owned broadcasterspent many millions of pounds to poach from another BBC a genuinely popular existing programme called The Great British Bake Off, with the result being the show’s biggest stars leaving and the ratings halving.Meanwhile, C’s lone recent success, Black Mirror, was lost to Netflix.Then there’s the sorry state of Channel  News, which makes even Newsnight look impartial.It was no surprise to me when I witnessed at the Bafta Awards last month Hugh Grant make a beeline for his pal Jon “F*** the Tories” Snow, no doubt to collude on even more coverage designed to undermine anyone who doesn’t share their anti-Press, anti-Brexit world view.Let me remind you of just a small portion of the smorgasbord of hit pieces served up by C in the past year alone.There was the “comedy” that imagined a character, based on Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, was shot in the head while giving a speech about immigration.There was the real speech from the channel’s head of news and current affairs, Dorothy Byrne, where she attacked Boris Johnson as a “known liar”.Its news service then ly claimed the PM said “people of colour” while answering a question about democratically controlled immigration rather than “people of talent”.There was the climate change debate where C News replaced Boris with a chunk of melting ice and refused to let his stand-in Michael Gove into the venue to represent the Tories.And there was the most recent election night broadcast where a studio audience who they claimed fairly represented the political spectrum booed when the exit poll showing a massive Tory majority was announced.If any other channel had broadcast such slanted programming they would have faced sanctions from the regulator Ofcom many times over.There is literally no benefit for the Government to hang on to a broadcaster which has lost any sense of its real reason for being.C no longer provides any sort of public service broadcasting.To be completely honest, barring the odd gem, it hasn’t done since it became Big Brother TV in  and started a march towards hyper-commercialism.I am by no means saying C should not exist. Once privatised, the successful parts would be able to thrive.That would mean far more commercially viable hits like the soap Hollyoaks, and further series of popular factual series like Bake Off.And likely the end of a biased news service fronted by Mr Snow, that on Wednesday night saw its ratings plummet to just ,.HOLLYWOOD celebrity agents and PRs operate in a narcissistic system where the over-the-top needs and desires of their spoiled, A-list, millionaire clients are put above everything .There is not a moment to think of the greater good for humanity, nor even the other staff involved on a project.No constraints are placed on the ridiculous nature of the daily requests these staff members oversee, be it demands for millions of dollars more for a project, or a private jet, or three personal assistants.They know all too well thattheir famous client isn’t happy, there is a long list of other agents just waiting to step in to take their -per-cent cut of the star’s earnings.That’s why, for the past six months, there has been a growing sense of dread within the Royal Family about such a network of Hollywood vultures becoming intrinsically involved in the “business” of the monarchy.And there was most definitely reason to worry.As the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s classless rebuke to the Queen over the use of the word “royal” showed, their new team will go for the low blow without a second thought for the damage it could cause to Crown or country.FOR years I have been campaigning for the BBC to overhaul the system that sees us put up a God-awful entry for the Eurovision Song Contest year after year.Sure, I acknowledge that we’re never going to do particularly well in the actual results, especially post-Brexit.But that’s no reason to put forward the type of total dross we have been.So this year I am celebrating – because the UK entry is actually an immediate piece of mid-tempo pop magic with a soaring chorus.Sensibly, the Beeb has signed up talented singer-songwriter James Newman to represent us with his tune My Last Breath.His record company BMG says it started the search for a song with the “sole aim of changing the perception of the contest by working with the very best UK songwriters”.James certainly has Eurovision pedigree.He won a Brit in  as co-writer of Rudimental hit Waiting All Night, has twice been nominated for Grammys and has written hit singles for Ed Sheeran, Calvin Harris and Jess Glynne.And his brother is the equally talented pop star John Newman.But now is his time to step into the spotlight himself and be able to proudly fly the Union Jack in Rotterdam this May.You can tune into Dan’s talkRADIO Drivetime slot on weekdays between pm and pm Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

to reduce confusion for fellow weather experts, sea captains and pilots.In America, when all the names in the storm alphabet are used, names are given following the Greek alphabet .Analysis has shown that naming storms makes people more aware of the severe weather and helps them prepare for them in advance.Surveys showed people were more aware of the threat and more likely to take action after hearing the name of a storm, rather than a forecast simply saying bad weather is on the way.The Met Office and its Irish counterpart Met Eireann decided to follow the US system of giving girls and boys names to tropical storms and hurricanes.A study of American hurricanes has shed light on an alarming pattern, and explained that more people are killed by female storms than those with male names.The reason why is all down to how we subconsciously view gender, since were more likely to assume that storms with female names will be less dangerous.Incredibly, the  study added that the more feminine the name, the more people a storm is likely to kill.The researchers even suggested that changing a hurricanes name from Charley to Eloise could triple the number of fatalities.Co-author Sharon Shavitt, a professor at the University of Illinois, said: In judging the intensity of a storm, people appear to be applying their beliefs about how men and women behave.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The major study, published in The Lancet, shows mental health problems skyrocketed among the unemployed within all social groups. The research also found no evidence that the welfare reform was associated with more people entering employment. Researchers estimate nearly , unemployed suffered clinically signicant levels of psychological distress between April  and December , of whom more than a third may have become clinically depressed.  But a DWP spokesperson said:“This research does not prove that people are experiencing distress due to the design of Universal Credit. “People coming to the jobcentre are often doing so at a dficult time in their lives, and there is a range of support available for those with mental health conditions.“We know that the vast majority of people on Universal Credit are satisfied with their experience.” Universal Credit, launched in April  in a bid to simply the benefits system and help more people into work, has been met with criticism. Poorer claimants have said they have suffered a a heightened risk of hunger, debt and rent arrears, ill-health and homelessness. Doctor Sophie Wickham, from the University of Liverpool, said: Our study supports growing calls for Universal Credit to be fundamentally modied to reduce these mental health harms. So far, the government has only looked at the impact of Universal Credit on the labour market, and there are no plans to assess its effect on health and wellbeing. With a further . million recipients of existing benefits expected to claim Universal Credit over the next few years, this expanding group may exacerbate pressures on already stretched mental health and social care services. The study is the first to quanty the possible impact of Universal Credit on mental health, and underscores the importance of evaluating the potential health effects of changes to welfare systems worldwide.

Iaposm an ex-offender who ended up on the streets hiding from the police, and hiding from my family.

So what you have is this compound which is absolutely terrible. “It is a human rights abuse, in my opinion, to let anybody sleep on the streets. I would not let one person sleep on the streets.” I would create therapeutic communities and I would give people places of safety where you then help them solve the problems.“It comes out of austerity.

At one point, one of them screams that he will kill anyone who tries to stop them.

The two then make their way to another stand full of goods while a Curry’s staff member can be seen in the background with his lanyard hanging around his neck.

Filmmaker Lucy Sheen was on her way to rehearsals when a white male passenger whispered in her ear: Why donapost you f**k off back to China and take your filth with you. The filmmaker was taken aback by the incident but said it is far from isolated. Only today I read of another incident on public transport where another East Asian female was taunted and called aposcoronavirusapos, she told the . Ms Sheen identies as transracial, having been born in Hong Kong in the s before being adopted in Britain - she then went on to study at the Rose Bruford College of Speech and Drama. She claimed racism of the kind she suffered on the bus is nothing new to British people of East Asian heritage or from overseas.Taking to Twitter on February  to vent about the incident, she used the hashtags #coronavirus and #racism.In my case, what shocked me was the stealth - the fact that this person had obviously made a decision to say what he did but do it in a covert manner.If he’d shouted that out I can deal with that, I could have handled that, she continued. It’s like any form of bias, prejudice or racism that is undercover, ingrained, institutionalised or structural, it’s very very hard to challenge or to try and change those entrenched views. Ms Sheen, who has dyslexia but has written, directed and acted in several celebrated productions - one of which appeared at the Venice Film Festival - feels todayaposs political climate has much to answer for.In the current climate along with the current government and what they seem to be supporting, it has given a great excuse for anti East Asian sentiments and [something for] racists to hang their racism upon. She said the bus incident made her feel both angry and deeply sad. I am British. I was born on the crown colony of Hong Kong, so British courtesy of the British Empire.

As the virus continues to spread rapidly across the planet, the number of Covid- patients diagnosed in the UK slowly ticks upwards. This morning the Department of Health and Social Care announced that two Brits had contracted the virus while in Iran. Both have ed to London from the Middle Eastern country, which has had the highest number of deaths outside of China. The London patients are being treated at the Royal Free Hospital in the capital, where a number of infected people are also in quarantine. Someone from Swansea in Wales also has the disease following a trip to Northern Italy. Public Health Wales is working to identy those who have come into contact with the patient.  Dr Giri Shankar, incident director at the organisation, said: Public Health Wales is working hard to identy close contacts, and we are taking all appropriate actions to reduce any risk to the publicaposs health. The ages and genders of the newly confirmed patients have not been revealed by the authorities. Yesterday six more people tested positive for Cornavirus in the UK.The highest concentration of patients is to be found in London, where five have been quarantined after flying in from France, one from China, one from Italy and two from Iran. A Chinese student and their mum were diagnosed and quarantined in York, while Derbsyhire has one confirmed patient who spent time out in Tenere. Four people have been isolated at Arrowe Park Hospital in Merseyside having left the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship which became a hotbed for the virus.  Both Belfast and Cardf have a confirmed case each which originated in Italy. In the past day concerns have been raised about the NHSaposs ability to cope with the spread of the virus. It emerged last night that overstretched hospitals here in the UK would be forced to treat only the patients most likely to survive should the virus take hold.

The prominent campaigner walked on stage to chants of Greta, Greta. Wearing a white knitted hat and yellow raincoat, she says the climate emergency is being completely ignored by politicians and the media.

Another read: when our world is dead where do we go  The speech is due to be followed by a march through the city. I look up to Greta Thunberg and I want to show my respect, said protester Eve Nott, , from nearby Bath. I think she can help us in changing our ways. Speaking to Bristol Live as she arrived by train at Temple Meads Station, Thunberg said she chose to come to the city due to its strong environmental movement. She said she hoped the event would be a gathering of people standing together in solidarity. Speaking before Thunberg addressed the crowd, Mya-Rose Craig, also , called for change. Mya-Rose was the youngest person to be awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Bristol last week. The student called for greater ersity in the climate movement. She told the crowd: Greta, welcome to our amazing city and thank you for being with us today. We have to engage with all of our communities in order to properly fight climate change.

Parents, especially those with primary school aged children, have been told to be aware of the risks of falls and crushing. Saying a lack of information from organisers has made it dficult to make adequate preparations, Bristol City Council and Avon and Somerset Police warned: Do not underestimate the scale of this protest. Residents have been urged to avoid unnecessary travel, with many busy roads in the centre closed to accommodate the rally from am to .pm.Two schools are also closed today. But others have embraced the event, with the Old Vic Theatre in King Street opening its facilities to youngsters and their families - offering them use of loos, baby changing units and a place to take shelter from the rain. There will be major disruption to the city, the councilaposs executive director, Mike Jackson, and Superintendent Andy Bennett of Bristol Police said, asking parents to be responsible for their children.  Parents are responsible for their children. The council and police are not responsible for unsupervised children. In terms of big crowds, there is the potential for trips, slips, falls and crushing. People can easily be separated from their friends and family. Mobile phone signals can be intermittent due to saturation on the communications masts.  However Bristol Youth Strike  Climate - which organised the demo - says they have no time for being patronised by police.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailOver a third of young people say they have self-harmed in a “shocking” new survey which reveals the disturbing epidemic sweeping Britain’s youth. In a YouGov poll of over ,  to -year-olds, % admitted hurting themselves in a range of ways including cutting, poisoning and burning. And a third of those youngsters did so in the past  months. Recent NHS figures relating to the same age group had revealed that just one in ten self-harmed. The latest research, commissioned by youth support charity The Mix UK, also reveals a worrying lack of understanding and support for youngsters. Some % of those who self-harmed in the past year had not accessed any support. Of those who visited a GP, hospital or healthcare professional, % said it was unhelpful. Zoe Bailie, director of brand and development at The Mix UK, said: “This is a benchmark piece of research that has blown other figures out of the water. The likelihood as a parent is your child may self-harm, or will have a friend who does.” Natasha Devon, a former government mental health tsar, added: “These figures are shocking and show a third of our young people are in emotional distress. The Government needs to see this statistic as a plea for help from young people and ask what caused it.” While self-harm is not automatically linked to suicidal thoughts, Ms Devon explained in some cases it can be without the correct support.  She said: “Now, self harm has to be severe enough to require hospitalisation for urgent action to be taken. “It used to beyou were in enough distress to hurt yourself you’d get an appointment with the NHS Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services. “Now, so many parents say to me it seems you have to kill yourself to be taken seriously. Demand is so high they have to increase the thresholds. One teacher said to me, ‘Girls learn how severely they need to self-harm to guarantee an overnight hospital stay, but not die’. We want to get people way before they get to that point.” The Mix, which will launch Self-Harm Awareness Day on Sunday, helps over . million young people a year with a range of issues, mainly across moderated digital s. Comments left anonymously on its website show claims of misunderstanding and stigma within the NHS around self-injury, with some healthcare professionals seeing it as attention seeking. One youngster said a GP told her girls who self-harm are “bad girls”.Another wrote: “I’ve insisted for help and received nothing or been told I wasn’t severe enough for support because I didn’t have cuts on my throat or wrists that were current or bleeding.” When The Mix put the YouGov questions on its site, visited by young people already seeking support, it found an even higher proportion of respondents – % – admitted to self-harm. Ms Baillie put the numbers down to a range of factors: “People are talking about it more but young people face a lot of pressure. Exam stress is huge. Concern about the future. Potential bullying. Pressures on social media.” The charity is calling for specialist training for health professionals and asking for young people to be directed to its website, which offers specialist support through peers, volunteers and professionals, without long waits. Ms Bailie said: “This is widespread, it affects everybody. All backgrounds.” The NHS said it is seeing more kids and young people than ever – , more last year than the previous one – and is ramping up early support in the community, schools and colleges. It added: “We also need social media firms, employers and others to step up and ask what more they can do.” "},{"url":null,"title":"man thanks huge belly saving","story":"NewsMan thanks his huge belly for saving his le after he falls down pub stepsColin Hayes is one of three people to fall down the same steps at Christopher Creeke Wetherspoon pub in Bournemouth in the last eight months, including one man in his s who later diedShareCommentsByRyan Merrield:,  FEB NewsColin Hayes weighed  stone when he fell \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

The Duke of Sussex and his bodyguards reportedly had the entire carriage to themselves on the way home from Edinburgh to London. No other passengers were allowed to use the carriage on the LNER service to Kingaposs Cross Station on Wednesday night, according to the Mail Online. He was on his way home from his eco-conference where he had asked attendees to drop his royal title, urging them to just call him aposHarry.apos Only the Queen conventionally travels exclusively first-class on the rail.  She typically has a small first class carriage to herself to and from her estate in Sandringham, Norfolk. Whereas Prince William and Kate Middleton earlier this month travelled to and from the new Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre near Loughborough, Leicestershire, alongside ordinary commuters. Prince Harry had been speaking at the Travalyst event at the Edinburgh International Conference Centre on sustainable tourism.The Duke founded the Travalyst coalition, which is working to help tourists find more eco-friendly ways to travel. The conference this week focused on getting travel industry feedback on new sustainability ideas, such as creating an online scoring system to show the green status of aviation, accommodation and holiday experiences. The Dukeaposs train trip comes after the Sussexes were criticised for their private jet travel last year. Buckingham Palace has been approached for comment on Harryaposs travel arrangements. He and we Meghan Markle are beginning a new le split between Canada in the UK following their shock announcement the planned to step back from royal le.  The move has left questions over the pairaposs security arrangements, as they still require protection in their new lestyle. Today Canada confirmed police protection for the family, including baby Archie, would end within weeks. The Royal Mounted Canadian Police would end its protection services once the coupleaposs transition out of royal le is complete, leaving the question of how to protect the pair to the UK, and to the Sussexes themselves.

The global outbreak has already cost thousands of lives, hit stock prices and disrupted businesses and sports events. Here schools have been closed and offices evacuated. Ministers are already planning for the worst case scenario amid fears the NHS could be unable to cope with a mass outbreak here.  If we reach epidemic levels routine operations will have to be cancelled and hospitals may struggle to find enough beds. The Tories may wish to ask themselvesthat would be the casethey had not starved our health service of funds for the last decade. The Government needs to calibrate its response carefully. It should put in place all the measures necessary to contain the virus while not whipping up alarm. Panic will not help. In time a vaccine will hopefully be developed. Until then we should follow the medical advice, and keep calm and carry on. Homes truths Nobody doubts we need to build more homes to address Britain’s housing crisis. But they need to be sited in the right places. More than , homes are being planned in areas deemed at high risk of flooding. These are on top of , built in - in flood zones. This defies common sense. Owners will be saddled with properties that are uninsurable, uninhabitable and unsellable. The Government needs to call time on these ill-judged developments and devise a housing plan that takes account of the climate crisis. Business as usual will only result in more flood-stricken families living in misery.

She was approached by a landlord claiming to have a house that would suit the couple from Bridgend and the parties were put in touch. Amy, a -year-old driver, said: We started talking to the landlord on WhatsApp and got really excited about the house. We were sent pictures of the inside and it seemed to have large bedrooms, a driveway, a big kitchen and garden, so we were really keen. Before the couple could look around the property, the landlord, who claimed to have recently moved from the area to Plymouth, said that he needed the security deposit in advance on the advice from his solicitor. He claimed this would ensure that the couple would be able to afford to rent the property. Amy said: We really wanted the house.

The couple transferred the extra money. But when they went to the house, they found that the house was occupied by itaposs actual owner - who had no idea his home had been ly placed on the rental market. I was so annoyed, fumed Amy. I emailed the landlord straight away asking what was going on. They emailed back saying that they had injured their foot and that they would meet us the next day. We knew something was up. I asked for the money back, but have not heard from them since.  Matthew, , had already given notice on his current lodgings but was fortunately able to reverse this before they found a new tenant. However, he and his girlfriend had been left £ out of pocket. We will never do something like this again, said Amy. From now on we will only go through property management companies and never give money over before. We had our heart set on this place, we thought this would be our family home. Unfortunately, because Amy transferred the money willingly, her bank have said she is unlikely to get it back. Frank Ballinger has lived at the property in Brackla for around  years. The -year-old has described the moment he met the couple and realised that his home was offered for rent without his knowledge.

On Friday morning the WHO said it could well reach all countries across the world. The stark warning came the day after Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the WHO, suggested the planet was at a tipping point. “This virus has pandemic potential,” he said. “We are actually in a very delicate situation in which the outbreak can go in any direction based on how we handle it.” So far more than , people in at least  countries have been infected by the disease. In the past few days more cases have been reported outside China than in the country, where the outbreak began in December.  The rapid spread of the disease, which is now in numerous European countries and has claimed lives in Northern Italy, has led governments to adopt ious containment proceedures. China has enforced a lock down of  million people to control the spread of the virus while Japan closed its schools for at least a month. Iran has canceled Friday Prayers in major cities and Saudi Arabia barred pilgrims from its holiest sites. Meanwhile three more people have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK, bringing the total to .  One patient in Wales and two in England have been diagnosed, officials have announced today. The case in Wales is the first for the country, with the total number of cases in England rising to  and one recorded in Northern Ireland.

The incredible moment was captured on video during Auckland Pride on February . The preacher - from the Torch of Christ Ministries church - had turned up uninvited to Our March, which celebrates New Zealandaposs LGBTQI+ community. The video shows him telling rainbow-glad revellers that today you can receive Christ in your heart and shouting religious beliefs on a megaphone. In response, two young women chose to show their love for each other and make out in front of him.  Other Pride-goers clad in brightly coloured clothing then slowly start to surround the preacher as he continues to shout his beliefs. He can be heard saying: You are controlled by the devil. The video was released by the church on YouTube, with a warning claiming that it includes lewd sexual acts, troubling images, and other sexually suggestive content. It includes a warning saying the video is not suitable for most children to watch. We preached the gospel of Jesus Christ and repentance while also telling people they are loved and cared about, it reads.  We did our best to approach people with the fruit of the Spirit while also standing firm on Godaposs truth.  Many people did very vile and lewd sexual acts on the camera while later having a conversation with us because of the conviction of sin that set in. Phillip Blair, the leader of Torch of Christ Ministries, was heckled at the same parade after accusing attendees of celebrating debauchery.  He was surrounded by revellers, who told him weaposre here, weaposre queer, get used to it. The preacher - who has spoken at LGBTQI+ parades in the USA, as well as New Zealand and Australia - was eventually asked by police to move on. Last year, Mr Blair was told to shut up by a commuter on a train in Sydney, Australia after telling him and other passengers to repent.

The MSC Cruises vessel MSC Meraviglia made land in Cozumel, Mexico on Thursday morning. Officials have entered the ship so customary checks can be carried out before those on board are given permission to go onto shore. Before being allowed to dock, the boat had been denied entry to Ochos Rios in Jamaica on Tuesday after word got out that a crew member was reporting flu-like symptoms. They had been placed in isolation while , passengers and , crew members waited on board. The MSC Meraviglia was then denied entry to Grand Cayman in order to provide protection to the health and safety of the residents of the Cayman Islands, a government health minister said. Reuters reported that the Mexican Port Authority cancelled permission for the cruise ship to disembark in Cozumel on Wednesday. That decision was later overturned.MSC Cruises criticised the refusal to allow its ship to dock, telling TIME : In both instances, the ship was effectively turned away simply based on fears.”The ships medical records show that the crew member had influenza and had travelled to Miami from Manila, Philippines via Istanbul. Luca Biondolillo, chief communications officer for the cruise company, said: MSC Cruises has now received official confirmation from the Mexican health authorities - following medical testing conducted by them overnight - that the two people on board MSC Meraviglia in Cozumel are affected only by seasonal flu and not Covid- Coronavirus. The ship has consequently been cleared for disembarkation.” Those on board the vessel did not seem too badly affected by fears of coronavirus infection or the shipaposs previously indefinite aposat seaapos status.  “Le is normal at the pool side,” one passenger told TIME. “We have not been asked to stay in the rooms.” The MSC Meraviglia is not the only cruise liner to be affected by the coronavirus.

Their parents were working in a dferent region and they were being cared for by their uncle who had locked them inside while he went outside to visit a friend. An elderly resident tried to reach the youngsters but was beaten back by the inferno. Tragically, their charred bodies were found after the flames were extinguished. Chief Fire Inspector Dionisio Cayudong Jr., said the fire started in the kitchen and rapidly engulfed the house because of the light, palm wood materials it was made from. He said: The fire started after Betsuzaaposs brother left the house locked and went to a friendaposs house. The children were trapped inside because the main door was locked.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"tarberts senior citizens party the night away","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWet and windy weather failed to dampen the spirits of Tarbert’s seniors as they gathered in the village hall for the senior citizens# Christmas dinner.A large number of willing volunteers had organised a sumptuous meal and decked the hall with multi-coloured fairy lights and balloons to provide a warm welcome for their guests.The familiar venue quickly came alive with smiles, hugs and the happy chatter of friends gathering for this much-loved annual event which has been going for more than  years.Elma McGougan and Jean Johnston, who had served on the original organising committee, reminisced about their experiences, explaining they ran fund-raising events and that many in the village donated money and goods so the dinner could be provided free of charge.The event, held this year on Friday January , is still organised by a committee and continues to be generously supported by businesses and iniduals in the village and surrounding area.Elma said: #In the s, the women on the committee made soup and brought it along. We did not have the new kitchen then. The hotel has always cooked the turkeys for us but cooking big pots of potatoes and vegetables was quite a job with just the gas rings. Back then, we had ice-cream and jelly for dessert.#Jean added: #It was all good fun and we had loads of laughs.#Elma continued: #We used to have sales to raise money for the dinner. Santa was on the stage and Jean’s children were his elves. They were only little then.#We modelled the clothes and the older women loved the bargains. We thought they were old, but they were probably the age we are now,# Elma said laughing. #We would shout #Roll up, roll up# to get them to come and see what we had on offer.#After a warm welcome from compère Martin Jefferies and a prayer of thanks for the food, the five-course meal was expertly served by members of the organising committee and their youthful helpers.A raffle, again free of charge, saw a large number of guests receive prizes and no-one was left disappointed as the remainder of the guests received selection boxes.Tarbert’s seniors showed they know how to party as dancers left their seats and enthusiastically took to the floor as soon as the musical entertainment began.A stunned Margaret Henderson was named #Citizen of the Year#, confessing she never expected to win the award.For more than  years, Margaret has collected money to support the Tarbert Sea Food Festival and Music Festival. Later, Margaret dressed up as Mrs Brown from Mrs Brown’s Boys to entertain the audience, something for which she is well-known.Martin Jefferies thanked everyone who had helped make the evening such a success with the happy gathering agreeing with loud applause.By Joan Crooks"},{"url":null,"title":"keep that mojo burning 4 below","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsFrom Oban,  Below previously graced the MOJO stage before in  with a blistering set from their debut album Alpha, to great acclaim.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard.

Indeed, the suggestion has been made that any opinions counter to the management view have been distinctly unwelcome.Nobody is suggesting that Knapdale Ward is perfect, and common sense tells us that dementia patients are more comfortable and relaxed in their home environment. An enhanced community care model is an excellent idea # but healthcare professionals are adamant that Knapdale Ward should be retained, with improvements made in discussion with staff.It is needed, they say, as an option within Argyll when the home environment is no longer suitable for dementia sufferers, their families and carers.Serious questions need to be answered.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

This is a stunning route and the views over the Sound of Jura to the islands of Islay and Gigha are a rich reward for screaming muscles on the testing climbs.This will be the third year this increasingly popular event will take to the road. As it is a sportive, the Kilberry Loop is a non-competitive event and at just short of  miles long is perfect for a first-time competitor. Of course, for more competitive cyclists who want to push themselves or who are in training, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is a great event to get a personal best.The quicker cyclists in  managed the course # which has almost  metres of climbing # in under two hours, which is quick, and there are others who complete the course inside a comfortable four hours, so there is room for all abilities.Around  cyclists of all ages took part last year, with a couple of gentlemen in their early s and those in their twenties joining in # and organisers hope this year#s sportive will attract even more athletes.To make the event even more attractive Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club hopes to include race timing for the first time. And, for the third year, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is supported by British Cycling, the nation’s largest cycling organisation and national governing body for cyclesport, which actively helps and encourages people to get into cycling.If you’d like to sign up for this year’s Kilberry Loop Sportive or want more information visit the Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club website."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part four","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAs crew for our cruise we were lucky, as we have been for the four previous years, and were able to get both the Doctor and Pilot to come again. The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ormsary man in oman endurance event","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowAn Ormsary man is about to embark on the challenge of a letime as he cycles over ,km in a bid to be crowned BikingMan Oman .Lindsay McCrae, , will be one of only  cyclists to take part in BikingMan Oman, part of a series of ultra-endurance cycling events where competitors test their limits of strength and stamina.In , Lindsay bought a road bike through his employer#s cycle to work scheme and what started out as an active commute with a few local races thrown in for fun, soon became an opportunity to challenge himself in some of the toughest races on two wheels.His first big win came in the gruelling City to Summit duathlon from Edinburgh to Ben Nevis. The race was a half marathon of road running, km ride through Glen Coe then back on foot for the final off-road marathon summitting Ben Nevis and finishing in Fort William.Bitten by the cycling bug, he went on to win Revolve  at Brands Hatch race circuit, completing  miles and ascending , feet in  hours. Adding a second-place finish in last year#s BikingMan Portugal event against some of the sport#s top athletes means Lindsay has truly made his mark on the endurance scene.Lindsay said: #In my first few races I just wanted to see how I would get on but now I#m definitely in it to win it. I think I#m just stubborn and that#s what keeps me pushing on when other people take rest breaks.#Lindsay, who works in sales technical support for an aquaculture equipment company in Inverness, fits his training around his job, spending one to two hours on a turbo in his garage three or four times a week, with longer rides of two to five hours at the weekends. His father#s greenhouse in Ardrishaig proved to be a useful training venue to shelter from the elements over the Christmas holidays as he prepared for his biggest challenge yet.The BikingMan Oman race starts in Muscat, Oman#s capital city, before heading out on the Arabian Peninsula, through the Hajar Mountains, across the Ash Sharqiyah Desert and along coastal roads back to the capital. The competitors will climb over m during the race, that#s the equivalent of climbing Ben Nevis almost seven times.Unlike cyclists on the Tour de France, BikingMan athletes are unsupported so must carry all their food and equipment with them.For Lindsay, one of the biggest challenges will be the weather. #Temperatures at the moment are around - degrees but can reach higher which can be dficult to manage on the steeper sections of the course. That#s where my nutrition and hydration strategy will need to be spot on.#But in case it all sounds like hard work, Lindsay highlights one of the main benefits of his high-octane adventures: #The best part is definitely refuelling after the race. I will burn about , calories over the -hours of my target time, so my recovery will mainly involve eating cakes and other calorie rich foods.#Lindsay grew up on the Ormsary Estate and attended Lochgilphead High School. His family still live in the local area and will be following his adventures closely over the five days of competition.The race takes place from February  to  and Lindsay will cover ,km in a bid to take the title."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"selkirk-gallery-strikes-gold-new-exhibition","story":"A BORDERS-based artist is bringing some Byzantine influence to a small museum in Selkirk.From next month gold will dominate Halliwells House as Alexandra Warren launches her exhibition in the Robson Gallery.Born in New York and raised in Greece, Alexandra developed a love of Cycladic sculpture and Byzantine icons.And despite spending the past  years in the Scottish Borders her work is still heavily influenced by the continuation of the Roman Empire.Her magnicent human figures and extensive use of gold leaf reflect a letimes influence.Alexandra told us: ldquoIrsquom very happy and honoured to have the opportunity of a solo exhibition in the lovely Robson Gallery in the historic Halliwellrsquos House, Selkirk.ldquoIrsquoll be presenting large figurative pieces and a series of small figurative paintings.\"Each piece is created with gold leaf, paint and shellac on wood , all inspired by Greek Byzantine icons - since I was lucky enough to have spent my childhood in Greece.rsquorsquoThe Traces of Gold exhibition opens on Saturday, March  and runs until the end of May.Assistant curator Phoebe Stewart said: ldquoWersquore delighted that Alexandra Warren is exhibiting with us in the Robson Gallery at Halliwellrsquos House.\"Her exquisite work, reminiscent of Greek Byzantine art, is a must-see.\""},{"url":null,"title":"across-pyrenees-melrose","story":"NEXT SundayMelrose Music Society continues its concert season with Across the Pyrenees: French and Spanish Music for the Saxophone.The concert, generously sponsored by the Tunnell Trust, will give the audience an exciting and colourful exploration of the cultural sympathy and musical styles of the two countries on either side of the Pyrenees.Saxophonist Jonathan Radford studied at Cheethamrsquos School of Music and the Conservatoire National Supeacuterieur de Musique de Paris with Claude Delangle, graduating in  with a Masters Degrees with distinction in both saxophone and chamber music.Pianist Eleanor Kornas, from Derbyshire, graduated with a First Class Honours Music degree from Cambridge University, and she was an Adami Award Junior Fellow in Piano Accompaniment at the Royal College of Music.

finances required for a new Peebles High School.Local Conservative council leader Shona Haslam and the local authoritys education portfolio holder Carol Hamilton hit out earlier this month at what they claimed was a financial snub from the Scottish Government.Their claims infuriated Deputy First Minister John Swinney, who reiterated Holyroods commitment to help following the school fire in November.But last weeks budget announcement by the Conservative Independent administration has now sparked a fresh row.According to the figures presented a new Peebles High will cost around pound million - with only pound million coming from an insurance settlement.The claim that there will be a pound million deficit has led to MSP Christine Grahame seeking clarication.The councils chief finance officer David Robertson has confirmed that Peebles High has an insurance value of pound million.And that the local authority is working with loss adjuster appointed by Zurich on a final settlement - expected to be made next month.But the correspondence has now thrown up more questions, with Ms Grahame demanding to know where a pound million deficit will occur.She told us: \"The claims being made by Councillor Haslam and her Tory colleagues are going to be massively concerning for the school community.\"As soon as the scale of the damage from the fire was apparent I wrote to SBC to check that insurance would cover the cost of rebuilding ndash I was told yes, it should.ldquoCllr Haslam has already been caught in one lie by saying the Scottish Government has refused funding for the rebuild when SBC have never requested it. And why would itit was covered by insurance ldquoIs it the case that the insurance company has rejected a claim for new build and will pay only for reinstatement of the damaged areas  If that is the case then she should come clean. She is claiming the school faces a pound million deficit.\"The only explanation I can offer is that this is the cost of replacement of damaged areas but on this Ms Haslam is silent.ldquoI await her response, but in the interim I would ask her seriously to desist in trying to play politics with this to get a disingenuous hit on the Scottish Government and SNP.\"It serves no one and is unnecessarily causing genuine concern amongst the local community when efforts should be going into ing stability and normality to students, parents and staff.Scottish Borders Councils administration has committed to delivering replacement secondary schools in Galashiels, Hawick and Peebles in the next six years.Councillor Haslam believes that an improved replacement school for Peebles school along with using parts of the remaining building needs to be factored in to the calculations.In a response to Christine Grahame, she said: \"As you are well aware the insurance will only pay to replace what was lost.\"This will still result in a music department in a windowless basement and a science department in labs that are not fit for purpose.\"Despite this our school continues to produce first class scientists and musicians but I believe they deserve more and better.\"We had planned to replace Peebles High School in the next  years. To only do part of the school now would be a  economy and impact on future plans to replace outdated buildings.\"I know how keen you are to see a new High School delivered in Galashiels so am perplexed as to why you are so against Peebles getting the same facilities  Perhaps you could clary  I am certainly not satisfied with half measures for our young people.\"We are also extremely keen to ensure that other towns developments are not held back as a result of this fire. So Galashiels and Hawick remain on schedule to be delivered. This means that our Conservative led council will be delivering three new High schools, two new primary schools in the next six years, quite an achievement as I am sure you will agree.\"This is held

appearing in the -foot statue which overlooks the Tweed near St Boswells.And fears were growing for the future of the -year-old iconic sculpture.But the few remaining Trustees of the statue have arranged for emergency work to be carried out in April.And it is hoped that a fundraising drive through the summer will lead to further preservation work to prevent any more deterioration.Jesse Rae, who is one of the William Wallace Trustees, told us: \"Emergency repairs will be made to the plinth this spring.\"I was up at the statue last summer with friends and I noticed there was damage beginning to appear.\"When I went back up a few months ago it was looking in a sad way.\"We know what needs to be done and well make a start with the repairs to the plinth in April.\"William Wallaces role in Scotlands history was brought to a world-wide audience by the film Braveheart.But the th century freedom fighter, who was proclaimedof Scotland in Selkirk, had been revered at home for centuries before the Mel Gibson movie.In  David Stuart Erskine, the th Earl of Buchan, commissioned the statue for a site overlooking the Tweed.Although the likeness to Wallace is questionable, and the style of sculpture has a isive effect on opinion, the statue has and continues to attract visitors to the Borders.Isabel Hay from the William Wallace Society believes more should be done to protect the monument.She said: \"I am concerned about the disrepair of the statue.\"It hasnt been looked after and its in the public interest for this tribute to William Wallace to be saved.\"We as a Society want to help preserve the Wallace monument and make sure its condition doesnt get any worse.\"The Saltire Society raised pound, back in  for the monument to be repaired and ed to its original state.And around a decade later the locally-based William Wallace Trustees raised enough money to improve the car park and access path to the statue.But weathering has led to fresh problems with the stonework.Musician Jesse, who made a fundraising song for the statue in the late s, hopes to announce new trustees to look after the statue in the coming weeks as well as plans, which include promotions through a television station, to raise funds for a second phase of preservation works.He added: \"Many of the original Trustees are no longer with us but we have people lined up.\"The second phase of works will include the Claymore - we need to get the emergency repairs done first.\""},{"url":null,"title":"community-given-reassurance-ahead-melrose-sevens","story":"RUGBY chiefs

He was .As a descendant of the famous Ballantyne clan, whose links to the Scottish woollen trade can be traced back to the mid-th century, Mr Brett upheld the family tradition by carving out a successful career in the fast-changing Borders textile industry.The son of an army officer, Lt Col. Denis Brett, and his we Katherine , Denis Roland Brett was born in  in Dehri Dun, India, where his father was serving with the Leicestershire Regiment.At the age of seven he was sent to Blairmore preparatory school in Aberdeenshire, then on to Haileybury School in Hertfordshire. There Rolyrsquos cricketing talents were quickly spotted, and as a member of the schoolrsquos st XI he had the distinction of hitting a six into the stands at Lordrsquos in the annual fixture against Cheltenham.On leaving school he was offered an apprenticeship by his uncle, David Ballantyne, in the family-run Henry Ballantyne  Sons mill at Walkerburn. It afforded him an invaluable insight into the business, supplemented by day release classes at the nearby Scottish College of Textiles in Galashiels.Additional work placements were undertaken at Ballantyne Sportswearrsquos Caerlee Mills in Innerleithen and at another family-run mill in Dalkeith. By his mid-s, Roly had been appointed mill manager at Ballantynersquos March Street Mills in Peebles.In  the Peebles operation was taken over by DawsonLtd ndash later to become Dawson International plc ndash before a restructuring of the Dawson empire in the mid-s saw Robert Noble Ltd take over as the new management company at March Street Mills.By now Mr Brett has risen to become the firmrsquos production director, and a further change of ownership came in the late s when Robert Noble was sold to Yorkshire-based textile company Moorhouse  Brook. Shortly afterwards Robert Noblersquos new managing director resigned, and Mr Brett was appointed his successor, remaining in post with the company until his retiral in  at the age of .Richard Ryley, a sales director with Robert Noble who worked alongside Mr Brett for  years, described him as a great colleague and incredibly approachable. ldquoHe was respected and well-liked not only by workers at the mill, but by associates in the textile trade throughout the United Kingdom and beyond.ldquoHe possessed great charm, but never shied away from making big or tough decisions. He was a wonderful mentor, and I will always be grateful for his sound advice and the support he willingly gave to myself and to all members of staff.In  he was appointed Deacon of the Scottish Borders Manufacturersrsquo Corporation, later serving as a Walkerburn Community Councillor, and for a time was a director of Live Borders, the culture, sport and leisure trust for the Scottish Borders.However, without a doubt the most important event in Roly Brettrsquos le was his marriage to Betty Taylor, at that time working as an auditor with Edinburgh firm Rolleston Somerville. They first met by chance, as Rolyrsquos cousin Alastair happened to be going out with Bettyrsquos flatmate Stroma.Love quickly blossomed, and Roly and Betty were married in Strathdon Church, Aberdeenshire, on September , . After honeymooning in Perthshire, the couple set up home in a rented cottage at Cardrona, then at Kaimend, Innerleithen, before a final move in  to the family home at Caberston House, Walkerburn.The couplersquos four sons - Chris, Jeremy, Mike and Alex ndash were all schooled locally and shared their fatherrsquos passion for sport and motor cars. Family le meant everything to Roly, with Betty and the boys always at the centre of his le.His exploits on the cricket field matched his business achievements. A member of the England Schools side that included future test stars Mike Brearley and Richard Hobbs, the young all-rounder turned down a county contract with Lancashire and opted instead to play his cricket north of the border.An elegant batsman and skilful off-spin bowler, Rolyrsquos cricket career included spells with the Dunfermline, Kelso and Selkirk clubs. He captained Selkirk on their ground-breaking tour to Barbados in , and the following year led the Souters to a Border League  Border Knock-out Cup double.Once his playing days were over, Roly qualied as a cricket coach, helping steer the South of Scotland u- side to its first Scottish Championship.A familiar adversary during his cricketing career was Gala wicket-keeper Ronnie Murray. ldquoRoly was a breath of fresh air when he first arrived on the Border scene, said Ronnie. ldquoHe was an excellent all-rounder, a true sportsman and also great fun to be with.ldquoHe played in a very good Kelso team that included players like John Rutherford and Michael Taylor, before helping inspire Selkirk to a string of successes in the s. You could always depend on Roly to anchor an innings, while he had a knack of picking up quick wickets when he came on to bowl.Golf was another sport at which he excelled, twice winning the Woollen Merchants  Manufacturers Cup, competed for annually at Sunningdale. The ornate trophy is kept on display at the British Golf Museum in St Andrews.As well as being a member of Peebles Golf Club, he also held memberships with Luffness Golf Club in East Lothian and Port Salon Golf Club in Donegal, close to Rathmullan where his father moved after retiring from the army.An interest in classic cars led to the ownership of a number of models being kept at Walkerburn over the years, including a vintage Daimler, Porsche and Mercedes SL.In  Mr Brett was diagnosed with frontal lobe dementia, a progressive condition affecting behaviour, personality and speech.As the disease began to take its inevitable toll, the love and support shown by Betty, members of his family and close friends , in addition to the kindness and understanding shown by staff in the BGHrsquos Cauldshiels Ward and at Murray House, Kelso, ensured Roly received the best possible care in his final months.Mr Brett is survived by Betty and their four sons, his sister Jo, brother Will, daughters-in-law Denise, Shona, Debbie and Mumba, and by eight grandchildren.A service of thanksgiving for Roly Brettrsquos le will be held in the Borders Crematorium, Melrose, on Tuesday, March , at pm.J.D.R.S."},{"url":null,"title":"dates-confirmed-2020-innerleithen-music-festival","story":"ORGANISERS have announced that this years Innerleithen Music Festival will take place during the weekend of August -to-.Now in its th year the festival continues to provide a great  for fantastic music in the heart of the Borders.True to its tradition there will be events taking place across multiple venues in Innerleithen.And, as usual, much of the activity will be centred at the Vale Club where lsquoLive and Localrsquo will be staged over the three days.Andy Wright from Innerleithen Music Festival said: \"The Innerleithen Music Festival has a strong reputation amongst artists and audience alike.\"Bands and singers approach us throughout the year enquiring about performance opportunities.\"Over the years we have showcased hundreds of bands and solo performers from across Scotland and farther afield, including such household names as Eddie Reader, Capercaillie, Skipinnish as well as traditional music favourites Phil and Aly.\"Last year one of our largest audiences was for local musician and rising star Tommy Ashby who is currently carving out a great reputation on the national music scene.\"Ahead of the festival this summer a fundraising concert will be held in the Union Club on Saturday, March .Already confirmed for next months concert are Redwood Rejects, Soul , All the Angels, Bobs Boiler Room and Dylan Paterson.Tickets go on sale from lsquoThe Hub on the High Streetrsquo, Innerleithen on March ."},{"url":null,"title":"gareths-newspaper-snaps-help-replace-peebles-high-camera","story":"A local photographer who captured haunting images of firefighters tackling the blaze at Peebles High School has donated the profits of his pictures to the school.Award winning photographer Gareth Easton was in Peebles when his children, both pupils at Peebles High, called to say the school was on fire.This week he spoke to reporter and former colleague Hilary Scott, about how he turned his pictures of the pupils running from the burning school, into an image of students with beaming smiles.INNERLEITHEN photographer Gareth Easton has snapped murder scenes, G riots, drugs raids, and even gambled with his own le aboard a trawler by capturing the danger inherent in commercial fishing ndash which netted him a national award.Never did he imagine that his next big job would be photographing the inferno of the secondary school both his children attend.ldquoOn the day of the fire I was working in Peebles.

You should self-isolateyou have travelled to any of the following places:to Hubei province in China in the last  daysto Iran, areas of northern Italy in lockdown or \"special care zone\" areas in South Korea since  Februaryto other parts of mainland China or South Korea, Thailand, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau in the last  days and have a cough, high temperature or shortness of breathto other parts of northern Italy , Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos or Myanmar since  February and have a cough, high temperature or shortness of breathHow do I self-isolate The best place to self-isolate yourself is obviously your own home, where you should stay for the duration of your quarantine.This means you shouldnt go to work, school or public areas, and not use any public transport or taxis.If you need something from outside your home, you canask friends, family members or delivery services to carry out errands for you.But youre advised to try to avoid visitors to your home, though it is OK for friends and family or delivery drivers to drop off food and other supplies.WhatIm not at home Of course, its possible that any coronavirus symptoms could arise while youre out and about.If this is the case, the official advice insists that you do not go to a GP surgery or hospital, as that could spread the virus inordinately.Instead, you should try to find a room to isolate yourself away from others. Ask for helpyou need to, but try to stay at least two metres away from other people.Open a window for ventilationyou can, but otherwise touch objects and surfaces as little as possible, and call  for advice.If you find yourself on public transport and become unwell, you should go back to your home or place of residence immediately.How long should I self-isolate for ,params: .pushYou may need to do

to try and minimise the spread of the Coronavirus.Nicole Rogers, Solicitor at DAS Law, has been looking at the impact this has on workers rights and pay.If I feel that I should be lsquoself-isolatingrsquo, can my employer deduct my pay for the time I am away from work This will depend on the facts.If you are otherwise fit for work but are taking precautionary steps by lsquoself-isolatingrsquo, technically you are not entitled to pay.However, it is good practice for employers not to deduct pay in these situations.An employee would usually be lsquoself-isolatingrsquo on the advice of a doctor and it is sensible for an employer to show understanding in order to fulfil health and safety obligation and maintain good staff relations.In addition, to withhold pay could encourage an employee toto work prematurely which might potentially risk spreading the virus.Many employers can allow temporary flexible working arrangements where employees can work from home.What are my rightsIrsquom quarantined and my boss refuses to pay my salary If you have contracted the virus, normal rules around sick pay will apply and you will either receive Statutory Sick Payor contractual sick pay.If your employer has specically told you not to come into the workplace as you have been in or to an affected area, you would ordinarily receive your normal pay.What is unclear is

Secretary for Health and Sport.Last year, the Primary Care Contractor Organisation outlined plans to alter the practice boundary to take patients from the Blindwells new town development.Construction is set to get under way on the first of the , phase one homes at the former opencast mine site between Prestonpans and Longniddry.Over the next decade and beyond, up to , new homes and community facilities are expected to be built there.Also proposed is a ldquoLevenhall Queen Margaret University extension as part of the boundary change at the Riverside GP practice.The practice is based at Musselburgh Primary Care Centre , along with Inveresk Medical Practice, which is separate.After it merged with Eskbridge Medical Practice, Riverside became the largest practice in East Lothian and one of the biggest in Scotland, with about , patients.Mr Beattie said: ldquoFrom correspondence with local constituents, it was clear to me that action needed to be taken to remedy the ongoing issues in relation to Riverside Medical Practice.ldquoI have spoken with Jeane Freeman, the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport, who is now working closely with NHS Lothian to ensure that a solution is found.ldquoIt was decided that the best route forward was to allow no further boundary expansions of the practice until the service is ing at a satisfactory standard.ldquoI am sure that this decision will be welcomed by all those who have concerns about the practice.He added: ldquoOf course, the NHS does not have complete control over the operations of the practice, given that the doctors are simply contracted by the NHS to run this service. However, NHS Lothian will work closely with the management going forward to ensure their budget is managed more effectively, and that the issues at hand are adequately addressed.Members of Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council have also told health bosses that the proposed boundary expansion would be ldquoa step in the wrong direction.The group contacted the Primary Care Contractor Organisation, stressing that it was ldquoabsolutely opposed to any change in the boundary area.Members also called for a meeting with health bosses, which took place recently at the practice and involved: Irene Tait, community council chairperson Margaret Stewart, community council secretary Holly Kilday, a community council member Dr Richard Fairclough and Dr Joana Stenke of Riverside Medical Practice ward councillors Stuart Currie and Katie Mackie Iain Gorman, East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnershiprsquos head of operations and Councillor Fiona OrsquoDonnell, chairperson of East Lothian Integration Joint Board.The community councillors highlighted complaints they had received from members of the community, including:A statement issued by the community council following the discussion said: ldquoWe wondered why on earth the practice would want to take on more of a workload when clearly they are not coping with what they have to deal with at present.ldquoThe practice acknowledged the fact that they had undergone many changes in the last few years, not least the fact that they are on their third telephone system.ldquoThe practice also stated they will need to step up to the mark with a communication plan, making sure that everyone in our community is aware of how the practice is working and what options are available to them.ldquoThe expectation from the public is,they phone for a doctorsrsquo appointment, they will see a doctor and this is not always going to be the case.ldquoWhen you call you will be given two options, same day or non-urgent, and this will enable the staff to put you on to the right person who can help and this could be NHS , paramedics, physio, mental health or occupational therapistor alternatively, a doctornecessary on the same day.Wrong direction ldquoWe discussed the boundaries and made them aware that we felt that to take on Blindwells would be a step in the wrong direction.ldquoThe meeting was quite positive and hopefully, moving forward, we will keep in touch with the practice and they with us so that everyone is kept informed.Dr Stenke and Dr Fairclough issued a joint statement, saying: ldquoWe were delighted to meet with the Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council representatives and local councillors. We felt it was a really positive opportunity to discuss many of the changes that have happened in Musselburgh over the last few years to stabilise and develop primary care services.ldquoIt is really important for us at Riverside to understand the views of the community we serve, which can be hugely supportive in improving services. For example, feedback on our old phone system helped us to understand the issues that our patients were experiencing and led to us developing a new telephone system that was more suitable for our patientsrsquo needs as well as those of the practice.ldquoRiverside, along with other practices in the county, are collaborating with and supporting East Lothianrsquos Health and Social Care Partnershiprsquos plan to grow health services to meet the needs of a growing population.ldquoWe remain keen to improve our engagement and communication with the local community, and the meeting was a positive step to build links with local groups.ldquoWe are grateful to the community council representatives and local councillors for taking the time to visit us at Riverside Medical Practice and we look forward to developing a closer and collaborative relationship with them.An East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership spokesperson said: ldquoWe thought the meeting with Riverside and the community council was very positive. We were impressed by Riversidersquos commitment to engaging with the community and communicating developments. We look forward to supporting them in any way that we can.Councillor Mackie added: ldquoIt was a helpful meeting with community stakeholders and local GPs. There was recognition that previous changes to the Riverside practice could have been better communicated to patients and a real willingness to improve engagement with the local community.ldquoHopefully this is the start of really meaningful engagement with local GPs at Riverside."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-advice-issued-queen-margaret-university","story":"An email sent to all students and staff says that the inidual has been told to stay at home for  days as a ldquoprecautionary measure.More than , people have died from coronavirus after it was first reported late last year.The QMU inidual has not been identied and it is not knownthey are a staff member or student at the university, based in Musselburgh.The email also states that ldquothere is no particular need for concern and the university is ldquofollowing standard NHS advice.The email reads: ldquoYou will be aware of the coronavirus from media reports, and from previous communications issued by the university, and the requirement that people ing to the UK from mainland China and other specied countries should follow ing travellersrsquo advice.ldquoIn line with the travellersrsquo advice, we have been advised that a member of the QMU community, who has recently ed from travel in Thailand, has developed flu-like symptoms, and has therefore, as a precautionary measure,been advised to remain at home for a period of  days.

When the fire effect is switched on, it gives an impressive imitation of a real one.Our small terraced house once had a real fire place, of course, but like so many it was modernised before I moved in, and it was filled in and central heating installed.Yet I am old enough to have lived all my childhood in the lsquos and lsquos without experiencing central heating! It did exist, of course, just not in the houses I lived in as a child!One memory I have is of arriving home from school on a cold winterrsquos afternoon and seeing the smoke coming from the chimney of the church house we lived in at the east end of the Pans. My father had lit the fire early and I still remember its welcoming warmth, and the way it crackled and danced as it defrosted my face and hands. Me and my brothers sat by it, jostling for the best space.Donrsquot get me wrong, Irsquom not complaining about central heating! I know Irsquom lucky to have a warm house and never take it for granted. We donrsquot use the lsquofirersquo for heat, that would be too expensive. But we switch it on for atmosphere. And the effect on the younger kids has been immediate. They sit by it, lie on blankets by it reading and playing and telling stories. I forget that they have little personal experience of having a hearth, even an articial one. The novelty will wane, perhaps, but I hope the cosy pleasure of it wonrsquot.Itrsquos not just the kids, as my we and I love sitting by it in the evening. Wersquove even moved some of the furniture, so this pretend but convincing fireplace, rather than the telly, has become the main focal point of the living room.You could say Irsquom easily pleased, and I suppose thatrsquos true. But our friends have commented on it too, one saying ldquoit really has given your house a dferent atmosphere as he sat by it with the wind howling outside.The hearth has traditionally been the soul of a house. The family would sit by it, soak in the warmth and watch the flames, while telling stories and talking. It was a draw for social communion. Visitors would be welcomed with a place by it and most of the cooking would have taken place there too. The old saying ldquolang may yer lums reekindicated the importance of a lit hearth as a symbol of wellbeing and good fortune.No wonder so many traditions and ceremonies were centred around the hearth. People used to leave objects buried within or near it. There were ious reasons for this: to capture bad spirits that may come down the chimney, for good luck or to deflect a witchrsquos spell. The hearth was seen as a kind of spiritual portal, to be defended and made safe, not just physically.The hearth was also a focus of many ceremonies that marked the changing seasons. The Celtic calendar is full of such events, Imbolc being the most recent. And of course there were the daily rituals of banking up the fire at night, and reviving it in the morning, and keeping it going. All these simple tasks are now fast fading into folk memory.Today, screens are more likely to be the focal point of our homes. Itrsquos kind of unavoidable, of course, and I claim no moral high ground of this issue. But the truth is they drug our senses and dull our conviviality, and, like many parents, we have tried to limit their use in our house. It has felt like a losing battle with my children who, I understand, live in a very dferent childhood to mine. And I readily concede itrsquos got lots of benefits, even though at times I may sound like an old dinosaur lamenting the passing of the Jurassic age.But the arrival of our fake woodburning stove has transformed our house in a way that shows we have lost something in the lsquomodernisingrsquo of our homes. As a storyteller, I have come to understand the importance of a hearth as a focal point for gathering it has the power to bring people together, to share warmth and light but also each otherrsquos presence and social connection. As the freezing wind rages outside, it is a magical space.That magic has been the true gt from my storyteller friend, and she wisely knew it. While much is missing from an articial fire, including the smell and sound of the real thing, our ancestral instinct still kicks in by the visual sight of a flickering hearth.So now my instructions to switch off the screens is more readily obeyed, because it signals time to get together around the fire and lsquobe together properlyrsquo to tell stories and challenge each other with riddles.Burnrsquos poem The Cotterrsquos Saturday Night now has new meaning in our house:To meet their dad, wi flichterin noise and glee.His wee bit ingle, blinkin bonilie,His clean hearth-stane, his thrty wiersquos smile,The lisping infant, prattling on his knee,Does arsquo his weary kiaugh and care beguile,An makes him quite forget his labor and his toil."},{"url":null,"title":"bench-put-place-memory-tranent-legend-bobby-marr","story":"Bobby Marr, who ran a greengrocer and florist on Tranentrsquos Winton Place for nearly  years, passed away last July.The -year-old was a familiar face to many in Tranent town centre, with hundreds attending his funeral.Marion Hoggan was heavily involved in the fundraising for the bench for Mr Marr, who had colon cancer.She said: ldquoI did not manage the funeral due to work commitments and I felt that I wanted to do something for him.

She was full of old stories. She had come to East Lothian when she was a young girl and lived there ever since. But she brought with her the stories she had been told when she was wee. They were tales told to her by her grandfather, a crofter from the west of Scotland, who had moved his family to the north east in hard times. Her grandfather had shared the stories collected by folklorist Donald Mackenzie, who wrote Wonder Tales from Scottish Myth and Legend.Now, in her old age, she loved sharing her version of these stories with her grandchildren. They were a mix of old legends and she knew that there were dferent versions. But the version told to her by her grandfather was of course her favourite.Her grandchildren settled around her fireplace and sipped their hot chocolate in anticipation. Their gran always sat in silence for a moment before speaking. It was asshe was waiting for a curtain to raise in their imagination.Then she began her story.ldquoBeria was the queen orsquo the dark times, the ruler of winter. She wis tall and strang. In fact she carried a great hammer, with which she made the Scottish mountains. She had a fearsome temper and looked scary, with one eye and lang white hair. There are mony stories aboot her, this is just ane orsquo them.ldquoYe see, while she ruled winter, at this time orsquo year, the signs orsquo spring began tae appear, and she felt she wis loosing her power. People grew less feart orsquo her and began tae resist her power. They looked forrit tae the arrival orsquo the summer queen, who wis carsquod Bride. She was the bringer of light and plentul times, and so people loved her and looked forward to her arrival. Beria was jealous orsquo her.ldquoThis is why Beria kept Bride a prisoner. She made Bride work hard and kept her in ragged claes.ldquoLike Cinderella! exclaimed the youngest, excitedly. Her gran smiled and nodded.ldquoBut Bride managed tae escape, helped by the man she loved, who became known as King Angus, and ever since people have celebrated that day. It wis oan February , but many years ago the calendar changed, and sae itrsquos February  that I celebrate Bridersquos day.ldquoAnd sae Bride wis free and wore new claes, which were bright and colourful. She set aboot sowing the seeds orsquo spring. She sprinkled snawdraps, and the blossom was encouraged tae bloom. The first bird tae sing in celebration of Bridersquos freedom was a wee linnet. Its sweet singing filled the air with the sound orsquo spring, and ever since folk huv carsquod the linnet lsquoThe Bird orsquo Bridersquo.ldquoBut what about Beria, wasnrsquot she mad that Bride escaped  asked one of her grandchildren.ldquoIrsquom coming tae that. She wis indeed. When she heard that Bride had escaped, she was furious, her rage knew no limits! She knew that this would end her power. She tried tae capture her again but she fled with Angus. Sae Beira took her great hammer and struck the ground with it, making ice and frost tae kill the grass and flowers that had dared tae start grawing. But the linnets continued to sing and this encouraged mair birds tae sing as well. It became a chorus.ldquoEnraged, Beria collected her servants, who were hags who rode on shaggy goats, while she rode on a huge black steed. They raised storms and winds tae silence the birds, and tae blow ower trees and strip them orsquo branches.ldquoThen she pursquod dark clouds ower the land, and ripped them open, sae cauld rain drenched the land, destroying food and making the soil drookit, killing livestock and ruining peoplersquos hames.ldquoWow, Beria was angry, and pretty mean too, said a grandchild.ldquoAye, she wis. She wanted tae keep winter going sae her power would last longer. She whipped up a gale wi a wind sae cauld and sharp it felt like a bird pecking at yer skin. It lasted fir mair than a week!ldquoWi arsquo these storms fishermen couldnae fish, the food orsquo folk was being wasted as the fodder and winter stores were ravaged by the storms.ldquoBut then March arrived and mair light filled the days. This increased the strength orsquo Bride, the summer queen, who ed with her husband Angus to sow mair seeds orsquo spring.ldquoIn a last desperate attempt tae keep her power, Beria took three days orsquo deep winter she hud kept aside, and used them tae bring blizzards and snowstorms. She coated the land in a white freezing blanket.ldquoBut after these three days, the winter queenrsquos power wis spent. Bride and Angus once again ed, riding through the countryside, chasing awa the hags and sowing spring wherever they went.

All that wee and poor Scotland would be able to afford would be wall-to-wall White Heather Club, interspersed with speeches from Alex Salmond.You can see where Irsquom going with this, canrsquot you :He acts the clown but Boris Johnson is a Bolshevik about powerThe former BBC Director-General, John Birt, said that Scots might not be able watch the BBC at all. Well, as it turns out perhaps no one will. At the weekend No Ten declared war on the BBC, saying that timersquos up for the licence fee.ldquoWersquore going to whack them, said a Government source, quoted in The Sunday Times. Probably been watching too many episodes of The Sopranos.The future is subscription. People wonrsquot pay a video poll tax in the age of Netflix, wersquore told. The BBC should sink or swim in the market ndash probably the former. First casualties will be local and ldquoregionalldquo servicesWersquore assured that this has nothing whatever to do with Andrew Neilrsquos lecture on the PMrsquos integrity when he refused to appear on his show during the General Election campaignNow, itrsquos not yet clear that the Government will get away with this. Many Tory MPs remain friends of the Beeb .Contrariwise, there are many independence supporters who hate the ldquoYoon BBC so much they are egging Mr Johnson on. There is a broad coalition of contempt for the BBC.This extends from most Labour Party members, who took to social media to condemn Laura Kuenssberg for being a Tory spokesperson, to the Daily , which believes the BBC is owned by Gina Miller and the Peoplersquos Vote campaign.It was ever thus. The BBC always gets both ideological barrels. But the point is that all this makes a nonsense of the claim that only by remaining in the UK could Scots still tune in to David Attenborough. Hersquos all over Netflix anyway.And the curious thing is that now there actually is a Scottish dedicated TV channel it is not filled with mawkish sentimentality and tartan kitsch. Most of the Scottishprogramming is rather good. Documentaries like Poverty Safari presented by the rapper Loki, for example ndash something the UK BBC would never have done.And therersquos quality. The drama Guilt was as good as anything on Netflix. Scotland has a unique character that is well suited to sardonic noir.The BBC is only the latest example of Scotland potentially losing great British institutions that were supposedly threatened onlywe voted Yes. Remember Royal Bank of Scotland saying that it would up sticks after independence Well, without a trace of irony, or self-awareness, RBS has just renamed itself the National Westminster Bank, in recognition of the fact that  per cent of its business is in the South.Another pillar of the Scottish financial sector, Standard Le, also threatened to leave Scotlandthere was a Yes vote in . It has now shted pound billion in assets to Dublin.Scots have a highly-developed sense of self-deprecating humour. Just as well. Because otherwise we might get very angryndash like those French demonstrators in Yellow Vests. Wersquore used to it. Like the weather.But yoursquod think that there would be just a hint of contrition from those nominally Scottish institutions which sought so recklessly to damage Scotlandrsquos reputation and national self-confidence five years agoRBS was already effectively a London bank in , with the majority of its operations in England. The threatened departure was contrived for political purposes.The same goes for Standard Le. Without a momentrsquos reflection, it has shted a number of operations to Ireland the better to remain in the European Union.I need hardly remind readers that Scots were told that only by voting No in , could Scotland be sure of remaining in the European Union. David Nish, the boss of Standard Le said almost exactly that. Many Scots believed him. When the history of Scottish independence is written, that will be up there with the poll tax and Margaret Thatcher.The list of broken referendum promises goes on and on. ldquoAs near a federal system as possible in the UK was how the former Labour PM, Gordon Brown, described the constitutional future should Scotland reject independence. That was the substance of The Vow published by the Daily Record, in cod vellum, and signed by all three UK party leaders.Well, the powers of Holyrood have been substantially curbed in the UK Withdrawal Act. The UK Government, when it can be bothered, insists that those powers over agriculture, fisheries, environment and so on will come winging back once Boris has Got Brexit Done.Anyone who believes that hasnrsquot been listening. Scotland will be allowed to administer these s, but standards will be set by the UK the better to facilitate trade deals with countries like America. Similarly, Michael Goversquos promise that Scotland would get powers over immigration after Brexit look ridiculous now.Itrsquos enough to make you want another referendum. Nicola Sturgeon keeps saying that Indyref will happen later this year. But that is a heroic case of hope triumphing over experience, or reality itself.The joke is on us. There wonrsquot be another legal referendum now that Mr Johnson is home with an -seat majority in Westminster.It feels ashistory itself is trolling Scotland, seeing just how much humiliation Scots are prepared to take.:Boris-induced surge evokes electric shock experimentEnglish people werenrsquot so docile and biddable. When Brexiters were confronted with Project Fear, they scoffed and voted regardless for what they regarded as independence from Brussels.Scots were given an offer they couldnrsquot refuse in : a borderless independence within Europe. Unfortunately, we did refuse it. And wersquore stuck with it.And herersquos the kicker.

reliably reversed.Now Scottish scientists say they have identied the genetic culprit responsible, and itrsquos all to do with a complex conjunction between latitude, sunlight... and whether or not a prospective baldy sprouts on a mountain.Unfortunately for anyone facing the prospect of a receding hairline, the baldness-related mystery solved by researchers only concerns plants, particularly those which grow on upland slopes.And despite the established convention of the animal kingdom that hairier equals warmer, in plants the opposite is true.Scientists at the University of Edinburgh have been studying a puzzle which has long baffled botanists ndash why some plants on high mountainsides have hair, while their low-lying cousins are smooth.Alpine species of snapdragon are covered in a downy fluff across much of their stalks and leaves, given them a far more hirsute appearance than their lowland cousins, which remain hairless.A study of the genetic make-up of these plants has revealed that those growing on higher elevations have evolved the ability to disable a gene which prevents them from growing hair, and is switched on in plants living at lower altitudes.It is believed that the reason behind this is to do with protection from the sun, as the small hairs may act like UV sunscreen to protect alpine plants growing in full sunlight on lofty, exposed clfs.Low-lying plants might not need to make the hairs because of the relative abundance of shade in valleys, protecting them from harmful rays.Although unlikely to help reverse hair loss in people, the study may yet have other beneficial results.Researchers hope their insights could aid the production of useful chemicals secreted by the hairs of some plants, including the antimalarial drug artemisinin, and the substance that give herbs and hops their flavours.Researchers named the bit of genetic code responsible for the plantsrsquo hair growth the ldquohairy gene and were able to isolate it by crossbreeding alpine and lowland species together.They scientists were able to answer the question of which plant came first ndash the hairy or the bald iety.It is thought the fact that the gene is switched off to allow hair growth indicates it evolved after the plants colonised upland areas, and was already present when snapdragons began to appear in the valleys.The findings show that the first snapdragons ndash which grew around  million years ago ndash were bald, and that newer, alpine species evolved as a result of mutations that deactivated the gene.Professor Andrew Hudson, of the University of Edinburghrsquos School of Biological Sciences, who led the study, said: ldquoThis exciting discovery gives us a chance to find out the rest of the genetic toolkit that controls plant hair growth.ldquoIt could also help us work out why exactly being hairy is an advantage for alpine plants."},{"url":null,"title":"free-bus-travel-18s-scotland-wont-work","story":"While providing free bus travel for those aged  and under in Scotland makes sense with regards alleviating poverty providing children with independence to travel without needing adults to taxi them about and boosting Scotlands green credentials, not everyone is happy.\"Mobile gang huts,\" I saw someone lament online.Oh to be young again and know that you are viewed with suspicion and dislike merely for your age. Imagine the nations bus routes do turn into a network of mobile gang huts, full of boozed up teens terrorising elderly passengers and swinging from the fold up seats where buggies with innocent bairns are meant to fit.At least theyd be off the streets, eh In my extensive bus experience, wild behaviour is normally the preserve of the adults aboard. Last week on my journey there were glorious scenes between a beleaguered mum and her grown up son. He insisted he would sit upstairs while she complained her knees wouldnt allow her to join him.From half way along the bottom deck she screamed up to him, \"Get yersel down here.\" He would not budge and so the conversation was carried on between them as though they were in the house and he was shut in his bedroom, she insisting he come down for his tea.\"Ye cannae choose yer family, eh \" she aimed at a hipsterish young man behind her, in an attempt to strike up some bonhomie. He would have absolutely none of it and kept his gaze focused on his phone screen. Beautully done.While I do not share the naysayers concerns that the Scottish Governments plans for a National Concessionary Travel scheme for those aged  and under will lead to moving hotbeds of anti-social behaviour, I do think this policy has aimed and missed.Or, perhaps, aimed and not landed at the feet of enough people.Of course, its a refreshing change to be using the bus itself to send a message rather than sticking meaningless messages on the sides of buses.Bus use has fallen by  per cent over the past five years, data released this week by the Scottish Government shows. At the same time, car travel increased with a record number - three million - of cars now registered in Scotland.Overall, journeys made by public transport have fallen by eight million over the past year.People have a peculiar snobbery about bus travel that they do not have about trains. That quote, oft attributed to Margaret Thatcher, about bus travel being a sign of personal failure casts a long shadow. And there arent leagues of bus spotters hanging about depots in the manner of locomotive lovers.There seems to be a notion that buses are for the working classes, and not the respectable ones. Those who choose other modes of transport already seem to think the bus is a wild west wilderness and thats before the marauding young folk are added to the mix.Bus clientele, though, are attracted by convenience. Not everyone lives near or within walking distance of a train station but most streets have a bus route to serve them.Certainly the customer base is not attracted by a bargain. To travel by train from my home to Glasgow city centre is pound. for a . To travel the same distance by bus is pound. Thats a signicant sum to travel just over one mile.When I moved into my flat in  the bus fare for a single was p and remained so for over a year. Its now pound., a  per cent increase.Im sure the operator would point out that I can get the fare marginally cheaper by downloading its app and purchasing tickets that way but to do so would involve buying an updated smart phone, which Im not inclined to do. Nor should I be - bus travel should be affordable.While the bus network is in the control of private companies, it will always be designed to serve profit over people. In Glasgow there have been several services threatened with the axe and others axed completely. First Glasgow says these routes are not well used enough to continue but, for those who do use them, they are a leline.Were I still a teenager, the new concessionary scheme would be nothing to mebecause the bus route that serves the area of Coatbridge where I used to live has been stopped by First Glasgow. I used to take it in one direction to get to school and in the other direction to get into Glasgow for work.It was vital because the local train line didnt - and didnt until  - run on a Sunday, which is extraordinary when you stop to think about it.The route that was stopped, the , was the only direct service from that part of Coatbridge in to Glasgow, the only direct service up to Airdrie and also served Monklands University Hospital, all the local supermarket, the main GP surgery and the town centre. Now the area is served by a selection of shuttle buses, some that dont run on a Sunday, some that take long weekends off and some that run once an hour.I cant imagine its a unique case but it does illustrate the need for buses to be publicly owned and designed to serve the public rather than monetise them.If one of the main aims of the National Concessionary Travel scheme is to improve the environment then extend it to make bus travel free for all. Driving is infinitely more convenient than taking the bus so its no wonder that car journeys are on the increase.Buses are slow and expensive. To get to a recent hospital appointment I could have driven in  minutes for free. The bus takes  minutes and costs pound. for an all day ticket. Where is the inducement to spend nearly a fiver to sit for more than an hour on a bus when you can do acommute in comfort for  minutes \"Environment benefits\" are an opaque concept to many commuters. So far government and local council policy has been to force drivers away from their cars by punishment - raising parking costs, say - when motorists may respond more to luring than force.Raising fuel duty to make car use more unattractive is the right way to go but, once out of their cars, drivers need to know that money is being invested in a coherent, high quality and extensive bus service that preferably runs  hours.Free travel for children is a solid start but the next step needs to be ensuring bus travel is still an attractive proposition once they hit the age of ."},{"url":null,"title":"msps-back-budget-tories-say-free-bus-plan-con","story":"THE Scottish budget has cleared its first parliamentary stage amid taunts the Scottish Greens have been ldquoplayed like a fiddle in their deal with the SNP.MSPs voted  to  on the general principles of the Bill for the   budget, with the second and final votes expected to be a formality next week.It followed SNP Finance Secretary Kate Forbes and Green co-leader Patrick Harvie announcing on Wednesday they had struck a deal to get the package approved.After telling MSPs three weeks ago that the poundbn at the Governmentrsquos disposal had been fully allocated, Ms Forbes found an extra poundm at the last minute to bring the Greens on board.This includes poundm for councils, poundm for the police, and poundm to develop a free bus travel scheme for under-s starting in January .In a lively debate before the vote, the Tories said ldquoPatrick the poodle and his party had been taken in by a ldquocon trick, with the bus travel scheme far from certain to be delivered.Tory MSP Donald Cameron said: ldquoWhat have the Greens received  Theyrsquove received funding to support preparations to introduce concessionary farespossible, subject to research and due diligence.

While the circumstances that leylandii are planted will not be conclusive as to whether there is a hedge, it is a relevant consideration.\"The judge said: \"It may well be, as the petitionersubmitted, that woodland is sometimes planted in discernible rows.\"\"The pattern of the planting in rows was nonetheless a relevant consideration in discerning whether the trees were a hedge. Hedges are generally planted in a line of some sort,\" she said.It was argued on behalf of Mr Rizza that the reporter was irrational in ordering the identied trees to be cut back to two metres without considering the effect of one row on another and in concluding that the height reduction would not signicantly alter the privacy or outlook of the hedge owner.But Lady Carmichael said: \"The reporter was deciding what action was required to remedy the adverse effects of the height of the hedge on the enjoyment of  Drummond Circus that its occupant could reasonably expect to have.\"\"Having reached the conclusion she did as to the adverse effects, it was reasonably open to her to decide that the appropriate remedy was to require the whole hedge be reduced in height,\" said the judge.Mr and Mrs Niven originally applied to Highland Council in  seeking that a high hedges notice be issued.Mr Rizza subsequently appealed to the Scottish Ministers who appointed the reporter and she gave her decision in December .The reporter concluded that the high hedge was a barrier to light which impacted on the garden and the windows of rooms at the rear of  Drummond Circus.ENDS"},{"url":null,"title":"thousands-due-join-greta-thunberg-bristol-climate-strike","story":"Bristol Youth Strike  Climate will begin with speeches, including one by the -year-old, on College Green at am.Greta is due to join protesters, including school pupils, on a march through Bristol city centre.Heading for the UK!

Similarly, some children are also cycling without a helmet and I would urge parents to ensure their children are suitably equipped to go out cycling safely.”Committee vice-chair Councillor Rosemary Bruce added: “Aberdeenshire schools are great supporters of the Bikeability scheme which provides training and advice for both the pupils and their families.

More, of course, needs to be done, not leastwe are to meet the challenge of the climate emergency, but I have no doubt that farmers in Orkney and across the country are up for meeting that challenge.“In order to be able to do that, however, they will need access to a broad range of measures, reflecting the dferent circumstances and approaches to agriculture across the country. This will allow each to make a meaningful contribution to reducing emissions, improving sustainability while safeguarding a sector that plays a crucial role within our economy.“It is also important that any future trade agreements negotiated hold food imports to the same high standards we require of our domestic food producers. It makes no sense to demand standards of our own farming sector that we are prepared to ignore when it comes to those importing food into the UK. This is not an unreasonable demand from the NFUS and I am pleased it is one that enjoys cross-party support, including from Scottish Ministers.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Exceptions would include charges that are set by legislation.OIC’s funding allocation from the Scottish Government for the year ahead currently amounts to £. million.

If Orkney was funded in the same way as the Western Isles, we would receive up to £. million more each year to deliver council services.“A great deal of thought and effort has been devoted to finding ways to lessen the impact on our community, our staff and the organisation itself. But we are having to recommend a range of cuts to services that are valued by people in Orkney. These are dficult decisions to make.”The measures recommended by the committee would result in a reduction of the council’s workforce by the equivalent of . full time equivalent posts.Of these, one full time equivalent post is currently vacant. For the remaining posts, the intention would be to avoid compulsory redundanciespossible and look instead at alternatives such as redeployment, voluntary redundancy and retirement.The committee also recommended that a contribution of up to £. million should come from the Strategic Reserve Fund to support services during the year ahead.The committee’s recommendation that Council Tax bills in Orkney should increase by . per cent from April  is agreed, it would result in an overall Council Tax income of £. million during  – .The committee’s recommendations go to a meeting of the Full Council on Tuesday, March ,  for further consideration.If approved, the following Council Tax charges, in the table below, would apply in Orkney for the year ahead.Households with only one adult living in the property will continue to receive a discount of  per cent on the charges detailed above.Further details in The Orcadian on Thursday. vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

After a third-place finish in the North District event in December and a fth place finish in the Inter Districts event in January, expectations were high for another strong performance in what is the flagship age grade cross country championship of the season.A field of  athletes took to the start line at Callendar Park in conditions which saw everything from sunshine, wind, hail and snow.

From the former perspective, the big positive about the Scots so far this year is that they have conceded the fewest tries and the least points of any of the six teams. Few would have predicted that a month ago.Hamish Watson got the nod for man of the match against the Italians, another indication that the open-side flanker is back to his very best. Others to stand out were loose-head prop Rory Sutherland, the find of the tournament, and Watson’s back row colleague Jamie Ritchie.Elsewhere at the weekend France proved just too good for Wales in Cardf, and are now the only side left with the chance of a Grand Slam. The French have been very impressive this season and have about five or six players who would be in a combined Six Nations team so far.At Twickenham there was a typical battle between two outfits who prefer brute strength to artistry. What little flair was evident mostly emanated from Ireland in the latter stages, but England had got so far ahead by half-time the game was really over.Sadly once again we had a referee, this time Jaco Peyper, seemingly unwilling to penalise a side which is consistently in breach of the offside rule.Irish fly-half Jonny Sexton, who had an awful game himself including making a complete mess of two kicks, could regularly be seen complaining to the referee. That even included pointing to players who were blatantly in the wrong place, but Peyper refused to take action.Only midway through the second half, when the Irish were all but buried, did Peyper appear to notice that so many white shirts were lying on the wrong side of the ball. I found that absolutely baffling.A week on Sunday Scotland will be in action again, this time back at Murrayfield against leaders France. That could be close, with the French chasing a clean sweep and the Scots still harbouring hopes of finishing third or fourth in the table.While the Finn Russell saga shows no sign of sorting itself out, and Adam Hastings likely to continue at number  despite being out of touch against Italy, it would be good to have a couple of players back from injury. The presence of either winger Darcy Graham and lock back row Sam Skinner would strengthen things in both departments.Team of the tournament so far: Elliot DalyJonny May , Robbie Henshaw , Gael Fickou , Mattia BelliniRomain Ntamack , Antoine DupontC J Stander , Jamie Ritchie , Gregory AlldrittAlun Wyn Jones , Bernard Le RouxRory Sutherland , Julien Marchand , Joe Marler .: : : : : : : :Two of my favourite footballers, in my opinion the greatest ever strikers from their respective international sides, celebrated their th birthdays over the past week.Last Thursday it was the turn of Jimmy Greaves, who sadly is not in good health having suffered a serious stroke five years ago.A documentary on BT Sport that evening covered all aspects of Greaves’ career, ranging from his early days at Cha, a big money move to AC Milan, theto Tottenham Hotspur, the shock transfer to West Ham and his final days in non-league football.The programme also touched on the hepatitis which he suffered from during the - season. He was warned that he would lose up to a yard in pace as a result of the illness, but bounced back with four goals in an away victory over Norway.Then came the  World Cup, an injury against France and Greaves’ omission from the side for the final. To see his replacement Geoff Hurst, who was an inferior player, score a hat trick and ultimately receive a knighthood, must have been dficult for Greaves. But typically he was magnanimous about the issue.At the end of his West Ham career Greaves succumbed to severe alcoholism, which brought his contract to an end. After four years away from the game he made a comeback with Barnet among other non-league clubs, and although still impressive his best was long gone.Greaves later forged a new career in television, first with Star Soccer and then more famously as the funny half of the Saint and Greavsie double act with Ian St John.I have to laugh when the likes of Gary Lineker and Harry Kane are sometimes compared to Greaves. Watching old footage reveals how a good number of his goals involved running from just inside the opposition half, beating two or three players and then rounding the keeper. Comparison  There really is none.On Monday it was the th for Denis Law, my boyhood hero and favourite player of all time.Law has also not enjoyed the best of health, suffering from debilitating eye problems and also from prostate cancer. But happily he appears to be in reasonable fettle at the moment, well enough to appear at the recent BBC Sports Personality of the Year event and attend former Manchester United team mate Harry Gregg’s funeral at the weekend.They say it is not always advisable to meet your heroes, but I would gladly pay money to interview Law.: : : : : : : :It was reported last week that Neil Fenwick is in the frame for the Shetland football manager’s job.If that turns out to be the case then good luck to the Lerwick Spurs player coach.When the position was first advertised last year the wording suggested it would be a dficult task, with the applicant likely to need a strong back-up team. That probably explains why so few people came forward.I’m not convinced anyone needs to be going through an interview process over this. None of the most successful people to have held the position were subjected to such scrutiny, and they mostly did the job very well.If Fenwick is indeed the man, let’s all get behind him.: : : : : : : :There is obviously still plenty of power in the conveyor belt which produces Shetland athletics talent, as evidenced by the success of young Layla Todd at the weekend.The -year-old’s fourth-place finish in the Scottish National Cross Country Championships was a tremendous achievement, a credit to both her and her coaches.With distance runner Seumas MacKay now too old for the junior inter-county squad and sprinter Katie Dinwoodie just having a year or two left, it will be necessary for younger competitors to fill the void. Todd will likely be one of those in the frame soon for the , metres event.: : : : : : : :Boxer Tyson Fury’s display against Deontay Wilder on Sunday morning, to claim the WBC heavyweight crown, was sensational.After the previous draw between the two, when Fury was ahead on points but floored twice late on, many predicted that this time Wilder would have his measure. No chance.Whatever you think of the so-called “gypsy king”, who has not always endeared himself to the general public, he is massive box-office entertainment.Wilder may still be given a third fight, which would be disappointing, or Fury’s next outing could be a unication battle with fellow Briton Anthony Joshua.That could well be a mismatch, as Fury appears to be in a dferent league from the muscle-bound Joshua.

In early , they decided to have insulation work carried out in their home following a cold call by Mark Crilly. that Mr Crilly, a former footballer who played for the likes of Ayr United, St Mirren, and Raith Rovers, came to their bungalow in July  and offered to carry out ious jobs as part of a grant scheme. Underfloor and internal wall insulation and a staircase to allow insulation to their loft room – then only accessible by a loft ladder – was part of the package.The work began in February  after confirmation that Julie and Rachel were eligible for the insulation scheme grant as they were in receipt of working tax credits. Mrs Child claims that after initially stating that he was working under one of the warm home schemes, prior to the work being carried Mr Crilly said he now had his own company – the Central Heating Team. February  to begin the work and fitted the staircase. February that the remaining materials would be delivered on st February and that the fitters would then finish the staircase. February in which she outlined work outstanding and issues related to the work carried out along with photographic evidence of it. She also told him that she would leave a key for the workmen to access her house as she had to go to Inverness for surgery.: “They were very happy with their job, but I went in to have a look and the staircase was dangerously on a forward tilt. There was no headroom # you actually had to duck to get in the attic space. So I brought this all to Mark’s attentionand he said #yes, I’ll get them to do something about it# – but what they did was wedge in an extra bit of wood underneath the staircase to try and put the tilt backward. It’s not fixed to the floor, there’s no banister, there’s no handrail at the top. I started looking at building regulations and there isn’t two metres clearance.”She added: “The underfloor heating was fine, no problems –but I think that is really all they are capable of doing because they weren’tjoiners.”After multiple messages asking Mr Crilly what would be doneto recty the damage Julie conducted a search through Companies House to finddetails of the Central Heating Team. She discovered that it was a limitedcompany but that it did not mention Mark Crilly at all.She spoke to one of the company’s directors, David Mastertonwho told her that Mr Crilly was merely one of their lead generators and that itwas through them the underfloor insulation had been carried out. She added thatshe was told Mr Crilly did not have the correct certication in place to undertakethe internal wall insulation. Mrs Child said that Mark Crilly emailed her in April  to say that Mr Masterton would arrange for a joiner to sort the staircase as soon as possible. In June , Julie managed to track down the joiner in question.He told her that Mr Crilly had casually mentioned that there might be work for him but nothing more. Mrs Child claims that the joiner inspected the work at her home and said he was shocked at the poor workmanship and was not interested in trying to put it right.In September , Julie employed the services of theStornoway-based firm Alex Murray Construction.She said: “I went to Alex Murray Construction and they said ‘they have cut through ceiling joists, which they haven’t reinforced, it’s dangerous – you shouldn’t be using the stairs # that all needs to come out or be strengthened.’“They sent us a quote for about £, to put it back to what it was before. They suggested that we speak to the building inspectors.”In November  Comhairle nan Eilean Siar conducted a building inspection of her home.Mrs Child said: “They said ‘your home insurance is invalid. There are major structural ceiling joists that have been chopped through without any reinforcements –you have a problem and have an assessor come in, the first thing they are going to do is come up to the attic and your insurance will be void#.”Following the building inspection, Mrs Child contacted Mr Crilly to determine who was liable, to which she claims he said he was.After sending him the quote and building report, and withher house no longer insured and vulnerable to the winter weather, she sent aletter at the start of December. This explained that the couple would give MrCrilly fourteen days to pay the quote in full otherwise they would take legalaction.She said: “He did email us and offer the deposit and money on completion but as we had already told him, the construction company would not accept that. They needed the money paid up front. He never got a valid quote for the work with them nor took it any further. All he has done is stall at every opportunity.“He has made us feel very foolish and like complete idiots.We came over here for the quiet le and we’ve no mortgage – so that we can makea few changes with our little business. There is no money in the bank to repairwhat he has done.” contacted Mr Crilly for comment, but we have not received a response."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/001WH2102NCA.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week service users at Tigh na Drochaid Resource Centre in Portree produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

So perhaps the best option is mixing some old favourites with a few which only made the grade recently.” . Anyone who knows me will not be surprised my first pick will be a Van Morrison track. There are so many which mean so much. Caravan, In the Garden, Tupelo Honey among dozens of classic songs. But I’ve decided to go with a track from the new album Three Chords and the Truth. Morrison thrives when he dips into spirituality and mysticism. At  the Man still has it. The song is Dark Night of the Soul, Van Morrison.  Glen Hansard’s music has been a source of much enjoyment in recent years. Great tunes but my choice is a track featuring Clarence Clemons’ son Jake. Drive All Night, Glen Hansard  John Martyn was a genius. His music transcends styles and fashions. Solid Air one of the finest albums ever produced. This song is just beautul.May You Never, John Martyn. .Nick Drake died a young man but left a powerful legacy of fine music. This song is particularly haunting. Northern Sky, Nick Drake  Following a pattern here, this artist is also dead. Sandy Denny remains a personal favourite. The combination of her voice and the genius of Richard Thompson leaves a song which will never grow old. Who Knows Where the Time Goes, Fairport Convention.  There has to be some sweet soul music. The Rev Al Green remains a voice without equal. Let’s Stay Together, Al Green.  In the same direction, Marvin Gaye could melt the hardest heart. His music both political and romantic. Of course, he’s dead too.What’s Going On, Marvin Gaye . Big fan of the Waterboys. Mike Scott is immensely talented. This is a wonderful version of a Van song from Astral Weeks. Sweet Thing, The Waterboys.  The Alabama Three never receive the plaudits which they deserve. Woke Up This Morning is generally the band’s signature tune but this is even better. Hello..I’m Johnny Cash, Alabama Three . Just love J J Cale. This track is magical. Cocaine by J J Cale My choice will probably change next week and I’m amazed I’ve missed Springsteen and Peter Green’s Fleetwood Mac. But that’s it for now, pop pickers.

Until we accept there is a problem, there is never going to be a solution.”Oldpark SDLP councillor and the party’s homelessness spokesperson, Paul McCusker, described the figures as “worrying”.“According to figures from the Housing Executive, there is a chronic need for more social housing in North Belfast,” he added.“While housing should absolutely be allocated based on objective need, it is clear that stark disparities exist in predominantly nationalist areas, like the ones I represent in Ardoyne and Carrick Hill.“The area known as North Belfast One showed an average need of , houses in  , a steady increase since   when  homes were required. Just % of the  housing allocations in North Belfast in   were in NB while % were in NB, despite the dfering levels of requirement for social housing between both areas.“These figures are worrying but unfortunately are not surprising to many of us in North Belfast, who have been aware for some time of the dficulties. Behind these figures are families who have been waiting, many for years and in inadequate conditions, to get a house and build a home. They should not have to wait any longer.“I welcome the frank statement from Minister Hargey, who shares my concern at the inequalities highlighted. I hope she will make it a priority to redress this stark imbalance.”A spokesperson for the Housing Executive said:“We will be reviewing current record-keeping practice in light of the Minister’s comments and officials will engage with the DfC about this issue.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sketch-1581936686704.png","title":"meet the inspirational lori","story":"“THE greatest pleasure in le is doing what people say you cannot do.”That is how Lori Gatsi-Barnett begins her typical day. Lori has this amazing personality she is a very good listener and that is one of her attributes that makes her your favourite TV personality. She presents Join Her at Northern Vision’s NvTv.Lori is not a household name in Northern Ireland’s TV industry but I can bet you my last shilling she is daring and it will not be long before we see a sea of work from hershe decides to work in this media sector. Imagine not having your typical chest thumping, mean drama kings and queens we are used to on our television sets.I would say she is arguably one of the most influential voices in the Black and Minority Ethnic community in all Ireland. Her fair and balanced approach is something rare these days, always well researched, the audience feels assured that this is not just a regular motivational speaker but someone who loves her job and wishes one thing: that changing one is changing many. Of course, not everyone will agree with the person on the podium. The human mind doesn’t work like that. It would be very odd and annoyingeveryone agreed with you. But those who have perfected their art in using the power of speech to change society know only too well that the more critics you attract, the better.Lori loves sports, especially basketball, which she played at professional level and she enjoys swimming whenever she gets time for it. Her le is enriched with business skills, which has helped Lori to train clients in ersity work, small and medium enterprise and corporate social responsibility. She cannot afford to be idle becauseshe doesn’t do it, someone will, that’s the reality.Last year, Lori launched a community interest company called JoinHer Network. It is an open-for-all, impartial, internationally erse group of women whose main scope of work is to change women’s lives for the better. For all women, she says, “Things may be challenging but le is what one makes it. There are many surprises out there, you will not know until you take the chance. There are no limits to what we women can do.”Belfast needs many Loris. We do.The JoinHer Network has seven solid members from dferent jobs and erse experience in the arts, community action, health and business. The group is mobilising new members from across the community to get involved in pushing for making their stories and experiences something that would inspire young women not to give up in whatever successes they have ambitions for.Besides the JoinHer network and continuing to spice up Ireland with good food for thought, Lori is absolutely the essence and mother of good TV. Headhunters should be looking right here.Finally, another factual week. The first-time ethnicity was used as a tick box in the Northern Ireland Census was in . This event provoked hopeless debates in the prelude to the census in England, for example.

In between dodging the last remnants of Storm Ciara, the former St Genevieve’s High School pupil and Derry Girls actress is warm, funny and straight talking about how her version of Willy Russell’s creation is “very much of this particular period in time”.She said: “Audiences have come with their friends, then they’ve come again and brought their mums, mother-in-laws, it’s phenomenal. Audiences feel like Shirley and it’s a gt that they want to give to other people. With the character of Shirley, I suppose it’s that thing that people always talk about, about being a ‘strong female lead’. Well, what is a strong female lead  To me, a strong female lead is someone who is flawed, they show their flaws. Shirley is just every woman and that is what is beautul about her. The character of Shirley has so many dilemmas that every woman faces, no matter what we are.“In the play Shirley talks about being back in school, she believed that good things were not meant for her.“A lot of us come out of school feeling like that or afraid to try stuff because we are afraid to fail.“I’ve been asked to contribute to a piece ITV are doing for International Women’s Day in March – what would you say to your younger self  The only thing I would say to my younger self is to try stuff, fail,you fail what is the worst that can happen  You get back up and you do it again, you do it better. This industry is constantly trying, but you can also play it safe. Shirley has been afraid to make mistakes her whole le. She’s got the . children, the nice house, it’s spotless, the husband, Joe, he’s out working, there isn’t much more she can do. It’s basically a question then of, ‘Is this it ’“Yes, Shirley is  and when I say that on stage people laugh because today, in , it’s so young. But actually  years ago  seemed older, people acted and carried themselves older. I’m  and I go, ‘Well, I’m young.’ We’ve come a long way, I think.”During the production’s initial run, Tara Lynne spoke of how, post-show, she had some “brilliant, absolutely incredible conversations” with women and men of all ages.“I had women in their s want to talk about the play, sixth form students talk to me about how they related to it.”Tara Lynne said that the revival of the play is also a fitting tribute to her friend and assistant director, Julie Maxwell, who tragically passed away last August during a night out in the city centre.“I know we all will truly miss her, I truly miss Julie, I have all the notes that she gave me during our first run of rehearsals. I feel that the success of the show and its second staging is a good way to honour her.”When the curtain comes down on this run, Tara Lynne will be preparing to start filming for the juggernaut that is Channel Four’s smash hit Derry Girls.

The combination of a growing younger population, gently rising property prices, and some of the lowest housing costs in Ireland or Britain means that Belfast is a hub of activity for younger people in the property market.In order to gain a greater insight into the experience of these first-time buyers in the local property market, the ATN spoke to two young couples that recently bought their first homes in Belfast as well as real estate expert Colin Moran of Property People. Our goal was to investigate what motivates young people out of the rental market towards purchasing, as well as the factors involved in choosing their first property.Fionntan Smithof Ladybrook, and his fiancée Ciararecently purchased their first home, a semi-detached four-bedroom house with a back garden, in Gransha, in the heart of Andersonstown. They said their purchase was a reflection of their two main priorities: an advantageous location and the space to start a family.“Before we purchased we were both living at home with our parents and saving money: we weren’t keen on getting into the rental market and always having that insecurity over your head,” Fionntan said.“Once we knew we wanted to start a family together we looked at a number of locations and homes. I suppose we could have looked at something cheaper down the road, or a more modern home further out in the ‘commuter ring’, but we decided that our priority was the advantages of living in such an older, settled, well-established area like Gransha.“There’s barely any crime here and being in the middle of West Belfast gives you’re the proximity to the city centre, pubs, public transport, the shops. At the same time, we have plenty of rooms and we have a big back garden, which allows us to raise a family.”Chris Campbell-Palmerand his partner Yvonneon the other hand, decided to purchase their first property – a three-bedroom terraced house – just off the Ravenhill Road in Southeast Belfast after eight years of co-habiting in rented accommodation.“We took the step of getting our first home because ultimately we were sick of moving so often, sometimes due to poorly-maintained properties and disputes with landlords,” they told the ATN.“Financially at the end of the day it is more expensive to rent and that isn’t sustainable. We looked at flats first but there’s a real lack of affordable apartments in Belfast, so that’s when we expanded outwards to look at houses in South and East Belfast, where prices are affordable for first-time buyers.“Even though it’s an older property which needs a bit of work, the house we settled on has more space than a typical terraced house, so we can have friends visit or maintain a lodger. Eventhe area is new to us it’s only a mile walk to the Ormeau Road where most of our friends are as well as being close to the city centre for work.”Director of Property People, Colin Moran, concurred with both couples’ choice to move out of the rental market and into owning their homes.“Purchase every time would be my advice. Despite the flexibility of renting, is in my opinion not a good long-term housing option,” he said.“Owning your property gives you much more stability over the future of your home and an asset that can be sold or passed on to future generations. As far as location and the features of the home you settle on, buying a property is very exciting and provides the buyer the ability to choose their home to reflect their personality, le choices, and future. For dferent people that will mean dferent things but the priority is to make sure your home fits your le as it is much more than just the building itself but how it can enhance your le.“In terms of professional advice, I would urge people to get on the property ladder at an affordable entry point, and aim for a % deposit as you have plenty of time to pay it off,” he added.“In terms of an investment, a good investment property is in a location that will be desirable for tenants to ensure occupancy, be of a good standard or at price that reflects any refurbishments. The numbers have to work in terms of rental yield as well, and that is key to bear in mind and somewhere were buyers should seek advice from an expert.”"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus passengers in contact with northern irelands first case contacted by health officials","story":"Patient travelled from northern Italy to Northern Ireland via Dublin, Dr Philip Veal , Dr Michael McBride and Mariam McCarthyprovide an update on Coronavirus on February th  \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fa .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_K.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fa .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_K.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fa .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_K.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fa .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_K.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  , Dr Philip Veal , Dr Michael McBride and Mariam McCarthyprovide an update on Coronavirus on February th  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose, Dr Philip Veal , Dr Michael McBride and Mariam McCarthyprovide an update on Coronavirus on February th  \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fa .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_K.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fa .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_K.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fa .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_K.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fa .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_K.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  , Dr Philip Veal , Dr Michael McBride and Mariam McCarthyprovide an update on Coronavirus on February th  \"Dr Adrian Mairs , Dr Philip Veal , Dr Michael McBride and Mariam McCarthyprovide an update on Coronavirus on February th  Kevin Scott   Belfast FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDr Adrian Mairs , Dr Philip Veal , Dr Michael McBride and Mariam McCarthyprovide an update on Coronavirus on February th  February   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailPassengers sitting close to a woman infected with Northern Ireland#s first coronavirus case have been contacted by health officials.On Thursday evening authorities were put on high alert after the Public Health Agency confirmed the first case had been detected.The affected woman had flown from northern Italy, where there have been a number of deaths due to the illness, to Dublin Airport before travelling to Northern Ireland.Health and Safety Executiveofficials in the Republic worked overnight on Thursday to identy those who were on board the flight.Were you in contact with the person infected in Northern Ireland  Contact us at digital.editorial@belfasttelegraphWorldwide, , people have been infected with the virus.

The regulator ordered the hospital to urgently review and resolve the issue.However, the RQIA carried out a further inspection in November last year and found limited progress in relation to arrangements for medical governance.It said the hospital should stop the practice of allowing doctors to assist with operations without providing evidence of revalidation and indemnity immediately during a serious concerns meeting in July.Revalidation is a safeguarding process all doctors must go through to prove their competence, while medical indemnity is insurance for doctors in the event of negligence.However, following a further inspection in November, the RQIA said it was not assured that sufficient safeguards were in place to protect the safety and wellbeing of patients.As a result, it put in place a failure to comply notice on the registration of the hospital, which had a gross income of £.m last year. Management of the hospital was given until February  to address the concerns.An unannounced inspection was carried out on Monday. While the RQIA found the hospital had addressed six of the nine failings, a number of concerns remain, including the governance systems to assure the fitness and competence of doctors working as surgical assistants.An RQIA spokesman said: Earlier this week, the RQIA conducted an unannounced inspection at the Ulster Independent Clinic to assess progress in addressing our concerns relating to medical governance at the clinic.While compliance was achieved in respect of a number of issues highlighted in the RQIA#s enforcement notice, further work is required to address a number of outstanding actions.As a result, the RQIA has extended the enforcement notice for a further four weeks. The safety and wellbeing of every patient at Ulster Independent Clinic is of paramount importance to the RQIA and we will continue to monitor this service through our ongoing regulatory activities.A spokesman for the hospital said: We continue to work with the RQIA to further strengthen our existing administrative and governance procedures.Whilst six of the areas previously identied have been completed, we welcome the short extension for full implementation of the remaining three actions.This includes us voluntarily engaging with the Northern Ireland Medical and Dental Training Agency to ensure robust arrangements are in place to support continued access for trainee doctors to observe and support our consultants as surgical assistants.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland df .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dd-f-b-a-adc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland df .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dd-f-b-a-adc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland df .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dd-f-b-a-adc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland df .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dd-f-b-a-adc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland df .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dd-f-b-a-adc_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern IrelandUlster Independent Clinic urged to act to ensure patient safetyThe Ulster Independent Clinic needs to act by next month to ensure patient safety, a regulator said.,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadHealth watchdog RQIA gives Ulster Independent Clinic extra month to meet basic safety standardsCoronavirus: Passengers in contact with Northern Ireland#s first case contacted by health officialsDefibrillator prototype by Ulster medic still in working order  years onJan de Vries passes away: Tributes paid to advocate of natural medicineStaggering % of Northern Ireland adults overweight or obese - survey reveals health timebomb,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Picture: BBC  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp-year-old Dan Douglas from Banbridge. Picture: BBC February   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe Public Health Agencyhas apologised to a Northern Ireland family after they were advised to isolate themselves in their home after their son ed from an Italian ski trip. Dan Douglas , from Banbridge, Do Down, was told to self-isolate in his bedroom for  days after experiencing a cold after a visit to San Valentino in northern Italy. He had not been to any of the  towns at the epicentre of the outbreak in the country but was given incorrect advice after his mother Elaine made two separate phone calls to the PHA helpline. It comes after the PHA revealed there have been in the region of  calls to the helpline over the past two weeks. The agency said they have no record of which helpline operator - who are not medically trained - gave the advice but said they have now put new measures in place to strengthen the service being offered. It comes after Elaine Douglas called the helpline this week when she was told by Dan#s school to contact their GP after he displayed symptoms of a cold. Dan#s father Dougie Douglas said: The helpline said get him out of school, get him home and put him in isolation and phone us back when you#ve done that.Mrs Douglas said the helpline advised her to undertake measures including: Keeping her -year-old son in his room while the rest of the family were asked to isolate themselves in their house Serve Dan his food on paper plates with plastic cutlery to be disposed of in a strong plastic bin bagNot to take anything out of his room for a period of two weeks Make sure Dan only used one bathroom, not to be used by the rest of the family Dan should clean his room with antiseptic spray every couple of hours To clean every handle he uses Speaking while her son was in isolation, Mrs Douglas said: I phoned back the helpline this morning to say he doesn#t have the symptoms they#ve listed on the website. Because he had a headcold, they said he has to [stay in isolation]. She said it would get a lot worse very quickly Dougie DouglasI assumed somebody would come out and test him but the helpline said just to monitor his condition andit gets worse call . She said it would get a lot worse very quickly.Mrs Douglas said she asked for her details to be passed on to a surveillance team but hadn#t heard anything from any public health body. She said she feared the public stigma around the virus. We live in a development and there are lots of neighbours and we don#t want people to say that#s the house that has coronavirus.Teenager Dan said he was bored in his room but that he understood the measures that were being taken. It#s for the safety of everyone  around me. People in school are making these  rumours about me being in hospital and that and it#s sort of worrying when I go to school, that people are going to look at me in a dferent way.When we landed in Dublin we didn#t get checked or anything, just got on the bus and went home Dan DouglasSpeaking of his experience in Italy, he said: When we landed, the towns around where we were staying were put in lockdown, which made everyone worried and wary of the people around them. You saw how many people were wearing a mask.When we landed in Dublin we didn#t get checked or anything, just got on the bus and went home.But when he went back to school, he had a runny nose so went to the nurse to get medication. I went to the nurse to get paracetamol and she told me to make sure I binned the tissue when I sneezed and cleaned my hands.I went home and did my homework that night and then out of nowhere I got taken away.On Wednesday, after Dan had spent two days in isolation, the Douglas family received a call from Dr Philip Veal of the PHA who told them they had been given the wrong information. Mrs Douglas said: I#m relieved we can have our le back and we#re not going to have to spend two weeks in the house. I was more concerned that my son as going to be in a shoebox of a bedroom with all his food rubbish and waste in a black bag for two weeks.Mr Douglas added it was a real relief that the information around the coronavirus had been claried. I didn#t really know what to do and I didn#t feel the information we were given was enough. They didn#t even ask for our address, even for somebody to speak to my son.Mrs Douglas said she would advise anyone with any doubts to phone the PHA directly and not to use the helpline. Dr Philip Veal of the PHA said he was surprised to hear the family had been given incorrect advice and that the agency was keen to send the right message to the public. We very much regret and apologise to the family for the inconvenience and discomfort this has caused them, he said. At the moment what we#re doing is asking people have they travelled to an area where there has been a spread of coronavirus andthey have associated symptoms like a cold or shortness of breath to make contact with their GP.Dr Veal said the PHA has taken steps to bring the situation under control following this incident. We#ve improved our quality assurance measures around the advice given, for example regular reviewing of the scripting given to the helpline, twice daily contact with the call line handlers to give them support and a direct line of contact with us should they need further advice. The coronavirus is a fast moving situation and new areas of concern are constantly evolving. We#re constantly working to update and sometimes when the information goes out there can be a lag, he said. Two wrong bits of advice is two too many so we#ve taken very robust steps to improve the quality of our helpline.Belfast Related ContentNorthern IrelandCo Antrim man living in Shanghai insists #le just goes on# despite coronavirus lockdown A Co Antrim man living in Shanghai has said that le hasn#t ground to a halt despite living under tight lockdown as China battles the spread of the deadly coronavirus.Northern IrelandGoods made in China are running low in Northern Ireland shops due to coronavirus Supplies of Chinese-made consumer goods, such as curtains and sofas, are expected to run low in shops here due to factory shutdowns triggered by coronavirus. at previous media briefing on preparedness in Northern Ireland to respond to Coronavirus at the Department of Health in Stormont on Wednesday Pic Colm Lenaghan Pacemaker \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming efc .ece AUTOCROP wh ing%N%Ireland%.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming efc .ece AUTOCROP wh ing%N%Ireland%.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming efc .ece AUTOCROP wh ing%N%Ireland%.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming efc .ece AUTOCROP wh ing%N%Ireland%.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming efc .ece AUTOCROP wh ing%N%Ireland%.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   at previous media briefing on preparedness in Northern Ireland to respond to Coronavirus at the Department of Health in Stormont on Wednesday Pic Colm Lenaghan Pacemaker \"GalleryNorthern IrelandCoronavirus: Isolation ward on standby in Northern Ireland but no cases after  tested, say health officialsAn isolation ward is on standby at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast should there be a confirmed coronavirus case in Northern Ireland, health officials have said.GalleryNorthern IrelandCoronavirus fears: Northern Ireland schools send home pupils ing from ski trips in ItalyPupils at schools in Northern Ireland ing from half-term ski trips in northern Italy have been sent home over fears about the coronavirus.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ddef-ffd-d-cd-dacee_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ddef-ffd-d-cd-dacee_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ddef-ffd-d-cd-dacee_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ddef-ffd-d-cd-dacee_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ddef-ffd-d-cd-dacee_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"World, recorded deaths in more than , confirmed cases of Covid-The total number of people infected worldwide by coronavirus has now risen above ,, with , recorded deaths.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ae .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ebc-c--bb-aacce_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ae .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ebc-c--bb-aacce_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ae .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ebc-c--bb-aacce_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ae .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ebc-c--bb-aacce_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ae .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ebc-c--bb-aacce_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"UKTV doctor blasts quarantine measures at coronavirus-hit Tenere hotelTV doctor Hilary Jones has blasted quarantine measures at a coronavirus-hit Tenere hotel as the Foreign Office said it was keeping the situation under review.VideoVideo NewsBoris Johnson - NHS prepared to deal with coronavirus,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadThreats against Regent House pupils over #repulsive# video mocking Down#s syndromeAlliance Party rake in most donations with £kFrantic search for anyone tied to Northern Ireland#s first case of coronavirusLarge number of hatchets and knives seized after disturbance at Strabane funeralSuspicious object found under teacher#s car at Belfast school a # alarm#,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Some airlines are a little more lenient than others when it comes to changes but that would fall under normal ticketing regulations anyway, she said.

Workforce imbalances in large organisations and big companies can result from a iety of often complex factors which cannot be over looked or simply dismissed.Reducing an analysis of sectarian practice to a numbers game sheds no light and serves little purpose. So too with equating every adverse decision to a sectarian motive or using the accusation of sectarianism to address every ill.Mr Scullion added: There are a number of immediate steps which could and should be taken to starts to process of eradicating sectarianism from our society. An integrated and secular education system, a Bill of Rights , an integrated housing programme and the criminalisation of sectarianism would be a good start.However, for as long as institutionalised sectarianism forms the basis of government structures and practices, there will be no political leadership from Stormont and no pressure to address either sectarianism or the vested interests which help perpetuate it. There is still a very long way to go. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Ulster Universityhas also confirmed that steps are being mapped out before any decision is made on the relocation of health science courses. Figures obtained by the Derry News by way of a Freedom of Informationrequest, after UU refused to provide them, show that student numbers have dropped from , in   to , in   - that is both full-time and part-time students. At Coleraine, numbers have dropped from , in   to , this year. It means that since   student numbers at Magee have decreased by . googletag.cmd.push The proposed graduate entry medical schoolat the Derry campus is projected to have  students in  enrolments begin next year as envisaged. Derry representatives have insisted that Health Science courses, such as physiotherapy and radiotherapy, from Jordanstown be transferred to the city to complement the GEMS. Those courses would attract approximately , students over time and are viewed as pivotal in the push towards the desired , students. However, all options remain on the table and the courses could end up in Coleraine or the new Belfast campus. An Ulster University spokesperson said: “The University has gathered feedback from a range of stakeholders on the future location of its health sciences courses. googletag.cmd.push “The next steps in the process to reach a fully informed final decision will be confirmed shortly.” Last week the Department for the Economy said “no funding” has, as yet, been formally committed by the UK or Irish Governments towards increasing undergraduate places at the Magee Campus as outlined in New Decade, New Approach. At the end of January, DfE announced that it was committed to delivering expansion of the Belfast campus and would provide UU with a poundm bailout to complete the build. The NI Audit Office had previously said the final cost was expected to be poundm over budget. At the same meeting, senior DfE officials declared that UU’s business case for Magee expansion was out of date and “new money” was needed – an outcome the official said was “hard to see happening.” A spokesperson for the Derry University Group commented: “This is a point of crisis. Commitments given to the North West in the Stormont Programme for Governmenthave clearly been broken by Belfast. “The political will shown by the two governments in New Decade, New Approach, has not been reciprocated by the new administration here. “This will have seriously damaging effects on the North West’s already-broken Higher Education sector and a devastating impact on the region’s faltering economy.” He continued: “The generosity shown by the North West’s main political parties in re-establishing partnerships under New Decade, New Approach has been abused, very cynically – as has Council’s relationship with Ulster University. “The two governments, and our local public representatives, cannot afford to wait any longer while the Greater Belfast Lobby bankrupts another administration. They must act immediately in the interests of the North West by overturning off-the-books bailout of UU and Belfast, and by insisting on the full implementation of the original PfG.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A row of terraced houses at Wapping Lane, close to the Fountain estate, have lain empty for a considerable number of years. Those properties are amongst , that are sitting empty across the Derry and Strabane council area. The Northern Ireland Housing Executive , says empty properties are a “wasted resource” for the owner and those looking for somewhere to live. “Vacant homes can deteriorate and become a nuisance for people living close by. They may also lead to neighbourhood decline,” NIHE added. googletag.cmd.push Potential benefits of bringing an empty home back into use include generating rental income to offset rates and the costs of maintaining the property, releasing capital from the sale of the property and protecting the long-term investment potential of the property. In addition, it reduces the risk of vandalism, squatting and anti-social behaviour, and liability for health and safety issues, or damage to adjoining properties. When planning permission was granted to convert the iconic former Sinclair factory building on Abercorn Road into  apartments, the proposal also involved the conversion of seven vacant terraced dwellings along Wapping Lane into  apartments. googletag.cmd.push DUP MLA for Foyle, Gary Middleton, told the Derry News that it is vitally important to develop this street. “I do want to see this area developed, it is my personal preference that they be kept as houses because I’d like to see more families move in to reinvigorate the area. In conversations I’ve had with the developer they have been positive about the possibility of houses. “I know parking was an issue, but I would encourage the developer to work as quickly as possible as it is in their interest to see them developed also.” The Foyle MLA said that homelessness figures show the need for housing in the city. “You don’t want to see any area sitting in derelictionit can be avoided. “It would also bring development of the streetscape which would complement the work that has already been done on the Abercorn Road – Wapping Lane needs to be part of that. “It would avoid problems with anti-social behaviour and environmental issues which have emerged while the properties have been vacant.” People Before Profit Councillor for the Moor area, Eamonn McCann, said it is “unacceptable” for so many houses to remain unoccupied. He believes that many housing units are being “turned over to Air BB” to take advantage of busy periods in the Derry calendar. It proves a lucrative business for property owners, he said, and means they don’t feel the need to let them out for the rest of the year. Cllr McCann is of the view that Stormont must implement a “crash programme” of house building for the Derry area and NI as a whole. “There is a serious shortage of housing, particularly rental properties for young people.” He suggested giving the Housing Executive powers to build again by using the , properties in its ownership as collateral to borrow money against. Councillor McCann supported development at Wapping Lane, adding: “The need for housing is as great as it was  years ago. Derry was the spark for progressive movements in the past and it must be again.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This year there’s an incredible line-up for you to celebrate International Womens Day, on the bill there’s the Henry Girls, Blackbird and Crow, Reevah, Blood, Great White Lies and Tara Gi with comperes for the evening, Madonna Kebab and Thran Leeann, and ending the night with some tunes from The Stray Kitten. All that for pound in Sandino’s on Saturday, March , but before that, there are several events, some flying the flag for the women and others are just dirty garage punks who should know better.The former includes Louise DaCosta, the one-woman army making everyone take notice of her skills producing electro music. It’s been a whole year since I spoke to her about setting up her own label and got another chat to her this week… googletag.cmd.push Womens Day coming up, how are things in electronicland for women behind the decks  “Things are definitely evolving in the music scene. “There are certainly more women getting involved. “Even from our workshops theres much more interest in ladies from all ages, long overdue, but its brilliant to see and be part of the #equalisingmusic campaign.” Are there other women dj-ing you like  “Of course, too many to mention. However, there are a few emerging acts that have come through the ranks at our courses. “I’m excited to watch their progress and looking forward to seeing them smash it at our label party. “Don’t want to make any names just yet...but keep an eye on our posters and events for some super next generation talent.” googletag.cmd.push Youre the brains behind a record label, no easy job, how has that been  “Honestly its been great. Delighted to be working with so many talented artists from all over Ireland and across the world. “We’ve signed over  artists, with our focus on pushing homegrown talent, but we’ve also welcomed established and emerging artists from USA, Spain, Portugal, Italy, UK, Malaysia, Serbia and India. “Initially, I had a three-year plan, but we accomplished all that and more within the first year... which was a pleasant surprise to say the least! “Selling out our label party events across the country, consistent radio play, hitting multiple charts with our tracks and almost  releases out within the first  months.” What have you lined up for this year  “Lots of label party events lined up nationwide as well as across the water.“Currently working with Arts Council, Blubell and ious groups delivering DJ skills digital workshops across the North West. As well as all the usual touring, looking forward to heading out to the Far East again through the year and playing across Ireland, Scotland etc. “Obviously, the big one this weekend DaCosta Records first birthday and looking forward to headlining Holi Colours Festival next month. My new track, Mermaid, is out th February.”Celtronic is  this year…. “Fantastic to see a local brand not only endure but go from strength to strength. “Long may it continue, more power to them.” What would you tell young women starting out  “Don’t be afraid to get involved. Go to a workshop, got to a course, go to events. “If you’re not invited to the party, then start your own. “Appreciate your local scene, learn and develop there. Be it, own it, do it!.” The latter obviously refers to New York’s Daddy Long Legs making a welcometo Derry this Friday night in Sandino’s. They’re the citys most beloved blues bashers have been huffing and puffing and blowing houses down on a nightly basis, on their infinite world tour and always bring an elevated level of rough and ready intensity to contemporary lo-fi blues, with their explosive fire ceremony. A Daddy Long Legs show is equal parts roots rock, blues and guttural soul, stripping down old standards and making them shiny and new again. Some of the originals are like an all-out spiritual revival, while others are hauntingly beautul. Also, on the bill are Protex, a Belfast punk band which formed in . Their first records were issued on Good Vibrations records. They formed part of the first wave of Belfast punk bands along with the likes of label-mates The Undertones and Rudi. Tickets are pound and can be acquired from Eventbrite. Asthat wasn’t enough, Stefan Murphy will be playing another intimate gig in the Grand Central this Saturday. If you were there for the last one you don’t need reminding of how special it was,you weren’t, he kicks off at ten on Saturday and it’s free.

You should never, ever accept defeat.“If youre able to show that comebackability youre never dead You saw it last year when we were away to Dundalk and away to Shamrock Rovers when it looked aswe were down and out but we came back. Theres that fighting spirit. “Its also got to do with the people who come off the bench. Its about making positive changes to try and get you back in the game. Its all down to the players and their appetite to not want to lose games. You would think thats a gimme in football but its not and were very proud that here we dont accept defeat and we keep going to the very last seconds of the game.”Despite last weeks game against Harps being televised, the Brandywell was packed to capacity and the supporters who stayed until the very end got their reward of a late goal. On reflection, Devine believes that the new players at the club may have been slightly overawed at their first experience of thousands of City fans cheering them on.“These bunch of players back themselves, they are good players,” he continued. “It was a wee bit of a culture shock for them seeing the crowd and the appetite and the expectation last Friday night but Im definitely sure that they will be ready for it this week. “The players were absolutely devastated that the game at St. Pats was called off because they were all going there confident.” googletag.cmd.push SignicantBoth Dundalk and Shamrock Rovers won on Monday night, maintaining their % starts to the new campaign. Bohs, who finished just ahead of Derry in third place last season, have also had a decent start, winning two from three. A win at the Brandywell would create a signicant gap between the two sides just a few weeks into the season, something which Devine is aware of.“These are the days in the season where we are all finding our way,” he said. “We have to make sure that we improve week by week and we cant wait for the games to come because the games are the biggest teacher. They show us what teams are right, what players are right, what formations are right. “The games will hopefully come thick and fast and hopefully we can start putting points on the board.“I dont think that anyone is ever going to be too concerned in the opening round of matches. Weve had a narrow defeat to Dundalk and weve drawn a Northwest derby so I dont think theres anything overly concerning at this moment in time.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Brandywell was packed with fans celebrating that equaliser with him and Liddle admits it was a special night for him. “Im surprised how many people come down to these games,” he said. “The games are brilliant to play in and the league is brilliant. The crowd was great, you cant hear anything on the pitch which is something Ive never experienced before. “I love it here. I think its very competitive, its tough and I think its just a great place to come and get some first team experience.”Now Liddle is hoping that his goal against Finn Harps is the start of good times to come in a red and white shirt.“I’m absolutely delighted to come here and score on my home debut, getting the equaliser in the last minute, is brilliant,” he said. “I was itching to get on just to show what I can do and hopefully this goal will help me to continue to show people what I can do.Having started the  campaign against champions Dundalk before facing Ollie Horgan’s men last Friday evening, Liddle already knows the le in the League of Ireland is going to be tough, having been thrown in at the deep end.“The first two games have been tough,” he admitted. “Obviously we know that this league isn’t easy and to be honest every game we play we think is going to be tough for us, so we just have to take each game as they come and hopefully grind out results.”The -year-old is already a fan of team-mate Walter Figueira for his late equaliser, after the ex-Waterford man showed great skill to create the chance. “I saw him do a lovely piece of skill and get to the byline and I was thinking to get a little bit of movement so that he could cut it back, then I was just thinking to make sure I would get as much connect on it as possible and lucky for me it went in. It was brilliant to go over and celebrate with the fans.” googletag.cmd.push More paceMeanwhile, Declan Devine wants his players to show more pace in their build up play when they face Bohemians tomorrow night. City were lethargic at times against Harps last week and, to an extant, played into their opponents hands. “I think we were slow in our build up play last Friday night, theres no doubt about it, but thats credit to Finn Harps as well as they made it really dficult,” he explained. “We wanted to work down the sides of them and create overloads, but that didnt materialise and I think we got into a bit of a rut in terms of playing slowly, which suited Harps. “That said, I have to give the players massive credit because into a gale-force wind we were the dominant team and we kept going. The keeper has made a great save before Adam scored and we hit the bar. It was so, so dficult to keep the ball down and play through, but to be fair to the players they kept plugging and kept plugging and I think rightly so deserved their equaliser.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

However, McKnight was not to be denied and in the seventh minute he dispossessed Corey Laverty and hit a shot that squirmed through Leneghanrsquos hands and into the net.Albion had barely time to celebrate as, virtually from the restart, Tollymore won a free kick that was delivered into the box, by McLister, for Ruairi Toner to shoot into the net.United slowly began to take a stranglehold in midfield with Marty McCourt and Tommy Kane dominating Burke and Rooney. On the left wing, Marty Devlin was giving the Albion defence a torrid time with his pace and power.Just on the stroke of half-time Albionrsquos Ryan Beckett fired a free kick over the Bearsrsquo crossbar.Despite having wind advantage, Tollymore were unable to create any chances of note and they were rocked in the th minute when Albion centre half Allan Cousins found himself unmarked in the Tollymore area to head a corner kick past Leneghan.Despite this setback, Tollymore held their nerve and Jack McCourt and Matt McCormick linked up for McCourt to run through on goal. Unfortunately, Albion lsquokeeper Joel Collins made a superb finger tip save to block McCourtrsquos shot.United were well on top, but were lacking the guile to open up the Moira defence until the introduction of veteran striker Adrian lsquoSparkyrsquo Howard.Within moments of Howardrsquos arrival in the st minute he got on the end of a McLister flick to shoot past Collins in the Albion goal.It was now all Tollymore as the Bears pushed for a winner and Albion were reduced to ten-men after Darryl Irwin was dismissed for a cynical foul on Marty Devlin as the striker burst through on goal, after being put clear by Tommy Kane.Virtually on the stroke of full time, Corey Laverty picked out Howard with a superb pass only for Collins to make another excellent save. Extra time saw Tollymore playing with the wind and forcing a succession of corners that Albion did well to defend.Albion seemed content to play for penalty kicks and it was only in the last couple of minutes of the game that they came out of their defensive shell, but were unable to penetrate a resolute Tollymore defence.Albion netted their first penalty with Marty McCourt equalising and then the fun started. Leneghan saved the second spot kick and Albionrsquos Joel Collins then blocked Corey Lavertyrsquos effort to keep things level at -. Leneghan then saved the third Albion kick before Marty Devlin scored to nudge the Bears in front at -.The Moira men levelled things with a cracking penalty leaving United with two more penalties to win. Unfortunately, Howard shot wide to leave the scores - and one penalty apiece left.Once again Leneghan made an unbelievable save to hand the initiative to United and Adam Rea stepped up to blast the ball into the net to send United into the final.Match sponsor: Diamond Pats, Newcastle.Tollymore United Moira Albion MID ULSTER LEAGUE CUP S

South Down MP Chris Hazzard during a meeting in Berlin last weekend with representatives from the Executive Board of the European Left.The MP was warmly received by delegates from the EU member states who congratulated Mr Hazzard on Sinn Feinrsquos recent success in the Irish election.Mr Hazzard said that it was ldquofantastic to receive a warm welcome from representatives of the European Left.He explained that throughout the Brexit negotiations, European solidarity with Ireland was ldquoremarkable and it was fitting that he had the opportunity to thank representatives from across the EU for that support at their Executive Board meeting.Mr Hazzard said that it was also important to take the opportunity to call for continued support in the months ahead.ldquoBrexit is by no means complete and Ireland will need ongoing solidarity as European and British government officials commence trade talks next month, the MP continued.ldquoWe canrsquot allow the British government to adopt a casual approach to their international obligations and responsibilities to protect both the Good Friday Agreement and our all-Ireland economy.Mr Hazzard revealed that it was also ldquofascinating to be involved in a discussion regarding the need to deepen understanding and relations with all European Left parties in the time ahead, especially in relation to tackling the climate emergency, workersrsquo rights, gender equality and the increasing need to counter the growth in extreme, far-right politics throughout Europe.Also this week, the South Down MP described British government immigration proposals as ldquounpopular, unworkable and a direct threat to economic well-being in South Down.Responding to proposals confirmed by the Home Office that immigration policy in Northern Ireland will change from next year, the MP warned that far from strengthening the economic wellbeing of society, the proposals are a direct threat to the local hospitality, tourism, retail and agri-food sectors.Mr Hazzard declared: ldquoIt is hard not to view these proposals as an elitist, xenophobic attack on overseas and low-paid workers, the vast majority of whom we simply cannot live without.ldquoIndeed, most worryingly, these proposals are a cruel attack on our care sector the wonderful, selfless heroes whom we all rely on to take care of us and our families in our hour of need.Mr Hazzard said it is ldquoabundantly clear that the Home Office has completely ignored what he described as the ldquoNorthrsquos unique and special circumstances and has shown nothing but contempt for local business and industry leaders who have engaged constructively with British government officials in recent years.The MP added: ldquoSinn Feacutein will be raising these concerns directly with the British government in the weeks to come..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26th February 2020 Down.jpg","title":"Down District has two of worst roads in NI  ","story":"TWO of the worst roads in Northern Ireland are in Down District and just miles apart, it has been revealed.They are the Shore Road in Strangford and the Blackstaff Road in Clough which are placed first and third respectively in the list of the provincersquos worst roads, the Department for Infrastructure has confirmed.New statistics revealed by the government department confirm that a total of  defects mdash including pot holes mdash were recorded on both roads last year.Government officials say that  defects were recorded on the Shore Road and  on the Blackstaff Road.The Department has confirmed that between  and  it paid out a staggering pound.m to drivers across Northern Ireland whose vehicles had been damaged by potholes.Years of underinvestment has led to a deterioration of Northern Irelandrsquos roads according to Stormont infrastructure minister, Nichola Mallon, who is making poundm available to help address the issue.The cash will also be used for winter gritting services and to help repair the tens of thousands of street lights that are out across the country.Ms Mallon explained that years of underinvestment as well as the impact of severe winter weather has led to deterioration in the road network and in recent years this has impacted on the level of vehicle damage compensation payments.Last year, Northern Irelandrsquos public spending watchdog warned that it would cost more than poundbn to deal with structural maintenance.The Northern Ireland Audit Office published a report highlighting how a lack of investment was having a deteriorating effect on the overall condition of Northern Irelandrsquos road network and found that a lack of funding had led to a signicant reduction in the number of potholes being recorded and approved for repair.Ms Mallon said that ldquofrustratingly for a number of years now not enough money had been allocated to her departmentrsquos budget to maintain roads and repairs were having to be done on a priority basis.ldquoWhile I have inherited severe and challenging budget constraints, I am committed to finding solutions that deliver better for our communities and improve lives, she said.ldquoI have impressed on the new finance minister the need for additional money to deal with this issue and other critical pressures. Sustainable infrastructure is key to improving lives and connecting communities.Confirmation of the poundm funding package to deal with roads maintenance, winter gritting and defective street lights comes just weeks after the Recorder revealed that while the lights were back on at Stormont after MLAs ed to work, they were continuing to go out across the district at an alarming rate.In mid-January, almost  street lights were not working in East Down, plunging many areas into darkness and the Department for Infrastructure confirming that due to budgetary pressures it was only able to provide a limited repair service.Province-wide, it was estimated that in excess of , street lights were not working with the government department having only a small number of engineers at its disposal to repair all of them.Downpatrick topped the league table for broken street lights in East Down with  in need of repair. Newcastle was in second place with  street lights not working.Other district hot spots included Ballynahinch where  street lights were out of order, while where,  faults were reported in Killyleagh,  in Castlewellan and Crossgar and  in Saintfield.In Ballygowan,  street lights are currently out of order with  and  faults reported in Ardglass and Killough respectively.Downpatrick councillor, Dermot Curran, has welcomed the infrastructure ministerrsquos commitment to invest poundm and hopes that many of the potholes and defective street lights across the district will be repaired.He said while the defects will be repaired according to their priority, he hopes that Ms Mallon will secure additional support from the Stormont Executive to carry out a full repair programme.ldquoThe minister is having to deal with a legacy of under investment in the roads network and she must be given every assistance by her Stormont colleagues. There are clearly budgetary pressures across a range of departments but it is is vital that we invest in our roads and wastewater infrastructure in particular, continued Cllr Curran.ldquoMs Mallon clearly has the needs of people at heart and hopefully she will be given additional monies to help address the particular problems we have in Down District. It is important that all road repairs are carried out to a high standard to that the work will last..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26th February 2020 Down GAA.jpg","title":"Down goals revive hopes  ","story":"DOWN left it late before getting the better of Longford at a bitterly cold Pairc Esler on Saturday night.Itrsquos ever so tight now in the race for second place behind an unbeaten Cork in the Division  table with Down, Longford, Derry and Offaly all on five points after four games.Saturdayrsquos game seemed to be heading for a draw as the sides were locked at - to - with less than  minutes remaining.However, two late goals from Cory Quinn and James Guinness put paid to a brave Longford challenge as Down ran out two point winners.Longford were dealt a blow before the game with star forward Rian Brady ruled out with a chest infection and his replacement, Peter Lynn, who scored two points in the early exchanges, had to go off injured after  minutes.It was Lynn who opened the scoring in the first minute, but Downrsquos fleet-footed set of forwards quickly got into gear and created scores for Barryand Darren OrsquoHagan before Liam Connerton brought the sides level again in the sixth minute.Cory Quinn and Lynn swapped scores as did Jonny Flynn and Darren Gallagher to leave the sides in deadlock at - apiece after  minutes.Flynn and Donal OrsquoHare then edged Down two clear as the first half headed for conclusion, but a total of six points were scored in added time.Gallagher and a rsquo from lsquokeeper Paddy Collum made it - apiece, but Kevin McKernan pointed Down back into the lead.

I welcome a review initiated by the government department to look at the impact of this legislation which needs to be amended so many local events can thrive once again.Cllr Devlin said while there were many positive aspects of the new legislation, such as providing a framework to ensure special events can be held on roads safely and legally, there were a number which have caused great dficulty to charities, running clubs and other groups doing vital work in the community.ldquoWhen this legislation was introduced by a previous minister there was uproar among local community groups, football and running clubs as well as charities who all hosted small road races to raise vital funds for their own causes, she explained.ldquoThis legislation represents another layer of red tape and, for many, resulted in them ceasing such events which was very disappointing for all involved.Cllr Devlin explained that while Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos policy was amended to accommodate local not-for-profit groups, the Stormont legislation remained ldquoflawed.She continued: ldquoI welcome that Minister Mallon has confirmed that she is aware of the concerns around the legislation mdash introduced before her time in office mdash and has committed to reviewing it.

I started to do some practice tricks with Stella where she would move between and around my legs and she was fantastic.ldquoI loved the thought of going to a dog show with mum for the whole day and meeting lots of other dogs so I started going to class regularly with mum.Ann, Fiona and their dogs, Stella, Minty and Turfy mdash another Bichon Frise mdash are trained by Irene Hull, from KARC in Dromore,As Stella was going deaf when Ann first started to work with her, Irene knew that the OneMind Dogs method of training using body language would be perfect for Ann and Stella.Fiona said: ldquoI really donrsquot know how Ann does it, but she picked up the technique so fast and now her and Stella are so effective together. Ann has become a much better trainer that I am and Stella competes better with her than she did with me.Ann added: ldquoThe only problem I used to have is that Stella would run off to mumshe missed a weave and I couldnrsquot call her back.ldquoConnection is the most important thing for Stella and I at the moment as because she is deaf, I have to keep her looking at me and focusing on me when she is running. I guide her with my hands, feet and my chest laser point.Apart from training, Ann and Stella have a normal loving relationship between a child and a best friend who happens to be a dog.Ann said: ldquoStella loves snacks and as soon as the fridge door opens, she goes wild, spinning in circles of joy.ldquoShersquos allowed to sleep on my bed the nights she has a bath. Thatrsquos what mum and dad think but as soon as they turn off my light, she sneaks under the blanket for a proper snuggle.She has her eyes set on claiming her mumrsquos other dog, Turfy.ldquoMum had her eye on training Turfy as he is fast and very keen, but he loves me more and runs way better for me, said Ann. ldquoI have been training him as well and we should be ready for competitions this summer.Ann hopes to show what she and Stella can do in front of her classmates as her principal has said she can bring the dog into school for a demonstration..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26th February 2020 This.jpg","title":"This Is Your Life surprise as David celebrates 100th birthday  ","story":"IT was a case of lsquoThis Is Your Lersquo for retired Carryduff farmer David Patterson when he was presented with a book chronicling  years of his amazing le.Mr Patterson, from the townland of Clontonacally, was surrounded by family, friends and members of his church, Trinity Presbyterian Church in Boardmills, when he celebrated becoming a centenarian at the weekend.For younger readers, This is Your Le was a famous TV programme where celebrities and people of note from all walks of le were surprised by the presenter with a book detailing the personrsquos many achievements.Mr Pattersonrsquos book, lovingly put together by his children, Margaret and Martin, was just one highlight of the weekend of celebrations hosted in his honour.The book shows the many changes that the diary farmer witnessed over the last  years, including pictures of him gathering in hay using horses and carts in the s and s, through to his international travels in later years.His family took him to Las Vegas for his th birthday, which included a helicopter flight over the Grand Canyon.

It affirms that religious officiants should not be able to solemnise a same-sex marriage in situations where their governing body has not approved same-sex marriage. Even where a governing body has approved same-sex marriage and made provision for it, a clergyperson should have the right to refuse to conduct such a marriage . Where a religious officiant refuses to marry a same-sex couple, that officiant should not be considered to have acted in breach of equality legislation.• Civil partnershipsThe church’s decision not to provide for same-sex marriage is unchanged. The doctrine of the Church of Ireland is that marriage is between one man and one woman this is therefore the only form of marriage which may be celebrated within the church. Anglican doctrine is expressed through liturgy, and the Church has no liturgy in relation to civil partnership or same-sex marriage. The context for the response is that there has been an alteration of the legal framework affecting a range of civil provisions, but this will not affect the church’s teaching.Your headline is entirely misleading in implying that the Church and Society Commission has decided to defy the doctrinal position of the Church of Ireland exactly the contrary was made clear in the response to the newspaper.The House of Bishops, in its statement following the  marriage referendum in the Republic, affirmed that the state is acting fully within its rightsit decides to alter its legal definition of marriage.This does not affect or alter the church’s understanding of how it celebrates marriage.The Rt Revd Dr Kenneth Kearon, Bishop of Limerick and Killaloe, chair, Church and Society Commission"},{"url":null,"title":"simple steps anyone can take help contain coronavirus ","story":"Sinn Fein says Gerry Adams can keep all £k Oireachtas pension – but it will slash all future retirement payments for TDsSudden death of person on NI railway line being investigated by PSNI - line now reopenedNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensNewsOpinionSimple steps that anyone can take to help contain the coronavirusThat a patient in Northern Ireland has now tested positive for coronavirus is highly regrettable but hardly surprising.By The NewsroomFriday, th February , : amUpdated Friday, th February , : am\"\"News Letter editorialThe virus is spreading rapidly round the world, and has been identied in more than  countries.The details of the NI affected patient, believed to be a woman who travelled up to the Province from Dublin with a child, and her exact movements are not yet known.

Le was never the same for Joe after his beloved Pearl died on  February .Joe, as with all his siblings, was raised in a Christian home and infused with a quiet yet unbending Christian faith. His willingness to bear the burdens of others and his desire to aid his fellow man manested itself in his role as a trade union shop stewart. His integrity and forthrightness earned respect and in most of his workplaces he was both foreman and shop steward. Physically tough he relied upon God in times of sorrow for the inner strength which toughness cannot supply.He was also, with his brothers, a member of Seagoe Church Lads Brigade Pipe Band and the quartet of three pipers and a drummer often practiced in the front room of their family home.Joe also thoroughly enjoyed the Lambeg Drums and Saturday nights in his mid to latter years were spent at ious drumming competitions. Joe was employed in ious weaving factories, one of which was Brookfield Mill in Banbridge and he was heartbroken when it closed down.Pearl and Joe and Elizabeth enjoyed many seasons at their caravan in Kilkeel and Saturday nights were taken up with playing pool with his good friend Sinclair Brown. Later they upgraded to a bigger caravan and continued their trips until Pearl’s death.Joe lived all his le in Edenderry and much of his married le in the house beside his parents in Watson Street.In his latter years after Pearl’s death Joe had a very structured schedule. A daily trip up the town included first stop Winnie’s Newsagent in Woodhouse Street for his paper, which had to be rolled up and secured with an elastic band. Next visit was to Gaynor’s Cafe in Church Lane where the staff didn’t even need to ask what Joe’s order was but once his foot crossed the door they had already started preparing it. His night time routine included a walk up around Portadown. But when family became concerned for his safety, he assured them that nobody would touch him and that he always carried his walking stick anyhow.As an avid Edenderry man, Joe was heavily involved in the generational annual construction of Edenderry arch.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win. Keir fits the bill. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Natural Resources Wales and the Welsh Assembly should not ignore the issue this time around.Responding to public concerns about the new plans, a spokesman for the Welsh Government said: ldquoIf EDF Energy submits a formal application, Natural Resources Wales will carry out a thorough assessment of the proposed activity before making a determination, having regard to the need to protect the environment and human health, as required by the Marine and Coastal Access Act .ldquoI know many constituents are very worried, said Stephen Doughty MP for Cardf South and Penarth.ldquoWe shouldnrsquot be a dumping ground for others, and I will continue to raise concerns on behalf of residents and report back any information I receive.To comment on the proposed sample plan, visit NRWrsquos consultation page before Wednesday, March  at: naturalresources.wales permits-and-permissions permit-applications-consultations-and-decisions current-consultations-marine-licence-applicantions hinkley-point-c-sediment-sampling-plan-sp  langen article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Of those who received the benefit,  per cent were unemployed.Universal Credit began in  and has been gradually rolled out across the country. It was designed to simply the benefits system for working age people by merging six separate benefits into one payment.But features such as the -week wait, the -child limit and the benefits cap, as well as public spending cuts, have been associated with a rise in rent arrears, food bank usage and child poverty.Local homelessness charity, Llamau, has expressed concern for young people who are being enrolled on the scheme.Joe Payne, head of vale services and family mediation for Llamau, said: ldquoPrior to the introduction of Universal Credit, a young person may have claimed Job Seekers Allowance or Employment Support Allowance but this is no longer an option.ldquoUndoubtedly, the five week waiting time and a very low National Minimum Wage for people under  is going to cause young people untold hardship and in a lot of cases, spiralling debt.A Department for Work and Pension spokesman said the increase in  to -year olds claiming Universal Credit is lsquoin line with expectationsrsquo as it has been rolled out to every job centre.Jane Hutt, AM for the Vale of Glamorgan, said: ldquoI am concerned at the rise in the number of claimants, particularly young people, who need to access Universal Credit.ldquoCare leavers in particular are being disadvantaged by the changes. I do not believe the concerns that have been raised by claimants, by employers and by organisations advising and supporting people affected, including those who are in employment, have been addressed and I will continue to raise them on behalf of my constituents.The government has committed to ending a four-year benefit freeze in April this year, meaning millions of people will see their payments rise by the same rate as inflation.Councillor Kathryn McCaffer, Vale of Glamorgan Council youth champion, said: ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council is working with a range of partners to mitigate any adverse impacts and offer a iety of support to young people in financial dficulties. Those classed as Not in Education, Employment or Trainingcan access the Inspire  Work programme, which provides financial help to pay for the likes of work clothes, training and travel costs.ldquoVulnerable tenants are protected from debt through the direct payments system.

He made me feel very relaxed, said one patient after meeting Charles.ldquoWithin  seconds I felt at ease. It was nice to be able to say what you wanted, and he genuinely had an interest in the patients, said Kathryn Guercio, a Health Care Assistant at Marie Curie.For Kathryn, the royal visit was an opportunity to thank the prince.ldquoWhen I was  I left school with no qualications. I was an absolute angry drop out. I joined the Princes Trust volunteers because they didnrsquot know what  to do with me, Kathryn said.Established by Charles in , the Princes Trust helps vulnerable young people to find employment and gain valuable training.ldquoI did a fortnight of caring in Surry and I loved it. I absolutely loved it. Thatrsquos when I thought I could do this. I just love looking after people.ldquoItrsquos because of that choice to join the Princes Trust volunteers that I ended up where I am, so I genuinely do thank him for taming a very wayward -year-old.Describing her job at Marie Curie, Kathryn said: ldquoI love it here. Therersquos no comparison. You can give that  percent every sht. And wersquove got a cracking view. The sun rises and then the moon rises. We get to see it all across the water. Itrsquos gorgeous.Following the tour, the prince ended his visit at a reception where he met actor and Marie Curie ambassador, Suzanna Packer.In a brief speech, he commended the staff and volunteers for their dedication which he called lsquotruly remarkable.rsquoHe then unveiled a plaque to commemorate his visit and cut a daffodil-themed cake made by local Michelin-starred chef, James Sommerin.Angelina Hall and Cathy OrsquoDoherty, co-owners of Glass By Design at Station Approach, were commissioned to design and produce the plaque.ldquoIt was an honour for us as local artists to be asked to make this, said Cathy. ldquoItrsquos something which is going to be here for people to enjoy.His Royal Highness was also the first person to sign the charityrsquos Great Big Daffodil - a -foot tall model with paper books in the shape of petals which will start a UK wide tour this week.The Great Daffodil Appeal is an opportunity for people to share their stories, memories, or tributes to a loved one.After signing the book and cutting the cake, Charles gave a final farewell to the staff who had gathered to see him and left with his entourage.The prince met with flood victims in Pontypridd later that afternoon.His trip to South Wales also included engagements at the CAF train factory in Newport, the Aston Martin Lagonda factory in St. Athan, Barry, and the British Airways Maintenance Centre in Cardf. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

How do those people then stay, snuggled in snoozy paradise for hour upon hour until their alarm gives them a nudge and they arise rested and ready for a new day  I have never been a good sleeper, even as a child. If anything at all is playing on my mind, I never lose my appetite, but I will lose slumber. I have friends who similarly suffer. I use the word suffer quite deliberately, because lying there in the dark at am it can feel like everyone  is snuffling softly but for the wide-awake person, it can feel horrendous. As the time ticks closer to the alarm and still sleep will not come, it can feel quite anxiety-inducing and so the vicious circle whizzes, fizzes and flies through your brain making sleep feel further and further away.But, as this is a lelong way of living for me and I am overwhelmingly a lsquocrack on kinda womanrsquo, I have developed ways to use this time effectively. I listen to podcasts, and have learned about biohacking, how broccoli defends itself and the many twists and turns of the Brexit negotiations whilst the street snoozes. I catch up with messages . I also think a lot. I just lay there in the dark and puzzle though story ideas, events from the day and issues facing friends, family and myself. In a twisted way, this time and opportunity has become quite precious to me. I donrsquot know when  in the day Irsquod have the time and space to just ponder, muse, consider and percolate. It is during this time that I have considered my earlier point about jealousy.

Rather than adhering to a nationally prescribed learning program, schools and practitioners will be able to make decisions that best meet the needs of specic learners.As well as contributing to the framework, St Josephrsquos has also introduced their own bespoke curriculum, and is one of only  Curriculum Innovation Schools in Wales.The St Josephrsquos curriculum is based on findings in child development and cognitive science, with staff undertaking extensive learning on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop.Lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social and physical development, whilst also providing a detailed knowledge and understanding of the world, both past and present.The school has also benefitted from signicant on-site works, including the refurbishment of all classrooms, a complete reconfiguration of the Foundation Phase learning spaces and a state of the art new-build Nursery.Staff regularly deliver learning experiences outside of the classroom, as the schoolrsquos grounds include a playing field, wooded area, pond, orchard, wildflower meadow and polytunnel.The implementation of the schoolrsquos ambitious curriculum has seen standards improve year on year. Last yearrsquos National Reading Tests saw the average child in St Josephrsquos score within the top  percent of the country, with similarly high standards achieved in mathematics.Headteacher, Gareth Rein said: ldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos. Everything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.Cabinet Member for Education and Regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning. It encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom.St Josephrsquos will be hosting an open day on Wednesday March .

The short list of potential locations for e-bike stations includes Penarth Town Centre, Cogan Train Centre, Penarth Train Station, Llandough Hospital, The Esplanade, Cosmeston Country Park, Cardf Bay Barrage, and Pont-y-Werin Bridge.The scheme hopes to encourage people to switch from their daily car journey to e-bikes, saving on average g of CO for every  kilometre travelled.The average round trip from Penarth to Cardf is km, which would save ,g of COused daily.Nextbike Managing Director, Krysia Solheim, said the Penarth scheme would be great for those who commute into the capital.ldquoWe know from our research that a lot of commuters already cycle from Penarth into Cardf, said Ms Solheim.ldquoE-bikes will make that journey easier and quicker than ever before, which will hopefully persuade more people to switch from four wheels to two on a daily basis. Picking up an e-bike instead of jumping in the car is also a great way for people to reduce their own personal carbon footprints to help our communities tackle climate change.ldquoPenarth will play an important part in leading the bike share revolution in Wales - itrsquos an exciting time - and we want the community to be as involved as possible.\"Councillor Peter King, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, said: ldquoFeedback from the Nextbike consultation was overwhelmingly positive, with many residents hoping to see the expansion of the scheme to the wider Vale.ldquoHaving declared a climate emergency last year, and having recently proposed a pound.m investment into tackling environmental issues, the Nextbike scheme will be a leading example of our commitment to tackling climate change and improving the wellbeing of our residents. We hope this will inspire the launch of similar schemes in future.The Nextbike project is being funded by Section  sustainable transport contributions. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They considered how everyday le has evolved for the residents of Penarth and identied which aspects of the area were important to them.They then created mono-prints, inspired by their ideas of place, nature, and wider environmental issues, key venues and buildings, and other things they valued and enjoyed doing.Cabinet Member for Leisure, Arts and Culture, Councillor Kathryn McCaffer joined the students for the workshop. She said: ldquoThis was a brilliant opportunity for these young people to work with professional artists whilst also engaging with their townrsquos rich culture.ldquoThe workshop is part of a wider consultation process to develop art works for the seating areas along Paget Road, and so it was incredibly valuable to have the input of Penarthrsquos younger generation in the shaping of its future.As part of the consultation process, the Vale of Glamorgan Council have commissioned Pandora Vaughan and Huw Owen to undertake a program of community engagement events with residents.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There have been no deaths.ndash What is the UK Government recommending people ing from infected regions do The UK Government said people ing from Hubei province in China, Iran, lockdown areas in northern Italy and special care zones in South Korea in the last  days should immediately self-isolate at home and call NHS .People ing from a number of other countries including the rest of China and Korea, Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore should self-isolatethey develop symptoms of cough or fever or shortness of breath.It also said those ing from Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and northern Italy above Pisa should self-isolatethey show symptoms.ndash What about schools Although several schools have sent pupils home over fears of Covid- contact, Public Health Englandrsquos general advice is for them not to close.Burbage Primary School in Buxton, Derbyshire, was closed on Thursday because of a case diagnosed in a parent.ndash Is it affecting financial markets The FTSE  index of leading British companies has fallen faster this week than at any time since the financial crisis in  ndash wiping pound billion off its value.Traders hate uncertainty and would rather cash out than wait for the outbreak to pass.They are also fearful that with factories closed and transport routes disrupted, businesses may struggle to operate properly in a globalised world ndash particularly with many relying on manufacturing from China.ndash What about a vaccine Vaccines have been developed and researchers are starting to test them on animals.But tests can take months to seeany potential vaccine can be used on humans and there will then have to be trials on humans.The World Health Organisation has convened a group of experts to fast-track promising tests, drugs and vaccines to help slow the outbreak.But experts say it could still be months or even years before any approved treatments or vaccines are developed.ndash What will happenit is declared a pandemic Health leaders have saidcoronavirus becomes a global pandemic then there are a number of contingency plans in place to halt its spread.Englandrsquos chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty said these include shutting schools, reducing public transport and quarantining whole families.But he stressed the actions would depend on the scale of the outbreak and said he was confident health services could cope with the current activity.ndash What is a coronavirus Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome .The strain that has recently emerged is a new strain that has not been previously identied in humans. The respiratory disease it causes has been named Covid- by WHO.ndash Where did it come from Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people, the World Health Organisation says.The first cases identied were among people connected to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan in China.ndash How is it spread The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with the virus coughs or exhales.These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person and can be picked up other people touching them then touching their nose or mouth, it added.ndash How can you stop it Thorough hand-washing, maintaining distance from others, and avoiding hand-shakes are among the most effective measures for reducing your risk of catching coronavirus.Everyday precautions like carrying hand sanitiser, covering your mouth and nose with a tissue or sleeve when you cough or sneeze,rather than your hands, and binning used tissues immediately is also helpful, according to the NHS.ndash What are the symptoms Initial symptoms of the novel coronavirus include fever, cough, tightness of the chest, shortness of breath and breathing dficulties.More severe cases can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, sepsis and septic shock, which can lead to death.There are no specic treatments or vaccines for a new coronavirus but symptoms can be treated.ndash Can only people with no symptoms spread the virus The jury is still out on this one, although scientists believe there is evidence of asymptomatic transmission.The Department of Health has said it believes the risk of catching coronavirus from someone with no symptoms at all is low.But because many people with Covid- experience only mild symptoms, particularly during the early stages of the disease, it is possible to catch it from someone who has mild symptoms.ndash Are some groups more at risk The UK Government says based on current evidence most cases appear to be mild and those who have died in Wuhan appear to have had pre-existing health conditions.The World Health Organisation has said about four in five people who contract the virus get mild symptoms and recover.But it added older people or patients with pre-existing medical conditions such as high blood pressure, heart disease or diabetes are more at risk of developing serious illness..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Coronavirus February   u all you need to know article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They should have checked the bus.” He continued: “I am just relieved that Ryan is ok.“I haven’t slept worrying about what could have happened. “Was the bus locked  Could Ryan have been taken  “WhatRyan had got off the bus - he has no road sense.

With their parents Sam and Christina , they lived in Florence Court, Edenderry. A fth brother Bertie, tragically died at a young age.The four brothers shared an unbreakable bond centred chiefly around football. They played together for The Church Lads Brigade and were members of the Edenderry United Team which won the McKinney Cup in . Joe went on to play for three seasons for BanbridgeTown and during these seasons the team was unbeaten. Indeed, Joe had a trial for an Under  Intermediate Team.In his mid s he stood in for an absent member of a rugby team and ended up as a scrum half and team captain. He was a long associate of Chambers’ Park Rugby and wore his Club blazer with immense pride.Joe married Pearl Forde in  andever there was a ‘marriage made in heaven’ this was it.They adored each other and ‘sparred’ with one another as only true soulmates can. They had one adored daughter, Elizabeth, who tragically died aged  in  a sorrow Joe and Pearl bore in quiet faith. Le was never the same for Joe after his beloved Pearl died on  February .Joe, as with all his siblings, was raised in a Christian home and infused with a quiet yet unbending Christian faith. His willingness to bear the burdens of others and his desire to aid his fellow man manested itself in his role as a trade union shop stewart. His integrity and forthrightness earned respect and in most of his workplaces he was both foreman and shop steward. Physically tough he relied upon God in times of sorrow for the inner strength which toughness cannot supply.He was also, with his brothers, a member of Seagoe Church Lads Brigade Pipe Band and the quartet of three pipers and a drummer often practiced in the front room of their family home.Joe also thoroughly enjoyed the Lambeg Drums and Saturday nights in his mid to latter years were spent at ious drumming competitions. Joe was employed in ious weaving factories, one of which was Brookfield Mill in Banbridge and he was heartbroken when it closed down.Pearl and Joe and Elizabeth enjoyed many seasons at their caravan in Kilkeel and Saturday nights were taken up with playing pool with his good friend Sinclair Brown. Later they upgraded to a bigger caravan and continued their trips until Pearl’s death.Joe lived all his le in Edenderry and much of his married le in the house beside his parents in Watson Street.In his latter years after Pearl’s death Joe had a very structured schedule. A daily trip up the town included first stop Winnie’s Newsagent in Woodhouse Street for his paper, which had to be rolled up and secured with an elastic band. Next visit was to Gaynor’s Cafe in Church Lane where the staff didn’t even need to ask what Joe’s order was but once his foot crossed the door they had already started preparing it. His night time routine included a walk up around Portadown. But when family became concerned for his safety, he assured them that nobody would touch him and that he always carried his walking stick anyhow.As an avid Edenderry man, Joe was heavily involved in the generational annual construction of Edenderry arch. Mr Roney’s funeral was on Monday February  in Seagoe Parish Church following by interment in Seagoe Cemetery.\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191205_4696_web.jpg","title":"pulse pr a decade in northern ireland communications","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Pulse PR’s Grainne McGarvey sits down with Ulster Business at the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Belfast to chat about marking  years in business amid an evolving media landscape, growing from strong entrepreneurial family roots and the next step in her company’s journey A bold decision a decade ago to go out on her own and establish Pulse PR has seen Grainne McGarvey work with a range of clients to help sell their message to a wider audience. In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common.

The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
