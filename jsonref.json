Such a developmental lag is due to the fact that no-one was engaged with the child.\u0027She can point to her eyes, nose and mouth, he said.But she \u0027unfamiliar with sleeping in a bed.

where cheaper agricultural fuel is sold as motor fuel - costing up to £40million a year in lost tax.  But there are major concerns that tariffs imposed in the event of a No Deal Brexit could increase smuggling activity.                                                     Today the European Commission said it was unhappy about the proposed the \u0027differential treatment\u0027 of trade on the island of Ireland. For example cars from the EU would be subject to a a 10.6 per tax on the cost of all \u0027fully finished\u0027 vehicles - making the prices of an average vehicle surge by £1,500. However in a seemingly confusing loophole in no deal plan, Northern Ireland\u0027s border would remain open for at least 12 months and goods entering from the Republic would not face tariffs to preserve the Good Friday agreement. However, tariffs will be payable on goods moving from the EU into the rest of the UK via Northern Ireland under a schedule of rates also released on Wednesday.  The Government insists that this will not create a border down the Irish Sea, as there will be no checks on goods moving between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.Instead, normal compliance and intelligence methods will be used to detect any traders attempting to abuse the system. Ministers accepted that the new regime will cause \u0027concerns\u0027 to Northern Irish businesses and farmers about the impact on their competitiveness .But they said these were the only steps that could be taken to deliver on the Government\u0027s commitment to avoiding a hard border in the case of no deal.Under the new regime for Northern Ireland, goods arriving from the Republic will still be subject to the same VAT and excise duty as at present.Small businesses trading across the border will be able to report VAT online without any new processes at the border.To protect human, animal and plant health, animals and animal products from outside the EU would be required to enter Northern Ireland through a designated entry point, while regulated plant materials from outside the EU and high-risk plants from inside Europe will require certification and pre-notification.There will be new UK import requirements such as document checks and registration for a small number of goods such as endangered species and hazardous chemicals which are subject to international agreements.Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley said: \u0027The Government has been clear that a deal with the European Union is the best outcome for Northern Ireland.\u0027But we will do all we can to support people and businesses across Northern Ireland in the event that we leave without a deal.\u0027The measures announced today recognise the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland. These arrangements can only be temporary and short term.\u0027In the case of no-deal, the UK Government is committed to entering discussions urgently with Brussels and Dublin to agree long-term arrangements.

He has sadly spent most of his adult life here at Dogs Trust after being found wandering the streets as a pup. \u0027Greyhounds can remain in the care of Dogs Trust for a while, often because of perceptions around their breed an example of this would be potential dog owners believing Greyhounds need lots of exercise, and Stevie is no exception to this phenomena. \u0027Despite being a stunning boy he has yet to meet the right family for him.           The Dogs Trust staff believe that Stevie is a victim of assumptions that Greyhounds need a lot of exercise and physical activity\u0027He is a real entertainer who is sure to make you laugh out loud at his antics. Despite being a loveable clown, he is a very smart dog who picks up things very quickly and is keen to learn. \u0027He loves to be the centre of attention and doesn’t like being left alone for long periods of time. He’s happy to walk with other dogs that he knows and is always pleased to meet new people.\u0027 And Stevie isn\u0027t the only long-term resident at the Dog\u0027s Trust looking for a permanent home.Monty, a six-year-old English Pointer, has been at the rehoming centre in Basildon since November 2016, after being found as a stray.

He has been with the Dogs Trust for four yearsBertie also has a very keen nose and is very good at finding the teddy bear that staff at the centre sometimes hide. The adorable six-year-old will need a quiet and relaxed new home and any new owners will need to visit the centre a few times before taking him home, in order to build a bond. Five-year-old Clarence is another cross-breed who has been housed at the Dogs Trust in Ilfracombe since December 2016. He has an charming lion\u0027s mane of hair and his small size makes him a perfect companion for people looking for someone to cuddle.           Clarence, five, is another cross-breed who has been housed at the Dogs Trust in Ilfracombe since December 2016Although Clarence loves to be fussed over, he can be quite shy around strangers and so needs an adult-only home without any other dogs. However, he does enjoy walking with other canines and will quickly make new friends in his new area. Clarence needs a quiet and settled home, where he will have his owner\u0027s unided attention. He will need some more training and support from the Dogs Trust so new owners shouldn\u0027t be further than an hour away, if possible.             Ollie, 11, is a Staffordshire Bull Terrier cross and has been a resident at the Glasgow Rehoming Centre for three yearsThe oldest of the five, Staffordshire Bull Terrier cross Ollie is 11 and has been a resident at the Glasgow Rehoming Centre for three years. However, despite his age he is very agile and energetic and will need space to stretch his legs. Ollie will need to be kept on a lead in public areas, meaning that a new home with a private garden would be preferred, to give him some freedom. He needs a gentle home and time and space to settle. The Staffie Cross would need someone around for most of the day initially, to help build up the length of time he can be left on his own. His new owners would also need to visit him at the Rehoming Centre  to build a bond before he goes home.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Labour vote block no deal tonight","story":"    Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said \u0027I don\u0027t know for sure, because I just don\u0027t - I don\u0027t even know what\u0027s going to happen today\u0027 when asked about when Labour would call for a second referendum          Jeremy Corbyn, pictured today, is expected to whip Labour MPs to vote against a no deal Brexit in the House of Commons tonightAppearing on the Emma Barnett Show on BBC Radio 5, Ms Thornberry was pressed on when the party would call for a new Brexit vote, saying: \u0027I suspect it will be next week.\u0027But I don\u0027t know for sure, because I just don\u0027t - I don\u0027t even know what\u0027s going to happen today.\u0027However she did confirm that a second referendum remained party policy.\u0027Frankly if we end up in some log jam, then I\u0027m afraid we are going to need to go back to the people and we are going to need to ask them what they want to do next,\u0027 she added.  Labour is set to help block a no deal Brexit tonight in another crunch vote in the House of Commons.Jeremy Corbyn will whip his MPs to vote against a plan that would see the UK crash out of Europe without agreements for future co-operation with Brussels.  It comes after the Labour leader called for no deal to be \u0027taken off the table\u0027 following the defeat of Prime Minister Theresa May\u0027s plan last night.Mr Corbyn wants a General Election and, if successful, would put forward an alternative exit plan that would keep Britain in a customs union with the EU. If MPs reject no-deal - as most Westminster observers expect - a third vote will follow on Thursday on whether to request an extension of the two-year Article 50 negotiation process, delaying Brexit by a number of months.           It comes after Labour helped block Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal in last night\u0027s vote, with the Prime Minister\u0027s plan defeated by 149 votes          The Prime Minister\u0027s hopes of saving her deal after a last minute dash to Strasbourg late on Tuesday turned to ashes in the Commons last night as the new concessions were hammered by MPsLabour\u0027s support for a second referendum remains unclear, with shadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey today saying the party has \u0027not ruled out\u0027 a People\u0027s Vote weeks after Mr Corbyn told his MP\u0027s he would call for one to \u0027stop a damaging Tory Brexit\u0027 Ms Long Bailey told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today: \u0027Now I think it\u0027s the opportunity for Parliament to set the agenda and take control because we have a Government now which isn\u0027t in control.\u0027Asked if Labour would push for another motion of no confidence in the Prime Minister she said it was \u0027something that we may consider in the future\u0027.          Mr Corbyn, pictured at his London home today, wants a General Election to be called and, if successful, would put forward his own plan to keep the UK in a customs union with the EU Pressed on Labour\u0027s position on a second referendum she said: \u0027We have not ruled out a People\u0027s Vote but our priority is securing a deal.\u0027Labour MPs were previously whipped to oppose a no deal Brexit in January when they helped narrowly pass the Spelman amendment, a non-binding motion calling for the scenario to be ruled out.  Mrs May has given Conservative MPs a free vote tonight, meaning they can vote with their conscience rather than follow the party line.Mrs May has indicated she will vote against no deal, and with Labour\u0027s support it is likely a majority in Parliament will follow suit.It is expected to be a very different result from last night, when just three Labour MPs - John Mann, Caroline Flint and Kevin Barron - voted for the Government\u0027s deal to leave.  Hours before tonight\u0027s vote, ministers announced worrying new tariffs that are likely to provoke more accusations of scaremongering after months of apocalyptic warnings about the impact of a no deal Brexit. Under the no deal plan revealed this morning, 87 per cent of products would be subject to zero tariffs in an effort to stop price spikes and kick-start trade with Britain from across the world.But ministers said products from the EU including beef, pork, chicken, butter, cheese and fish would also be subject to import taxes expected to push up prices in the supermarkets from March 29 if there is no deal.    Labour\u0027s opposition - and the deal\u0027s rejection by 75 Brexiteer Tory rebels alongside the DUP - sunk Mrs May\u0027s motion last night with Boris Johnson saying Mrs May should put her deal to bed          There were 75 Tory rebels - down from 118 last time - as well as all 10 DUP MPs. Just three Labour MPs backed the deal. The Prime Minister got back about 40 MPs from the January 15 voteCars from the EU would be subject to a a 10.6 per tax on the cost of all \u0027fully finished\u0027 vehicles - making the prices of an average vehicle surge by £1,500.However in a seemingly confusing loophole in no deal plan, Northern Ireland\u0027s border would remain open at least \u0027temporarily\u0027 and goods entering from the Republic would not face tariffs to preserve the Good Friday agreement. The situation will raise fears that the Northern Irish border could become a smuggling route for EU products.With just 17 days until the UK is scheduled to leave the EU, hardline Eurosceptics sided with Labour last night to inflict a crushing 149-vote defeat on the Prime Minister.A delay to the March 29 departure date is now almost certain. Mrs May\u0027s massive defeat also opens the door to drastic options such as a general election or second referendum.Speaking in Strasbourg, where the European Parliament is gathering for a debate on Brexit ahead of the next European Council summit, the EU\u0027s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said: \u0027Again the House of Commons says what it doesn\u0027t want. Now this impasse can only be solved in the UK.\u0027Amid speculation about how long she can survive in Downing Street, the Prime Minister\u0027s aides insisted she had not considered resigning. Boris Johnson is among leadership candidates sizing up their chances. "},{"url":null,"title":"Youve won inconsiderate parkers prize Mother fours shock neighbour leaves note","story":"    The mother-of-four was about to take her youngest child to school when she found this \u0027petty\u0027 note on her windscreen          Chelsey Chara, pictured with her partner Robin, was shocked to find the note on her Vauxhall Zafira parked near her home          The mother-of-four was accused of being inconsiderate for her parking job.

Rights groups have previously said the activists had no access to lawyers during more than nine months of detention and interrogation.          Fellow campaigners say the women have been charged under the kingdom\u0027s cybercrime law and could be landed with up to ten years in jail           Western governments called on Saudi to release the women, after they blasted the Arab kingdom over the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in IstanbulRelatives said they were told at the last minute that the trial had been moved from the Specialized Criminal Court, which was set up to try terrorism cases but is often used for political offences.It was unclear what was behind the decision, but diplomats said they were hopeful it signalled a more lenient handling of the cases after months of lobbying by Western governments.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and British counterpart Jeremy Hunt have said they raised the issue with Saudi authorities during recent visits. It remains to be seen if Riyadh will bend to that pressure - with the women possibly receiving acquittals or pardons - or pursue harsh sentences.Critics say the case has revealed the limits of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u0027s promises to modernise Saudi Arabia.The prince has courted the West to support ambitious economic and social reforms, but his reputation was tarnished after Saudi agents killed Khashoggi, a royal insider-turned-critic, last October at the kingdom\u0027s Istanbul consulate.The outcry over the murder increased scrutiny of the detained women\u0027s rights activists, who also include Nouf Abdelaziz, Mayaa al-Zahrani, Samar Badawi, Nassima al-Saada, Shadan al-Onezi, Amal al-Harbi and Mohammed al-Rabia.They say some of the women, including Hathloul, were held in solitary confinement and subjected to mistreatment and torture, including electric shocks, flogging and sexual assault. Saudi officials have denied those allegations.Hathloul, who had advocated an end to the driving ban and the kingdom\u0027s male guardianship system, was previously detained twice, including for 73 days in 2014 after she tried to drive into Saudi Arabia from the United Arab Emirates.Nafjan and Yousef participated in a protest against the driving ban in 2013. Yousef also authored a petition, which Nafjan and Hathloul signed, in 2016 seeking to end male guardianship, which requires women to obtain the consent of a male relative for major decisions.Activists and diplomats have speculated that the arrests may have been aimed at appeasing conservative elements opposed to the relaxation of social strictures. They may also have been meant as a message to activists not to push demands out of sync with the government\u0027s own agenda.Dozens of other activists, intellectuals and clerics have been arrested separately in the past two years in an apparent bid to stamp out possible opposition."},{"url":null,"title":"Terrified dog winched safety stuck 48 hours 200ft high mountain ledge","story":"    A thermal camera fitted to the chopper displays an image with a single white dot on the mountain          But as the lens zooms in, it becomes clear that the source of heat is a dog cowering on the edge of a vertical dropA thermal camera fitted to the chopper displayed an image with a single white dot on the mountain.But as the lens zooms in, it becomes clear that the source of heat is a dog cowering on the edge of a vertical drop.The footage then cuts to show a winchman being lowered down on to the snowy mountainside, where he scoops the dog up in his arms, and is hauled back up,  swinging violently in the stormy conditions. Back in the Coastguard office, a visibly happy but muddy dog warms up and shakes off the muck picked up from its two days in the wilderness. Captain Simon Hammock, co-pilot Roger Sherriff, winch operator Rob Glendinning and winchman Mark Stevens were undertaking some essential winter training with another winchman Kate Willoughby visiting from Humberside Coastguard helicopter base at Stag Rocks in the Cairngorms.

Photograph: Liam McBurneyPA The DUP leader Arlene Foster has said she will use her visit to Washington for St Patrick’s week events to brief people there that her party was seeking a “sensible” Brexit deal “which works for every part of the United Kingdom as well as our neighbours in the Republic of Ireland”.“It is important that Dublin and Brussels are in deal making mode,” she said. Ms Foster said she would also tell political figures in the US that it was Sinn Féin which was blocking a return to Stormont.“Whilst Sinn Féin focus on a narrow agenda in Northern Ireland, I will be relaying the frustration amongst people of all backgrounds about a lack of devolution. It is important that decision makers within the United States hear more than just another tired call for a isive Border poll,” she said.Sinn Féin deputy leader Michelle O’Neill said there was a mounting sense of alarm within the business and farming sectors that the DUP was dragging Northern Ireland towards a no-deal Brexit.“Whatever no-deal proposals the British government come up with, the fact is that it will be an economic disaster their own evidence tells us that. The civil service analysis tells us that. The experience of our business, farming industry and SMEs tells us that,” she said. “That is where the DUP have taken us. They have consistently shown a callous disregard for the people who live here.”The SDLP Brexit spokesman Daniel McCrossan said “the British government are playing chicken on the issue of the Border in an attempt to lay blame elsewhere. But what they need to understand, and fast, is that without a backstop the hardening of the Border is inevitable.”Alliance Brexit spokesman Stephen Farry said the British plans for no tariffs or checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from the Republic in a no-deal Brexit were neither tenable nor sustainable. At best they amounted to a temporary fix, he said.Ulster Unionist Party MEP Jim Nicholson said the proposed no-deal tariff regime should refocus minds on the importance of getting a good deal done.EU sources on Wednesday said exempting Northern Ireland goods coming into the Republic from EU tariffs following a no-deal Brexit may not, in fact, be possible.EU reaction to UK plans?A European Commission spokesman would say only that the EU was “analysing” the UK plans. But he emphasised that the bloc would apply tariffs on “all trade” from the United Kingdom.He refused to elaborate on whether that includes Northern Ireland.WTO rules require equal treatment by states of their trading partners, with limited exceptions, and Mr Schinas warned implicitly that the UK announcement may break those rules. If they do the EU might refer the UK to a WTO disputes panel.“This is essential for the EU in order to remain a reliable trading partner to the rest of the world, including upholding internationally agreed rules on global trade.”MFN rates are imposed by the European Union on imports from countries which do not have a free trade agreement.Another EU spokesman said that the UK was well aware of the EU’s obligations under the World Trade Organisation, implying that London would not expect reciprocation of the tariff gesture.It is understood that Irish Ambassador to the EU Declan Kelleher raised concerns about the UK plan at the ambassadors’ meeting in Brussels on Wednesday.Mr Schinas also refused to be drawn on whether the UK’s proposed “biosecurity” measures would be regarded as sufficient protection of the all-Ireland meat and agriculture trade.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

File Photograph: David YoungPA Britain will not introduce any new checks or controls on goods moving from Ireland to Northern Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit, including no customs declarations for normal goods.Announcing a series of “strictly temporary, unilateral” measures on Wednesday morning, the British government said its priority would be to enter into discussions with the European Commission and the Irish Government to jointly agree long-term measures to avoid a hard Border.Britain also announced a temporary tariff regime for a no-deal scenario but said it would not apply tariffs on goods crossing the Border into Northern Ireland. It will be for the Irish Government and for the EU to determine what measures might be applied on goods crossing the Border from Northern Ireland into Ireland.However, goods entering the rest of the UK from the Republic of Ireland would face tariffs which will be high in some sectors and be a particular threat to the Irish beef and dairy sectors, who sell a large proportion to the British market.The decision not to apply tariffs to goods crossing the Border means that although Britain will impose tariffs on beef and dairy products, all Irish beef and dairy products will be able to enter Northern Ireland tariff-free. “The government has been clear that a deal with the European Union is the best outcome for Northern Ireland. But we will do all we can to support people and businesses across Northern Ireland in the event that we leave without a deal. The measures announced today recognise the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland. These arrangements can only be temporary and short-term,” Northern Ireland secretary Karen Bradley said.Goods arriving from Ireland into Northern Ireland would still be subject to the same VAT and excise duty as today and the British government would continue to collect these taxes on Irish goods. Small businesses trading across the Border and not currently VAT-registered would be able to report VAT online periodically without any new processes at the Border.Animals and animal products from countries outside the EU would have to enter Northern Ireland through a designated entry point. Regulated plant material from outside the EU and high-risk EU plant material will require certification and pre-notification. New import requirements would also apply to imports of endangered species and hazardous chemicals.The measures were announced ahead of a vote at Westminster on Wednesday night on a motion ruling out a no-deal Brexit.The new tariff schedule would apply from 11pm on March 29th in the event of a crash out of the EU and would be in place for up to 12 months. The headline rates published by the government represent a percentage of the existing rate imposed by the EU on imports from countries which do not have a free trade agreement.They include 53 per cent of the existing EU rate on beef, which equates, for example, to 6.8 per cent on boneless beef plus €160.10 per 100kg and 6.8 per cent on unboned beef and €93 per 100kg.Other rates include 60 per cent of the existing EU rate on poultry, butter 32 per cent, cheddar cheese 13 per cent. - Additional reporting Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It is just very difficult. There is very little room to manoeuvre from the EU side,” Mr Cowen added.“No matter what assurances are given or interpretative documents seem to be provided. There seems to be people finding a reason why not to support it rather than take them at their word.”He was speaking beside the winners’ enclosure at Cheltenham’s Prestbury Park racecourse where he was part of a group celebrating City Island’s victory in the Ballymore Novices’ Hurdle. The horse is owned by Bernardine Mulryan, wife of property developer Seán Mulryan, whose company sponsored the race.Other members of the group included film director Jim Sheridan and the artist Guggi who travelled over from Dublin for the second day of the four-day jump racing festival.Mr Cowen said he had money on City Island, trained by Co Kildare-based Martin Brassil and ridden by Mark Walsh. “We won a few pound there we won a few pound there,” he told The . The former taoiseach, in Cheltenham for three days of the festival, said that he watched the House of Commons vote on someone’s phone as he left the racecourse on Tuesday evening. “It means you don’t miss it too much,” he said, of politics and the parliamentary turmoil around Brexit.He described the deadlock over the proposed EU-UK orce deal and the contentious backstop to avoid a future hard Irish border as “an unfortunate situation” because it was only “a contingency insurance policy”. “I think there will be a free-trade agreement so I don’t think it will ever emerge anyway. There will be a successful trade agreement so it is unfortunate that there are not allowing them to get into the second phase of negotiations and deal with that rather than harping on about what is essentially a contingency,” he said.He agreed that it was getting “very close to the wire” and the UK’s scheduled departure from the EU on March 29th for no deal to have been agreed on an orderly exit. “It is unfortunate that it has got to this point. You just have to hope common sense will prevail. There seems to be a majority that won’t want a crash-out and that is important from our point of view,” he said, speaking hours before British MPs vote on Wednesday evening on whether the UK should leave the EU without a deal.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Brian LawlessPA Wire The Government is to bring forward a package of support measures for businesses, exporters and farmers to Cabinet next week, amid deepening concern about the possibility of a no-deal Brexit. Speaking in Washington DC on Wednesday, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said Tuesday’s vote in the House of Commons means that a no-deal Brexit is now a “growing possibility.”“We are well placed to deal with any shock that might arise from no deal. The fact we have a budget surplus means we can borrow if we need to support our economy, the NTMA has cash on hand should there be any disturbance in the markets, the banks are well capitalised,” said Mr Varadkar, who is due to meet US president Donal Trump on Thursday. He said the new package of measures to be agreed by Cabinet next Wednesday would provide income supports for those effected and business supports to help businesses restructure and pursue new markets. “We want Irish exporters, Irish farmers, Irish fisherman and businesses to know that the government has their back.” Mr Varadkar said the House of Commons still had the opportunity to avoid a no-deal. “It is very much in the hands of the British political establishment to take a no-deal off the table.“The option is there for the House of Commons to take no-deal off the table tonight.“What I’d say to people who were advocates of Brexit who perhaps voted against this deal, I’d ask them is this what “they really want. Was Brexit really about trade restrictions and protectionism, tariffs, borders, restrictions on trade, is this what Brexit was really all about?” UnicornsAsked about European Council Donald Tusk’s reference to a picture of a unicorn by a six-year old girl which he shared on social media on Wednesday, Mr Varadkar replied: “I think a lot of people that advocated unicorns have been chasing unicorns for a very long time and as we head into the next few weeks it should be patently obvious to everyone that unicorns only exist in fairytales.On Wednesday’s tariff proposal published in London, Mr Varadkar said: “There is a supreme irony in that the proposals produced by the British government today propose to treat Northern Ireland differently to the rest of the United Kingdom when it comes to customs, and you will be aware that many of those who voted against the backstop did so on the basis that they feared Northern Ireland might be treated differently in a few years’ time. “The UK proposals will treat Northern Ireland differently in a few weeks’ times in terms of customs, rules and regulations. Whilet he UK may impose tariffs in a o deal scenario, the European Union will also and a common external tariff will apply to any goods exported from the United Kingdom. This will have a serious impact on the British economy and the economy of Northern Ireland. He said that “this can all be avoided,” by having a customs union. “That is why the customs union was invented in the first place,” he said, urging the UK to reconsider a request for a customs union with the European Union. “In terms of what may happen in Northern Ireland I personally don’t think that the UK government’s proposals would be workable for very long. They propose to treat Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the United Kingdom in a few weeks time,” the Taoiseach said. “ Let’s not forget one of the big objections to the backstop was that that might happen in a few years time. The UK government is proposing to treat Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK in a few weeks time and inevitably it would mean that Northern Ireland would become a backdoor to the European Single Market and I think within a matter of months that would lead to the need for checks at Northern Ireland’s ports. “So those who oppose the agreement may find that something very akin to the backstop is applied by the UK government in only a few weeks time. Trump meetingLooking ahead to his meeting on Thursday with President Donald Trump and congressional leaders, he said that this week offered an opportunity to talk to US political leaders about Ireland’s position on Brexit and deliver the message that Ireland is a “good and reliable partner for the United States that is certain about its place in the world when perhaps other countries are not and are somewhat in chaos.”However, he said he was not asking the United States to “take sides” when it comes to Ireland and Britain. “We know they will want to negotiate a free trade agreement with the UK into the future and we also want to negotiate a free trade agreement between the US and the EU and would like to do that before there is any agreement with the UK, but we will be saying to them of course that the Good Friday Agreement has to be paramount.” Maradkar has confirmed that his partner Matt Barrett will be joining him in a meeting with US Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday morning. It comes after Mr Pence, who describes himself as a Christian and a conservative, extended an invitation to the couple last year during a meeting with Mr Varadkar. Speaking in Washington DC, Mr Varadkar said: “He (Matt) was able to get time off work and make the journey, so he’ll be taking up the invitation from Mike and Karen Pence to attend tomorrow.“Karen can’t be there because she’s in Abu Dhabi at the Special Olympics.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Bulent KilicAFPGetty ImagesIslamic State may be on the brink of defeat in Syria, but its ideology remains a potent recruitment tool. In the American midwest, a region that has proved fertile ground for the terror group and other extremist recruiters, communities and law enforcement officials face a new challenge: dealing with returning jihadists and dozens of extremists due for release from prison in the coming years.According to the programme on extremism run by George Washington University in the US capital, Minnesota and Ohio make up two of the three US states with the highest per capita rate of iniduals travelling to join Islamic State, also known as Isis.The attraction to the terror group remains a worry for US authorities. Last October, 19-year-old Naser Almadoaji, an Iraqi-born US citizen from Dayton, Ohio, was arrested while attempting to board an aircraft to Kazakhstan, from where he planned to cross into Afghanistan and join up with an Islamic State affiliate group.Almadoaji, who attended a school in the suburban district of Beavercreek until 2015 and worked at a local supermarket, also attempted to make contact with an unnamed terrorist group after travelling to Egypt and Jordan last year.Laith Alebbini (28), also from Dayton, was arrested before attempting to fly to Syria in April 2017. Prosecutors say Alebbini has since been open about his support for Islamic State.“Frankly, the threat of international terrorism is something that is present in Dayton, in the southern district of Ohio and throughout the country,” Ben Glassman, the US attorney for the southern district of Ohio, told reporters in December. Contacted by phone, several people involved with the local Muslim community in Dayton refused to comment on whether radicalisation was a concern among their community.AttacksOhio has experienced several Islamic State-related attacks and near misses in recent years. In November 2016, a Somali refugee was shot dead in the state capital, Columbus, after staging a car and knife attack that was later claimed by Islamic State.A month later, a 20-year-old Islamic State sympathiser from Cincinnati was sentenced to 30 years in prison after buying automatic rifles and ammunition that police officers say he planned to use to attack government targets in Washington DC. At least eight people from Ohio have been charged with attempting to travel to Syria or Iraq to join Islamic State, and one, Abdirahman Sheik Mohamud from Columbus, returned with plans to conduct a terrorist attack.Minnesota, a largely rural state bordering Canada, has the highest per-capita rate of iniduals in any US state travelling to join extremist groups in Syria, Iraq and Somalia. In November 2017, a 20-year-old man stabbed and badly injured two people at a mall in Bloomington, Minnesota. The perpetrator, Mahad Abdiraham, said his actions were to “answer the call of jihad.” Abdiraham received a 15-year jail term but may be eligible for release in 2026.More than 40 per cent of those who left the US to join extremist groups such as Islamic State and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the former al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria, remain unaccounted for, and while President Donald Trump has called on European countries to repatriate Islamic State fighters from Syria, he has refused to allow American extremists, such as Hoda Muthana, a 24-year-old woman from Alabama, return to the US.Disengagement programmeSome “rehab for terrorists” successes have been recorded. Minnesota is home to the first de-radicalisation programme in the country, the Minnesota Extremist Disengagement Program, which works with defendants formerly involved with foreign and American terrorist organisations but who are deemed fit for temporary release before sentencing.Of 30 people charged with involvement with foreign terrorist organisations in the district, 12 were deemed suitable to take part in the programme. Of those 12, 10 completed it successfully. While the number of participants is too few to definitively call it a success, its results are promising.Still, the dearth of de-radicalisation programmes is concerning for many. About 80 people convicted of terrorist-related crimes are set for release from US prisons in the coming five years. No disengagement programmes exist in American prisons for ex-jihadists, and funding, Lowry says, is hugely lacking.Judges in Minnesota and Ohio have been forced to place iniduals convicted of terrorist-related offences in halfway houses or delay their sentencing because, upon their release, there are insufficient facilities to help with their specific reintegration needs."},{"url":null,"title":"mardi gras celebrations new orleans pictures","story":"From children clamouring for tossed strands of beads, to revellers dressed up as blind referees poking fun at the NFL, to high school bands marching down the street, people in New Orleans, USA, celebrated Mardi Gras (Fat Tuesday) with flair and fun.Here: A members of the Zulu Social Aid and Pleasure ClubBrexit vote latest news: MPs to vote on no-deal or Plan B orce strategy - liveBrussels will tell Theresa May to ask for a long Brexit extensionFirst Day of Spring 2019: How the vernal equinox marks the changing seasonsWho could replace Theresa May as the next Tory leader and prime minister?

No deferral looks likely and the accompanying Written Ministerial Statement refers to a consultation on the detailed design and implementation.”Large companies taking advantage of smaller ones by taking months to make payments will also face tougher rules. Big firms will have to review and report on their payment practices annually in the first step of a crackdown.The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) cheered the move aimed at\u0026nbsppreventing\u0026nbspthe “rife and pernicious” practice.“The UK’s late payment crisis destroys thousands of businesses every year,” said FSB national chairman Mike Cherry.\u0026nbsp“The commitment from the chancellor that the business secretary will see this through is welcome, and we are especially pleased that the first measure has been announced – to make a non-executive director responsible for the supply chain through the audit Committee of every large business, and to report back through the Annual Report on their progress.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

It is damaging our economy and it is damaging our standing and reputation in the world,” he said.Mr Hammond, who has hinted he could resign if the UK crashes out of the EU, told the Commons that MPs have the choice to remove the threat of an “imminent no-deal exit”.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of no-deal Brexit Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass715 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass715 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersMPs\u0026nbsphave the chance to map out the way forward to a deal that can be collectively supported, Mr Hammond said.“We have huge opportunities ahead of us he said,” praising\u0026nbspBritain’s universities and technology companies.“We are the fifth largest economy in the world, a proud successful outward-looking nation\u0026nbspwith no boundaries to what we can achieve”.But he warned that\u0026nbsp“leaving with no deal would mean significant disruption... and a smaller and less prosperous economy in the long term than if we leave with a deal.”He made clear that if there was a Brexit deal, he would spend some of the £26.6bn “headroom” he expects to have in the Autumn Budget.\u0026nbspHowever if no deal is voted through he implied that the money would disappear due to a big hit to the economy.Delivering some good news for the chancellor, the Office for Budget responsibility revised up its forecast for wage growth to 3 per cent and Mr Hammond said another 600,000 jobs would be created by 2023.But shadow chancellor John McDonnell attacked\u0026nbspthe chancellor’s record on the economy, jobs and wages.\u0026nbspThe government had broken\u0026nbspthe “historic link between securing a job and taking yourself out of poverty”, he said.The Conservatives have\u0026nbspcreated a “large-scale jobs market of low pay, long hours and precarious work”, he said, adding that average wages are still below where they were ten years ago and 4.5 million children are living in poverty.Business groups reacted with disappointment to Mr Hammond’s speech. Edwin Morgan, interim director general of the Institute of Directors, said: “Warm words and proposed consultations are not enough for businesses at a time when confidence is rock bottom and investment plans are eroding away, and many will find it difficult to tread water until more decisive action at the Autumn Budget.“While a ‘no deal’ would wreak certain havoc for many firms, we must also avoid being lulled into thinking an exit deal alone is a substitute for providing a real economic impetus that lowers costs, spurs productivity growth, and supports businesses as they adjust to Brexit, whatever its form. Indeed, the fact that the OBR lowered its forecast for GDP growth this year – based on a smooth exit from the EU – highlights just how much the economy is set to fall below its potential, even in a relatively benign scenario.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

What we are hearing is the biggest change in terms of trade this country has faced since the mid-19th century being imposed on this country with no consultation with business, no time to prepare,” she told the BBC’s Today programme.Theresa May has lost control of Brexit“This is no way to run a country. What we potentially are going to see is this imposition of new terms of trade at the same time as business is blocked out of its closest trading partner.”Adam Marshall, director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said abrupt changes to tariffs would be an “unwelcome shock” for businesses.“If the government were to bring these tariffs into effect on 30 March, the move would also have the potential to cede negotiating leverage in future trade talks.\u0026nbsp“While ministers have clearly listened to our arguments and maintained targeted protection in some areas, overall there has not been enough consultation, preparation or planning to support the firms and communities that could find themselves at the end of a sudden shift in tariffs. As MPs vote tonight, this is yet another reason why they must act to avoid a messy and disorderly exit from the EU on 29 March.”The government also announced there would not be any new checks or controls on goods moving from the Irish Republic\u0026nbspto Northern Ireland.Police in Ireland are concerned that\u0026nbspcould prove to be lucrative for potential smugglers and existing criminal networks in the country and across the border.Tariffs will apply to goods including beef, lamb, pork, poultry and some dairy products in an attempt to protect farmers but the NFU said this would not be enough.Irish European affairs minister\u0026nbspHelen\u0026nbspMcEntee said the move would be “absolutely disastrous for Irish agriculture”.NFU president Minette Batters said\u0026nbspit was “appalling” that farmers have only just been given the\u0026nbspopportunity to see the tariff rates –\u0026nbspa fortnight before they could come into effect.\u0026nbsp“Farmers and food businesses have no time to prepare for the implications, which will be exacerbated by the fact that we will face tariffs on our own exports on food into the EU and other countries with whom we currently enjoy free trade arrangements.\u0026nbsp“Although we are pleased to see that the government has listened to our concerns and elected to treat many agricultural sectors sensitively, which may support farmers who are already facing disastrous disruption from no deal, it is enormously worrying that some sectors will not have this protection – noticeably eggs, cereals, fruit and vegetables.\u0026nbsp“Even those sectors that are treated sensitively will, in most instances, see worrying and large reductions in the tariff rates currently charged on non-EU imports.\u0026nbsp“Furthermore, the approach taken by the government to lump products under the same high-level tariff code, for example whole carcases and high value cuts of fresh beef, means there is a high chance of market distortion for many sectors who are deemed to have been treated sensitively.”It comes after Theresa May lost a crunch vote on her Brexit deal in the Commons on Tuesday night.We’ll tell you what’s true.

In 2008, he joined Lehman Brothers on an industrial placement as part of his degree at the University of Bath. Within three months, global financial markets had spiralled into meltdown leading to the collapse of the fourth largest investment bank in the US, and battering swathes of other financial institutions beyond recognition.Tens of thousands of people lost their jobs and the global economy crumbled. Reflecting on that time, the now 30-year-old understands that he was much more fortunate than some of his older colleagues. As a bright-eyed graduate he was swiftly snapped up by one of the global investment banks that had emerged from the crash bruised but still breathing. He stayed with that organisation until 2012, when he took five months off to go travelling.“I was completely uninspired,” Rocha-Thomas, who now lives in Cambridge, says of his former employer. “The IT team I was part of was so far removed from any kind of purpose,” he adds. So when he got back to the UK, he decided to join The App Business, a start-up which helps large companies build mobile apps. At the time the company\u0026nbsphad 20 employees. In the seven years that Rocha-Thomas has been there, the workforce has ballooned to almost 200 and he feel like he\u0027s been instrumental in driving that expansion. He says it\u0027s been incredibly rewarding and has given him an immense sense of purpose.Rocha-Thomas\u0027 story is becoming increasingly common. Although graduate schemes at banks, consultancies and accounting firms for years represented a well-trodden path for many bright youngsters leaving top universities, signs have emerged that even some of the most prestigious employers are starting to lose their shine.How Lehman Brothers caused \u0027the worst financial crisis in history\u0027According to a study published last year by High Flyers, a market research company which specialises in student and graduate recruitment, employers in eight out of 13\u0026nbspkey industries and employment areas hired fewer graduates in 2017 than the year before, with the biggest drops in recruitment at the top accounting and professional services firms, and banking and financial companies.Just 9.6 per cent of all graduates surveyed applied for roles in investment banking, which represented the lowest proportion since 2009 when banks halted graduate recruitment in the wake of the global financial crisis. And over the past year, that trend is expected to have continued.\u0026nbspWhile some of the move is likely to have been driven by companies cutting their recruitment budget in the face of Brexit uncertainty and other economic pressures, experts say that increased competition from booming tech companies and entrepreneurial start-ups is also to blame.Created with Sketch.

Juergen Ziegler, chief executive for Europe, said that while Brexit was not the only factor, it has brought forward the decision to relocateSeveral studies have highlighted that young people are no longer as motivated by money as they used to be, and are increasingly prioritising a sense of purpose over pay. Start-ups are tapping into this sentiment by offering professional newbies the opportunity to have an impact from the get go – something that would ordinarily be unthinkable in a large multinational.Gian Power worked at Deutsche Bank and PwC after graduating from Aston Business School in 2014. He quit big corporate life in 2017 to set up his own company called The Lion\u0027s Club, which brings together motivational speakers on subjects around well-being, work-life-balance, and overcoming challenges to reach your full personal and professional potential.Gian PowerYouTube)“When working at PwC, my hours were long and I spent most weekends studying. It was a sacrifice I chose to make but it was hard to find time to explore my own interests and purpose,” he says. “I wanted to be my own boss, I wanted to craft a life that makes me happy and allows me to do things that bring me happiness.”Edwin Lee\u0027s experience echoes this. He interned at RBC Capital Markets before joining JP Morgan full time in 2006 in New York, and rising to the position of managing director. At the end of 2017 he resigned and joined a friend who was setting up his own company,\u0026nbspCastle Ridge Asset Management,\u0026nbspthat uses investment strategies informed by artificial intelligence.He tells The Independent that, particularly during his final few years at the Wall Street stalwart, work-life balance became “a serious issue”.“I ran the corporate trading desk which meant I was at work before the markets opened and didn\u0027t leave until the bankers were done,” he says. Lee often worked more than 15 hours a day and if calls weren\u0027t taking over his weekends and evenings then travel to London, Hong Kong and Tokyo often was. His wife had just given birth to their daughter and he felt like he was not seeing her grow up. “It had to change”.Of his current job he says that it was a “once in a lifetime opportunity” and that the autonomy was a considerable incentive. “It would be our team and our firm to build exactly as we like.”Already back in 2014, McGraw-Hill Education commissioned a survey of hundreds of US graduates which found that 73 per cent prioritised finding a job that they enjoy over one that pays well. And almost half of respondents said that they would favour a career that is beneficial to society.iStock)Lovell Corporation, a Canadian marketing company that focuses on connecting businesses with young professionals, published a research report in 2017 based on a survey of 2,000 young people, that found Generation Z – or those born between the mid-1990s and early 2000s – to be a generation of “change-makers”. These are the young people currently entering the workforce.The top career choice for that demographic in the survey was entrepreneur, with a large proportion also citing the not-for-profit sector as their top pick.“These statistics demonstrate the inclination of younger workers to seek meaningful work that fulfils their personal goals and creates impact,” the study concluded.Gian Power on meditation and motivation in the face of family tragedyOther studies have shown that the generation of people entering today\u0027s workforce is also more sensitive to issues around ersity and inclusion, and that those people are increasingly looking for a company that reflects those qualities.\u0026nbspScores of banks, professional service firms and consultancies are still marred by a reputation of being dominated by white men, and progress towards a more erse workforce is proving sluggish. Gender pay gaps are stubborn and that\u0027s spoiling the appetite of not just young women.Speaking recently at Goldman Sachs Asset Management\u0027s annual Future Leaders Conference, Ruwan Weerasekera, the chief operating officer at Softbank Investment Advisers, the manager of the massive Saudi-Japanese backed technology fund, said that almost everyone working at his company was previously at Deutsche Bank, UBS or Goldman Sachs.Softbank attracts talent, he said, by being erse, forward looking and representing an “intersection between finance and technology”. Many of the firms his company invests in are focused on social responsibility, which he says is also a big driver for a heterogeneous pool of potential hires, and is likely one of the reasons why his current employer is the only place he has worked where “white men are in the minority”.\u0026nbspDoing well by doing goodSo what are large institutions, like investment banks, doing to combat the start-up-driven brain drain? Kathleen Hughes, a partner at Goldman Sachs, tells The Independent that her firm has recognised and acknowledged the need for change to address the priorities of the next generation.“Around 60 per cent of Goldman Sachs\u0027 workforce is millennial and they have very particular values. As they start their career, they will value things like giving back and making an impact,” she says, adding that this is something Goldman has started tapping into.When Crystelle\u0026nbspPereira\u0026nbspfirst joined Goldman Sachs she felt like she was competing in \u0027both a marathon and a sprint\u0027In recent years, Goldman launched what it calls the Analyst Impact Fund which provides an annual opportunity for the most junior workers to pitch their cases to invest in non-profit organisations they deem to be most worthy. A sizeable grant from the firm is then allocated to the winning organisation. “Giving back is important,” says Hughes, “and that\u0027s what we\u0027re addressing.”Acknowledging issues around work-life-balance and presenteeism is also high up on Hughes\u0027 list of priorities. She says that technology has represented a sea-change for the better in that flexible working is now an integral part of company culture.And the initiatives seem to be resonating where it matters. Arianna Roccio, a recent graduate who has been at Goldman Sachs for three years, says that flexibility has evolved dramatically even in the short time that she has been at the company. “It\u0027s not really about face time in the way you might think,” she says.propsects to entice employees\u0026nbsp(Getty)Crystelle Pereira, another recent graduate who works at Goldman, says that when she first joined she felt like she was competing in “both a marathon and a sprint”. Since then, however, the dialogue between graduates and their managers has improved, “especially around the importance of balance and downtime”.Other banks have also implemented measures to sweeten career prospects for potential employees and tune into the zeitgeist.\u0026nbspChuck Teixeira, chief administrative officer and head of transformation at HSBC\u0027s global banking and markets ision, tells The Independent that his company has had to “completely change our approach”.Forget Brexit. We might be approaching another global recessionCould a no-deal Brexit hit the economy sooner than we think?Political tensions in Europe could lead to a serious economic slowdownHe says that they\u0027ve recently launched internship and graduate programmes, in which new professionals are introduced to careers in data science and engineering – areas not traditionally associated with banking.“To attract talent to these programmes, we have had to get on campus face-to-face, run meet-ups and hackathons where engineers and data scientists work together to rapidly prototype products,” he explains. “We realise that HSBC is not front-of-mind for these capabilities so we are reaching out to the global market and positioning ourselves differently, including targeting talent in other industries,” he adds.\u0026nbspFkexible working needs to be intergal to company culture (GettyiStock)Will Rocha-Thomas, who these days serves on his company\u0027s team that is responsible for hiring and retaining talent, is also encouraged by the progress. But he says that large firms still have their work cut out for them, and it\u0027s not always straightforward for the entrepreneurial start-ups either.Finally, he says that another simple thing that many large and small firms are still getting wrong, is that they are not taking action in response to feedback.\u0026nbsp“This sounds obvious but it’s a struggle for many big, centralised companies where making a simple change is a huge endeavour,” he says. “When people feel unhappy about something, and feel like there’s nothing they can do to change it – even if they give honest feedback – they generally quit,” he adds.Former JP Morgan managing director Edwin Lee agrees. While he admits that there are a lot of things\u0026nbsplarge institutions are able to do to improve the satisfaction and work-life balance of staff, the shift has to first occur in the fundamental, cultural DNA of the firm. Only then can practical changes be implemented. And that\u0027s where he sees the hurdle.He says that measures like paid leave, flexible working arrangements, sabbaticals or even mobility opportunities – that are frequently a given at start-ups and newer tech companies – are still often at odds with managers\u0027 immediate objectives. Those, in turn, often centre around short-term goals and the next earnings report.So perhaps the first step is to simply expand the horizon: teach managers that change happens gradually and that the long-term satisfaction of employees is as critical to the long-term health of the firm as the next quarter\u0027s profit is. Delving into the unknown is always scary, but once you\u0027re in, the opportunities might just surprise you positively.We’ll tell you what’s true.

No deferral looks likely and the accompanying Written Ministerial Statement refers to a consultation on the detailed design and implementation.”Large companies taking advantage of smaller ones by taking months to make payments will also face tougher rules. Big firms will have to review and report on their payment practices annually in the first step of a crackdown.The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) cheered the move aimed at\u0026nbsppreventing\u0026nbspthe “rife and pernicious” practice.“The UK’s late payment crisis destroys thousands of businesses every year,” said FSB national chairman Mike Cherry.\u0026nbsp“The commitment from the chancellor that the business secretary will see this through is welcome, and we are especially pleased that the first measure has been announced – to make a non-executive director responsible for the supply chain through the audit Committee of every large business, and to report back through the Annual Report on their progress.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

It is damaging our economy and it is damaging our standing and reputation in the world,” he said.Mr Hammond, who has hinted he could resign if the UK crashes out of the EU, told the Commons that MPs have the choice to remove the threat of an “imminent no-deal exit”.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of no-deal Brexit Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass715 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass715 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersMPs\u0026nbsphave the chance to map out the way forward to a deal that can be collectively supported, Mr Hammond said.“We have huge opportunities ahead of us he said,” praising\u0026nbspBritain’s universities and technology companies.“We are the fifth largest economy in the world, a proud successful outward-looking nation\u0026nbspwith no boundaries to what we can achieve”.But he warned that\u0026nbsp“leaving with no deal would mean significant disruption... and a smaller and less prosperous economy in the long term than if we leave with a deal.”He made clear that if there was a Brexit deal, he would spend some of the £26.6bn “headroom” he expects to have in the Autumn Budget.\u0026nbspHowever if no deal is voted through he implied that the money would disappear due to a big hit to the economy.Delivering some good news for the chancellor, the Office for Budget responsibility revised up its forecast for wage growth to 3 per cent and Mr Hammond said another 600,000 jobs would be created by 2023.But shadow chancellor John McDonnell attacked\u0026nbspthe chancellor’s record on the economy, jobs and wages.\u0026nbspThe government had broken\u0026nbspthe “historic link between securing a job and taking yourself out of poverty”, he said.The Conservatives have\u0026nbspcreated a “large-scale jobs market of low pay, long hours and precarious work”, he said, adding that average wages are still below where they were ten years ago and 4.5 million children are living in poverty.Business groups reacted with disappointment to Mr Hammond’s speech. Edwin Morgan, interim director general of the Institute of Directors, said: “Warm words and proposed consultations are not enough for businesses at a time when confidence is rock bottom and investment plans are eroding away, and many will find it difficult to tread water until more decisive action at the Autumn Budget.“While a ‘no deal’ would wreak certain havoc for many firms, we must also avoid being lulled into thinking an exit deal alone is a substitute for providing a real economic impetus that lowers costs, spurs productivity growth, and supports businesses as they adjust to Brexit, whatever its form. Indeed, the fact that the OBR lowered its forecast for GDP growth this year – based on a smooth exit from the EU – highlights just how much the economy is set to fall below its potential, even in a relatively benign scenario.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

What we are hearing is the biggest change in terms of trade this country has faced since the mid-19th century being imposed on this country with no consultation with business, no time to prepare,” she told the BBC’s Today programme.Theresa May has lost control of Brexit“This is no way to run a country. What we potentially are going to see is this imposition of new terms of trade at the same time as business is blocked out of its closest trading partner.”Adam Marshall, director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said abrupt changes to tariffs would be an “unwelcome shock” for businesses.“If the government were to bring these tariffs into effect on 30 March, the move would also have the potential to cede negotiating leverage in future trade talks.\u0026nbsp“While ministers have clearly listened to our arguments and maintained targeted protection in some areas, overall there has not been enough consultation, preparation or planning to support the firms and communities that could find themselves at the end of a sudden shift in tariffs. As MPs vote tonight, this is yet another reason why they must act to avoid a messy and disorderly exit from the EU on 29 March.”The government also announced there would not be any new checks or controls on goods moving from the Irish Republic\u0026nbspto Northern Ireland.Police in Ireland are concerned that\u0026nbspcould prove to be lucrative for potential smugglers and existing criminal networks in the country and across the border.Tariffs will apply to goods including beef, lamb, pork, poultry and some dairy products in an attempt to protect farmers but the NFU said this would not be enough.Irish European affairs minister\u0026nbspHelen\u0026nbspMcEntee said the move would be “absolutely disastrous for Irish agriculture”.NFU president Minette Batters said\u0026nbspit was “appalling” that farmers have only just been given the\u0026nbspopportunity to see the tariff rates –\u0026nbspa fortnight before they could come into effect.\u0026nbsp“Farmers and food businesses have no time to prepare for the implications, which will be exacerbated by the fact that we will face tariffs on our own exports on food into the EU and other countries with whom we currently enjoy free trade arrangements.\u0026nbsp“Although we are pleased to see that the government has listened to our concerns and elected to treat many agricultural sectors sensitively, which may support farmers who are already facing disastrous disruption from no deal, it is enormously worrying that some sectors will not have this protection – noticeably eggs, cereals, fruit and vegetables.\u0026nbsp“Even those sectors that are treated sensitively will, in most instances, see worrying and large reductions in the tariff rates currently charged on non-EU imports.\u0026nbsp“Furthermore, the approach taken by the government to lump products under the same high-level tariff code, for example whole carcases and high value cuts of fresh beef, means there is a high chance of market distortion for many sectors who are deemed to have been treated sensitively.”It comes after Theresa May lost a crunch vote on her Brexit deal in the Commons on Tuesday night.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The pound slipped to $1.30 and €1.16 after Mr Cox released his legal assessment ahead of an appearance in parliament.The falls more than erased previous gains made by the British currency on Monday after Ms May claimed to have secured “legally binding” assurances from the EU that that the backstop could not continue indefinitely.Sterling had rallied towards a 22-month high of\u0026nbsp€1.18 on Monday night,\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspapproached the $1.33 mark against\u0026nbspthe dollar.But Mr Cox’s statement that the UK would still need EU agreement to be released from\u0026nbspthe backstop triggered\u0026nbspa sharp sell-off of the pound.In his official legal advice, Mr Cox wrote that if both sides deploy ”the necessary diligence, flexibility and goodwill” that both sides are now legally bound to show, it would be “highly unlikely” that the backstop would come into play. But he went on: “However, the legal risk remains unchanged that if through no such demonstrable failure of either party, but simply because of intractable differences, that situation does arise, the United Kingdom would have, at least while the fundamental circumstances remained the same, no internationally lawful means of exiting the Protocol’s arrangements, save by agreement.”The advice makes it extremely unlikely that Ms May’s Brexit deal will be voted through by MPs, and means leaving the EU with no deal would remain a possibility.Crashing out of the EU with no deal would likely cause a significant reduction in the purchasing power of the pound as investors become more pessimistic about the future of the UK economy.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot, interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still inspires. HO242 The Wings of the Dove (1997)Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn’t topped Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a leading role the masquerade of her and Linus Roache\u0027s motives makes the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart out at the end. PSJapanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki\u0027s films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually). But there\u0027s meat to their bones for adults to digest, especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki\u0027s fascination with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s unparalleled. HOLuis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this 16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage, which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PSYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HOYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film.

But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HO742 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman’s beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland’s lugubrious health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PSWes Anderson\u0027s meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making one last attempt at redemption. With a who’s who of Hollywood in support, it’s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as family life itself. HO942 Lawrence of Arabia (1962)David Lean’s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles – notably the attack on Aqaba – with psychological insight into the toll that the war took on Lawrence’s mind. The white-led casting of Arab characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HOA devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica’s neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job – but it requires a bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in compassion and empathy. HOSpanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HOOriginally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point: one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the best sci-fi production design ever. PSPauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HOIf we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO1542 Days of Heaven (1978)Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PSThe problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u0027s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll ever see. PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth. HOClaudette Colbert\u0027s eloping heiress and Clark Gable\u0027s hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra\u0027s evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that\u0027s one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert\u0027s skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable\u0027s smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2742 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2842 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2942 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3342 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO3442 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)The erging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u0027s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PSThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HOStraight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PSOrson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HOThe Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PSIs it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it\u0027s a paean of sorts to Woody Allen\u0027s early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (I\u0027ll have what she\u0027s having). It\u0027s still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan\u0027s careers. Toy Story revolutionised animation Up and Wall-E vie for the best opening of any film this century, but for sheer audacity Pete Docter’s head-trip must prevail. As a little girl struggles to adapt following a family move across country, her emotions go on a madcap adventure through the mind itself. What’s dazzling here is that two completely separate films unfold at once. Kids watch brightly coloured sprites on a quest adults watch a psychologically dense depiction of how we think and feel. It’s wonderful.Disinterred from a script Tarantino wrote in the mid-Eighties called The Open Road – the same screenplay that also spawned Natural Born Killers – Tony Scott\u0027s True Romance is a pulpy, hyperviolent twist on a damsel-in-distress fairytale, with a plinky-plonky score that is based on Badlands. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the lovers on the lam, chased by Christopher Walken\u0027s suave mafioso. Bombastic, brash – and totally brilliant. 142 Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)With this update and upgrade of the 1930s serial adventure, Steven Spielberg turns what could have been pastiche into a practically perfect film. Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores.

HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u0027s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll ever see. PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth. HOClaudette Colbert\u0027s eloping heiress and Clark Gable\u0027s hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra\u0027s evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that\u0027s one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert\u0027s skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable\u0027s smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2742 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2842 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2942 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3342 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO3442 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)The erging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u0027s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PSThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HOStraight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PSOrson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HOThe Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PSIs it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it\u0027s a paean of sorts to Woody Allen\u0027s early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (I\u0027ll have what she\u0027s having). It\u0027s still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan\u0027s careers. Toy Story revolutionised animation Up and Wall-E vie for the best opening of any film this century, but for sheer audacity Pete Docter’s head-trip must prevail. As a little girl struggles to adapt following a family move across country, her emotions go on a madcap adventure through the mind itself. What’s dazzling here is that two completely separate films unfold at once. Kids watch brightly coloured sprites on a quest adults watch a psychologically dense depiction of how we think and feel. It’s wonderful.Disinterred from a script Tarantino wrote in the mid-Eighties called The Open Road – the same screenplay that also spawned Natural Born Killers – Tony Scott\u0027s True Romance is a pulpy, hyperviolent twist on a damsel-in-distress fairytale, with a plinky-plonky score that is based on Badlands. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the lovers on the lam, chased by Christopher Walken\u0027s suave mafioso. Bombastic, brash – and totally brilliant. “To have the added privilege of hearing Chris’s insights firsthand makes this a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We’re going to keep fighting for better education and work to destigmatise periods.”According to children’s charity Plan International UK, almost half the\u0026nbspgirls in the UK have missed an entire day of school because of their period and one in 10 women aged between 14 and 21 are unable to afford sanitary products.Schoolgirls should get free period products, activists tell governmentAnna Miles and Gemma Abbott\u0026nbspfrom the Red Box Project\u0026nbsppaid tribute to the “huge commitment of our coordinators on the ground” and the “unstoppable energy of many activists” for helping the #FreePeriods campaign succeed.“We know from our work, in thousands of schools across the UK, that the need is not limited to secondary schools, but also primaries and colleges,” they said.“We hope to see further commitment from the government in meeting the needs of all students who menstruate.“No child should have to miss school because they have their period and they cannot use menstrual products.”A spokesperson for the National Association of Head Teachers has described the free period product scheme as “the right thing to do”.Government launches bid to end period poverty worldwide by 2030While the National Education Union (NEU) also praised the scheme, it criticised Mr Hammond’s lack of ability to address the national school funding crisis in the Spring Statement.“The Chancellor had an opportunity today to end uncertainty for schools about budget planning. He failed,” said NEU joint general secretary Kevin Courtney.Several Twitter users have been celebrating the pledge for free sanitary products in English secondary schools.“Finally, girls won’t miss school because they don’t have pads, and girls and boys will learn about #menstruationmatters,” tweeted newsreader Anila Chowdhry.“Legendary. So many congratulations,” wrote mental health campaigner Natasha Devon.In August 2017, it was reported Scotland was to become the first country in the world to provide women with universal access to free sanitary products.A year later, the Scottish government announced free sanitary products would become available to students in schools, colleges and universities thanks to a £5.2m fund.This article was originally published on Saturday 9 March when the news of the free sanitary product scheme was announced by the Free Periods campaign group.We’ll tell you what’s true.

If you’re a creator of comic books featuring the adventures of super-powered, costumed heroes, that might be a difficult rule of thumb to apply. But perhaps not for Tom King. In Mister Miracle, from DC Comics, King and artist Mitch Gerads have created one of the most critically acclaimed graphic novels of the last year, and for the Washington-based writer, he drew on experiences that not a lot of other creators working in the field today have access to.King, 40, who was born in California, spent several years as a counter-terrorism officer for the CIA, working out in the field in Iraq and Afghanistan. It’s fascinating to think about what King saw and did, and how that later informed his writing. Obviously, I suggest, if he tells me too much about it he’ll have to kill me.\u0026nbspHe’s heard that one before, of course, probably more times than he can count. “No,” he says, with what feels like an oft-trodden out reply, “if I tell you too much about it, they’ll have to kill me.”Born to a film-writer mother in Southern California, King developed a love of storytelling and an understanding of narrative from an early age. During the 1990s he interned at the offices of the two big comics publishers, Marvel and DC. His ambition, though, was to become a lawyer\u0026nbspand he graduated from Columbia University in the year 2000, intending to follow this path. He started working for the Justice Department.And then came 11 September. Like everyone else in America, King was appalled and shocked and numbed. But he also knew he wanted to do something in response. So he went on to the CIA website and discovered that they were recruiting.“They were looking to bring in a new generation of operatives to serve in this new world,” he says. “They wanted people who were good at connecting the dots. I went in maybe hoping to get a job as an information guy, I took the psych tests, and ended up as an operations officer.”Created with Sketch.Mister Miracle: The critically acclaimed graphic novel in pictures Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Photos by DC ComicsPhotos by DC ComicsKing worked out in the field in Afghanistan and Iraq for seven years, and the exact nature of his work out there is necessarily vague. When his wife fell pregnant with their first son (they have three children now) he knew he had a difficult decision to make.“The part of the job I loved was being overseas, out in the war zone, as bizarre as that might sound,” he says. “But I knew I didn’t want to do that and have a family. I didn’t want to be away from my wife and kid for a year at a time.”Returning to the US, King didn’t resume his plan to become a lawyer but instead turned to his first love, writing. But he wasn’t back in the world of comic books just yet… or at least, not quite. King wrote a prose novel, but about superheroes. A Once-Crowded Sky was published in 2012, to good notices. Writing about superheroes had regalvanised his love of comics\u0026nbspand opened the door for him to work at DC.His first gig was a series about Dick Grayson, the original Batman side-kick Robin who grew up and adopted a new persona, Nightwing. Co-written with Tim Seeley with art by Mikel Jannen, the series was the first time that King was able to draw on his CIA past, as the character quit the superhero business to become a spy.That led to more work, and to the series that first brought King to wider notice – and his first collaboration with Mitch Gerads, his Mister Miracle co-creator. Published in late 2015, The Sheriff of Babylon was a critically-acclaimed crime series about a San Diego cop who becomes a military consultant in Iraq\u0026nbspand has to solve the murder of a young local police trainee.More work followed, with King getting to write characters both classic and obscure, from Batman to the Omega Men for DC, and the Vision (the character played by Paul Bettany in The Avengers movies) for Marvel.Which led to King and Gerads working together again on what has become one of the most well-received comic books in recent years, earning plaudits from mainstream reviewers and publications especially… Mister Miracle.Mister Miracle is a character who was first introduced in 1971, created by the towering genius that was Jack Kirby for DC comics. Real name Scott Free (ouch. But it was the 1970s, and King and Gerads do a fine job of contextualising that), Mister Miracle is billed as a “super escape artist”, Houdini in a cape and mask and yellow, green and red livery. He’s always been one of those B-List characters, except to the most devoted fans, in terms of recognisability.But in an age where, thanks to the big comics companies mining their intellectual properties and breathing fresh life and mainstream appeal into characters formerly known only to the cognoscenti – s of the Galaxy, anyone? Ant-Man? Black Panther? Aquaman? Suicide Squad? – even the non-rabid comics fan seems more willing to accept stories featuring characters who aren’t Superman, Batman, Captain America or Spider-Man.DC cancels comic where Jesus learns from superhero after backlash Still, a super escape artist in a garish costume. Possibly limited scope there for anything beyond a series of set-piece daring feats, you might think. Which is possibly why Mister Miracle won so much praise by being one of the most literary and absorbing stories released by DC in some years.It opens with a shocking image… the titular character slumped on his bathroom floor, wrists cut and bleeding out over the tiles. Yes, it begins with a superhero attempting to commit suicide.“Scott Free can escape from anything,” says King. “So we thought… he’s going to keep pushing it, trying to escape from more and more difficult situations. And eventually he thinks, can I escape from death?”King and Gerads had wanted to work on another big series after the Sheriff of Babylon, and initially they pitched an idea for a Batman comic but focussing on two big villains, the Joker and the Riddler. However, the characters were already earmarked for a storyline in the main Batman comic, so it was vetoed. DC, however, threw them another option.Gerads says, “I got a call from Tom and he told me that we couldn’t do the Batman story. He said what would your second choice be, and straight away I said Mister Miracle.” Gerads pauses. “That’s absolutely true. And Tom said, well, that’s what they’ve offered us. And he sent me the pitch and the first line was, ‘Mister Miracle attempts suicide’.”Starting from that dark place, the story then expands out into an exploration of, really, the anxieties of living in the modern era. Scott Free is married to the unlikely-named Big Barda, and they are attempting to navigate the mores of family life in present-day Los Angeles. But Scott and Barda are also not of this Earth.Original Mister Miracle creator Jack Kirby dreamed up for DC comics in the 1970s a series of books that became known as the Fourth World, existing within the normal DC continuity of Batman and Wonder Woman, but also slightly apart from it. It focussed on two worlds, New Genesis, where the benevolent New Gods lived, and Apokolips, brutal realm of the tyrannical Darkseid. New Genesis and Apokolips are perpetually at war, and in a bid to broker peace, their rulers Darkseid and the Highfather agree to swap infant sons. Scott Free is the child of New Genesis, brought up in the hellish Apokolips, where he learns his craft and meets Barda, one of the fearsome Female Furies. Together they escape, and make a new life on Earth, but are called back into the war, which is where we find them in this story.Mister Miracle was originally released as a 12-issue monthly series, and has just now been collected into a single volume. But it was always meant to be read as a graphic novel. King says, “It’s like a Dickens novel, which were originally serialised. It’s meant to be read as one story.” He pauses. “Not that I’m comparing myself to Dickens, obviously.”The story is a mix of domestic life and the horrors of war. In one memorable scene, Scott and Barda fight their way over several pages through the terrors of Apokolips, holding a conversation as they do about redecorating their condo flat, building up to the tender moment – delivered as each character despatches bad guys in a sequence that looks like a platform video game – that Barda reveals she is pregnant.Mister Miracle is a very personal book for both King and Gerads. The sheer exhausting nature of war comes across in several scenes, obviously drawn from King’s experiences. And Gerads’ son was born right in the middle of him working on the series, adding extra dimension to the point where Barda gives birth.It should be noted that comics are a very collaborative medium, and King and Gerads worked closely on the distinctive look of the story. The trend in comics these days is for big, break-out images, kaleidoscopic panels, imaginative layouts. With Mister Miracle, the team went for a nine-panel grid, most closely associated with the classic of the genre from 30 years ago, Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons’ Watchmen.That’s perhaps informed the mainstream success of Mister Miracle. It might be an odd thing to say, but reading comics is a learned skill, and not everybody gets on with the medium. A strict page design allows for easier digesting of the narrative. Gerads says, “Some people in comics think doing a grid like this must be very constricting for the artist, but that’s not the case. The magic with this is that you know exactly how the reader is going to read your page.”King likens it to “almost like three Charlie Brown cartoons on each page, three panels each, and everybody knows how to read those”.Aside from being a meditation on war and a domestic drama with dialogue that would satisfy any Netflix drama binge-watcher, there’s also a bigger storyline at play in Mister Miracle. To wit, is any of it actually happening? Is it all, in fact, the dream of a superhero who’s lying on his bathroom floor, his life slowly ebbing away?“Living life is full of ambiguities,” says King, perhaps a little ambiguously himself.Gerads is more forthcoming, and points out that Scott Free is in every single scene in the story. “We never leave Scott’s side in the entire book, we go on this ride with Scott through the story. Perhaps by the end Scott realises that it doesn’t matter if it’s real or not, because one way or another this is what he’s lived through.”It was announced last year that one of DC’s next big movie projects will be based on the New Gods world, with Ava DuVernay (A Wrinkle In Time) lined up to direct. Rumours emerged in the last few weeks that Scott Free and Big Barda will actually form the central focus of the movie. Whether it will end up as an adaptation of this story, neither King nor Gerads could say, but if it does it could end up DC’s most interesting movie yet.King and Gerads are hatching another collaboration for DC, which they aren’t at liberty to discuss (though King drops the hint that there’s a clue within Mister Miracle as to what that might be) and in the meantime, King is writing for the publisher Heroes in Crisis, which deals with the post-traumatic stress disorder that could actually affect superheroes given the ongoing violence and battles they deal with on a daily basis.Does he find writing about the things he’s seen and experience during his time with the CIA cathartic? Or is it painful? Perhaps a bit of both, he says.“I think me writing about war has been more necessary than anything else,” he says. “War and the damage that war does has formed the basis for a lot of my work. I write to give my kids a better life and the best thing for me has been to draw on what I’ve done. But I think I might be ready to talk about something else, now.”Mister Miracle by Tom King and Mitch Gerads is out now and\u0026nbsppublished by DC Comics.We’ll tell you what’s true.

A charity encouraging education through photography is trying to change that, writes Will WorleyClick to followThe Independent‘I look at this place in a new way,’ says Victor, 12There is little expensive technology flaunted on the streets of Kibera, a slum in Nairobi, Kenya, often called the largest informal settlement in Africa.\u0026nbspSo it is a disorientating sight to see children gathering in the corner of a ramshackle bus terminal on the slum’s outskirts, clutching a disparate\u0026nbspcollection of flashy cameras, ranging from DSLRs to GoPros, as well as the occasional e-tablet.\u0026nbspThe children of this juxtaposed scene are students of the Inua Mimi Rescue Centre, a local space dedicated to caring for some of the most disadvantaged children in Kibera. The cameras they hold have been donated by iniduals and manufacturers, and are distributed among the kids by Photostart, a growing charity that aims to teach children life skills through photography.Children living in Kibera – and other sub-Saharan African slums – grow up in an environment tough beyond the comprehension of most westerners. While there is some local praise for the area’s erse community and lively atmosphere, poverty runs deep and many people live on less than a pound a day. There are few services, infrastructure is dire and planning is almost non-existent, particularly in the poorest area known as “Chocolate City”, after its muddy paths.Kenyan youth in general face significant challenges. Only 32 per cent\u0026nbsphave finished secondary school or have some vocational training, and there is little prospect of stable work – only 5 per cent\u0026nbspof Kenyan youth were in formal employment last year, according to research by Well Told Story, a development communications group. Circumstances are even tougher for those from Kibera, who say they are often tarnished by their association with the area, which has a reputation for crime and political violence.\u0026nbspHow one Kenyan woman escaped FGM and saved thousands more from the cutBut when its youth are given the chance and resources to prove themselves, they flourish. Photostart students have achieved far beyond what their society expected of them, and their pictures have won awards, featured in exhibitions in Nairobi’s most important cultural centres, and even been placed in The\u0026nbspNew York Times.The children’s starting point at the bus terminal is testament to the scale of their achievements. The Inua Mimi Rescue Centre, run by Shosho Pascalia Nduku for 19 years, is the closest many of its 128 children have had to a formal education. But it has been constantly beset by financial problems, meaning Shosho struggles to pay teachers and maintain the building.She gives The Independent a tour of the dilapidated classrooms, where some of the children with no other home also sleep. “My wish is God will help me find a bigger place,” she sighs. Seven classes are crammed into just three small rooms. The paint is faded and the furniture falling apart, and in one the only light is provided by a plastic drinks bottle protruding through a hole in the corrugated metal ceiling.Shosho\u0026nbspPascalia\u0026nbspNduku\u0026nbsphas run the Inua Mimi Rescue Centre for 19 years\u0026nbsp(Will Worley)“The kids are so good,” she says. “But to pay the teachers is a tricky thing, so they are always changing and they cannot be stable.”\u0026nbspThe centre has no regular sponsorship and running it is a constant struggle for Shosho, but she says it is “a dream God gave me”. When she first began her work, she says, she would sometimes find children’s bodies in piles of rubbish in the street.\u0026nbspShe houses orphans, their parents taken by HIV, who sleep\u0026nbspon rags on the floor in the centre. Some of the children lack birth documentation and don’t even officially exist, demonstrating how far removed they are from mainstream society.\u0026nbsp“I have so many kids who don’t have ID, I don’t know what to do,” says Shosho, “I talked to the government about it, but they say they are waiting for reports.”Sometimes, children with families fare little better, and Shosho says she occasionally sees children who have been sexually abused by brothers or fathers. It doesn’t take long for her to spot them, she says: “They come in the next day with a changed face.”\u0026nbspSexual and gender-based violence is a key challenge facing the youth of Kibera, according to Thomas Bwire, a local journalist who runs a community news website and focuses on health. He says: “Rape can happen within the family or in the close community. Students are also vulnerable when they go to school.”Shosho has mostly run the centre alone for the two decades it has existed, though a volunteer, Ann, is preparing spinach and potatoes for the children’s lunch during The Independent’s visit. “The way a child is behaving, you can tell if they have eaten or not,” says Shosho. “When a child is hungry, they can be sick.” Malnutrition is also known to have an impact on a child’s development and particularly educational attainment.Created with Sketch.From Cairo to Cape Town: In and out of Africa with National Geographic Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A ghostly Nuba glee club bathes in ashes to ward off evil spirits before singing at a sanda festivalKenyans trudging along a road battle clouds of ﬂying locusts.

He says this has a poor impact on their physical development and mental health. “Kids still want to play, but often they do it in ditches where there is sewage,” Bwire adds.Photostart, founded by an American, David Lehman, aims to further the children’s abilities and belief in themselves. In addition to teaching the children to use digital cameras and tablets, it also schools them in organisational skills like data entry and digital asset management – thus grounding them with an education in technology that is not available to them in their normal schooling. “There’s not much theory, lots of it is practical,” he says.\u0026nbspLehman, 35, also highlights “soft skills” Photostart encourages in the kids, like planning, preparedness, expression and building their self-confidence. It’s also key that the children are taken off the street, something Lehman reckons Photostart has done for roughly 20,000 hours across their projects in Kenya and South Africa. “If they are on the streets they are with the gangs,” he says.\u0026nbspOutside the rescue centre, the children, aged around eight into the early teens, are ready to venture into the slum. The group must wait for two young men who provide an informal security presence – their equipment is, after all, a valuable commodity.Photostart, a charity aiming to teach children life skills through photography\u0026nbsp(Will Worley)On their arrival, the children rapidly take to the streets with their cameras. Shosho, who has no classes today, joins the group as they make their way through the dust-red maze of paths that make up Kibera. As they leave their everyday lives behind them, the children’s spirits rise and excitedly, then more methodically, their view of their everyday environment alters as they document it through a lens.Dr Gil Pasternak, reader in social and political photographic cultures at De Montfort University, says photography encourages its practitioners to acquire a fresh perspective as it compels to\u0026nbspthem to go out into a new environment. “They need to make decisions: what to photograph, what angle to use, how to frame it, what to include, what to exclude,” he says.\u0026nbspThere are other benefits too. “The process of going out with camera can potentially make them aware of ersity and complexity,” Pasternak adds. “It can lead them to understand that information can be delivered in different ways and can also be manipulated.”He says this may help some children develop their critical thinking and lead them to question what is given to them as objective information and to explore further, possibly “developing their curiosity more broadly”.Lehman guides the children on the walkabout, pointing out when someone’s elbow is in the frame, or why the shutter won’t close (the timer’s on). “You can see progress in their work, especially older kids,” he says.\u0026nbspAs the children move deeper into Kibera, stray dogs, slumbering in the afternoon sun, suddenly find themselves models for an impromptu photo shoot. An open rubbish pit, smouldering and noxious, becomes the backdrop for portraits of friends posing together. Next to it lies the railway track which cuts through the slum as it links the coastal city of Mombasa to Uganda, and a view of Kibera’s expanse opens up.\u0026nbspThis railway was where Kibera began, when the British colonial government granted ethnic Nubian soldiers who served the empire land next to the tracks in the early 20th century. It used to be a wooded area – the name comes from the Nubian “Kibra”, meaning “forest”. The slum grew as more people, of all ethnic groups, migrated to the city, and the railway sustained economic activity.Inua Mimi Rescue Centre in Nairobi (Will Worley)But despite being a gateway to Nairobi for many Kenyans, Kibera has gained a reputation for political violence, which emerged along ethnic lines after elections in 2007. Election-related violence also swept through the slum in the aftermath of a disputed poll in 2017, and left its mark on the children living there.“The election was a challenge, people liked to fight,” says\u0026nbsp14-year-old orphan Abrut Wakesa, of the bloodshed, which led to the deaths of dozens people.Children often witnessed violence during this period and sometimes even subjected to it, according to Bwire, leaving them vulnerable to mental health problems. “But there are no trauma centres or counselling,” he says. “People can’t share what they saw. They are left to heal on their own.”As the children continue on their walkabout through the winding alleys and open sewage of Chocolate City, they become more animated. Objects of visual excitement, like a lone white rabbit which cautiously emerges from behind a fence, prompts a flurry of shutters.Shosho, who an hour before seemed to carry the weight of the world on her shoulders, laughs in between playing with a DSLR.“My heart is shining, I am the happiest woman,” she beams. “My kids really need this. They are the poorest of the poor.”Lehman says that an important part of the walkabouts he organises – with different groups across Nairobi – is to get the children “out of their heads and classrooms” for a little while, and to forget about their troubles.“Kids who were very shy, we now see brightness in them when we do this,” he says.Pasternak says the simple practice of being out with a camera may be conducive to improving confidence and other attributes in young photographers.\u0026nbsp“Being in a new environment, they will meet people out there, which means the photographer can learn about different perspectives, different values and different types of behaviours,” he says. “They might have not encountered these elsewhere.”\u0026nbspPasternak continues: “Encountering a range of iniduals and personalities can compel some children to learn how to talk with different types of people.\u0026nbsp“It can help them develop their expression skills and it can consequently help them develop new vocabulary, both verbal and emotional.”Pasternak adds that meeting new people and learning how best to deal with them can also “encourage them to empathise better and help them understand that not everybody is the same”.\u0026nbsp“All of these are transferable skills they can take to other areas in life,” he says.\u0026nbspWe ignore Islamist terrorism in Africa at our peril‘The city is very quiet’: Nairobi left reeling after latest attackCanadian among six suspects in court over Nairobi hotel attackNairobi attack a grim reminder of spectre of terrorism over KenyaThe “harder”\u0026nbspskills, such as inputting data into a spreadsheet, are turned into lessons that are “most assuredly shared with friend, neighbour or stranger”, says Lehman. Each walkabout is followed by a debrief, and older children often take responsibility for training younger students.\u0026nbspWhile the student’s pictures have been widely recognised within Kenya, perhaps their most valuable achievement is taking it upon themselves to share the benefits of their experiences.“Knowledge spreads fast,” Lehman says. “These students are anything but selfish about learning, they make sure their peers are keeping up, and relish showing off how much they have learned.”Locals have received the project well, and hope that it will both benefit more of their children and give the area a voice.“It’s a good platform for kids to do something different and a change in activity from the classroom,” says Jaymosh, a Kibera resident who works with another charity operating in the area. “There are a lot of untold stories in the slum.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

The pound slipped to $1.30 and €1.16 after Mr Cox released his legal assessment ahead of an appearance in parliament.The falls more than erased previous gains made by the British currency on Monday after Ms May claimed to have secured “legally binding” assurances from the EU that that the backstop could not continue indefinitely.Sterling had rallied towards a 22-month high of\u0026nbsp€1.18 on Monday night,\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspapproached the $1.33 mark against\u0026nbspthe dollar.But Mr Cox’s statement that the UK would still need EU agreement to be released from\u0026nbspthe backstop triggered\u0026nbspa sharp sell-off of the pound.In his official legal advice, Mr Cox wrote that if both sides deploy ”the necessary diligence, flexibility and goodwill” that both sides are now legally bound to show, it would be “highly unlikely” that the backstop would come into play. But he went on: “However, the legal risk remains unchanged that if through no such demonstrable failure of either party, but simply because of intractable differences, that situation does arise, the United Kingdom would have, at least while the fundamental circumstances remained the same, no internationally lawful means of exiting the Protocol’s arrangements, save by agreement.”The advice makes it extremely unlikely that Ms May’s Brexit deal will be voted through by MPs, and means leaving the EU with no deal would remain a possibility.Crashing out of the EU with no deal would likely cause a significant reduction in the purchasing power of the pound as investors become more pessimistic about the future of the UK economy.We’ll tell you what’s true.

inflict serious injuries with venomous fangsClick to followThe IndependentA new species of stiletto snake which can stab sideways and jump a distance equal to\u0026nbspits own body length has been discovered in West Africa.Three specimens were found by a team of scientists working in the rainforests of southeastern Guinea and northwestern Liberia, and were later all identified as a species previously unknown to science.The snake is from a family of vipers which have teeth protruding from the sides of their mouths, allowing them to strike prey with their venomous fangs from an unusual angle and without even opening their mouths.The group is also known as mole vipers or burrowing asps and, due to their unusual physiology, they cannot be handled as other snakes can by holding them behind the head.While most of these burrowing snakes are not venomous enough to kill a human, some are able to inflict serious tissue necrosis, which could lead to the loss of a finger or thumb.Created with Sketch.Snake charmers of Uttar Pradesh Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A snake charmer holds a cobra, which was caught in a house in a near-by

been named Branch’s stiletto snake, or Atractaspis branchi, and was named in honour of the\u0026nbspSouth African herpetologist Professor William Branch, a world-leading expert on African reptiles who died in February 2017. It was found by a team led by Dr Mark-Oliver Roedel from Berlin\u0027s Natural History Museum.The new species lives in areas of untouched rainforest and on jungle edges in the western part of the Upper Guinea forests – a threatened region renowned for its unique and erse fauna.Branch’s stiletto snake is likely endemic to this area, the scientists said.The first specimen of the new species was collected at night from a steep bank of a small rocky riverbed in a lowland evergreen rainforest in Liberia.

Then, it repeatedly struck. The team reported that it jumped distances almost as long as its entire body. The other two specimens used for the description of the species were collected from banana, manioc and coffee plantations in south-eastern Guinea, about 27km apart.“The discovery of a new and presumably endemic species of fossorial snake from the western Upper Guinea forests ... is not very surprising,” the researchers said.They added: “However, further surveys are needed to resolve the range of the new snake species, and to gather more information about its ecological needs and biological properties.”The team’s findings were published in the open-access journal Zoosystematics and Evolution.We’ll tell you what’s true.

If you see a video of a pool ball knocking into another one, for instance, and then reverse that same video, the physical processes would both make sense and it would be impossible at the level of physics to know which way around would be correct.But the universe does have one rule that goes only in one way: the second law of thermodynamics, which describes the progression from order to disorder.If you saw a video of someone breaking a perfectly arranged triangle of pool balls into a mess, for instance, then watching that backwards would obviously look nonsensical.The new experiment is like giving the pool table such a perfectly calculated kick that the balls rolled back into an orderly pyramid.The scientists found that, working with just two qubits, “time reversal” was achieved with a success rate of 85 per cent. When three qubits were involved more errors occurred, resulting in a 50 per cent success rate.The error rate is expected to drop as scientists improve the sophistication of the\u0026nbspdevices used, the researchers behind the discovery said.The experiment could have a practical application in the development of quantum computers, the scientists said.“Our algorithm could be updated and used to test programs written for quantum computers and eliminate noise and errors,” said Dr Lesovik.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

During the 2016 Brexit referendum, the countryside was seemingly covered in huge billboards, presumably placed there by farmers and landowners, urging a Leave vote.And yet now, as the outraged response from the National Farmers’ Union makes clear, agriculture seems set to be one of the biggest losers from Brexit, especially under the no-deal\u0026nbspscenario currently\u0026nbspunder discussion.Their fear, if not their earlier voting record, is easily explained.On the one hand, much of British farming is protected by the European Union’s common external tariff regime. This is basically an import tax on products such as meat, dairy products, cereals and sugar from the rest of the world, ranging up to almost 40 per cent. It has helped such business survive and prosper, in some cases, and helps to fund the common agricultural policy. From there the money is used to support farm prices and incomes.

Cheaper products from the rest of the world – Australia, Argentina, Africa, the US – would soon undercut the British equivalents, leading to lost orders, lower prices, redundancies and bankruptcies.Brands such as Weetabix or McVitie’s can source ingredients such as sugar and grain just as easily from America as, say, East Anglia. Partial government promises about future farming financial support are only of limited comfort – those subsidies may not exist for ever.Brexit plan to slash tariffs after no-deal condemned as ‘madness’On the other side, if the EU were to maintain its existing tariffs and then slap them on British agricultural exports, farmers would find themselves effectively locked out of their close European markets. The EU might also implement costly and time-consuming customs checks on perishable goods and live exports, and require certification under “rules of origin” for the likes of confectionery and frozen meals.Everything from Scottish salmon and Welsh oysters to English beef and frozen cod pie would be badly hit in such conditions.\u0026nbspSo hard Brexit\u0026nbspwould be a colossal double whammy, impoverishing already vulnerable countryside industries in a way not seen since the depression of the early 1930s. For an economist, the argument is a classic example of the consumer interest (cheaper food bought at the lowest possible prices on world markets) being set against the producer interest (maintaining farming incomes).Either way, it is probably not tactful or helpful to remind people in our rural communities that many of them voted for Brexit.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

The cutting-edge study sheds a remarkable light on the geographical origins of the Neolithic community that first constructed the ancient site.26 Three of the cremated cranial fragments used in the study Up until now, it has always been assumed that it was not possible to carry out place-of-origin tests on burned bones – but recent research at Oxford University by Belgian scientist, Dr Christophe Snoeck of the Free University of Brussels, has now discovered that the act of cremation actually crystallises a bone’s structure and prevents the crucial origin-indicating isotope evidence from being contaminated by isotopic signals in the surrounding soil.36 Aubrey Hole 7 during excavation in 2008 Although the geographically intermediate examples hint at there being a well-worn prehistoric land route between west Wales and Stonehenge, nobody yet knows exactly how the stones (and the cremated remains) were transported. Sea and land routes are both possible.46 Aubrey Hole 7 following excavation in 2008Geologically, previous research has shown that the stones (so-called bluestones or dolerite, used for the early phase of Stonehenge) also came from western Britain (in this case, the Preseli mountains in southwest Wales).

Depending on the specific feasting site, only 22 per cent came from the local region, classed as Wiltshire, Dorset, Hampshire, Sussex and Kent.The main meat consumed at these ceremonies was pork – and the new evidence, therefore, demonstrates that participants were expected to contribute pigs from their different home areas around the country.The conclusion is that Stonehenge-era Britons had some sort of “national”\u0026nbspinter-communal or pan-tribal identity, as well as presumably their local tribal or clan ones. In that sense, the mega-feasts may well have represented the birth of Britain as a cultural or even geopolitical or ideological concept. However, what is not known is whether any such potential concept continued through time – or was, more likely, merely transitory.Archaeologists discover long-lost tools used to build StonehengeMost of the isotopic and faunal research on the 131 prehistoric pigs, funded by the British Academy and the Natural Environment Research Council and published in the US-based publication Science Advances, has been carried out by Dr Richard Madgwick of Cardiff University, Dr Angela Lamb and Professor Jane Evans, both from the British Geological Survey, and Professor Umberto Albarella of the University of Sheffield.“Our isotopic analysis of the pigs’ teeth and bones has revealed the unexpectedly large scale of geographical interconnectedness in late Neolithic Britain,” said lead author Dr Madgwick.\u0026nbsp“It strongly suggests that key people were not merely functioning politically, ideologically\u0026nbspor ceremonially at a local or regional level, but were also playing roles on a much broader country-wide canvas.“These gatherings could be seen as the first united cultural events of our island, with people from all corners of Britain descending on the areas around Stonehenge to feast on food that had been specially reared and transported from their homes.”The feasts were held at ritual sites such as\u0026nbspDurrington Walls (near Stonehenge), Avebury, Marden (near Devizes) – all in Wiltshire – and Dorchester in Dorset, all of which were of great religious and political importance.It, therefore, strongly suggests that religious or political elites wanted and were able to gather together at a “national”\u0026nbsprather than purely local communal or tribal level.Given the religious and ritual nature of the venues, it is conceivable that at least some of the participants had societal roles that were “national”\u0026nbspin nature\u0026nbsp – similar perhaps to the pan-tribal Druid religious elite in Iron Age Britain 2,000 years later.The emergence of some sort of country-wide identity now appears to have been part of a package of new cultural and political developments that occurred at around the time the great stone circles of Stonehenge and Avebury were built.These parallel developments included truly monumental architecture with\u0026nbspsome ceremonial centres 30 times the size of Stonehenge\u0026nbspa new pottery style\u0026nbspceremonial feasting on a vast scale and a partial change from beef to pork consumption.Across Britain, scores of new ceremonial centres were built – for rituals and probably also for feasting. Certainly in southern Britain, these new monuments\u0026nbspand their ritual feasting function\u0026nbspappear to have driven up demand for meat.Because pigs breed\u0026nbspand grow much faster than cattle, they are capable of rapidly producing substantially greater quantities of edible biomass. As such, it is likely that the creation of huge monuments such as Stonehenge and Avebury and other “henges”\u0026nbspacross the country\u0026nbspchanged eating traditions and thus also the agricultural economy.However, the discovery that pigs were being brought from all over Britain to be eaten at vast inter-communal national\u0026nbspceremonies in southern England raises additional questions – especially regarding how the animals were transported over such distances.The archaeological evidence suggests that they were brought to the mega-feasts while still alive.Herding pigs for long distances is a difficult, if not impossible, task – and the animals would certainly have been thin (and not ideal for feasting on), if they had been forced to walk hundreds of miles.It is more likely, therefore, that the pigs were either carried on litters, as most were under a year old,\u0026nbspor transported along rivers or coastally by boat.In some civilisations in other parts of the world, animals, especially those earmarked for sacrifice during ceremonial feasts, were regarded as ritually important or even sacred, and it is conceivable that the pigs brought from all over Britain for these pan-tribal ceremonies were treated with great care and respect prior to slaughter.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The recent scientific analysis of the Stonehenge cremated bones (that appear to have been buried adjacent to the newly re-erected stones) is now helping to reveal the origins of the community, which appears to have actually built the earliest version of the monument.The ever-increasing body of evidence suggesting Stonehenge and the original Stonehenge community’s western British origins has substantial implications for our understanding of British prehistory.Scientists know the Stonehenge early phase standing stones (known as “bluestones”, rather than the later more famous and much larger “sarsen” stones) come from this and other Pembrokeshire prehistoric quarries – because of chemical identification tests they have carried out on the rocks.So far, only two quarries have been identified – both on the northern slopes of the Preseli Hills in Pembrokeshire, southwest Wales – but geologists, who have studied the Stonehenge bluestones, think it is likely there were at least three or four other quarries that have yet to be found.The discovery of the tools is likely to rekindle one of archaeology’s biggest debates – how did the builders of Stonehenge transport the bluestones (an estimated 79 of them, each weighing approximately 2 tons) from southwest Wales to Salisbury Plain.There are three major potential methods – by land, by land and river, and by sea and land andor river.Stonehenge celebrates 100 years since site was gifted to nationThe most practical way would have been predominantly by sea – but the most ritually, politically and ideologically impressive method would have been predominantly by land. Only very detailed future archaeological research will stand a chance of finding the route and cracking that particular mystery.In the first, more maritime\u0026nbspscenario, the stones would potentially have been moved by raft (or catamaran) down Pembrokeshire’s river Taf into the Bristol Channel and then along England’s river Avon to within 20 miles of the Salisbury Plain site earmarked for Stonehenge.In the second scenario, the stones would have had to be carried by stretcher or hauled on sledges (or possibly rollers) for long distances over often extremely challenging terrain (with only limited opportunities for river transport).This second method would certainly have had ostentatious political and ideological advantages – but it would have required vast amounts of manpower, time, effort and intertribal or interclan acquiescence.The discovery of the stone quarrying tools, which date\u0026nbspto the approximate time of the construction of the first stone phase of the monument (c 2900BC), proves\u0026nbspbeyond reasonable doubt for the first time\u0026nbspthat Neolithic people quarried the Welsh stones that ended up being used to build the world’s most famous prehistoric temple.But why did the builders of Stonehenge want to get their standing stones from 175 miles away when they could have used perfectly good local stones from Salisbury Plain?The answer is probably genealogical. Chemical\u0026nbspsignatures found in the bones of early Stonehenge people\u0026nbspsuggest many of those iniduals were originally from western Britain,\u0026nbspnot from Salisbury Plain. It is therefore conceivable that the stones of early Stonehenge were brought to Salisbury Plain from the area associated with the builders’ ancestors.Fascinatingly, in much later (medieval) Arthurian literature, the stones of Stonehenge are said to have been brought by the magician Merlin from the far west (although, in the legend, from Ireland, rather than southwest Wales).The fact that the stones were brought from Pembrokeshire to Salisbury Plain raises another key mystery. If indeed they were transported to their new home as clan or tribal heirlooms, then it suggests they already possessed great significance. And that implies the possibility that they had already functioned as a ritual monument (ie\u0026nbspas standing stones) in Wales, long before they were taken to Salisbury Plain.So the big archaeological question is whether the initial stones of Stonehenge were second hand or freshly quarried for use so far away. If the former theory is correct, then the original Stonehenge was actually in Pembrokeshire – not in England. The hunt is therefore now on for the original site of this potential Welsh proto-Stonehenge.Without doubt Salisbury Plain’s world-famous prehistoric temple still holds many secrets – but archaeological research over the coming years is likely to reveal them.British people ‘more familiar with Eiffel Tower than Stonehenge’Groundbreaking research reveals origins of people who built StonehengeThousands gather for summer solstice sunrise at Stonehenge Stonehenge tunnel ‘could destroy traces of human life from Ice Age’Congestion expert warns worst Christmas jams will be at StonehengeThe discovery of the quarrying tools – published today in the British archaeological journal\u0026nbspAntiquity –\u0026nbsphas been made by a team of archaeologists and geologists from UCL, Bournemouth University, the University of Southampton, the University of the Highlands and Islands and the National Museum of Wales.Professor\u0026nbspPearson said: “What’s really exciting about these discoveries is that they take us a step closer to unlocking Stonehenge’s greatest mystery – why its stones came from so far away.“Every other Neolithic monument in Europe was built of megaliths brought from no more than 10 miles away. We’re now looking to find out just what was so special about the Preseli Hills 5,000 years ago, and whether there were any important stone circles here, built before the bluestones were moved to Stonehenge.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

The carbon signal, absorbed into the bones from the timber used in the funerary pyre, also suggests a Western or non-local origin.Geologically, previous research has shown that the stones (so-called bluestones or dolerite, used for the early phase of Stonehenge) also came from western Britain (in this case, the Preseli mountains in southwest Wales).

Now we are beginning to make tremendous progress in understanding the people and the community which built Stonehenge,” said the project’s osteologist, Christina Willis of University College London’s Institute of Archaeology.The research was carried out by archaeologists and other scientists from the University of Oxford, UCL, the Free University of Brussels, and the Museum of Natural History in Paris and is being published\u0026nbsptoday by the online\u0026nbspjournal\u0026nbspNature Scientific Reports.The ever-increasing body of evidence suggesting Stonehenge and the original Stonehenge community’s western British origins has substantial implications for our understanding of British prehistory.UCL)Firstly, it demonstrates the extremely broad geographical horizons that the builders of Stonehenge had. It shows that, despite agriculture increasingly tying people to the land, at least certain sections of society were well travelled and almost certainly had family connections spread across thousands of square miles.Secondly, it shows the lengths that prehistoric people were prepared to go to achieve seemingly non-utilitarian objectives – i.e. the realisation of spiritual or ceremonial aspirations.Thirdly, it suggests the possibility that the western origin of Stonehenge was so\u0026nbspimportant and memorable that it was celebrated across the millennia through collective memory and epic storytelling passed on across the generations. Potential evidence of this is\u0026nbspthe Arthurian story of the magician Merlin, who transports the stones of Stonehenge from the west. The\u0026nbspMerlin story describes how the stones\u0026nbspcame from Ireland – but southwest Wales is certainly close enough to Ireland, and also has\u0026nbspimportant Irish connections. The story was first written during the medieval times – but may well have had its roots in prehistoric collective memory.\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.

I know we are leaving the EU. But I think we should be friends.Accompanied by a unicorn and heart sticker, she continued: Please may I have a signed photo of you for my Europe book.As revealed on his official Instagram page, Mr Tusk responded: We will always be friends, Sophie.Last year Ivan Rogers, the former UK ambassador to the EU, claimed UK hopes of finding a technical solution to the Irish border issue was viewed in Europe as a fantasy island unicorn model.The letter generated a string of supportive comments including many who backed Sophie\u0027s appeal for friendship despite the bad-tempered continentatl\u0026nbsprelations.Well said Sophie, wrote one.

UK automotive businesses will be put at immediate risk.Parliament must reject no-deal and take it permanently off the table.Edwin Morgan, interim director general of the Institute of Directors, said: Our politicians have yet again failed to find a way to break the impasse.\u0026nbspThey are becoming adept at saying what they don\u0027t want, but it\u0027s still hard to see where the desire for compromise lies.Trade union leaders also raised concerns about the continued uncertainty.GMB leader Tim Roache said: The Government can continue to flog a dead horse, or finally choose to be honest with the public about what can realistically be achieved.He added that the only way to break the logjam is a second referendum.Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said: Two months may have passed since the last vote, but the PM\u0027s bad deal remains the same.\u0026nbspHer failure to negotiate a better deal risks a catastrophic no-deal Brexit that would crash the economy and harm public services.\u0026nbspThanks to her Government\u0027s negligence, working people are still no closer to knowing what Brexit means for them, their families, their jobs or the public services many help provide.We’ll tell you what’s true.

It’s our 10th biggest trading partner globally and the third largest of non-EU States,” he said.“We have a large trade surplus in services with Switzerland, including financial services and professional business services. So it’s important we get our future trading relationship right.”Hammond\u0027s Brexit Britain is optimistic to the point of delusionWhy are farmers suddenly so worried about a no-deal Brexit?Hammond goes rogue with challenge to May to \u0027start building consensus\u0027‘Always be friends’: Tusk shares Brexit exchange with six-year-oldShoppers are stockpiling painkillers and toilet roll ahead of BrexitThe agreement signed by Dr Fox “in many aspects differs significantly from the EU-Swiss agreements it replaces,” Lord Boswell added.The report points out that Switzerland is only the UK’s 15th largest partner in goods trade – but the 7th largest for services.“The UK has a large trade surplus in services, overwhelmingly made up of financial services (£1.95bn) and other business services (£6.5bn),” it states.Dr Fox has run into criticism because his department for international trade has struck “continuity agreements with just seven of the 69 countries and regions with which the EU has trade deals.They give businesses “a range of preferential market access opportunities”, including cheaper import tariffs and duties and more relaxed “rules of origin” requirements.The deals also deliver “enhanced market access” for services, “public procurement opportunities” and “improved protections for intellectual property”.In 2017, Dr Fox confidently predicted the deals, accounting for around 11 per cent of the UK\u0027s trade, would all be ready for “a second after midnight” on Brexit day.Roll overs with Switzerland, Chile, the Faroe Islands, Eastern and Southern Africa, Israel and the Palestinian Authority have been secured – but the deals with Japan and Turkey, for example, will not be ready, he admitted.We’ll tell you what’s true.

I don’t need to treat of them now and no ruling is required now.Mr Bercow has sought to build a reputation as a champion of backbenchers against the government and has sided with the commons in most disputes.Created with Sketch.Papers react to the Brexit vote Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch. highlights just how soon the Prime Minister\u0027s defeat has come Britain\u0027s scheduled date of departureThe Daily Mail takes aim at MPs who political editor Jason Groves claims have plunged Britain into chaos by rejecting the Prime Minister\u0027s dealThe Independent calls for a second referendum as a way forwardThe  leads with exasperation, with political editor Macer Hall writing that Brexit was hanging in the balance last nightThe Sun take the Prime Minister\u0027s croaky voice into account as it reports on last night\u0027s Brexit shamblesThe Financial Times claims that the Prime Minister\u0027s authority is in shreds and reports on the fall in the pound in the wake of the voteThe Daily  calls the Prime Minister\u0027s defeat humiliating and claims that a delay to Brexit is likelyThe i claims that parliament is out of controlThe Times claims that Britain is in crisis and that the Prime Minister may face resignation callsThe Daily Mirror says that the Prime Minister surrenders in reference to the likelihood of Brexit being delayed after the vote  highlights just how soon the Prime Minister\u0027s defeat has come Britain\u0027s scheduled date of departureThe Daily Mail takes aim at MPs who political editor Jason Groves claims have plunged Britain into chaos by rejecting the Prime Minister\u0027s dealThe Independent calls for a second referendum as a way forwardThe  leads with exasperation, with political editor Macer Hall writing that Brexit was hanging in the balance last nightThe Sun take the Prime Minister\u0027s croaky voice into account as it reports on last night\u0027s Brexit shamblesThe Financial Times claims that the Prime Minister\u0027s authority is in shreds and reports on the fall in the pound in the wake of the voteThe Daily  calls the Prime Minister\u0027s defeat humiliating and claims that a delay to Brexit is likelyThe i claims that parliament is out of controlThe Times claims that Britain is in crisis and that the Prime Minister may face resignation callsThe Daily Mirror says that the Prime Minister surrenders in reference to the likelihood of Brexit being delayed after the vote In the past, he has even gone against the advice of expert commons clerks, using his authority to overrule them and allow a government motion to be amended by backbenchers – something which ultimately gave MPs more control of the Brexit process.On repeat votes, the handbook for parliamentary procedure Erskine May\u0026nbspsays: “A motion or an amendment which is the same, in substance, as a question which has been decided during a session may not be brought forward again during that same session.”Government ministers are aware of the potential stumbling block to Ms May staging a third vote on her deal, but believe they have a right to try and “disapply” any disadvantageous ruling – though it would require them to win a vote on it in the commons.Ms May lost the first meaningful vote on her Brexit deal by 230 votes, and then again by a smaller but nonetheless historically large margin on Tuesday night.Bercow makes unusual noise in House of CommonsAsked after the most recent defeat whether the government would consider bringing back Ms May’s deal for a further vote, the prime minister’s spokesman indicated it was possible.Cabinet minister Alun Cairns went further saying that the second defeat for Ms May’s negotiated settlement was not “the end of the deal” and that there was still “everything to play for”.We’ll tell you what’s true.

He makes clear that other signatories can move the amendment later this evening.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspSir Keir Starmer - the shadow Brexit secretary - is now responding to Gove. He says it is a serious debate, and one that is long overdue.\u0026nbspHe adds he wanted to see the mantra of my deal or no deal... dead and buried in the vote later this evening.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHe said: On this side of the House we have never accepted there should be a binary choice between the Prime Minister\u0027s deal or no deal. Between very bad or even worse is not a meaningful choice and it would be a very sorry end to the negotiations.Yesterday the House overwhelmingly voted to reject the first of those options, the Prime Minister\u0027s deal. Today we have the chance to reject the second and we should do so with as big a majority as possible.The mantra of \u0027my deal or no deal\u0027 needs to be dead and buried tonight.During the debate, Gove warns there could be a real risk of direct rule for Northern Ireland under a no-deal scenario - considering there has been no functioning executive in the country for the last two years.\u0026nbspThe environment secretary confirms that the prime minister\u0027s motion does not take no deal off the table - as the default position, in law, as it stands is to leave the European Union on 29 March.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAnna Soubry - the new Independent Group MP and ex Conservative - says this admission means MPs are not being given what they asked for.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOn a no-deal scenario, Gove adds the country would endure and pays tribute to civil servants working around the clock to prepare for such a situation.Environment secretary Michael Gove is now opening the debate on no deal - just hours before MPs vote on the scenario. He starts off with a somewhat gushing tribute to the prime minister who always puts country first.\u0026nbspShe has throughout this process shown fortitude, tenacity, thoughtfulness, diligence and above all an unselfish and unstinting patriotism.\u0026nbspDue to a sore throat which is causing her problems with her voice, Theresa May has not opened the debate as\u0026nbspplanned.In perhaps\u0026nbspthe most unsurprising\u0026nbspannouncement of the chancellor\u0027s statement, he says he will be voting against a no-deal scenario.Responding to the Spring Statement, Edwin Morgan, interim director general of the Institute of Directors, says:“Warm words and proposed consultations are not enough for businesses at a time when confidence is rock bottom and investment plans are eroding away, and many will find it difficult to tread water until more decisive action at the Autumn Budget.\u0026nbsp“While a ‘no deal’ would wreak certain havoc for many firms, we must also avoid being lulled into thinking an exit deal alone is a substitute for providing a real economic impetus that lowers costs, spurs productivity growth, and supports businesses as they adjust to Brexit, whatever its form. Indeed, the fact that the OBR lowered its forecast for GDP growth this year – based on a smooth exit from the EU – highlights just how much the economy is set to fall below its potential, even in a relatively benign scenario.During his statement, the chancellor also talked about building a consensus across the House of Commons for a deal we can collectively support to press forward with Brexit.This is not exactly the government line - considering Downing Street and Theresa May have shown no sign of dropping her current agreement and rejected descriptions of it being dead.\u0026nbspInstead, Mr Hammond here appears to be calling for a cross-party consensus on a UK-EU agreement - and one that could command the support of a majority of MPs.\u0026nbspOf course is something Jeremy Corbyn has called for - and involves an agreement on a customs union. It would never be acceptable for the Conservative Eurosceptics, and if the PM went down this road, she would in all likelihood\u0026nbspsplit her party.John McDonnell attacks the government for breaking the “historic link between securing a job and taking yourself out of poverty”.This government has created a “large-scale jobs market of low pay, long hours and precarious work”, he says, adding that average wages are still below where they were ten years ago and 4.5 million children are living in poverty.​Earlier, chancellor Philip Hammond used his Spring Statement to downgrade growth forecasts and warn\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspthat uncertainty over Brexit was damaging the economy.It came after\u0026nbspministers revealed plans to scrap tariffs in the event of the UK crashing out of the\u0026nbspEuropean Union\u0026nbspwithout a deal as\u0026nbspMPs prepare to vote\u0026nbspon a\u0026nbspno-deal\u0026nbspBrexit.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of no-deal Brexit Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass715 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass715 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersWe’ll tell you what’s true.

No 10 intends to whip against any amendments, but might now be forced to concede a further free vote or face a revolt by around 20 fiercely anti-no-deal ministers.Any other problems?Yes.\u0026nbspA further Tory amendment, dubbed ‘Malthouse Compromise B’, would dump the Brexit deal yet demand a transition period – despite the EU repeatedly ruling that out as a fantasy.At a cabinet meeting this morning, several ministers called for a free vote on that as well, with the threat of resignations from the Brexiteer side if they are whipped against it.What time will the votes be?John Bercow will reveal which amendments he has selected mid-afternoon, with voting from 7pm – unless MPs demand more time, with the Spring Statement taking place first.We’ll tell you what’s true.

That was later connected to a botnet, which took control of huge numbers of household internet devices without their owners knowledge and pointed them at one part of the internet, taking them offline.Such an attack is known as a distributed denial of service attack and can quickly break large parts of the internet\u0027s infrastructure by overloading it with traffic.Because many of the world\u0027s largest internet companies rely on the same underlying infrastructure, a single point of failure can instantly cause issues across much of the web.

We are almost there.”And he’s right.In the sneering words of ex-Whitehall panjandrum John Kerr, who devised the Hotel Calornia-style check-out-but-never-leave rules for Brexit, Britain has “come to heel”.Whatever emerges from the ashes of this week’s Commons votes, nothing can conceal the humiliation this country has suffered under Theresa May’s lock-jawed leadership.The PM has tarnished one of the jewels in the British crown — respect for this once-great nation in the eyes of the world.Thanks to her, a clutch of faceless EU bureaucrats and their feckless Tory allies have shredded the UK’s reputation for statesmanship and cool diplomacy. Great Britain — the world’s fth-largest economy, nuclear power and permanent member of the UN Security Council — has been reduced to an object of international pity.Allies across the Commonwealth, America and even our erstwhile EU partnersare embarrassed to watch a great democracy grovelling before the unelected Burghers of Brussels.EvenAttorney General Geoffrey Cox s today with his famous cod-piece bulging, it’s lose-lose for Brexit.He might persuade enough Tory MPs to vote Mrs May’s botched and rebadged Chequers Deal through Parliament. But it will be at enormous cost.Barring an unlikely last- minute face-saver, Remainers have won this battle and the .million people who voted for Brexit have been comprehensively whipped.We can blame conspirators such as Tony Blair and ex-Chancellor George Osborne. We can point the finger at the BBC, Whitehall and a clutch of Cabinet plotters.We can blame the Brexiteers themselves for tripping over while stabbing each other in the back.And we can certainly blame Phil Hammond for blocking preparations for No Deal — our sole trump card in Brexit negotiations.But in the end, responsibility for this carnage lies with Mrs May. Indeed, thanks to her, Spreadsheet Phil can now bribe MPs with the £billion he saved by selling us down the river.If his chicanery succeeds, there is a remote chance Parliament will support Chequers and sign up to Brino — Brexit In Name Only. It will be a sour “victory”.History might be kind to Mrs May’s decency and her sense of public duty. But it will not ignore the catastrophic blunders which risk condemning this country to permanent vassal status.Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt correctly warns Europe has just as much to lose. “This is a moment of change in our relationship between the UK and the EU and history will judge both sides very badlywe get this wrong,” he says.“We want to remain the best of friends. That means getting this agreement through in a way that doesn’t poison our relations for many years to come.”Stubborn as she is, Mrs May must know her days as PM are numbered.Losing three babies in quick succession is an unimaginable tragedy in any circumstances.In Shamima Begum’s case it underlines the recklessness of bringing children into the world of terrorist anarchy. Nothing Home Secretary Sajid Javid could have done in the few weeks since she emerged in public is likely to have saved her innocent child.The responsibility lies entirely with Shamima and her jihadi husband, Dutchman Yago Riedijk.There is no chance of her surviving what threatens to be disastrous spring council elections.Certainly there is no question of leading the Government into the next round of EU negotiations, still less risk another general election meltdown.Countless Tory supporters will risk letting Jeremy Corbyn in rather than vote for another May-led government.There is a deal to be had with pro-Brexit MPs who are threatening to inflict a final defeat on Chequers tomorrow.The consequences are unpredictable.If she promises to go by mid-summer, they will vote for her deal. If that works, she will at least be able to claim victory of a kind.It’s a long shot.

These include a fat embolism, when fat enters the bloodstream and blocks a blood vessel.In the lungs, for example, it blocks oxygen from entering the bloodstream, while in the brain it can cause a stroke – both can be fatal.Cheap overseas clinics are contributing to a rise in deaths from having the procedure, Prof Frame, a senior consultant surgeon at Springfield Hospital, Chelmsford, said.Last year a survey of  surgeons from across the world found  patients had died from a condition called a fat embolism - where the injected fat travels to other parts of the body that it shouldnt.Most of these deaths appear to have been caused by inappropriately qualied practitioners working in non-approved facilities, including homes and garages, he added.Other post-surgery problems, such as gangrene and sepsis, can also be fatal.Sarah Hemingway, representing Elite Aftercare at the inquest, told how the firm does not directly employ the surgeons themselves, and has no formal contract with the hospital involved in the surgery.But Mr Paige explained how the companys website claims to employ the best surgeons and nurses for procedures.The inquest also heard how Ms Cambridge had been asked to fill in a patient information anaesthesia form prior to travelling for the surgery, but no direct contact was made between Elite Aftercare and her GP.A provisional post-mortem examination had previously revealed that the mum died from a fat embolism caused by a cosmetic surgical procedure.It had been reported that the beautician had been paranoid about having excess stomach weight from having children, and opted for the butt lt procedure, which involves the reshaping of the buttocks by transferring fat from other areas including the stomach and back.Reports in the aftermath of her death told how Ms Cambridge had three heart attacks during the operation, which took place on August  last year.Patients make appointments at a UK office before travelling to Turkey for the surgery.The clinic’s website claims: “Elite Aftercare aims to provide a UK standard of care.”One reality star who had surgery there said last year: “It’s not a dodgy back street clinic.“I weighed up whether to have my nose job in the UK or over there and chose Turkey.“They’re constantly checking you’re all OK. They’re not going to discharge youthey don’t think you’re fit to leave the hospital. I was fine.”During Tuesdays hearing, the coroner suggested that a three-day inquest into her death would take place in early July, focusing on the contact between Ms Cambridge and Elite Aftercare, any pre-assessments done prior to the treatment, and the procedure itself.The controversial Brazilian butt lt, made famous by US reality TV star Kim Kardashian, involves taking fat from the waist or stomach and inserting it in the buttocks.The operation takes between one and two hours and involves a tiny cannula being inserted into a mm hole to extract fat.The fat is then puried and re-injected into the buttocks.According to Elite Aftercares website, Towie stars Lauren Goodger and Amber Dowding and Geordie Shore’s Chloe Ferry, have had procedures there.Former Spurs footballer Jamie OHara also had liposuction at the same Izmir clinic last year after piling on the pounds by scoffing junk food on Celebrity Big Brother."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/dk-comp-tim-berners.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"tim berners lee how to save the world wide web","story":"It is a moment to celebrate how far we have come, but also an opportunity to reflect on how far we have yet to go.The web has become a public square, a library, a doctor’s office, a shop, a school, a design studio, an office, a cinema, a bank, and so much more.Of course, with every new feature, every new website, the ide between those who are online and those who are not increases, making it all the more imperative to make the web available for everyone.And while the web has created opportunity, given marginalised groups a voice and made our daily lives easier, it has also created opportunity for scammers, given a voice to those who spread hatred and made all kinds of crime easier to commit.Against the backdrop of news stories about how the web is misused, it is  understandable that many people feel afraid and unsurethe web is really a force for good. But given how much the web has changed in the past  years, it would be defeatist and unimaginative to assume that the web as we know it can’t be changed for the better in the next .If we give up on building a better web now, then the web will not have failed us. We will have failed the web.To tackle any problem, we must clearly outline and understand it. I broadly see three sources of dys affecting today’s web:The second category requires us to redesign systems in a way that changes incentives.And the final category calls for research to understand existing systems and model possible new ones or tweak those we already have.You can’t just blame one government, one social network or the human spirit. Simplistic narratives risk exhausting our energy as we chase the symptoms of these problems instead of focusing on their root causes. To get this right we will need to come together as a global web community.At pivotal moments, generations before us have stepped up to work together for a better future. With the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, erse groups of people have been able to agree on essential principles.With the Law of the Sea and the Outer Space Treaty, we have preserved new frontiers for the common good.Now too, as the web reshapes our world, we have a responsibility to make sure it is recognised as a human right and built for the public good. This is why the Web Foundation is working with governments, companies and citizens to build a new Contract for the Web.This contract was launched in Lisbon, Portugal, at Web Summit, bringing together a group of people who agree we need to establish clear norms, laws and standards that underpin the web.Those who support it endorse its starting principles and together are working out the specic commit-ments in each area.No one group should do this alone, and all input will be appreciated. Governments, companies and citizens are all contributing, and we aim to have a result later this year.Governments must translate laws and regulations for the digital age. They must ensure markets remain competitive, innovative and open. And they have a responsibility to protect people’s rights and freedoms online.We need open web champions within government — civil servants and elected officials who will take action when private sector interests threaten the public good and who will stand up to protect the open web.Companies must do more to ensure their pursuit of short-term profit is not at the expense of human rights, democracy, scientic fact or public safety.Platforms and products must be designed with privacy, ersity and security in mind. This year we’ve seen a number of tech employees stand up and demand better business practices. We need to encourage that spirit.And most important of all, citizens must hold companies and governments accountable for the commitments they make, and demand that both respect the web as a global community with citizens at its heart.If we don’t elect politicians who defend a free and open web,we don’t do our part to foster constructive, healthy conversations online,we continue to click consent without demanding our data rights be respected, we walk away from our responsibility to put these issues on the priority agenda of our governments.The fight for the web is one of the most important causes of our time. Today, half of the world is online. It is more urgent than ever to ensure the other half are not left behind offline, and that everyone contributes to a web that drives equality, opportunity and creativity.The Contract for the Web must not be a list of quick fixes but a process that signals a sht in how we understand our relationship with our online community.It must be clear enough to act as a guiding star for the way forward but flexible enough to adapt to the rapid pace of change in technology.It’s our journey from digital adolescence to a more mature, responsible and inclusive future.The web is for everyone and collectively we hold the power to change it. It won’t be easy. Butwe dream a little and work a lot, we can get the web we want. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

but it will be a place where successful global tech giants pay their fair share, where competition policy works in consumers’ interests, and where the public are protected from online harms.It comes after a government-ordered review published last night found competition rules of the digital market are inadequate and called for ministers to create a new competition watchdog to rule on mergers.The review - led by former Barack Obama adviser Jason Furman - ruled that the lack of regulation had allowed firms like Facebook to acquire the WhatsApp messaging  without any competition or scrutiny and had created an “unlevel playing field”.Treasury sources said Mr Hammond is keen to implement radical changes because it will force the likes of Facebook and Instagram to act swter on issues such as self-harm pictures because greater competition would allow their users to switch providers.The review also calls for the creation of a code of conduct and the strengthening of regulatory powers to tackle anti-competitive behaviour.Hard professor Jason Furman, who led the review, said: “The digital sector has created substantial benefits but these have come at the cost of increasing dominance of a few companies which is limiting competition and consumer choice and innovation.“Some say this is inevitable or even desirable.“I think the UK can do better.“The Chancellor, Philip Hammond, was right to recognise there is a better way than just continuing with the status quo.“My  is outlining a balanced proposal to give people more control over their data, give small businesses more of a chance to enter and thrive, and create more predictability for the large digital companies.“These recommendations will deliver an economic boost driven by UK tech start-ups and innovation that will give consumers greater choice and protection.”The review also recommends changes to merger rules so that the Competition and Markets Authorityis better equipped to stop mergers that are considered likely to damage future competition or consumer choice.In addition, it calls for the introduction of powers that would force large companies to open up to smaller firms by providing access to certain data, where doing so would not affect user privacy.It saidthe proposals were adopted it could help boost the economy by encouraging the development of new s alongside established names.In response, Mr Hammond said: “The UK leads the world in embracing technology and the opportunities it delivers for people.“Competition is fundamental to ensuring the market works in the interest of consumers, but we know some tech giants are still accumulating too much power, preventing smaller businesses from entering the market.“The work of Jason Furman and the expert  is invaluable in ensuring we’re at the forefront of delivering a competitive digital marketplace.“I will carefully examine the proposals put forward by the  before responding later this year, setting out how the Government will implement the changes needed to ensure our digital markets are competitive and consumers get the level of choice they deserve.”Damian Collins MP, chairman of the House of Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sportselect committee also backed calls for tighter regulation.“I welcome the publication of Professor Furman and his expert ’s report on unlocking digital competition.“Its central conclusions that digital markets only work wellthey are supported with strong pro-competition policies, corroborates a number of the findings of my committee’s report into disinformation and ‘fake news’ published in February,” he said.“It is clear that a strong code of ethics is needed to regulate online s, and I agree with the report’s conclusion that the proposed code of competitive conduct is complementary with the code of ethics suggested by my committee.“We welcome the measures put forward to tackle anti-competitive practices and bullying tactics by market leaders.“This comes at a critical moment ahead of the beginnings of regulation from Government to rein in the powers of the tech companies.“I agree with the report that common data standards, including around the treatment of inferred data, should be set.“My committee was concerned by the treatment of inferred data by large tech companies such as Facebook, and it is essential that the Government acts to protect consumers.“The report is right to highlight that United Kingdom has the opportunity to lead by example in the area of digital regulation.“With a history of fair and robust regulation, and with the largest tech sector in Europe, the UK is uniquely placed to set world-leading standards in the digital arena.“Through the formation of the International Grand Committee it has already been demonstrated that other nations are ready to work with us to tackle the plethora of challenges presented by social media s.”Later this month, a government white paper on online harms is expected to be published, which is likely to include some proposals for new regulation on social media s and internet companies.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She was like a relic from a bygone era.She had survived through periods of terrible poaching and it was a victory that her le was not ended prematurely by a snare, bullet or poisoned arrow.Tragically, ruthless poachers prize elephants like F_MU precisely because of their impressive tusks.Ivory can fetch up to £, per pound on the black market due to demand in Asia - where it is used in an array of ancient medicines.The rarity of the super-tuskers made Wills task tracking her down all the more dficult - an effort he described as like looking for a needle in a haystack.He and wildle experts from the Tsavo Trust used a spotter plane to comb the area from the skies and relayed information to Will via radio as he crossed the dusty terrain in a car.But he remembers being awestruck when he first laid eyes on his subject.He wrote: If I hadnt looked upon her with my own eyes, I might not have believed that such an elephant could exist in our world.Will needed to use one of his BeetleCams - a remote-controlled buggy with a camera mounted on it - to capture the dramatic close-up shots.He added: She always proved to be the most exceptional subject.Her temperament was gentle and calm. Sometimes she would come so close to me that I could have touched her.The snaps - taken in August  and now being published for the first time in a new book - are the last documenting the stunning animal, who died shortly after amid a crippling drought in the area.Tsavo is home to the largest elephant population in Kenya and covers about , square miles.This makes it dficult to patrol - forcing conservationists to not make F_MU more widely known in case she attracted poachers.The photos feature in a larger book of incredible photographs taken by Will called Land Of Giants - documenting the wildle in Tsava and the work of the Tsavo Trust.It contains  previously unseen black-and-white photographs taken over three expeditions of two female big tuskers - one being F_Mu - and four males, including LU, the largest of all.Will added: Photographing F_Mu was a feeling of privilege and euphoria that will stay with me forever."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Poseidon-5.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"russia secret nuclear submarine revealed 2020","story":"The so-called Poseidon strategic missiles, carrying up to  megaton warheads, will be deployed by  and could wipe out the likes of Los Angeles, according to reports.Putins military plans to deploy the weapons on the new Project  sub Belgorod - a converted nuclear-powered submarine.Russias state-owned news agency Tass, citing a Moscow defence source, claims the underwater warships could carry six of the Poseidon torpedoes.In January, Fox News reported that a former senior adviser to President Trump admitting there are “genuine concerns” about the plan.Former State Department senior adviser Christian Whiton said a blast would create a “wave - and a highly irradiated one” but because the water would absorb a lot of the energy the wave would be less damaging than getting hit by the bomb itself.A prototype doomsday craft took to the waves for the first time on Christmas Day to begin under-sea trials, Tass news agency reported.A defence source is quoted as saying: In the sea area protected from a potential enemy’s reconnaissance means, the underwater trials of the nuclear propulsion unit of the Poseidon drone are under way.The drone is said to be powered by a miniaturised nuclear reactor, which has been fitted to the rear for ocean tests.Before Christmas it was expected that development of the weapon was at an early stage and the craft was being carried by one of the Russian navys nuclear submarines as part of experimental design work rather than full-fledged sea trials at this stage, the source told Tass.Vladimir Putin revealed the existence of the state-of-the-art new weapon earlier in , and claimed it would be able to whizz through the ocean almost silently at up to  knots.Putin said: It is really fantastic. They are quiet, highly manoeuvrable and have hardly any vulnerabilities for the enemy to exploit.There is simply nothing in the world capable of withstanding them.Poseidon - originally called the Status- Oceanic Multipurpose System - got its name after a Boaty McBoatface-style public poll by Russias defence ministry.The drones will be armed with conventional weapons and a two megaton nuclear warhead with the primary purpose of destroying naval bases, according to reports in Russia.However analysts at the Pentagon - which uses the name Kanyon for the drones - are said to believe they will carry tens of megatons of explosive power.Experts have said that kind of blast under water could be enough to trigger a tsunami as powerful as the one that killed , people in Japan and knocked out the Fukushima power plant in .Rex Richardson, a physicist, told Business Insider: “A well-placed nuclear weapon of yield in the range MT to MT near a sea coast could certainly couple enough energy to equal the  tsunami, perhaps much more.”Some reports claim the resulting wave could reach ft, swamping entire cities.And there are fears it could blow ocean sediment into the air, generating a deadly radioactive dust cloud.Russias navy had previously said they hoped Poseidon would be in service by .The claimed miniature nuke reactor - said to be  times smaller that previously achieved - is the same one that allegedly powers the Burevestnik M cruise missile.That was also unveiled earlier in , part of an arsenal of advanced weapons Russia claims is capable of thwarting the most modern defences to help it win World War Three."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000475570415.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"signs dementia held back eat 150g portions mushrooms week","story":"Scientists found people who ate more than two g portions a week were half as likely to suffer mild cognitive impairment .The condition is a transition phase between normal ageing and dementia and hits memory, attention and spatial awareness.Researchers from the National University of Singapore believe a compound in mushrooms called ergothioneine could help protect the brain from ageing.A previous study found levels were lower among patients with MCI.

which theyve shown themselves unwilling to do.When setting out the next steps, May said politicians will vote tonight on whether the UK should leave the bloc without a deal or not.If they vote against a no-deal Brexit, they will vote on Thursday on whether Article , which is the legal mechanism taking the UK out of the EU, should be extended.She also said that politicians would need to decide whether they want to delay Brexit, hold a second referendum, orthey want to leave with a deal, but not this deal.Tonight, March , MPs will vote on whether the UK should leave the EU without a deal and,that falls through, on whether Brexit should be delayed.Tory MPs get a free vote on a no-deal Brexit.At pm tonight, politicians will vote on a government motion saying that parliament rejects leaving the EU without a deal on March  - but notes that leaving without a deal remains the legal default unless a deal is agreed, allowing for it to happen at a later date.But,that is also rejected, therell be yet another vote on March  on whether to delay Brexit by extending Article , probably by months.If Britain does seek a delay, it would require the agreement of all the blocs other  members.Wednesdays motion has no legal force, however, and ultimately doesnt prevent a no-deal exit.Another option is to hold a general election, which Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn previously raised the possibility of.And a second referendum may also be on the cards, after nearly a million people marched in support of a Peoples Vote, campaigning for a second referendum to be held on Brexit.Some MPs, though are keen for a binding referendum, where the result would automatically take effect.However, the BBC points out, there would need to be a new piece of legislation to make this happen, and to work out the rules, for example, who could vote.A further option is another no-confidence vote, which May has previously survived, which could be triggered by Corbyn.After months of resisting pressure within his party, Jeremy Corbyn finally said Labour would back another EU referendum after his alternative Brexit plan was defeated on February .His U-turn came after eight MPs quit the party to form the Independent Group.But Labour has now apparently pulled back from pushing for a second referendum ahead of a week of crunch votes on a Brexit deal.The party is concerned that such a move could be isive for the country.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said Labour would focus on trying to rule out a no-deal Brexit and the government’s “bad deal”.Today, ahead of the vote on whether the UK should leave the EU without a deal, Corbyn argued that May has failed, no longer has the ability to lead and must change her approach.Labours leader added: This is a rudderless Government in the face of a huge national crisis.He urged the Commons to listen to the country, including workers and EU nationals who are fearful for their futures, saying of May: She needs now to show leadership.But May said Labours proposals have also been rejected by MPs and she noted Corbyn appeared hesitant to back his own partys policy to move towards a second referendum.She added at Prime Ministers Questions: He has nothing to offer this country.Coral spokesman John Hill said that the firm has cut the odds on a general election taking place this year into -

but that would need to be unanimously agreed by all EU member states.Then there is the question of what to put on the ballot paper.If there are three questions - for example accept a negotiated Brexit deal stay in the EU or leave with no deal - then just  per cent could decide the winning option.The first referendum on EU membership took place in .Two-thirds of votersbacked the continued membership of the European Economic Community, which the UK had joined only two years before.Under Harold Wilsons leadership, the Labour Party was trying to present to the public a dferent version of EEC membership to get a better deal.The EEC was integrated into the European Union after it was created in .In June , Britain voted to leave the EU after .million people backed Leave compared to .million Remain voters."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000374460725.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"brexit blue passports delay home office","story":"The Home Office confirmed that the new blue passport design would be phased in “from late ”.But for months, Brits may be issued with either a blue or burgundy one – and will have no say on which design they get.“You will not be able to choose whether you get a burgundy or a blue passport during this time,” the Passport Office said.It insisted that all British passports should be blue from “early ”.But the decision is likely to cause uproar among Brexit and Remain-backing Brits.

Were totally f***ed.A group of Tory MPs from across the Brexit ide, including Jacob Rees-Mogg, Damian Green, Nicky Morgan and Steve Baker, have tabled an amendment to tonights vote on the so-called Malthouse compromise.Their motion calls for a post-Brexit transition period of up to three years even in a No Deal scenario, to give both sides the time to hammer out a future trade deal.Mrs May initially planned to order MPs to vote against the amendment, but changed her mind after a fiery Cabinet meeting where pro-Brexit ministers said she must leave it up to iniduals.Eventhe Malthouse plan were approved by the Commons, Brussels would be unlikely to agree a transition period without a comprehensive withdrawal agreement in place.Boris Johnson hit out at Mrs Mays decision to offer a free vote on No Deal - telling LBC: I do think that is absurd, this is a fundamental matter of Government policy.But David Cameron backed the PM, saying: Obviously, what needs to happen next is to rule out No Deal - that would be a disaster for our country - and to seek an extension, and Im sure that is what is going to happen next.\" data-credit\"\" data-sizes\"auto\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   dk-comp-graphic-pagemay-v.jpg stripallw\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" Even the Cabinet is likely to be split on the No Deal vote - with Brexiteers such as Andrea Leadsom voting in favour, while the likes of David Gauke oppose it.Chancellor Philip Hammond openly urged the PM to go for a softer Brexit deal which can win the support of other parties in an extraordinary blow to her authority.Delivering his Spring Statement this afternoon, he called for MP to remove the threat of an imminent No Deal exit hanging over our economy.Mr Hammond, an arch-Remainer, added: Tomorrow, we will have the opportunity to start to map out a way forward towards building a consensus across this house for a deal we can collectively support to exit the EU in an orderly way.In a further sign of Cabinet splits, his no at the Treasury Liz Truss said she would vote against ruling out No Deal, telling the BBC: No Deal would be better than not Brexiting.Speaking at Prime Ministers Questions, Mrs May hit out at Jeremy Corbyn for opposing her deal without saying what he wants to happen instead.She pointed out that the Labour boss has this week held back from supporting a second Brexit referendum - even though that is his partys official policy.The PM, who is battling a bad sore throat, blasted: I may not have my own voice, but I do understand the voice of the country.He doesnt agree with Government policy, he doesnt even agree with Labour party policy - he has nothing to offer this country.Mrs May is under increasing pressure from her own MPs to resign or even trigger a snap General Election.Nicky Morgan warned the Cabinet may have to confront Mrs May later this week and demand that she resign.Tory MP Daniel Kawczynski blasted today: Not only did she not campaign for Brexit, she didnt even campaign. Shes sitting on the fence and when you sit on the fence, you get splinters.I thinktheres an extension to Article  andthis intransigence goes on then of course there may be calls for a change in leadership.Aides admit the PM is closer than ever to throwing in the towel - but remains adamant she will press on with her current deal.Its still not clear whether the EU will actually grant Britain an extension to the Brexit process eventhe Commons votes to request one tomorrow."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000475670661.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"how old theresa may prime minister paid brexit","story":"With her position considerably weakened, bookmakers say the odds on May leaving her position as PM are shortening all the time. Heres what we know about the embattled Conservative Prime Minister.May, , was born in Eastbourne, Sussex on October , .She graduated from Oxford University with a geography degree in .May started her career at the Bank of England, and has worked as a financial consultant and senior adviser in International Affairs before she turned to politics.Her previous positions in Government include Home Secretary and Minister for Women and Equalities.Theresa May has been the MP for Maidenhead since , and became the first female chairman of the Conservative Party from -.Her husband Philip, who works in private equity, has been described as her secret weapon because he acts as her eyes and ear in the City.In , then Home Secretary May, revealed to the Daily Mail that she has Type  diabetes, a disease which carries risks of heart attacks and strokes.Speaking at the time, May said she carries a needle with her at all times and must inject herself with insulin at least twice a day.She said: It was a real shock and, yes, it took me a while  to come to terms with it.The diabetes doesn’t affect how I do the job or what I do. It’s just part of le... so it’s a case of head down and getting on with it.May was appointed PM on July , .Back then, the BBC said her toughness has become her political hallmark.She regularly attends St Andrews Church with her husband in Sonning, Berkshire.May supported the UK remaining in the EU during the referendum campaign but was not a prominent campaigner.Her entire premiership has been devoted to ensuring Britain has a smooth departure from the EU - but its been a rocky road.She has survived two direct threats to her leadership, one from within her Conservative Party, and one brought by opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, who tried but failed to force a general election.In November , the EUs  other countries gave their backing to her Brexit plan at a special summit in Brussels.It came after a number of cabinet resignations and calls for her to quit.The PM vowed to push with every fibre of my being hours after she pulled the trigger on a Brexiteer rebellion led by  Jacob Rees-Mogg which could spark a leadership challengeAfter the deal was approved by the EU, she made a direct appeal to the public in a letter to the nation.In her letter Mrs May said: “I will be fighting campaigning with my heart and soul to win that vote and deliver this Brexit deal for the good of the UK and all of our people.”But on December , , Mrs May cancelled the vote at the eleventh hour after realising she was sure of certain defeat.The chaotic Brexit negotiations led to her own D-Day two days later, when a critical number of MPs submitted votes of no confidence.On the night of December , an anonymous vote saw  Conservative MPs vote for her to stay, against  who voted for her to be ousted.Since then, MPs have rejected her Brexit deal for a second time - resulting in further instability at Westminster, and putting her political future in doubt.During a speech on Brexit in Grimbsy, on March , she said that months have been spent arguing about Brexit, when we could be focusing on improving our NHS, our schools and our communities.As Prime Minister, my job has been to negotiate the very best deal I could. Everyone now wants to get it done.She described the process as dragging on, but stressed that Brexit will not be a race to the bottom.May added that people voting to leave the European Union had voted for real change in our country.And it was a message to those in positions of power that for too many people working hard up and down the country, le was too hard. The Prime Minister is currently paid £,  a year, which includes the basic salary for an MP – currently set at £,.And being PM does have its perks - May gets a £, a year plush pad at No  Downing Street and free use of lavish Chequers throughout the year.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Lots of the meat is in a separate report by the Office For Budget Responsibility- the governments official independent watchdog. It will shock you to learn that the watchdogs verdict is not quite so rosy as the Chancellors big impressive speech. More importantly it may have passed you by, since MPs are holding an era-defining series of votes on Brexit. So as a public service, weve rounded up  bits of small print from the OBR that are worth reading - and got thoroughly buried by Brexit. Delaying Universal Credit will mean less transition cash is paid out to struggling families, an official government document shows.The revelation comes after managed migration of million existing benefit claimants onto the new six-in-one system was pushed back, only starting in mid-. Tory ministers launched the -month delay to ensure people wouldnt see their incomes suddenly drop when they move over. But this delay has had a consequence for other families. It means thousands more people will move to UC while the new system is still being put together - and get no transition payments at all. Thats because any existing claimant with a change in circumstances moves to UC immediately, without being able to wait for the extra cash that will be in place under managed migration. Today, the Office for Budget Responsibility revealed the delay has saved the government poundmillion in UC costs over five years. The reason for that saving was not made clear in the OBRs report. Some of it may be due to more people remaining in the old system for longer, instead of racking up costs under UC. But the OBR also explicitly said transition cash has been reduced.  Last week, Tory welfare chief Amber Rudd announced more than , pensioners will no longer face regular reviews for their disability benefits. It was hailed by the Work and Pensions Secretary as a compassionate change for thousands of people, allowing them to keep their PIP benefits without fearing theyll be taken away. But todays OBR report shows there is another reason too. According to the report, the DWP faced long-term capacity constraints from carrying out the reviews at the same time as assessing new claims, and moving people to PIP from old benefits. So the department has prioritised moving old-style claimants onto PIP, rather than processing scheduled award reviews, the OBR said. . Business investment is at its worst level since the financial crash  The OBR report says business investment is expected to fall for the second year in a row in .This is its weakest performance since the financial crisis and is due to uncertainty related to the Brexit process, the OBR said. Labour MP Clive Lewis of the anti-Brexit Best For Britain campaign said: Thats not a Britain fit for the future. Its a limping, broken Britain.Once our short-term future is saved from a clf-edge, we must then put this issue back to the public and give them the final say on what happens. . House prices are set to go into reverse  House prices are set to fall briefly into reverse, the OBR said. The dip below zero inflation is expected to happen around the end of this year - before prices pick up again. The brief dip will be good news for buyers but bad news for anyone struggling to sell a house. Despite this, though, the OBR expects house prices to soar % between  and the start of  - close to growth in household income. . Were still sitting on a poundbillion loss from the RBS bailout  The taxpayer has currently lost out by poundbillion from the RBS bailout, OBR papers show. There were pound.billion in cash outlays to the formerly stricken bank, but there have only been pound.billion in principle repayments. Overall the Treasury is down pound.billion from its ious interventions during the financial crash.

The House of Commons voted - against Theresa Mays plan - just  days after it suffered the biggest defeat in history.Understandably, people are feeling a range of emotions right now, with manly likely switching from confusion to frustration, and back again.And these feelings were perfectly encapsulated by a BBC host on television last night as she interviewed a  of MPs about what on earth is going to happen next for Britain. While grilling politician Barry Gardiner about Labours Brexit stance, Newsnight host Emily Maitlis dropped some seriously sassy side-eye.The -year-old asked the MP: If there is a general election called, which there is every likelihood could happen, what will be on your manesto  What Brexit vision will be on your manesto then  He replied: To negotiate the deal that we have set out. Maitlis couldnt stop herself from interrupting him, enquiring: Thats going to be on the leaflet   Gardiner continued: We will decide what our manesto position is as we normally do...At which point, Maitlis began shuffling her papers before glancing off to her right with a look of sheer exasperation on her face. She then began scrawling notes, which many viewers at home were desperate to have a glance at.   The MP added: It is a democratic party, as you know, it is not made up by one person on Newsnight as you know. Still seemingly unimpressed, Maitlis shot back: Well its not made up at all, people are literally pulling their hair out tonight. Following the heated exchange, the host was praised on social media for capturing the mood of the nation. One person tweeted: Emily Maitlis speaks for the nation.   Another commented: Emily Maitlis reaction here is PERFECT. A third added: Maitlis side-eye has knocked the planet off orbit. What a mood, wrote a fourth. However not everyone was impressed with the hosts behaviour, with some branding it unprofessional.  Speaking to Buzzfeed News, Maitlis joked that she hadnt been writing during the show but instead was crossing out all future dates and holiday plans.She later admitted that she had been making notes of what the guests were saying. She explained: When Im trying to process thoughts I write down what theyve just said so I can actually take it in and seeit makes sense to me.

I know we are leaving the EU, but I think we should be friends.” She then asks: “Please may I have a signed photo of you for my Europe book ” Sophie adds: “I have drawn you a unicorn.”   Open Europes Henry Newman said: This is embarrassing. What is the president of European Council doing  It is a very serious negotiation and he is playing on Instagram” Following last nights Brexit vote, Mr Tusk said: We regret the outcome of tonights vote and are disappointed that the UK Government has been unable to ensure a majority for the Withdrawal Agreement agreed by both parties in November. On the EU side we have done all that is possible to reach an agreement. Given the additional assurances provided by the EU in December, January and yesterday, it is dficult to see what more we can do. If there is a solution to the current impasse, it can only be found in London.   He added: The EU, for its part, continues to stand by the Withdrawal Agreement, including the backstop, which serves to prevent a hard border in Ireland and preserve the integrity of the single market unless and until alternative arrangements can be found. With only  days left to March , todays vote has signicantly increased the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit. We will continue our no-deal preparations and ensure that we will be readysuch a scenario arises. Should there be a UK reasoned request for an extension, the EU will consider it and decide by unanimity. The EU will expect a credible justication for a possible extension and its duration.

Because, oh my, there are a LOT of contenders for this particular crown of sh*t-dripping thorns.. David Cameron Its easy to blame Dishface, because hiding his well-covered form in his shepherds hut and having to keep a safe distance from piglets makes him an easy target.But for those who have forgotten, it is this well-polished human turd who promised, during the referendum campaign, that he would trigger Article  of the Lisbon Treaty immediatelythe vote was to Leave.The Leave campaign, on the other hand, promised it would not. But having curled it out on the national stage, Dishface made Article  a political necessity.So certain was he that Remain would win he refused to allow the civil service to prepare for Article , an act later described as an act of gross negligence for which we have been paying ever since. . Theresa May  This poor cow gets the blame for everything, despite arguably having managed the best anyone could with the be-spaffed sows ear she was gted by her predecessor. But having taken over from him a month after the referendum, she did a bunch of stupid things.She said Leave means Leave, when leaving cleanly was never possible without amputating Northern Ireland and watching it explode. Even before she lost her slim majority, she bent her knee to the extremist headbangers demanding a definitive act to cement the referendum result which was, even then, looking shakier than an alcoholic Elvis impersonator. She wrote to the EU triggering Article , setting a two-year deadline for a task that was impossible, unwinnable, and unsellable. And the courts promptly told her that was illegal because she was not a medieval monarch who ruled by ine right, and it must be approved by Parliament.. The House of Commons  Having been instructed to exert its sovereignty, the House of Commons took back control by agreeing with the PM. The entire Tory party, the DUP and % of Labour voted to trigger Article . The supporters included red and blue front benches, and the big names who have complained since about the clock which they wound up - Corbyn, Watson, Thornberry, Hammond, Johnson, Mogg.Last night, pretty much the same people voted against the best deal that could be come up with in the two-year limit they had set - like turkeys voting against veganism on Christmas Eve. Tonight, you can bet your bottom dollar the same MPs will ide into those prepared to go against the will of the people and exit WITHOUT a deal, and those who want to hit snooze on the alarm they once thought so important.. Idiots  Lets also blame - after all, why should anyone be immune  - people who voted for something they didnt understand and didnt research. Lets blame people who said worl, Norvern Ireland is fine now, innit  Lets blame the north east, the Welsh, Cornwall, car factory workers, racists, Islamophobes and everyone  who put a X in a box without realising the decision would bite them on the arse like a great white whos been on a diet since Amity Island. Except, well, every vote is like that. We dont all read all the leaflets, we dont all vote asking ourselves how this would affect Belfast or Bognor or Billericay.But this was not a normal vote. It was not legally-binding, it sold no policies, and none of us would ever vote for the importation of blood products, distemper vaccines or fissile material to be given to the sort of firm blamed for the Great KFC Chicken Shortage.. Russian trolls  Previous votes did not involve fake news, Facebook malgorithms, St Petersburg troll factories and data theft enabling direct social media advertising of absolute bollocks.Facebook was only born in  the Electoral Commission had yet to get around to outlawing some of this stuff, or requiring candidates to declare it. This enabled a free-for-all that tossed facts out of the window and capitalised on what was already an instinctive, emotional, impulse vote. They told you to vote for what you FEEL, and made you feel under attack.Oh, and on top of that, it also saw the grossest breach of campaign finance rules in British history. The only reason no-one was jailed for it and a re-vote ordered was because the referendum wasnt legally-binding. It is noticeable that, having done their utmost to make Brexit as unlikely, chaotic and damaging as possible, the Brexit campaigners are doing the most blaming. We will be waiting a while for Moneybags Mogg and What Japes Johnson to admit any responsibility for the shambles they did a lot to orchestrate.This was a vote undertaken in circumstances of insanity. The Tory party lost its purpose in a row about the French, Labour lost is way in a row about Communism, and Parliament had its teeth knocked out by Tony Blair, were handed a set of dentures by the Supreme Court, and has since devoted itself to gnawing its own feet off. Voters lost their minds arguing with each other, the internet warped like the Starship Enterprise on an LSD bender, and the pro-Brexit pot-wallopers were obnoxious, obstreperous, and obstructive.Theresa May, bless her socks, has done all she can to destroy her own premiership and thereby est herself of the filled nappy that Brexit has hung around her neck. It seems to be throttling her at present, after which we can only hope it move on to more deserving victims. Were on course for another vote, which should really thrill all those who crow about the will of the people although strangely they seem quite angry about it. Whether its a referendum or a general election, we can only hope that this time our politicians locate both butt checks, remove their craniums from within them, and find the brainpower necessary to write the legislation needed to require a minimum turnout and minimum majority. Had they done that  years ago, we wouldnt be in this purgatorial cesspit, in which chaos and indecision empty their bowels on us while two pensioners bitch about whod be best at making things worse.The politicians think the people got us into this mess, and the people blame the politicians. GroundMogg Day will only come to an end when we stop shouting and start talking about how to kill it."},{"url":null,"title":"no deal brexit vote live","story":"\"liveBlogUpdate\": [would be terribly upsetyou missed these stories.\",\"author\":[,,,],\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror news politics no-deal-brexit-vote-live-\", Mr Varadkar also said that in the event of a no-deal Brexit the European customs code will apply to goods exported from the UK to the EU.

Philip Hammond proved yet again today that he can barely hold a tune let alone recognise a popular hit. This Spring Statement was an exercise in trying to play catch up. There was additional money for the police to tackle kne crime - a rebuke to Theresa May who has claimed there is no direct link between police funding and levels of crime. The Chancellor also promised some additional funding for housebuilding, though much of this was a re-packaging of previous announcements. And there was a string of consultations on the environment presented as an example of how the Government understood the concerns of younger voters. There was no great over-arching strategy.  Instead we got the equivalent of a SWOTtest by a middle manager fearful that he may see his company car downgradedhe fails to meet his sales targets. He identied the areas voters are worried about and then did the bare minimum to buy off their concerns. The poundmilion for the police across England is a tenth of the amount cut from the politan Police alone. As John McDonnell pointed out in his response, the pledge to build more environmentally-friendly homes comes nine years after the Tories scrapped Labour’s Green Homes guarantee.

But today was the second-most important financial event of the year - the Spring Statement. Youre forgivenyou didnt know. The major update, second only to the Budget, was sandwiched between debates on Brexit that will change Britains future. And Chancellor Philip Hammond weaponised Brexit, dangling billions of funding before MPs - but threatening to swipe it all awayMPs dont agree a deal. Aside from our leaving the EU it was a bit of a damp squib. Yet despite all this, there were some announcements to take note of - and you should. Because theyll affect your le just as they wouldwe werent leaving the EU. Heres our guide to the Spring Statement at a glance.  The Chancellor announced he intends to launch a full three year spending review before the summer recess - to be concluded alongside an Autumn Budget, probably in November. It will cover areas including social care, local government, schools, police, defence, and the environment - and could finally boost spending in those areas. That is what I mean to an end to austerity - delivered by an Conservative government, he said. But it could all be scuppered by Brexit  Mr Hammond used the review as a threat - saying it depends on leaving the EU with a deal. “Last night’s vote leaves a cloud of uncertainty hanging over our economy and our most urgent task in this house is to overcome that uncertainty, he said. The progress we have made will be at riskwe cannot secure a smooth and orderly exit from the EU.  Mr Hammond warned of signicant disruption in the short term and a smaller less prosperous economy in the long termwe dont get a Brexit deal. The Chancellor warned no deal will mean higher unemployment, lower wages and higher prices in the shops. Mr Hammond told MPs: I need to be straight with the house A no-deal Brexit would deliver a signicant short- to medium-term reduction in the productive capacity of the British economy. And because our economy is operating at near full capacity, any fiscal and monetary response would have to be carefully calibrated not to simply cause inflation. An insulting poundmillion for kne crime  The Tory government has unveiled a poundmillion emergency fund for police across the country to tackle kne crime. Chancellor Philip Hammond said the funding will be made available immediately and ring-fenced for overtime and schemes such as violent crime reduction units. poundmillion is new Treasury cash and the remaining poundmillion must be found by the Home Office from existing budgets. He caved in after weeks of calls for the Tories to plunge more cash into fighting the surge in kne crime. But the fund was slammed as not good enough after years of Tory cuts that have shed , officers. Labours shadow policing minister Louise Haigh said: Our overstretched officers are already at breaking point, owed thousands of rest days and leave. It wont paper over the deep cracks in the system. Lib Dem Ed Davey tweeted: Its an insult to hard-working police  kne crime victims  their families.  Free sanitary products will be available in schools in England from this September, the government confirmed today. Chancellor Philip Hammond made the announcement in his Spring Statement in a victory for period poverty activists. Campaigners say some girls spend days offschoolbecause they are menstruating, too worried to go to lessons without a tampon or sanitary towel. He said he would fund the provision of free sanitary products in secondary schools and colleges in England from the next school year.  Chancellor Philip Hammond has today pledged to deliver , more affordable homes to tackle the UKs housing crisis. Delivering his speech the day after Theresa Mays second Brexit deal defeat, he announced plans to for a poundbillion homes guarantee scheme to support and deliver around , affordable homes. It was later claried the money is a loan guuarantee - not hard up-front cash. In the Autumn Budget , the Government set out a series of policies to raise housing supply by the end of this Parliament - bringing it to its highest level since , on track to reach , a year on average. Today he said he will unlock pound million from the Housing Infrastructure Fund - the  grant introduced to invest in new build homes - to unlock up to , more affordable homes at sites including Old Oak Common in London, the Oxford-Cambridge Arc and Cheshire. But Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter said: “While this is good news, it has to be noted that we can’t deliver social housing on the scale we need on borrowing alone.  Starting from June, paper landing cards will also begin to be abolished at airports for people visiting from overseas. This will reduce bureaucracy for travellers and speed up the processing of passengers on arrival in the UK, the Treasury said. But while thats good news for all concerned, another change will only slow things down for Brits ing from abroad. From June , citizens of the US, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Japan, Singapore and South Korea will be permitted to use e-gates at UK airports and at Eurostar terminals, the Treasury said. This will signicantly reduce queues and improve the flow of passengers and the overall experience at the UK border.

A Brexit deal was agreed between the UK and the EU in November , but it was voted down twice in the House of Commons - first in January by  votes, then on March th by  votes. MPs are voting on Wednesday  March on whether to avoid a No Deal Brexit - and theyre widely expected to block it. But even so, no deal remains the default option and plans have long since been put into action, costing more than poundbillion, in case it happens. The government published  technical notices outlining the practical effects of No Deal - from driving licences to cats. And it unveiled new tarfs that would slap pound, on the cost of a family car from the EU - but leave % of goods imports, including steel, tarf free. This could threaten struggling UK industries with a flood of cheap imports.  Meanwhile ministers have , troops held at readiness, could call up Army reserves and declare martial law. Supermarkets and pharma giants are stockpiling food and medicine. If theres no arrangement in time, well lose  international trade deals in a blink, shed access to EU criminal databases and troops couldto the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. A lot of the effects are on business. UK farmers face a nine-month wait for approval to export organic goods to the EU. Fishermen could be blocked from EU waters. And manufacturers fear their supply chains drying up. But businesses are not what whove written this guide for. Instead we have tried to establish  ways No Deal Brexit will affect you, the reader and your everyday le. What is a No Deal Brexit  No Deal is the default optionMPs, the EU and the UK government cant agree a Brexit Withdrawal Agreement by  March . The -page deal on the table would have ensured businesses arent cut off by continuing rules in a transition period until December . But it came at a cost - a backstop that could trap the UK in an EU customs union from . That means MPs have opposed it. Leaving with no deal will mean falling back on World Trade Organisation trade tarfs - increasing the price of imports and exports - and could leave legal black holes where EU law stood before. The UK government has been ramping up preparations for no deal since the beginning of summer . MPs believe they will block No Deal through Parliament - in a vote on Wednesday  March - butthey dont its still the default option at pm on March .  ways No Deal Brexit will hit you NOTE,  March : These scenarios are accurate as of early , when this piece was last updated. Some have since been partially resolved - for example, there is an agreement to ensure flights will continue. . Martial law could be imposed with thousands of troops on standby  More than , troops are being held at readiness in case there is a disastrous no-deal Brexit. Army reserves are also legally able to be called upthere is civil unrest, while councils are braced for possible runs on banks, fuel and food. Local Resilience Forums are reporting back to Whitehall and expect several months of disruptionthere is no deal. The government has plans in case it needs to impose martial law - military law - and curfews to restore order. Cabinet minister Matt Hancock admitted the plans existed but insisted the government was not specically looking at martial law and it was not the focus of our attention. . You need to renew your passport early  At the moment, British citizens can enter Schengen area countries with a valid passport eventhey only have a day left before they expire. But in a no deal Brexit, after  March  you may not be able to travel to these countriesyou have less than six months left on your passport. The government is advising travellers to renew any passports older than nine years and six months. . Usually this means renewing six months before your passport expires. Butyour passport had more than  years validity, youll have to renew earlier, because the extra months on top of  years dont count. The following are members of the Schengen Agreement: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. . Pet owners must visit the vet FOUR MONTHS before a holiday  There is a huge surge in red tape for pet owners who want to take their beloved animals abroad. Currently dogs , cats and ferrets can travel anywhere in the EU as long as they have a pet passport. The main requirement is that three weeks before the first visit, owners must go to the vet to have their pet vaccinated against rabies and microchipped. But in the worst case no-deal Brexit, pet owners must visit a vet at least four months before taking their pet the EU. And because talks are ongoing, that means youd better book in now. The animal must have a rabies vaccination followed by a blood test at least  days later, to prove the vaccination worked. Pet owners must then wait at least three months before visiting the vet to obtain a health certicate. But this cannot be done more than  days before the date the holiday starts. . KFC and other big names could run out of food  Food is being stockpiled forwe crash out of the EU without a deal, and ministers have promised an adequate supply. But thats not the same as having the range of food we do now. Leaked plans in December warned Brits could have to y their diet. And in January, big names KFC, Pret, Lidl, Co-Op, MS, Waitrose, Sainsburys, Asda and McDonalds signed a damning letter warning food supplies could run short because of disruptions to the supply chain. They wrote in a joint letter to MPs: Our ability to mitigate these risks is limited. As prudent businesses we are stockpiling where possible, but all frozen and chilled storage is already being used and there is very little general warehousing space available in the UK. They added: Retailers typically store no more than two weeks inventory and it becomes dficult to restock storesthe supply chain is disrupted. . You could lose your job  A string of firms have either moved jobs out of the UK or are threatening to do so in a no-deal situation. Airbus, which employs , people in the UK with around , more jobs in supply chains, warned it may move where. Car plants are moving forward standard shutdowns to be around Brexit in case there are supply chain issues. And critics fear new investment will not come the UKs way, hitting jobs in generations. Your motorway commute faces becoming a lorry park  Major motorways in the South of England are set for serious disruption in case of a no-deal Brexit. From early  the Mwill be closed as needed from junctions -, with a contraflow of both directions on the opposite side, so it can be used as a lorry parkthere is gridlock at Dover. A backup lorry park will be in place at Manston Airport. The M in Kent is also expected to be used as a holding area for lorries. And a similar fate could befall a -mile stretch of the M towards Southampton. . Millions of plane tickets could be cancelled  The International Air Transport Associationwarn up to million plane tickets could be cancelledthere is no deal. Currently it is not known exactly which tickets could be hit, or how passengers would find outthey are at risk. The situation arose because in a no deal, there will be no automatic legal basis for flights between the EU and UK after pm on  March . Under a pact struck between the UK and EU in December, basic connectivity will be maintained for a -month periodtheres No Deal. But according to the IATA - which represents  airlines including British Airways - that only means maintaining the number of flights in . It does not allow an increase in services - yet tickets have already been sold based on a predicted increase. Talks are ongoing, but Amyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office, previously warned flights could be groundedgoodwill fails. . Youll find it harder to drive in the EU  Currently a UK driving licence is the only thing visitors need to get behind the wheel on the continent. But under a no-deal Brexit, you should get an International Driving Permit. The pound. documents were due to be sold at , post offices from February. Before they were sold at fewer than . The number of permits issued would have to soar from , a year to million. Meanwhile you will also be forced to apply for a green card to prove you have the right car insurance. The certicates are free of charge and available from insurance companies. But the government warns firms may increase administration fees in order to cope with the extra bureaucracy. Those who forget their green cards would be forced to buy expensive frontier insurance in the country they are visiting. . Up to a million Brits may be forced to take a new driving test  British people driving in Europe could be forced to take a new driving testtheres a no deal Brexit. Up to a million Brits living in Europe were told to replace their driving licence with a local permit immediately. Guidance issued by the Department for Transport said: If you are aUKlicence holder living in theEUorEEAyou should exchange your UK driving licence for a local EU driving licence before  March . From that date, in the event that there is noEUExit deal, you may have to pass a driving test in theEU country you live in to be able to carry on driving there. . If youre an EU citizen, youll have fewer rights to stay in the UK  More than million EU citizens living in the UK will have less concrete rights to stay. Whether theres a Brexit deal or not, EU citizens can stay in Britainthey register for settled status with the government. But the rules are stricter in a No Deal Brexit. In No Deal, only EU citizens arriving before  March can apply, not those arriving by December . The deadline to apply will be  December , instead of  June there is a Brexit deal. And family members will only be able to join settled EU citizens in the UK before  March . As for the other way round - major EU nations have inidually said theyll allow UK ex-pats to stay, but this could y by country. . Pharmacies and hospitals could start rationing medicine  Pharmacists have requested special powers to ration medicinesthere is no Brexit deal Under plans by the Healthcare Distribution Association, they would have special powers to y doctors prescriptions and offer something a drug is unavailable.  million packs of medicines are imported to the UK from the EU every month, and the NHS is preparing for a doomsday scenario to prevent supplies running dry. Government and NHS chiefs have set up a war room called the Operational Response Centre and industry firms are creating six-week stockpiles of medicine. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has chartered a plane to fly in short-shelf-le products, like isotopes for cancer treatment, from Maastricht. Insulin could also be stockpiled. Mr Hancock claimed hes become the biggest buyer of fridges in the world, after fitting out facilities for storage of the crucial drugs. NHS staff are being directed to urge patients not to stockpile medicines personally to avoid shortages throughout the system. . Your mobile phone roaming charges may be hiked  Mobile roaming charges face an immediate hikethere is a No Deal Brexit, the government has confirmed. Tory ministers are revoking the EU law which guarantees UK citizens pay the same for using their phone on the Continent as they do at home. That will leave mobile phone firms free to hike costs whenever they like after the UK leaves. Guaranteed free roaming launched across the EU just  months ago - and meant big savings. But that guarantee will be scrappedthere is no deal, thanks to an obscure law laid before Parliament. . You should get insurance and flexible tickets for Eurostar disruption  Eurostar services could be suspended in a worst-case no deal Brexit. The government has told international train passengers - including the Eurostar - to make sure they have insurance and ticket terms and conditions that are sufficient to cover possible disruption. That implies passengers should buy FLEXIBLE tickets - not the fixed cheap ones that are popular for their low cost. The UK will need bilateral deals with France, Belgium and the Netherlands to ensure international trains keep running. Without such a deal, Britain has proposed recognising EU operator licences until March  to ensure services can continue. But this isnt guaranteed, and UK operators would have to reapply with the EU. The EU has agreed to keep permissions for services like the Channel Tunnel open for three monthsthere is No Deal, while a new agreement is negotiated. But there arent guarantees. Former Transport Secretary Andrew Adonis claimed the vital train link between Britain and Europe could be severed. . You might have to go through airport security twice  Air passengers changing flights in the EU may have to undergo two security screenings under a no-deal exit. Travellers boarding a plane in the UK to fly to a European airport, before changing flights for an onward destination, would be screened in Britain as they are now. But they might have to have a second check in the EU before getting their connecting flight. “Currently passengers flying from the UK and transferring at an EU airport for an onward flight do not have to be re-screened at that EU airport, because the UK applies, and exceeds, the EU baseline aviation security measures,” says a Department for Transport briefing note. “If there is no deal, and the EU decides not to recognise the UK aviation security system, then passengers and their luggage will have to be re-screened when changing flights in EU hub airports.” . You could be barred from using Netflix and Spoty on holiday  Britons could be barred from accessing their accounts for Netflix, Spoty and other online entertainment while travelling to EU statestheres a no-deal Brexit. Under the EU-wide portability regulation, which took force in April, citizens can access accounts set up and based in one country while visiting other member states. But a government technical notice said: The portability regulation will cease to apply to UK nationals when they travel to the EU. This means online content service providers will not be required or able to offer cross-border access to UK consumers under the EU Regulation. UK consumers may see restrictions to their online content services when they temporarily visit the EU. . If you live in Northern Ireland, you face electricity blackouts  Northern Ireland will be forced to take drastic measures to stop the lights going out. A worst-case No Deal Brexit would scupper the all-island electricity market shared by Northern Ireland and the Republic - leaving it without any legal basis. This would make both markets less efficient, with potential effects for producers and consumers on both sides of the border, the government warns. And it may be necessary to seek additional [legal] powers to preserve security of supply. To stop the lights going out, Northern Ireland would have to take more electricity from British power stations through an interconnector running under the Irish Sea. But Northern Irelands Transmission System Operator may need to rely on fall-back arrangements to ensure power keeps flowing, the government warns. That is why, eventheres a no deal, the government will take all possible measures to keep the all-island market running. There has been talk of barges in the Irish Sea. Dustin Benton of Green Alliance warned:Any emergency action to keep the lights on, both in Northern Ireland and across the rest of the UK, would likely be highly polluting and expensive. . You could be stranded on your package holiday  Package holidaymakers could be left with no legal protectionthe firm they booked with goes bust. Currently Brits have insolvency protectionthey book with a package holiday provider thats based anywhere in the EU. But in a No Deal Brexit, that protection would only applythe firms are targeting the UK market. That means those booking with, say, a cheaper Spanish firm online that has no UK presence could be unprotected. Eventhe UK government could act, in practice it will be much harder to take enforcement action against foreign firms because other countries will no longer recognise UK courts. . Youll lose rights to take action over dangerous products  Government documents reveal the same problem - UK courts not being recognised - will strip Brits of their consumer rights for EU goods bought online. Alex Neill of consumer group Which  warned: A no-deal Brexit would massively weaken peoples rights to take action when they purchase faulty or dangerous products from outside the UK. The Governments advice that we all become experts in international consumer law is hopelessly unrealistic. Securing a good deal with the EU is vital to ensure that Brexit doesnt result in a bonfire of consumer rights and protections.” . Your cigarette packets will change  Graphic warnings on cigarette packets will be replaced by Australian versions in a no-deal Brexit. And in some ways they are even more gruesome than the ones we have now. The grim pictures show a foot ridden with peripheral vascular disease, a clogged artery, a bleeding brain and high-resolution teeth stained black. The photos will be changed in a No Deal Brexit because the European Commission owns theon ones we currently use. That means the UK would be unable to use them after  March . . If youre going through a family breakdown, you could be trapped in limbo  Families who are midway through orce or child custody cases involving another EU country could find themselves trapped in limbo. If there’s a no deal Brexit, the UK will cease to be part of co-operation between EU family courts on  March . Instead the UK will fall back on legal conventions drawn up in The Hague. But these are complicated and do not cover every area of the law. The government has advised families with ongoing cases to seek legal advicethey will not finish by Brexit Day. A government technical note says: Broadly speaking, cases ongoing on exit day will continue to proceed under the current rules. However, we cannot guarantee that EU courts will follow the same principle, nor that EU courts will accept or recognise any judgments stemming from these cases.” . Your everyday medicines and perfumes could become more expensive  Currently, popular ingredients in cold medicines can usually be traded within the EU without a licence. In a no deal, a licence will be required to trade these so-called precursors. Sowe leave without a deal, firms who want to trade such chemicals with the EU will have to register with the Home Office, which can cost between pound and pound,. They will also need an import export license, which costs pound. Critics say this could push up prices for consumers in the shops. Similarly, cosmetics firms will be slapped with more red tape to prove their products are safe for human health. Currently they can use one legal “nominated person” to certy a product for the whole EU market. Butthere’s a no deal Brexit, UK checks won’t be recognised in the EU - and EU checks wont be recognised in the UK. That means two sets of checks. Labour MP Owen Smith claimed drug giants will look to pass on the costs. And finally... your regular caviar parties are doomed!

One in three people in Britain believes that a house can be haunted and  per cent think they’ve experienced a ‘supernatural presence’, according to a YouGov survey. But a growing number of scientists now believe toxic mould - which grows on the walls of damp homes in the UK - could be to blame. It comes as Emma Marshall blamed a string of health problems on the black mould in her flat. The -year-old, who noticed the black mould at her flat in Hackney, east London, suffers from exhaustion, memory loss and her hair has been falling out in clumps.   Emma, who works in the music industry, has also suffered from brain fog, chronic nerve pain and skin rashes. She thought nothing of the “thick black mould” in the bathroom of her flat when she moved in in . But, since moving out the following year, her health has steadily declined. She is now hoping revolutionary treatment will help her expert symptoms. But experts claim the terrying hallucinations can be banished by simply scrubbing the mould off.  Ralitsa Prodanova of leading domestic services firm Fantastic Services said: “For eye-witnesses who experience supernatural encounters, the events can be extremely traumatic. “And when the paranormal activity is centred on your own home it can prove even more frightening. “But it’s important to remember that there could well be a rational, domestic explanation for all manner of spirits, poltergeists and demons. “Several studies have suggested the toxic black mould that grows on damp walls could be a factor. “These living, organic moulds can send spores - clumps of microscopic seeds - into the air, spreading like a virus.  “One of the worst-offending types - Stachybotrys chartarum - is present in many homes in the UK, and the mycotoxins it produces can cause respiratory problems, inflammation of the skin, tiredness and nausea. “Meanwhile some types of fungus - particularly the rye ergot fungus - have a psychedelic effect when ingested, causing hallucinations and delusions. “These moulds could well be behind many ghost sightings. And it’s important homeowners are aware of the dangers.” The phenomenon was first examined in  by experts in Maryland, USA, who christened it ‘Sick Building Syndrome’, or ‘SBS’, and documented the effects in the journal ‘Neurotoxicology and Teratology’. Lead author Ritchie Shoemaker analysed the inhabitants of water damaged, and mould-ridden buildings, and found patients had compromised ‘neurological ’, as well as a host of other toxicity-related ailments.  And in , a team of scientists from Clarkson University, New York, studied the links between hauntings and toxic mould. Associate Professor of Civil  Environmental Engineering Shane Rogers sampled the air quality in buildings associated with alleged ghost activity. He said: Hauntings are very widely reported phenomena that are not well-researched. “They are often reported in older-built structures that may also suffer poor air quality. “Similarly, some people have reported depression, anxiety and other effects from exposure to biological pollutants in indoor air. “We are trying to determine whether some reported hauntings may be linked to specic pollutants found in indoor air.”  He also added: “‘Although allergy and asthma symptoms and other physiological effects are well established, there has long been controversy over the effects of indoor mould exposure on cognitive and other ing of the brain.” American physicist and paranormal sceptic Dr Harry Kloor is also convinced mould is to blame for many supernatural events. He said: “A common airborne fungus will actually grow on latex paint and produces these ergot alkaloids which cause people to hallucinate. This could explain the bizarre things that people are seeing.” The NHS warns that, ‘ you have damp and mould in your home, youre more likely to have respiratory problems, respiratory infections, allergies or asthma.Damp and mould can also affect the immune system.’Some are worse affected than others, too, with babies and children, the elderly and those with existing problems, such as eczema or asthma, particularly susceptible. But thankfully there are methods to combat toxic black mould. Fantastic Services professional Ralitsa says: “If you’re attempting to clean black mould yourself, always wear a protective mask, rubber gloves and safety glasses. “And the most effective method of combating mould is to pour bleach into a spraying bottle, before covering mouldy areas and letting the bleach get to work for  minutes. “Open all windows to allow any toxic fumes to escape. “Then wipe and rinse the area and leave it to dry, before disposing of the cloth used.Bear in mind that bleach is a strong chemical product, which makes it dangerous for people with allergies, sensitive skin, as well as kids.” "},{"url":null,"title":"cheltenham festival 2019 armed cops","story":"NewsCheltenham Festival : Armed cops arrest elderly man suspected of carrying KNIFEArmed police handcuffed an elderly man and were seen marching him away during the horse eventShareByTalia Shadwell:,  MAR NewsPolice arresting the man at the Cheltenham Festival on suspicion of carrying a kne \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn elderly man has been arrested by armed police at the Cheltenham Festival on suspicion of carrying a kne.

Dr Chris Pickering leads the Major Trauma Centre at the Royal University Hospital in Stoke which is featured in the gripping four-part Channel  series, Critical Condition.The programme goes behind the scenes to show the work of Chris and his team, who are responsible for delivering the immediate le-saving care following a catastrophic event in a person’s le. Cases include a man who has been hacked to within an inch of his le by a machete-wielding attacker and a -year-old motorbike racer who is minutes from death after crashing at mph.The documentary shows Dr Pickering and other consultants calmly directing emergency staff as they resuscitate desperately ill patients, and making le and death decisions knowing that each second counts.  But despite his serene demeanour the father-of-two, who has  years AE experience, admits his work often leaves him feeling emotionally shattered - and has forced him to rethink his own priorities in le. He said: “I certainly go home after a particularly hard sht and make sure my children known how much I care about them. “We see everything, from families who need reconciling on someone’s death bed, to someone who’s arrived too late. It forces you to think about the relationships you have, and make sure that you make the effort with them, before it’s too late. “It makes you think about what’s more important in le.”   And he said that while emergency medics are known as “adrenalin junkies” away from work, living le to the full is a consequence of seeing so many people’s lives cut short before they can achieve their own dreams. He said: “I think a lot of us do find ways of enjoying le away from work. What you see does make you relish the things you have a lot more and make you want to make the most of your time.” Dr Pickering said that having to tell a patient’s family that their loved one didn’t make it is “one of the worst parts of the job” and something that always stays with him. He said: “In my career there are several times that stick in my mind when I’ve had to go in and tell a family the worst news. “And it’s particularly hard when you’re telling parents, it doesn’t matter how old the patient is. But inevitably at some point we have to tell a parent that they’ve lost their child. “As long as I know I can walk away knowing I’ve done the best for my patient, that’s what helps you cope with it, knowing you’ve done the best you can.”  The documentary, which was filmed in autumn last year, shows the moment a patient is told he is going to die and another who is told he has an incurable brain tumour. Cameras also captured the team’s desperate save the le of a -year-old man who was found in a pool of blood after being attacked by a machete, and the moment his desperate mother arrives in the hospital after getting a late night visit from police officers to deliver the news. Dr Pickering said: “Every day I or one of my colleagues in the department will have to have a conversation with a family that will be unpleasant. “We see a lot of people who have found themselves in the end stages of le. “Knowing that I’ve done my best for them, explored all options, done everything that could be done for the patient. That’s what makes it easier to cope with.” The doctor also told how he is worried about the effects of Brexit on his teams le-saving work.He said: I think I worry because I dont know what the effect is going to have. We are a group of clinicians who like to make plans and focus on what we have that is concrete, and its dficult for us to plan or react to what we dont know. But, like you see us doing in the show, its a challenge we will face in the same way when its there in front of us.

The -year-old wants her daughters to be at her bedside with her husband Mark while she is in hospital, as no-one will be home to care for them. The mum, from Burnley, Lancs, had asked St Augustine of Canterbury Primary School to allow both her daughters to have five days leave.   She had hoped they would only need between two and three daysthe upcoming operation at Newcastle Freeman Hospital goes well. If the operation is not a success, Mrs Payne, who runs Emmas Newsagents in Burnley, will need open heart surgery and that will keep her in hospital for five days. The surgery can only take place during term-time as it is the only time a specialist from London can lead the keyhole procedure. In a letter, the school explained it had only authorised two days absence and would not allow five days due to Charlottes standard attainment testsexams in May.

My husband, Mark, will take me up to the hospital for the operation on the Tuesday and will be with me, no one  can look after my children and they want to be close to me.

My previous appointments have all managed to be away from term time but this operation has to be when the surgeon can perform it. The children know that Im undergoing a tough operation and they want to be close to me. Sinead Colbeck, headteacher at St. Augustines RC Primary School, said: We cannot comment on inidual cases.

County Cllr Susie Charles, cabinet member for children, young people and schools, said: It would be inappropriate to comment on inidual cases however schools have a very clear policy, based on government guidance, regarding the authorisation of leave. The decision to authorise absence or not rests with the headteacher of the particular school. Schools work closely with parents to understand the reasons for the request. Each request is always taken on its merits. School attendance is given high priority in Lancashire schools and rightly so, as every day counts in each pupils education. However our aim throughout is not to punish parents but to ensure that children and young people attend school and receive a good education.

So that’s it, ain’t it.”The heartbreaking moment was captured by the cameras of a new, no-holds-barred Channel  documentary, Critical Condition, which starts tonight. The four-part series goes behind the scenes to show the work of the hospital ’s Major Trauma Centre as they receive patients on the brink of losing their lives, and care for them during the ‘golden hour’ when every second counts.And some of the scenes are so disturbing the programme is shown after the pm watershed.   They include patients whose lives have suddenly been ripped apart by a road smash, a workplace accident, a massive heart attack or, as in Geoff’s case, sudden excruciating pain as a consequence of a deadly illness. Cameras continue filming as the team work to save their lives, reviving those whose hearts have stopped, pinpointing the cause of bleeding and pain, and performing delicate surgery like carefully removing a blood clot from one man’s brain.Within hours of being told the devastating news he had an aggressive and incurable tumour, surgeons opened up Geoff’s skull to remove the cancer, which had attached itself to his brain - a way to prolong his le and relieve his terrible headaches .Later, cameras film the moment neurosurgeons use an electric saw to cut through Geoff’s skull. “It’s a bit like carpentry, measure twice, cut once,” says the surgeon he removes the bathplug-sized piece of skull he has just cut. After finding the tumour which had caused Geoff’s brain to bulge - and his insupportable headaches - he says: “It’s naked eye dferent, pinkish, greyish, firmer than it should be. It’s definitely a tumour, there’s no doubt about it. “But it’s not good that it’s attached like this, it’s worrying.”   The images capturing such tragic and dramatic moments in people’s lives make for incredible -not dficult - viewing. But they are what NHS trauma teams across the country face every day, according to Dr Chris Pickering, Royal University Hospital’s emergency medicine specialist who features in the programme. The Royal Stoke is one of  specialist trauma centres in the UK, with patients frequently arriving by air ambulance from across the region following major accidents or for le-threatening conditions. Speaking exclusively to , Chris said: “When Geoff came into the resuscitation room we thought he may have suffered a stroke with potentially bleeding to the brain, then at the MRI scan we find this horrible tumour. “It’s a very dficult thing to approach with anyone, to tell them and their family they have something that’s going to get worse and eventually kill them. It feels like a sentence you are giving them. “But I or one of my colleagues will have an unpleasant conversation like that with a family every day.  “We see a lot of people at the end stages of le. In one of the episodes one of my colleagues has to tell a patient they are going to die. “It’s as much about being honest with them, and about the compassion and the way you deliver it. But then making sure you can deliver the care they need, and making sure they are comfortable. “But it’s one of the worst parts of the job. In my career there are several times that stick in my mind when I’ve had to go in and tell a family the worst news. And it’s particularly hard when you’re telling parents, it doesn’t matter how old the patient is. But inevitably at some point we have to tell a parent that they’ve lost their child. “As long as I know I can walk away knowing I’ve done the best for my patient, that’s what helps you cope with it, knowing you’ve done the best you can.”  The series, which starts tonight at pm on Channel , also shows the team’s desperate efforts to save the le of a -year-old man who was found in a pool of blood after being attacked by a machete. The man, called Dave, has a gaping wound in the right side of his head and the left side of his neck. And it also captures the moment a man who arrives complaining of what he believes is indigestion pains has a heart attack. The tense moments during which his heart stops completely, as staff wait for an internal defibrillator in his heart to jolt him back to le are all caught on camera. Filmed during Autumn , the documentary follows Chris and his team, who are responsible for delivering the immediate le-saving care following a catastrophic event in a person’s le. And as well as the serious kinds of injuries and conditions they are required to deal with, the programme highlights the relentless fast pace of the department’s daily workload during which they have to make split-second le and death decisions. Chris says that the on-screen portrayal of his department “is not an unfair reflection of what we do.” And he says he has witnessed the massive increase in workload on NHS staff in the  years since he first started out as a doctor.  He said: “My first ever AE job was a Northwick Park hospital in north London, which at the time was one of the busiest departments in the country, with around  patients a day on a busy day. Today they are close to seeing  a day. “At Royal University Hospital we see between  and  patients a day. “Our resuscitation room has eight beds and we are normally operating with six of those at any one time. We see a lot of very sick patients a day, and we receive an average of two to three traumas a day. “Tonight I will be on sht from pm and on the shop floor until midnight, butI leave before am I’ll be happy. I’ll be on trauma call all night, then back in a meeting room at am. I’ll be in the office all day then working Friday all day on the shop floor again. “I normally only see my we on a Monday evening.” But he says he gets a “buzz” from getting the call that a major trauma patient is on their way. He said: “A colleague once gave me a mug which reads: “Trauma junkie - It’s not that I want you to get hurt, I just want to be there when you do. “That’s very much the attitude we have. We don’t want to see anyone hurt, but you do get a buzz about making people better than they do. “These people we see are going through something horrendous, they have just had a moment of severe pain and distress.We’re really the second phase after the pre-hospital guys have done their work, we’re the ones who try to make sure they recover, or don’t have lasting effects. “It does give you a real buzz to know you are part of that.”Critical Condition is on Channel , tonight, at pm."},{"url":null,"title":"stonehenge hosted massive rave like","story":"NewsStonehenge hosted massive rave-like events  years ago, pig remains suggestA landmark study has unearthed evidence which indicates that feasts in the Stonehenge area attracted people and their beasts from hundreds of miles awayShareCommentsByAdam Aspinall:,  MAR NewsRollo Maughfling, Archdruid of Stonehenge and Britain conducts as ceremony as druids, pagans and revellers gather in the centre of Stonehenge, \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAncient Britons travelled for hundreds of miles for rave-like mass gatherings around Stonehenge in an ancient forerunner of the Glastonbury Festival, a study suggests. State of the art analysis of pig remains reveals that feasts in the Stonehenge area and across the ancient kingdom of Wessex attracted people and their beasts from hundreds of miles away. The landmark study, which unearthed evidence of the earliest large-scale celebrations in Britain, reveals the monumental distances travelled for national mass gatherings. The study is the most comprehensive to date and examined the bones of  pigs, the prime feasting animals, from four Late Neolithic complexes, dating back around , years.   Serving the world-famous monuments of Stonehenge and Ave bury, the four sites - Durrington Walls, Marden, Mount Pleasant and West Kennet Palisade Enclosures - hosted the very first national events. The results show pig bones excavated from the sites were from animals raised as far away as Scotland, North East England and West Wales, as well as numerous other locations across the British Isles.   The researchers believe it may have been important for those attending to contribute animals raised locally at their homes. Lead researcher Dr Richard Madgwick, from the University of Cardf, said: This study demonstrates a scale of movement and level of social complexity not previously appreciated. These gatherings could be seen as the first united cultural events of our island, with people from all corners of Britain descending on the areas around Stonehenge to feast on food that had been specially reared and transported from their homes. Pigs were the prime source of meat for Neolithic feasting, said the scientists.   The team focused on the henge complexes of Durrington Walls, Marden, Mount Pleasant and West Kennet Palisade Enclosures. Dr Madgwick added: Arguably the most startling finding is the efforts that participants invested in contributing pigs that they themselves had raised. Procuring them in the vicinity of the feasting sites would have been relatively easy. Pigs are not nearly as well-suited to movement over distance as cattle and transporting them, either slaughtered or on the hoof, over hundreds or even tens of kilometres, would have required a monumental effort. This suggests that prescribed contributions were required and that rules dictated that offered pigs must be raised by the feasting participants, accompanying them on their journey, rather than being acquired locally. The research is reported in the journal Science Advances.

As well as live DJ sets and lavish fireworks displays there are also performances from half-naked women. People clamour to get on the guest list but there is only space for , people - and The Candyman has come up with a very unusual way of deciding who will be getting in. He has teamed up with Celebrity Ink to brand fans around the world with a real tattoo of his Candy Shop Mansion logo.   The tattoo is then their ticket to VIP access to his next huge house party in December. And Travers claims , people from countries including Australia, Indonesia, India and Thailand have confirmed they will be getting the tattoos. The businessman said: Its only taken  years to create the best party on the planet. When you think of the Candmay party, you think next level - then double it. A Candyman party is a place to be free and live out your wildest fantasies without any judgement.   The only problem with my party is that my bed only sleeps nine girls. Last December more than , people flocked to the bash. Dom Perignon flowed, along with Moet, Gentleman Jack and Grey Goose vodka. And the centre piece of the party - Travers himself. He arrived on a floating stage on the river behind his -bedroom orgy mansion.   It has been reported the lavish bash cost more than one million Australian dollars. Travers, who is famed for his polyamorous le, said: What I’m like in business, le or sport, I’m like that in bed.They love my imagination and creativity. You need that when you’ve got multiple girls.”Married to Taesha the couple have two children.  Travers, , told : When I was a teenager I wanted  children, but six will do now, I would be happy with two more boys. Taesha texted me today actually, and can I read this out  She said, I really want a baby boy with you....like now. The couple have two daughters, Velicia, , and Serafina, , and Travers has two children from a previous marriage to Venezuelan beauty queen Ninibeth Leal - Valentino, , and Luciana, . Taesha, a former body building champion, said that she actually instigated their infamous polyamorous lestyle, not Travers.  Taesha speaking previously to : When I was younger I was into girls. I was curious and I kissed girls but it never went further than that. Our first few years of married le were normal. We had children, we got married, but I would text him pictures of girls and ask himhe liked them or point out girls when we were out. One night, the couple decided to invite another girl into their company and their bed has rarely been empty since. Four women - and just one man - sleep there on an average night while at parties, naked bodies tend to spill out onto the floor, the couple said.  I like girls the way Travers does so it works for us both, Taesha said. The couple met when Taesha was just  but their  year age gap has not proved a barrier to their enduring love, they said. An agent first invited Taesha to one of Travers Candyman parties but she turned down the offer. When she was later recruited to work at a Candyman party, she refused two roles - as a rollerskater and a cloakroom attendant - but she eventually agreed to be a hostess.  And when she met Travers there she said it was love at first sight. I had Googled him before and I thought he was really hot but when I met him I froze. He was the most drop-dead gorgeous thing I had ever seen. He had glasses on and when he took them off he had the most amazing green eyes. It was instantly love for me. But he takes his parties very seriously. He just said hello and was very business like. He was not sleazy at all and clearly respected all the girls which impressed me. We didnt get together that night but we were destined to be together because we kept crossing paths. We always saw each other on a track we both exercised on. I was with my mum the first time we met there and I was too shy to speak. But then we bumped into each other at a club. He told me I had a really fat ass and gestured at it.I couldnt really hear him so I went right over to him and he told me I had a really big ass again. He offered to help me with my modelling portfolio and we just really clicked. The couple quickly had daughter, Velicia, now , and found their dream house - the Candyman Mansion - where they now live and throw their elaborate parties.  Taesha said: We had desperately wanted the house and when we were moving in we went for a celebratory dinner in a restaurant we had wanted to go to for a while. He started telling me I love you. Youre the mother of my children, and all these sweet things. Then he took out a ring, got down on one knee and asked me to marry him in front of the whole restaurant. I said yes Ill marry you.

The Bring Catherine Home page has been set up after the Oxfordshire -year-old plunged more than ft to her death in a mountainous region of the country. So far poundk has been raised towards a poundk goal to assist her parents in covering the costs of the search for Catherine, repatriating her body back to England, her funeral, and recovering her possessions. The fundraiser has been organised by the Lucie Blackman Trust, a charity which supports families of British people missing abroad, and has been helping her loved ones.  Catherine, from Witney, and described as a nature lover, was backpacking in the region and staying at an eco hotel. She had been reported missing from her hotel in the village of San Juan La Laguna. Tragically, after days of looking, a search party located her body after a stray puppy she had been carrying with her was found close by.  She was found in a cavern around ft from the peak of a hiking trail and two miles from her hostel on Monday. Investigators say she died from a traumatic brain injury and may have laid undiscovered for between four to six days. Guatemalan authorities are still working to determine how she came to fall to her death. Her family have criticised local media reports speculating foul play was suspected in Catherines death. They made a statement via the Lucie Blackman Trust, saying it was unlikely foul play was involved.  Earlier reports from Guatemalan media had suggested the backpacker had been raped and killed, because her body was found naked. Catherine had been travelling since September last year, heading to the central American country, and had been staying in the San Pedro, Lake Atitlan area with a friend. The Trust said Catherine appeared to have been fasting and had stripped off to take a walk and watch the sunset.  The statement issued by the Trust in response to the speculation said: “She was very much a nature lover and adored sunrises, so it seems quite conceivable that she went up the mountain to greet the sunrise, shedding clothing as she went, and due to her lack of intake of food and fluid may have passed out or fallen, causing the wounds to her body. The Trust says  per cent of the funds raised for Catherines family, including any funds in excess of what is needed for their cause, will go toward supporting other families in similar situations. Guatemalas Interior Ministry earlier said in a statement immediately after Catherines body was found: After several days of intense searching by police authorities, other institutions and volunteers for the missing British national, participating teams are being coordinated at the scene where her body has been found. After  hours of an exhaustive search, the result is very regrettable and the Interior Ministry and police chiefs have immediately designated a team which will carry out the criminal investigation. This is to determine what has happened and who could be involved in this deplorable incident."},{"url":null,"title":"woman hugs boyfriend begs him","story":"NewsWoman hugs boyfriend and begs him not to die after stabbing him in stomachWARNING - DISTRESSING CONTENT: Erick Omar told witnesses in Mexico girlfriend Sonia Amayrani Nunez Aguilar wanted to kill him as she declared her loveShareCommentsByKelly-Ann Mills:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video moment-woman-begs-boyfriend-not-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, combinedPrompt :true, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, combinedPrompt :true, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA woman was filmed begging her boyfriend not to die, as he lay bleeding in the street - after she reportedly stabbed him.

Particularly against Inverness last week, they seemed to be able to keep United at arms’all too easily.I think that had a lot to do with the tempo of their play, which was not high enough.

There were so many amazing things going on before VA Dundee was here, but the museum has really just shone that spotlight on everything that was always going on here, brought it to the forefront and brought a lot more people into the city to see these things. “Among the many positive experiences Ailsa has enjoyed through volunteering and then employment, her favourite and most memorable moments have been her involvement both in the opening of VA Dundee last September and then the official opening of the museum by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in January.Ailsa explained: “The opening was such an exciting time for everybody, it was mind-blowing to see it all on such a large scale. Once it was all happening it was so emotional to see my city having the eyes of the world on it – just to witness that was a once-in-a-letime experience that I will cherish forever.“I was then involved in the Royal visit representing the Young People’s Collective. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge came to visit the museum during which they were really keen to meet the young people involved in the opening.“So a few of us got to meet them both which was such an amazing experience, they were so interested in everything we’d been doing and asked lots of questions. It was a surreal experience but a wonderful one.” vw, px\"  Over £ million of National Lottery funding was awarded to help VA Dundee become a reality – and Ailsa says it has changed her le and the lives of many others.She added: “VA Dundee has changed my le in so many ways. It’s given me a chance to stay here and to do something amazing in my town. One of my neighbours I’ve grown up with and who is supportive of me, when I got the job she told me it is so amazing that Dundee is able to give me this opportunity and I think that sums it up.”From today, any organisation that has received National Lottery funding has the chance to gain nationwide acclaim by entering the th Birthday National Lottery Awards – a search for the UK’s favourite ever National Lottery-funded projects.National Lottery Awards winners will receive a £, cash prize and national recognition at a glittering ceremony broadcast on BBC One later in the year.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks. Why have we in Argyll after nine years, four dferent Transport Ministers and £m spent and still have no guaranteed safe passage   on The Rest and Be Thankful Follow the Argyll Advertiser#s campaign #Invest in the Rest#. Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"honours even for red star in argyll derby","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Ropework played host to this keenly contested local derby which was watched by a healthy crowd on Saturday February .And for the second time this season, Red Star and Campbeltown Pupils shared the points in a match both sides will feel they could have won.Both sides were struggling for fluency in the opening stages but Red Star settled first and grabbed the opening goal after  minutes. A long ball to the right hand side was met by Ryan Caskie who cut the ball back to Stuart McLean. The youngster took a touch before slotting past the Pupils# goalkeeper to give Star a - lead.Star continued to press and doubled their lead when Coll McCallum robbed the Pupils# defender on the edge of the box before cutting the ball across goal. The unfortunate Pupils# defender could only ert the ball into the empty net, with McLean waiting on a tap in. The game continued at a frantic pace, however, there was no further scoring in the first half and Star went in with a - advantage.Pupils came out with purpose in the second half as they looked to force themselves back into the game, however, it was a howler from Red Star which allowed them back into the match.A square ball across the back resulted in a mix-up between Star keeper Luke Kalache and defender Ben Forbes which allowed Donald McCallum to prod the ball home from just inside the box and Pupils were back in the game at - with eight second half minutes gone.The home side didn’t recover from this and you could sense a nervousness that gave the visitors plenty encouragement. The equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when good play from Pupils down the right by Soudan saw him get a low cross in which was met by the on-rushing run of Ryan Deans and he finished well to level the score at -.This set up a frantic finish and both sides could have nicked it towards the end. Pupils went close with a headed effort which was clawed to safety while at the other end there was a goalmouth scramble which Star couldn’t convert and both sides had to settle for a draw in the end as referee Jimmy Litster blew for full time.Red Star were dealt a blow as it emerged that captain Aaron Moore suffered a dislocated shoulder. Hopefully this will not keep him out for too long.On Saturday February , Star have another important home game as they look to move off the bottom of the table when they take on Claremont AFC.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ayr teen yob admonished after","story":"NewsAyr teen yob admonished after kicking dogThe offence occurred in Ayr’s Dalmilling Road on May  last year.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR NewsThe boy appeared at Ayr Sherf Court \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA -year-old who kicked a dog ended up in the dock at Ayr Sherf Court.

If we did not encourage change, we would still be living in caves.Mr Howardrsquos arguments have not swayed principal planning officer Carlos Clarke as he recommends that councillors reject the application and force him to cease trading from the premises.He writes: ldquoAspects of the development are acceptable, subject to conditions, particularly to rationalise the number and appearance of the ious small structures proposed.ldquoHowever, the joinerrsquos workshop and retail sales would be contrary to the local development plan, and this conflict is not overridden by other considerations.ldquoAs these elements form a signicant part of the development proposal, it would not be appropriate to delete them from a prospective consent by condition.ldquoUltimately, therefore, the application should be refused because of the proposed retail and joinerrsquos workshoprsquos conflicts with council planning policy.The proposed joinerrsquos workshop would be contrary to the local development plan in that there is inadequate justication for the proposed use on this site, which is not located within an allocated employment, mixed-use or redevelopment area, and would be potentially detrimental to the character and amenity of the surrounding area.ldquoThe proposed retail use would also be contrary to the local development plan in that the site is not within the town centre and it is not been demonstrated that there are no sequentially preferable sites closer to or within the town centre or that the proposed development would not detract from the vitality and viability of the town centre, and because the visual impact of the retail use proposed would be detrimental to the character of the surrounding area.ldquoOther material considerations do not outweigh this conflict."},{"url":null,"title":"readers-photo","story":"This photo, entitled lsquoRainy Days... rain drops and reflectionsrsquo was posted by BorderCamera Club member Hazel Dunbar.

After his first two space launch attempts ended in failure, it is no surprise that Elon Musk#s SpaceX recently took a dummy to the International Space Station.Solo ocean crossings in a sailing boat are another example of a sport that seems too risky to many.Free Solo tells of Honnold#s perfectionism but ultimately he relies on  practice, friction, magnesium carbonate chalk for his sweaty palms and his wits.Throughout the ascent, and the preamble which leads to it, including romance and his girlfriend#s struggle #to understand#, Honnold is filmed by his friends, some of whom cannot bear to watch the final solo.Extreme solo feats have existed as long as humans. The marathon developed in Ancient Greece as a solo running challenge and people still die in the st century emulating those barefoot warriors.Climbing and mountaineering has a long history of solo risk taking and many of its protagonists live relatively short lives.Some though, such as legendary Italian Walter Bonatti, were hard wired for solitary ascents. He shot to fame in the s with a solo ascent of a climb on the Dru, renamed the Bonatti Pillar, in the French alps.Bonatti finished his hard climbing career in  with a solo in winter of the north face of the Matterhorn for the centenary of that mountain#s first attempt. He passed away, aged , in bed.Up till Free Solo, many films about climbing have only been of real interest to climbers and have not made it into mainstream cinema.Using the latest techniques including drones, remote cameras, huge telephoto lenses on digital cameras from the valley floor and cameras wielded by dangling climbers has created a National Geographic movie which has transfixed audiences.Even climbers emerge after an-hour-and-a-half with sweaty palms after the glimpse into Honnold#s seemingly nihilistic world.A still of Alex Honnold during his climb.

Procuring them in the vicinity of the feasting sites would have been relatively easy.ldquoPigs are not nearly as well-suited to movement over distance as cattle and transporting them, either slaughtered or on the hoof, over hundreds or even tens of kilometres, would have required a monumental effort.ldquoThis suggests that prescribed contributions were required and that rules dictated that offered pigs must be raised by the feasting participants, accompanying them on their journey, rather than being acquired locally.The research is reported in the journal Science Advances."},{"url":null,"title":"lorry-goes-up-in-flames-and-causes-delays-on-the-m1","story":"West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue service received a call shortly after pm on Wednesday reporting a vehicle was alight heading southbound on the motorway at Lofthouse.The flames had spread to the nearby banking but no casualties were reported.Footage posted to social media showed a column of fire and smoke streaming hundreds of metres into the air and enveloping nearby homes.One witness said Robin Hood and Lofthouse, about six and a half miles south of Leeds and three and a half miles north of Wakefield, had been ldquoplunged into darkness as smoke billowed over buildings.Lofthouse and Robin Hood plunged into darkness due to a lorry fire on M @WakeExpress @LeedsNews pic gmmMnUvimdash Helen FeeleyMarch , Another described ldquohuge explosions coming from the vehicle.It is not clear what started the blaze or the cargo the lorry was carrying.Huge lorry fire on M!

The semi-retired earl, whose Lever Bros business would go on to form part of giant Unilever, believed the croftersrsquo outmoded way of le needed a visionary like him to revolutionise their communities.He believed a mechanised fishing industry with ice factory, canning and processing plants to feed his UK-wide network of businesses could end the back-breaking task of toiling the land and allow crofts to merge to create single, sprawling farms, boosting his fortunes in the process.ldquoThere was a strong aspect of late Victorian paternalism, of people in poverty and seeing the crofting way of le as a very backward one, adds Mr Robertson.ldquoHe thought these were impoverished people in need of being improved. He didnrsquot see any benefit in crofting and thought what Lewis and Harris needed were more large farms ndash dairy farms in particular ndash and that the people should go to work on the farms or in his fish processing and canning factory.Resistance came, in particular, from young men home from the First World War. Angry at having been initially promised crofts on their , they drew inspiration from the rebellious actions of the Red Clydesiders and organised themselves in military-style groups.Together they marched on crofts that Leverhulmersquos farms had swamped, and carried out a series of land grabs to take them back. Sixteen of Lord Leverhulmersquos  Lewis farms were affected, while his threat to evict the crofters drew little public or political sympathy.ldquoLeverhulme didnrsquot understand the crofts and cotters. They didnrsquot want what he was offering, it was incompatible with their lives, says Mr Robertson, a lecturer at the University of Highlands and Islands.ldquoTherersquos a Gaelic word lsquoduthcashrsquo an amalgam of a sense of heritage and a fundamental belief in common rights. They believed they had a right to inherit land ndash even land they didnrsquot own.A showdown between Lord Leverhulme and croftersrsquo representatives symbolised the yawning gap between the two.The episode is marked today by the Gress Raiders Memorial. Eventually, Lord Leverhulme gave in and switched focus to Harris, where a small fortune was ploughed into creating his modern vision in the fishing port of Obbe ndash hastily renamed Leverburgh. He died in .But the episode prompted Parliament to pass rethink croftersrsquo rights and passed the Land Settlement Scotland Act , which gave government the right to remove land from private ownership and deliver it to the people.Today, it is accompanied by more recent ldquoright to buy legislation that gives communities, such as recently happened in Ulva, the chance to push for landowners to sell land to them.Mr Robertson said: ldquoLeverhulme wanted to completely reorganise how the land was worked on Lewis and Harris.

It raises more questions than answers in my opinion.”Officers had argued that continuing with the previously-approved phased increases would be “counter-productive” in terms of encouraging usage and generating income.They also stressed that the proposed .% increase would generate an additional £, against the £, under the initial pricing policy and steer the authority towards recovering some % of its costs.Councillors heard that while the new pricing policy had been successful in meeting income targets in recent years – with facility usage remaining comparable in   to the two preceding years – the latest review had identied a number of key areas where usage trends caused some concern.The current year’s membership sales have “signicantly reduced” by % with the only area of growth being membership types which restrict users to either ‘wet’ or ‘dry’ services for a reduced rate.Membership is also the only area where actual income is predicted to be less than the previous year – down by £,.From a business perspective, Cllr Colin Pike urged caution on the introduction of any increased charges which, he said, people would notice “instantly”.He commented: “We understand that we have to make money but you don’t do that by putting prices up.”Initiatives such as incentivising existing customers to bring along a friend or relative to an activity, he said, would boost user numbers and increase revenue.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The North-east is one of the areas for which Observatree has a shortage of volunteer surveyors.

For instance, a very unexpected discovery was the presence of Roman activity at Milltimber, likely dating from around   AD. Ninety bread ovens were uncovered, which were probably constructed by the Roman army at a time of invasion led by the Roman General Agricola. However, no evidence of an associated camp was found, which is unusual for these types of features. We can only speculate as to why the ovens were in this location.“Going back to the very earliest finds, there was also evidence of stone tool production dating between about , and , BC at Milltimber, a near unprecedented body of evidence which pushes back our understanding of human activity in north east Scotland by several thousand years.”Bruce continued:“Bronze Age activity was identied from Nether Beanshill in the form of a roundhouse and contemporary cremation complex dating from around , to , BC.

They need to know what funding is available, what standards must be met and what tarfs need to be paid.#It is therefore appalling that Conservative ministers have failed to conduct an impact assessment on the impact of Brexit on sheep farming. These ministers are woefully irresponsible. Farmers deserve better.#“Behind the scenes analysis falls well short of the in-depth impact assessment that farmers and crofters deserve. It is like not doing your homework, but trying to cover the fact by saying that you put together a mind map. Simply unacceptable. By the government’s own admission, they have done nothing, and know of no work to do an impact assessment on the industry.“They have let the industry, and our farming and crofting communities down.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It’s interesting because, no matter where I go, these are the three predominant issues, and they are all related.”There are around  EIS members in Orkney.On Monday, EIS members voted to reject a new pay offer.According to Mr Ramsey, the next step will be to hold a ballot on industrial action, although the union remains open to further negotiation.“Assuming that our members decide to vote for a strike, there will be two or three weeks before that goes through,” the vice-president explained.“We intend to continue to negotiate.

Our wives, husbands, hated neighbours, loved friends, tolerated colleagues, any and all Europeans that live here will be stripped of their rights and become less than us. Less secure, less valued, less physically safe. Our institutions will be impaired, our horizons narrowed.Edinburgh will be reduced for the second time in its history. After the loss of the national parliament in , it ceased to be a capital. Within Europe, its light, relit, has burned brightly for  years, and the city has taken its place as one of the great capitals. With Brexit this light will dim. Edinburgh will be cast down into parochiality. A secondary city within a secondary region of the UK. The city of the Enlightenment will be in the same all-British bracket as Slough, Norwich, Wolverhampton.For decades our horizons have been wide open. Paris, Rome, Prague, Helsinki. Scots have found berths in every one of these places, contributing to the community they find themselves in, acting as bees in the cross pollination of good ideas that has been helping the intellectual economy and cultural integration of Europe blossom.This is Scotland’s right historic place. We are on the edge of Northern Europe. Sutherland, Caithness and much of the Western Isles, not to mention Orkney and Shetland were domains with shared populations and experiences with Iceland, Norway, Greenland. Iceland’s women are  per cent descended from Scottish and Irish women.We are just a short stretch of water from the continent, and in the past those seaways have seemed like motorways. Poland teems with the ancestors of the , Scots families that flitted across the North Sea in the s, trading the famine raging at home for opportunities abroad. Scottish surnames given Polish inflection over the years include Kietzs , Losons, Ramzes and Szynklers. The four-time mayor of Warsaw between  and  Aleksander Czamer was born Alexander Chalmers in Dyce, Aberdeenshire.: Poll: Scottish independence more popular than Theresa May’s Brexit dealMore than genetics, more than common names bind us to our European neighbours. The very words in our mouths indicate our shared past and common present. The Scots language has common words in the Scandinavian language – such as ‘bairn’ for child and ‘braw’ for good – and in Ireland, our near European neighbour, Ulster Scots retains some vibrancy. Our own Scots Gaelic started le as the Ulster dialect of Irish, the shared languages evidence of endless Hiberno-Scottish relations. In Switzerland, I was surprised to come across a ft statue of Scotland’s queen-bothering reformer John Knox, towering above a central city park. At the statue’s feet was a massive mosaic of the Lion Rampant, Scotland’s ancient emblem. Behind the statue in the old town is the Kirk of Scotland. Elsewhere in the city, you’ll find the Genevan Gaelic choir meeting, and on other nights the Swiss Scottish Country Dancing Society.Some might say that these glory days of European influence are behind us. That Europe was our past and Brexit our future. Not so. Scotland is becoming more European as the years pass, not less.There are many tens of thousands of new Scots who are absolutely European, and no vote will change that. The Polish, Baltic state, Romanian migrants and their children, many Scottish born, who make up chunks of our population are and will remain European. Their next generation will likely be at least bilingual, with one modern European language as a mother tongue. Much as the great Irish migrations have redoubled the connections between Scotland and Ireland, so too will the legacy of the more recent eastern European migrations culturally tether future Scots to those countries.This is not an article in defence of the EU. This is an article in favour of open borders, of knowledge sharing, and of cooperation. I’m aware that the EU also creates borders and enmity with Russia, with Turkey and others. But saying the EU is too exclusive and so choosing Brexit is like complaining of claustrophobia in a large public park and curing it by upturning a bucket on your head.: Brian Monteith: Only a clean Brexit break can save us nowScots are Europeans by language, by history, by ancestry, by geography and by experience. Isolated from Europe, Scotland will be heading for another period of intellectual darkness.Our famous universities are amongst the best in the world. And our population is the second best-educated in Europe, in terms of university degrees per head. This is an enviable position for a small country to be in. And it’s down exclusively to internationalism and tight European connections. Our universities certainly carry out groundbreaking research, but they generally do so with large EU grants, or in conjunction with other universities. They almost always conduct research and education with large staffs of EU nationals, who will soon become legally insecure.The impact is already being felt. Scottish universities experienced a drop-off in applicants from EU countries. EU students are vital, as, although they are generally fee-free, they have a massive economic impact on the community around the university. They rent expensive flats, spend student loans in shops and bars, and work lower-paid jobs during their studies. When they graduate many stay, making positive contributions to their community and the economy. Those that leave become positive ambassadors for Scottish education internationally.In what can only be described as an intentional and massive ‘get it right up you, Scotland’, the Home Office has committed to offering EU students three-year visas to study in the UK. Degrees in Scotland take four years. In England, most take three.Our universities provide superb education to massive numbers of working-class and lower-income Scots. They are one of the key tools in providing social mobility in Scotland. They allow us to mix with European and international students, to form relationships that last letimes, to engage in projects and enterprises across a infinite number of fields. They are Scotland’s window to the world. They are a window through which Scots can reach out and have a positive impact internationally. Brexit will do much to close that window.Holyrood has been damaged too. How can we look to the parliament in Edinburgh as anything other than a diddy wee ‘pretendy’ parliament, when it can do nothing to either prevent Brexit or gain Scotland’s independence  There’s been a pro-European, pro-independence majority in there for umpteen years, and yet we are set to lose our European citizenship thanks to an English majority in its favour.All this talk of clf edges probably isn’t correct. Instead what we’ll experience will be long, slow subsidence. A steady trickling away of blood, of energy, of vibrancy. We are, right now, an integrated European partner on the cusp of independence. A new European nation right in the crucible of formation, with all the promise that entails.If Brexit drags Scotland with it, it will take us a very, very long time to get back to the position we are currently in today.Alistair Heather is a writer and presenter and is on Twitter @Historic_Ally©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"passengers wasting money to pay for seats together on planes","story":"Passengers who pay extra to sit together when they fly are wasting their money in the vast majority of cases, an investigation has found.The inquiry found that, out of those who refused to pay the extra fee to select a seat,  per cent of passengers were seated together anyway. That figure rises to  per centRyanair is excluded from the list of airlines.The analysis of , economy passengers carried out by Which  Travel discovered that the  most popular airlines that operate paid-for seating options were asked whether or not they seat families, couples and groups together, all of them confirmed that they did - with the exception of Ryanair and Wizz Air.Families with children should be protected by the Civil Aviation Authorityguidelines, which state that airlines should ‘aim to sit parents close to children’ and that parents should not have to pay to avoid being seated away from their child. But airlines are not currently obliged to follow this advice. Some airlines – including BA, Thomas Cook and Tui – state that children under  will always be seated with at least one adult. When the CAA surveyed recent flyers last year, it found nearly one in five had paid extra for seat reservations because they were travelling with children. Meanwhile, the Royal Aeronautical Society Flight Operations Group said it believes family members sat in dferent sections of the plane may lose precious time looking for one another during an emergency evacuation, putting themselves – and others – at risk.However, Which  claimed that Ryanair ignores these guidelines and forces families to pay to sit together, citing the airline’s policy that it is compulsory for at least one adult in the group to select a paid-for seat. They can then reserve seats for free for up to four children.Rory Boland, Which  Travel Editor, said: “Unless you are flying with Ryanair or Wizz Air or fancy a little extra legroom, it’s not worth paying more to choose your seat, as you’ll be seated next to your travelling companions anyway.“It’s worrying to hear that parents are being separated from young children. It’s reprehensible for any airline to make money by splitting up families and we would encourage the regulator to examine such cases closely to ensure the guidelines are working.”He added: “Passengers with mobility issues should make their requirements clear to the airline, and be sure of your rightsthey resist – the law is on your side.”The rules concerning disability are enshrined in European law. But the CAA has warned that in some cases passengers with reduced mobility were paying extra to sit with their carer despite airline regulations meaning this should happen free of charge.Ryanair said that it “fully complies with all EU safety regulations”, while Wizz Air said the safety of its passengers was “always our number one priority”.The investigation found that some airlines allow customers to select a seat for free. ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit no deal tariff plan revealed as cost of food set to rise","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The UK Government will slash import tarfs to zero across % of goods in the event of a no deal Brexit to try avoid higher prices for consumers - but the cost of food and cars is set to rise, according to plans revealed this morning.No new tarfs or checks on goods will be introduced on trade across the land border into Northern Ireland, in order to avoid a hard border, it has also been announced.It follows the rejection by MPs of Theresa May’s Brexit deal for a second time on Tuesday night, setting up a vote this evening on whether to accept a no-deal Brexit.Ministers will seek to maintain existing protections for the lamb industry, by applying the full tarf rate to sheepmeat products entering the UK.: Six reasons why Brexit Britain can’t trust Donald TrumpOther food products such as beef and poultry will face a reduced rate compared with the rest of the world, but prices would still be expected to rise for shoppers.A .% tarf on imported cars could raise the cost of the average family vehicle by £,.Meanwhile, other industries will see the UK Government unilaterally apply a very low or zero tarf, potentially exposing them to crippling competition from foreign products.Cheddar will be protected under existing tarf rates, but other cheese products will face no tarfs, and tarfs on steel and aluminium imports will be dropped.

They were discovered by staff in a store at the Museum of Edinburgh, just a few hundred yards away from the Palace of Holyroodhouse, where Mary ruled for six years after ing from France in . The  documents, which are inidually dated, numbered and signed, relate to the rights of deacons and tradesmen in the city, the selling of meat at the Tolbooth and the making of salt in Newhaven.Early conservation work on the documents, which were recently discovered in the Museum of Edinburgh’s own storage facility off the Canongate, has revealed watermarks – one of a goat and another of a flower – which can only been seen when held up to light.It is thought the papers entered the archives of the local authority in the s, but were then “lost” before being rediscovered nearly a century later during conservation work. Intriguingly, some of the documents signed by Mary date from when she was still in France.Experts in the council’s museums and galleries service, which is responsible for the official archives of the city, said the recently unearthed documents revealed an “often overlooked “ aspect of her le.History curator Vicky Garrington said: “Together, the documents shed light on a key part of Scotland’s past. We all know the tragic story of Mary Queen of Scots, her eventful le and eventual execution in , but in these documents we see a dferent side to Mary.“Here, she can be seen carefully managing the everyday affairs of Edinburgh, both from France and Scotland. It’s fascinating to think of her reading through these official papers before carefully applying her signature.“They are staying in storage at the museum for now. But we hope to have them assessed by a conservator and for further research to be done on them by experts on Mary, after which we hope to exhibit them, which will be hugely exciting.”Museums and galleries manager Frank Little said: “We’re constantly reviewing, caring for and researching our collections, and look forward to sharing more of the city’s rich heritage with residents and visitors through our programme of exhibitions and online activities.” Council culture convener Donald Wilson said: “Our museums and galleries hold thousands of historic treasures, many of which are on display in our venues.

Over the last few weeks KPL staff have been busy ferrying equipment, supplies and crews out to it as part of the first such contract secured by the yard. During a visit, I expected to find a hive of activity the roar and clang of big machines.But on Thursday of last week I found the whole site surprisingly quiet. This, I am told, is because most of the activity is now taking place onboard what KPL directors refer to as the OGW.“The rig is crawling with insurance people and regulators right now,” says one of the directors, Simon Russell, as he shows me round. “They are all signing off their bits and pieces before the rig gets the final piece of paper that says it’s good to go.”Every weld is being stress tested. Every item of equipment is being put through its paces.Before the rig can face the punishing swells of the north Atlantic, such attention to detail is a matter of le and death.There are also inquisitive guests onboard, doing a little window shopping. They’ve been helicoptered straight on to the rig, the property of US firm Diamond Offshore. These VIPs are potential customers from major players such as Tarka Oil, here to see what the buzz is all about. While doing so, they may also be mightily impressed with Kishorn Port Ltd. That is the hope, anyway.As you are reading this, there is a good chance the Ocean GreatWhite, with a crew of  aboard, will be making its way back up the Minch. If the weather is favourable it may even be doing so under its own steam, without the need for a fleet of tugs to tow it to the Blackrock prospect, some  miles north west of Shetland.So advanced is the OGW that each corner-leg contains two enormous thrusters, powered by engines capable of generating , brake horse power of thrust. For non-petrol-heads that’s  Ferraris per engine. A top speed of eight knots is the result. Not bad for a structure that isn’t exactly designed to cut through the water. Stability is the name of game: even in the roughest seas the thrusters are meant to ensure that the rig doesn’t deviate by more than a metre from the drill point. West of Shetland, it may need every Newton of force those thrusters can provide. Once safely in place, the Ocean GreatWhite will be used by Siccar Point Energy and Shell UK to test for oil in an unexplored area of the seabed.“This is really cutting edge stuff,” enthuses Alasdair Ferguson, the other director in this   venture involving his own firm, Ferguson Transport and Shipping, and Simon’s LeithsLtd. “The rig can operate in , feet of water and drill a hole , feet deep.”In other words, that’s six miles into the earth’s crust. This is how far down we now have to go to get the black stuff. As the ‘Age of Oil’ wanes, rigs like the OGW could become the workhorses of the near future.However, the days of building giant concrete caissons to support them are long gone. Whatever finished products emerge from Kishorn in the next few years, another Ninian Central will not be among them. Deep water is where the action is – and that means floating oil rigs like the Ocean GreatWhite, a sixth-generation model designed specically to harvest the hard-to-reach hydrocarbons that now makes up much of what the UK still produces. Thankfully for Kishorn, that means west of Shetland.  According to Simon, this trend involves the “centre of gravity” shting away from Aberdeen and towards the west coast.KPL is ready and waiting for that trend to continue.“The same thing is happening with offshore wind,” says Simon. “If you look at the next round of Crown licenses you’ll see that most of them are here on the west coast.”“We want to create a multi-use facility,” adds Alasdair. “We want to build resilience into this facility so that it is not reliant on any one industry.”Offshore wind turbines need concrete caissons, albeit smaller than the Ninian Central’s. That’s another box ticked in favour of Kishorn.From about  metres away, the Ocean GreatWhite does indeed look like a floating hotel, to use Simon’s description. Unfortunately, this is as close as we are allowed to get. Obtaining insurance cover for non-crew is a minefield Diamond Offshore also doesn’t want any photographs taken of their cutting-edge equipment. So circling the rig aboard the ‘Infinity’ will have to do for us.Aside from ferrying crew to and from the Ocean GreatWhite, the ‘Infinity’ usually takes tourists out to St Kilda from the Stein jetty in Waternish. But that happens mostly in the summer.“We have been flat out doing this since the rig arrived,” says skipper Kenny Mackinnon.Regular work over the winter is good for those who don’t usually have it.In fact, the arrival of the OGW has been a boon for the area. Twelve locals have been taken on in ious positions. This is the direct benefit. There is a harder to quanty knock-on effect for local businesses in what Alasdair refers to as the “downstream supply chain”. Everything from additional bed nights to sandwiches bought in the nearest shops are covered by this concept. And there have been quite a few of those over the last six weeks.Food and lodgings for visiting crews and subcontracted workers might sound like small beer, however. But the temporary largesse created by the presence of the OGW could be the start of something much bigger.Nothing like the crazy days of the s and s, though, when a town of , people sprung up in accommodation blocks behind the dry dock. That kind of development, said Simon, will not happen again, partly because of the strain it would place on local infrastructure.  Instead, he envisions - people employed directly at the site.The prefabs of Kishorn’s heyday are long gone but the dry dock is still here, its original concrete floor as good as new, so I’m told. The faint imprint of the Ninian Central , once the biggest manmade object ever moved across the face of the Earth, is still visible a spectral impression of the past.KPL have more modest ambitions than trying to resurrect what was.Simon and Alasdair are building in small steps. They’re making progress, just at a slower pace than many would like to see.Further investment is required to speed things up. That, however, is based partly on more rigs using the yard. KPL have a few irons in the fire on that front, but nothing definite yet.“The revenue this will generate will enable us to extend one of the piers, out into the deeper water, so we can load and unload directly rather than having to ferry equipment and people back and forth,” says Alasdair.Just sixty metres from the shore Loch Kishorn reaches a depth of around  metres, easily enough to accommodate oil rigs which, it should be remembered, need taken apart when they’ve reached the end of their working lives. Decommissioning s is on the KPL menu too.If , jobs were a flash in the pan,  jobs might be the sustainable optimum. By definition, the slow build lasts longer than the quick buck.In this place of big numbers,  might be big enough."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/2110-5-October-12-150x150.jpg","title":"highland council to engage in keep left campaign through two year","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe Highland Council is to engage in a two-year programme of painting directional arrows on roads to remind tourists to drive on the left.During a recent area committee meeting in Portree, Gordon MacDonald, Highland Council#s roads manager, told local councillors that the scheme would begin in April .

It honours the UK’s solemn commitments in the Belfast Good Friday Agreement.“If we ever have to use that insurance policy, it cannot become a permanent arrangement and it is not a template for our future relationship.“The deal that MPs voted on in January was not strong enough in making that clear and legally-binding changes were needed to set that right. We have now agreed them.“The EU cannot act with the intent of applying the backstop indefinitely which can be challenged.“Now it is time to come together and back this improved deal.” Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the new agreements were an “unambiguous statement” of both sides’ “good faith and intentions” but also made it clear they did not undermine the principle of the backstop.“We have insisted that the Withdrawal Agreement could not be rewritten, and that the backstop arrangement, while intended to be temporary, must continue to apply unless and until it is replaced by future arrangements that can achieve the same objective, namely no hard border,” he said.“However, we have also said that we were prepared to offer guarantees and further reassurances and to the UK of our good faith and intentions – indeed we have offered such reassurances on many occasions.“The Instrument agreed yesterday puts those assurances on a legal footing and represents an unambiguous statement by both parties of what has been agreed. “It does not reopen the Withdrawal Agreement, or undermine the backstop or its application. “It says that we will work together, in good faith, in pursuit of a future relationship that ensures that the objectives of the Protocol, particularly the need to avoid a hard border, are met. “The documents agreed yesterday reiterate our wish to establish a future partnership with the UK that is as close as possible, and marks our commitment to ensure that negotiations on that future relationship can begin as soon as the UK leaves. “The instrument agreed sets out how we will go about this important work. “In many ways, Brexit has been a dark cloud over us for many months, and particularly the threat of no deal. A positive vote tonight can remove that cloud and restore confidence and optimism in Britain, Ireland and across the European Union. “We now need to see the Withdrawal Agreement ratied by Westminster and by the European Parliament without further delay, so that we can get on with the important work of building the closest possible relationship between the EU and the UK, and between the UK and Ireland, post Brexit. “I know feel that for the remains of the day, we need to give MPs in Westminster the time and space to consider what#s now on the table.” All eyes now turn to UK Attorney General Geoffrey Cox who will later today give his considered assessment of whether what Mrs May has secured is legally binding. His response is expected to be key in deciding what way Brexit hardliners – notably Jacob Rees-Mogg’s ERG and the DUP – will vote this evening.

But now, it seems the only paths are to see a catastrophic no deal outcome, the Government working across the House of Commons to find a softer version of Brexit, or reconsidering Brexit in its entirety,# she said.“In the short run, taking a no deal off the table must be the immediate priority. In itself and without a clear plan, this resolves nothing. The House of Commons is good at saying what it is against, but can’t manage to give a clear answer on what it is for. But the UK is too close to the clf-edge and every day of uncertainty sees more and more economic and social damage.“The clearest, most coherent and most democratic route through this impasse lies with a People’s Vote, including both the Prime Minister’s deal and the Remain option. This needs to be tested in Parliament as a matter of urgency.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"two more people to stand trial linked to meli case","story":"TWO more people are to stand trial on offences arising out of the murder of Christopher Meli.-year-old Daniel McManus, of Springbank Drive, and Shannon McIIwaine , of Glenalina Park, both in West Belfast, appeared at Belfast Crown Court on Friday for a ruling on their case.Mr Justice Colton dismissed applications by their legal teams to have charges of affray dismissed on the grounds of insufficient evidence.The senior judge said that although they were not accused of engaging in violence on the night of Mr Meli’s murder in December , he had come to the conclusion, “that their conduct taken at its height is sufficient to put each of the defendants on trial for affray.”Dismissing the application, Mr Justice Colton added: “I am satisfied that the affray took place in a public place and in such a manner that a bystander or reasonably firm character might reasonably expect it to be terrying.” Following his ruling, both defendants were formally arraigned on a single count that they “unlawfully displayed force and made affray” on December, , .Both replied “not guilty” and were released on continuing bail ahead of the start of their trial on September .In January this year, six other people were ed for trial in connection with Mr Meli’s murder.Three are charged with murdering the -year-old father-of-one, while their co-accused face other charges linked to alleged incidents on the evening.Mr Meli was beaten to death at Doc’s Path in the Glasvey Close area of Twinbrook.At the time police, believed up to  young people were involved in a number of violent incidents that culminated in his death.All six accused appeared at Belfast Crown Court where they heard the trial could last up to  weeks.The trio accused of murdering Mr Meli are Caolan Lavertyof Belfast Road in Glenavy, Stephen McCannof Dundrinne Road in Castlewellan and -year-old Lee Smyth, who was living at an undisclosed address in County Antrim.

Some say economic doom and gloom while others argue it would give the UK the freedom to strike its own favourable trade deals with trading partners around the globe.What happensMPs can’t agree on a deal One option is to request an extension to the transition period beyond the current agreed deadline of March .Would the UK get an extension It would have to be agreed by the EU’s remaining  members states.How long could the extension last It would probably last no longer than May  because otherwise the UK would theoretically have to elect a new set of MEPs to the European Parliament.Would a Brexit extension solve anything It would give the UK more time to end the current stalemate.

With a decision due on prosecutions later this week, Lord Ramsbothan, who was military assistant to the British Army’s Chief of General Staff at the time of the massacre said putting ex-soldiers on trial \"would set a dangerous precedent.\"Mr McCartney said: “These comments are yet another attempt by figures within the British establishment to influence the due process of law, specically in relation to Bloody Sunday prosecutions and more generally in relation to the wider legacy process.“We have heard similar outbursts from the British Secretary of State Karen Bradley and her Prime Minister Theresa May who repeatedly and ly claim that legacy investigations are unfairly weighted against State forces.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh\"The British Government’s intent is about protecting British soldiers who were responsible for killing Irish citizens and who colluded with loyalist death squads throughout the conflict.“That is completely unacceptable. There can be no immunity of impunity for British soldiers guilty of crimes in Ireland. No legislation that puts them above the law and no deviation from the legacy mechanisms agreed at Stormont House five years ago.\"Mr McCartney concluded: “These mechanisms need to be enacted and the Stormont House Agreement implemented as the only way to deal with the legacy issue.”"},{"url":null,"title":"universal credit north next says sdlp candidate rory farrell","story":"SDLP Ballyarnett election candidate, Rory Farrell, has said ‘the North is next’ after it was revealed that the Tory Government is pressing ahead with the controversial Universal Credit roll-out.Work  Pensions Secretary, Amber Rudd, announced on Monday that existing benefits claimants in Harrogate, Yorkshire will move to Universal Credit in July.Universal Credit is a new benefit replacing Jobseekers Allowance, Income Support, Employment  Support Allowance, Housing Benefit and Tax Credits. Up until now only new benefit claimants or those with a change in circumstances have been moved to Universal Credit.This new announcement paves the way for all existing benefit claimants to transfer to Universal Credit. The Tory Government expects all claimants to be moved to Universal Credit by December .Mr Farrell said: \"There are no good news stories about Universal Credit and the announcement by Amber Rudd will set alarms bells ringing across the North.\"This will ultimately affect thousands of people across Derry and Strabane.\"We have over , JSA claimants. Nearly , people on Income Support. And over , people in receipt of ESA. Not to mention the , families and iniduals receiving tax credits.\"These are massive numbers of people and the looming introduction of Universal Credit will cause uncertainty and concern for every one of them.\"Universal Credit is the cornerstone of the Tory Governments Welfare Reform project. It was designed by the Tories, but delivered by the DUP, Sinn Fein and Alliance. The SDLP voted against all welfare cuts and we continue to oppose on a daily basis.\"\"Universal Credit should be scrapped. It is causing untold damage in our communities and the sick, the unemployed and those on low incomes are paying the price.\"googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot

The second half continued to be a feisty affair and a great spectacle for the neutral spectator.With the lowered sun in Ballynahinchrsquos eyes, Ballymena did the smart thing and constantly took the high router, creating numerous scoring opportunities for Ballymena.Unfortunately, for lsquoHinch, their lead didnrsquot last too long as Ballymena bounced back with another great counter-attacking goal to make it -.It was end-to-end stuff, like the first half, the best of the chances falling to Millar, McIlwaine and Campbell only to be denied by the hard-working Ballymena defence and lsquokeeper.Cards were shown to both sides with William Edgar, Andrew Mulholland and Tim Crean doing time on the sideline.Ballymena had decent short corner chances, but were closed down well by Ashley Brown, Rea Coffey and of course Aaron Donnell.lsquoHinch had a few shorts of their own, but couldnrsquot convert. With  minutes remaining on the clock, Ballynahinch patiently played the ball around the back, waiting for an opening.Ashley Brownrsquos pass then found the lurking Stuart Hunter in space. Hunter was able to pick out roaming right back Leslie Harrison, who pulled a perfect pass back into Millar and he made no mistake in finding the net.Ballynahinch could easily have sat back and closed up shop, but they pinned Ballymena into their own half with a series of concerted attacks.Congratulations to everyone involved with the Ballynahinch menrsquos team, especially the supporters who never miss a game.The celebrations were short-lived as Ballynahinch have a huge game this weekend when they face Portrush in Coleraine in the Irish Hockey Challenge semi-final at pm.Ballynahinch: Aaron Donnell, Rea Coffey, Andrew Mulholland , Ashley Brown, Leslie Harrison, Matthew Martin, Stuart Hunter, William Edgar,Tim Crean, Jason Campbell, Alex Millar, Andrew McIlwaine, Luke Curry, Micheal Carney, Josh Higginson, Steven Crean.Joint men of the match: Alex Millar and Rea Coffey.Ballynahinch Ballymena ULSTER INTER LEAGUE.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£2m tidal turbine providing energy spins in to action  ","story":"A poundm tidal turbine currently in Strangford Lough could provide electricity for between - homes, it has been revealed.The Scottish firm behind the innovative Subhub has said that energy produced from the fast-flowing lough could cost as low as p per kWH for local industrial load customers.However, the Subhub is not connected to the local electricity grid and is being tested for its environmental impact and maintenance needs.The distinctive yellow Subhub mdash which is roughly the size of of a bus mdash has been in Castleward Bay for the last six weeks.Easily seen from Portaferry, it was towed from Belfast Harbour and fixed into position within  hours on January .Jeremy Smith, managing director of QED Naval, said that Strangford Lough was chosen over the Orkneys for the Subhubrsquos final commissioning before being made available for the global market.Mr Smith explained: ldquoThe Subhub is a foundation structure for tidal turbines and provides a means of transporting and fixing tidal turbines to the sea bed.ldquoWe want to prove the environmental credentials of Subhub after developing it since .ldquoWe selected Strangford Lough as the commissioning site specically as it had the iants of conditions that Orkney hadnrsquot.

Lyng took the resultant penalty, but it was saved by a combination of Karen Haughey and then Sara-Louise Carr in the last action of the half.The second period followed a similar trend as Clonduff dominated the third quarter, Sara-Louise Carr banging over her third point and Gribben, who was picking up so much ball around the middle third, putting four between them once more from a placed ball.Gailltiacuter took over from then on, but will rue near-misses with shots for goal from Jackman, Carroll and Fitzgerald.The latter reduced the margin to the minimum with three scores, the third from play in the th minute after wonderful work by Kate Lynch, but crucially Gribben responded with a fantastic conversion of a free outside the  after a heavy challenge on Megan OrsquoReilly.Lyng made it a one-point game once more from a free, but Clonduff defended resolutely to hold out.Clonduff: K Haughey, N OrsquoHagan, J Boden, S Murphy, C McGilligan, E Rafferty, F Carr , B Fitzpatrick, C Cowan, C Fitzpatrick, SL Carr , P Gribben , O Gribben, K McGilligan.

In fact, the South Eastern Trust has been concentrating for some time on trying to find suitable day surgical services which could be delivered in Downpatrick.Miss Ritchie said it appears ldquovery short sighted to relocate services from the Downe to other hospitals, suggesting the bedding down of eye surgery will result in the increased requirement for theatre access for ENT and other services.She added: ldquoAs the Downe has high level computerised technology theatres, it is important that full use is made of them to ensure continued local accessibility to day surgery services at the point of delivery.ldquoI have already written to the Trust urging that ENT surgical clinics are retained in the Downe Hospital.Also this week, Miss Ritchie has issued a fresh call for a permanent MRI scanner to be installed in Downpatrick.She said that for a number of years the local community has been involved in trying to secure a permanent scanner which health chiefs agree is a necessity.She added: ldquoI understand that the permanent facility is subject to a business case which needs a Minister in place to approve. Whilst the devolved institutions remain in cold storage, the approval of such a facility will probably take some time.ldquoIn the meantime, a mobile scanner has been located at the Downe for a limited period to deal with a current overburdened service at the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald. I hope this unit can remain in place until the business case for the permanent scanner has been approved.A South Eastern Trust spokeswoman has confirmed that there are no plans to reduce the number of ENT sessions delivered at the Downpatrick hospital.She added: ldquoThe Trust is planning to increase ENT clinics at the Downe and to relocate an ENT day surgery session from Downpatrick to the Lagan Valley Hospital to facilitate the cataract elective care centre prototype work..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Food firm to create 125 jobs with £17m investment  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK is in line for a major jobs boost.Finnebrogue Artisan has this week unveiled plans to create  new jobs as part of a poundm investment in an ultra-modern nitrite-free bacon facility.The news comes just weeks after the firm unveiled details of a poundm investment in a new vegan and vegetarian factory to support  jobs.Already one of the districtrsquos leading employers and widely regarded as one of Northern Irelandrsquos most innovative food producers, Finnebrogue Artisanrsquos latest investment is being supported by Invest NI.The new manufacturing facility is for the production of the companyrsquos nitrite-free bacon, hailed by many experts as a breakthrough in the food processing sector when it was unveiled to wide acclaim in January last year.The Naked Bacon range is now widely available in leading supermarkets across the UK, with Invest NI offering the Downpatrick company over pound.m of support towards the capital investment in the new nitrate-free bacon facility.The  new posts are expected to be created by , supporting  posts already in place at the ultra-modern plant outside Downpatrick.Finnebrogue chairman Denis Lynn says it has been known for decades that nitrites used in curing meat can cause cancer.ldquoThatrsquos why, despite being the UKrsquos leading top tier sausage maker, we refused to make a single rasher of bacon until we could figure out a way to make it better and safer, he continued.ldquoWe always set out to make food the best it can be, without being bound by the way it has always been done.

The development proposal includes plans for almost  parking spaces, eight of which are reserved for mountain rescue team members.A new pedestrian crossing at the Bryansford Road junction with Shimna Road forms part of the proposal and while planners have received  objections, they have also received five letters in support of the proposal.In papers submitted ahead of next weekrsquos meeting, planners confirm that none of the statutory consultees, including the Department for Infrastructure, Rivers Agency, Environment Agency and the local environmental health department, have lodged any objections to the redevelopment of the former school site.They confirm that roads officials are content that the proposed development will not have any ldquoadverse impact on the existing road infrastructure and is acceptable in terms of road safety.Planners are also insisting that the indicative designs of both the new store and mountain rescue centre would not be inappropriate in this part of the resort.They say it is acknowledged that there are ldquoobvious restrictions for the redevelopment of the existing Lidl store in Railway Street and there are no alternative vacant sites in the town centre which can accommodate the supermarketrsquos needs.ldquoA suitable brownfield site has become available at the edge of the town centre which could accommodate the proposal and has met the requirements of strategic planning policy, say planners.They also confirmed that a study of the impact of the new store on existing retailers shows the proposed investment will not have any ldquosignicant or unacceptable impact on Newcastle town centre.Environmental health officials say they have no objection in principle to the investment, provided conditions are attached restricting hours of business and deliveries, with planners concluding that the overall impact of the proposal, which is close to a number of homes, is not considered to be ldquosignicantly detrimental to warrant a refusal of the application.Lidl has confirmed it plans to develop a new , square metre supermarket, explaining it opted to redevelop the former primary school site as there are limited opportunities to redevelop the storersquos current base at Railway Street in the resort.Lidl says it has been looking for alternative premises in Newcastle town centre for over a decade without success and that while properties have become available, none were suitable because they were too small.It says the current sales area at its Railway Street base is is too small for the store to carry a full range of goods, pointing to narrow aisles with limited circulation space. The company says the car park is too small and fails to meet its requirements, with the general customer experience falling short of a modern food store.Planners say that having assessed the ious planning policies and having regard to all representations made, all consultees engaged and all other material considerations, it is found that the proposal is acceptable in planning terms and approval is recommended..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Newcastle’s pop up beach back on agenda of council  ","story":"A DECISION to reject a proposal for a pop-up beach in Newcastle has been overturned.Last month, a Newry, Mourne and Down Council Committee recommended not to proceed with the articial beach mdash similar to those in Paris and other parts of Europe ndash at the townrsquos promenade.However, the decision was overturned at Monday nightrsquos meeting of the full council when it was agreed to seek funding for the pop-up beach and develop a business case which could pave the way for its introduction.But not all councillors agreed, with Sinn Fein members rejecting it. They said there were health and safety concerns associated with the beach. They expressed support for transporting sand by road from Ballykinlar to Newcastle promenade and implementing an enhanced beach management plan.The radical suggestion to bring a touch of French summer flair to Newcastle was initially discussed last September when it was agreed to further explore the idea, with the initial focus on the cost of developing such a facility.The idea was suggested because of the lack of sand on Newcastle beach.Pop up beaches along the banks of the Seine and other cities and towns across Europe are hugely popular and some local politicians believe they can be a success in Newcastle.Council officials have confirmed that while Newcastle promenade is not suitable for pop-up beaches, two areas adjacent to the Downs Road car park would be suitable and that the cost over a nine-week period would be pound,.At last monthrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee, politicians rejected the pop-up proposal and agreed to seek a meeting with the Environment Agency to discuss securing a marine licence to transport sand from Ballykinlar to Newcastle.It was also suggested that groins would be placed along sections of beach to protect the sand and a programme of better beach management introduced.

However, it is not workable.ldquoI have been advised in no uncertain terms by a iety of coastal erosion experts that importing sand to Newcastle or removing stones from the beach simply wonrsquot work due to the movement of sediment and that permission to do this work would be denied by central government.ldquoAs a councillor for Newcastle, I want to improve our tourism product and the pop-up beach proposal is simply my suggestion to try and do something dferent. I also recognise that an articial beach would have to be properly managed and maintained.Cllr Devlin added: ldquoA pop-up beach could not just be created at the start of the summer and left. It would have to be adequately cleaned and looked after. As a mother, I would not want my child playing in dirty sand so the management and cleanliness of the pop up beach is essential.ldquoThis suggestion wonrsquot be without itrsquos issues, but surely as a council it is our job to try and make improvements and better our area where possible, expressing disappointment Sinn Fein opposed her proposal.Sinn Feinrsquos Willie Clarke argued that there was no appetite for a pop-up beach and that the suggestion to move sand from Ballykinlar to Newcastle was to replace the hundreds of tonnes which drt away on a seasonal basis.He continued: ldquoHow are you going to manage a pop-up beach that will be filled with stagnant sand  There is the potential for both dogs and young infants to foul the sand and other health and safety issues which need to be addressed.ldquoWill the sand be cleaned every day  What measures will be taken to prevent sand from blowing up Main Street  Local people and traders want to see a sandy beach, not a pop-up beach. I believe it is a no brainer that we try to secure Environment Agency agreement to place sand on the beach.Cllr Clarke said part of the pleasure of going to the beach was being able to go into the water and suggested that a pop-up beach could not provide such an experience.He added: ldquoWe need to look at anti-social behaviour issues associated with pop-up beaches which could contain broken glass.

Murray launched the ball high into orbit and wasnrsquot the least bit surprised when the wind took over and helped it on its way to the top right hand corner of the net with Ross clutching at thin air.Six minutes later at the other end Anton McGrattan struck yet another free kick from just outside the box past Ryan Walsh to bring the sides level.Olympic continued to see more of the ball, but Jones, when he did receive the ball out wide, was let down on a few occasions by a lack of support in the box and some wasteful finishing from Shane Murray.Kilmore were far from out of it and the bustling Joe McKinney was proving a handful and he almost gave the visitors a nd minute lead when he shot wide after a sizzling breakaway run from Anton McGrattan.Murray missed another good chance for Olympic after Jones carved out another opening before Kilmore seized the lead.Callum Dougan foraged deep and played a delightful through ball into the path of McKinney, who had beaten the offside trap. McKinney wasnrsquot for hanging around and after shrugging off Stevie McGoran, herounded lsquokeeper Walsh to make it -.The unrelenting wind and rain greeted both sets of players back for the second half and it was Kilmore who went on the offensive with Ryan Slavin being denied by Walsh.Two minutes later Kilmore shot themselves in the foot when Murray floated a free kick into the box and Jason Noade had all the time in the world to head the ball past Ross.Things became hot and heavy for a while with the tackles flying in, but clear cut chances at either end were hard to come by.Kilmore were now asking most of the questions, but a resolute Olympic rearguard refused to budge and Walsh had relatively little to do, apart from the odd shot from distance.Extra-time produced little of note, but Kilmore could have wrapped things up in the second period when McKinney crossed for Pete Casey, but, for once, he sliced his effort into no manrsquos land.Jones, Jason and Stevie Noadersquos first three penalties were perfect for Olympic, but they were matched by McGivern, McKinney and Larkin for Kilmore.Adam McLean nudged Olympic - ahead before Anton McGrattan fired his effort wide, advantage Olympic.Murrayrsquos first attempt was saved by Ross, but the referee made him retake the penalty as he insisted Ross had moved forward off his line. Murray was not about to look a gt horse in the mouth and drilled his second attempt to the net, much to the despair of a mightily aggrieved Kilmore side.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Dalton Tate, Aaron McClean, Jason Noade, Ryan Noade, Stevie McGoran, Stevie Noade, Ryan Molloy, Shane Murray, Niall Murray.

I will be briefing people about how we are striving for a sensible deal which works for every part of the United Kingdom as well as our neighbours in the Republic of Ireland. It is important that Dublin and Brussels are in deal-making mode.” Mrs Foster added: “This is a week in Washington where the voice of a ing Northern Ireland Executive should be heard. Many in DC have a keen interest in Northern Ireland. They should be aware that one party alone is blocking the restoration of devolution and preventing local decisions being taken in Northern Ireland.“For two years Sinn Fein have been putting their own narrow interests ahead of schools, hospitals, roads and our economy.

The development connects to the entrance to Murch Road.After complaints from residents of vehicles tracking mud from the site across the nearby Murch Road, Barratt have promised to introduce improved wheel washing facilities.Plaid Cymru Community Councillor Chris Franks said residents had spoken to him to express their frustrations.He said: ldquoThe mud has splattered cars and made the whole area dirty. It is also a hazard to pedestrians.ldquoIt is illegal to deposit mud on the public highway. Why the Conservative Independent Council has been so ineffective is beyond me.ldquoNot content with creating these awful conditions a trench has been excavated across the entrance to the busy Medical Centre.ldquoThis resulted in the entrance being narrowed.The failure to engage with the Medical Centre is a disgrace.The trench excavation was carried out by the Gas Transportation Company Ltd in a separate development.The medical centre used Facebook to warn residents attempting to access the site that contractors had partially blocked the entrance.Plaid Councillor Richard Grigg said: ldquoThis site has been operational since last summer.ldquoIt is only now that hopefully a decent wheel wash has been installed.ldquoWhy has the County Council been so uncaring about this situation ldquoThey have a duty to protect the community.ldquoThe site which was sold to the builders by the council for millions has been a real problem with huge contractorsrsquo vehicles causing chaos on local roads. The planning process has totally failed Dinas Powys.Steve Williams, managing director of Barratt Homes South Wales, said: ldquoWe always strive to minimise the effects of construction and apologise to anyone who has been inconvenienced by work in Dinas Powys.ldquoWe have a jet wash on site during opening hours to clean the tyres of vehicles leaving the development throughout the day.The construction is part of the Local Development Plan that will see , new homes built in the Vale of Glamorgan over the next eight years.Planning permission had been granted in February , despite criticisms of the impact that the new site would have on congestion in and around Dinas Powys, which, planning officers confirmed, is already at maximum capacity.While acknowledging extra homes would generate more traffic, officers said increases would be negligible and traffic around Murch Road and Cardf Road would be over capacity in several years regardless. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

The development connects to the entrance to Murch Road.After complaints from residents of vehicles tracking mud from the site across the nearby Murch Road, Barratt have promised to introduce improved wheel washing facilities.Plaid Cymru Community Councillor Chris Franks said residents had spoken to him to express their frustrations.He said: ldquoThe mud has splattered cars and made the whole area dirty. It is also a hazard to pedestrians.ldquoIt is illegal to deposit mud on the public highway. Why the Conservative Independent Council has been so ineffective is beyond me.ldquoNot content with creating these awful conditions a trench has been excavated across the entrance to the busy Medical Centre.ldquoThis resulted in the entrance being narrowed.The failure to engage with the Medical Centre is a disgrace.The trench excavation was carried out by the Gas Transportation Company Ltd in a separate development.The medical centre used Facebook to warn residents attempting to access the site that contractors had partially blocked the entrance.Plaid Councillor Richard Grigg said: ldquoThis site has been operational since last summer.ldquoIt is only now that hopefully a decent wheel wash has been installed.ldquoWhy has the County Council been so uncaring about this situation ldquoThey have a duty to protect the community.ldquoThe site which was sold to the builders by the council for millions has been a real problem with huge contractorsrsquo vehicles causing chaos on local roads. The planning process has totally failed Dinas Powys.Steve Williams, managing director of Barratt Homes South Wales, said: ldquoWe always strive to minimise the effects of construction and apologise to anyone who has been inconvenienced by work in Dinas Powys.ldquoWe have a jet wash on site during opening hours to clean the tyres of vehicles leaving the development throughout the day.The construction is part of the Local Development Plan that will see , new homes built in the Vale of Glamorgan over the next eight years.Planning permission had been granted in February , despite criticisms of the impact that the new site would have on congestion in and around Dinas Powys, which, planning officers confirmed, is already at maximum capacity.While acknowledging extra homes would generate more traffic, officers said increases would be negligible and traffic around Murch Road and Cardf Road would be over capacity in several years regardless. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

The event ran from Saturday March  to Tuesday March .The Vale brewery Tomos and Lilford produced a special beer called ldquoCarnival - Penarth Pale Ale.Meanwhile the two Penarth butchers, Thompson Family Butchers and David Lush Butchers, both created their own special Penarth carnival sausages.The organisers estimated that more than  people took part in costume in the walk through town on Saturday, which saw the coronation of the lsquoFirst Foolrsquo at am. The procession marched from Sully Terrace through town.At .am in Penarth Library, there was a presentation of the head of Bendigeidfran, from The Mabinogion. The head was made by children from Cogan and Penygarth schools.The lsquoFirst Foolrsquo was then sent by train to the Tower of London to bring news of the Carnival to the traditional resting place of the head of Bendigeidfran, where he met the Raven Master.Long distance cyclist Dave Hann was due to cycle to Harlech, north Wales to raise money for the RNLI Penarth, and bring news to Harlech that Carnival had broken out in Penarth.Unfortunately Mr Hann only got as far as Cardigan before Storm Freya made it too dangerous to continue. Organisers have one barrel of carnival ale left and will take it to Harlech by train in the next few weeks to share it and the storybook of the carnival.On Sunday, two rugby teams took part in a ldquotug-o-sausage to decide which butcherrsquos sausage was better. Congratulations were extended to the winners, Team Thompson.Congratulations were also extended to the traders Ener-chi and Lilypad by the organisers, for having the best-dressed shop windows. Particular praise was singled out for the carnival flowers at Holm House Hotel created by Lilypad.Further nights of partying, songs and dancing were spotted in the Albion, St Faganrsquos Castle, and other pubs, bars and venues across Penarth. There were also celebrations on the Penarth Pier on Tuesday night following a Pancake Day event, while wandering bands of musicians like Wonderbrass kept spirits high.The festival culminated in a grand Mardis Gras party on Tuesday, which saw crowds of costumed residents dance the night away.Richard Parry, one of the carnival organisers, said: ldquoToday is Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent. Carnival finished last night on Mardi Gras.ldquoThanks to everyone who took part, contributed, encouraged, sponsored, smiled and partied, especially those people who took a carnival Bank Holiday Monday.ldquoIt was fabulous to hear your Carnival Bank Holiday stories, and to all those people who have had little private carnival moments of joy over the festival, thatrsquos what it has all been about.ldquoAnd some people have already said, lsquosee you next year!rsquoldquoThere were lots of people laughing and smiling on the sidelines, telling me they wanted to take part next year ndash just with a little more notice next time. But now itrsquos established, wersquoll be back next year and ready for even more people to join in the fun! article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Wersquore creating work which is not really necessary.If we want to improve the gateway there are other ways of doing it.ldquoIt really doesnrsquot begin to tackle the active travel . I do feel this is about spending the money before next February.Councillors were told the widened roundabout was one part of a wider strategy for transport improvements in Penarth.Charlotte Pugh, senior planner for the council, said the new scheme would transform the area.She said: ldquoThis whole are is going to be completely transformed. At the moment it is not very welcoming to pedestrians.ldquoI think it will go some way to transforming this gateway into Penarth and make it a safer environment.Previous plans to make part of Plassey Street one-way to incoming traffic, and removing the roundabout altogether, were dropped following opposition from the public.The committee agreed to endorse the transport scheme but requested regular updates on the wider transport plans for Penarth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The PM was forced into a corner, forced to concede that she might have to rule out No Deal and extend Article , and the Labour Party came out decisively for putting this issue back to the people.And this week we saw the Government attempt to win over MPs with a fund it claims will boost less well-off towns after Brexit ndash but in another shambolic aspect to this hapless attempt to bribe MPs into voting for Theresa Mayrsquos so-called deal, there is no cash for Welsh towns.Another example of the Tories letting Wales down, and yet further reason to support the push for a final say on Brexit for the public through a Peoplersquos Vote. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Last month I met with constituents over disruption to local rail services. I know that many of you will have experienced delays and cancellations to services in the weeks following the handover of the Wales Rail Franchise. I understand and share the frustration that these delays have caused. There has been a shortage of rolling stock as a result of a large maintenance backlog following the handover of the franchise together with planned changes to rail services. This has led to a signicant reduction in services and replacement bus services. I have been in contact with the Minister for Transport and Transport for Wales to raise the concerns of constituents. I have been assured that service levels are now back to normal and they do not anticipate any restrictions to services in the coming year. I will of course maintain my interest to see that those assurances are kept. I will update residents again on future plans to deliver improved station facilities, trains and more regular services.As many of you are aware Cardf Bus has recently announced changes to bus services across Cardf and the Vale. A number of bus routes are at risk as part of these changes. The removal of bus links for work, social links and public services, including hospital routes, would have a signicant impact on my constituents.Cardf Bus are not acting to deliberately hurt our communities. Far from being an uncaring organisation Cardf Bus are stuck with a legal framework that stops them from operating on the same basis as commercial competitors. Competitors can cherry pick and target single profitable routes that undermine the wider social propose that most of us want from local bus services. Cardf Councilrsquos Labour leadership has committed to supporting at risk bus services for  years. Unless the Conservative leadership of the Vale Council agrees to Labour councillors amendments to the budget and protects local bus services in the Vale then bus routes will go. The Vale Council leadership could and should act. If they donrsquot then my constituents will suffer.In future, the regulation of buses is the answer. London was the only part of the UK that was allowed to keep a regulated bus service. It is no mistake that it has the best and most coherent service. We now have the legislative powers to regulate bus services here in Wales. The Welsh Government is currently consulting on proposals to reform bus and taxi services in Wales. More information on the consultation can be found at: https:beta.gov.wales improving-public-transport. The consultation closes on th March ndash please do get in touch and take part. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We can pass motions ruling out no deal until wersquore blue in the face but it will make no dference unless there are options that this House will support.The principle aim of the amendment he said was to make sure that Brexit is ldquoas smooth as possible for citizens and businesses.Brexit advocates lsquostill chasing unicornsrsquoIrish premier Leo Varadkar has said that people who advocated for Brexit has been chasing unicorns for a ldquovery long time.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar speaking at the US Chamber of Commerce in Washington DC Speaking to the press at the US Chamber of Commerce in Washington he said: ldquoAs we head into the next few weeks it should be blatantly obvious that unicorns only exist in fairy tales.ldquoI would say to people who advocated Brexit ndash is this really what they wanted, protectionism, borders, tarfs, restrictions on trade.ldquoIs this really what Brexit was all about.

right, adding legislation issued by the Westminster Government to empower Northern Irelandrsquos civil servants to take decisions is ldquosustainable at the moment and it is hoped the executive can be restored.Mr Gove went on: ldquoBut it is also clear that the current situation with no executive would be very, very dficult to sustain in the uniquely challenging context of a no-deal exit.ldquoNow we, in the circumstances that the House has voted for no-deal, would have to start formal engagement with the Irish government about further arrangements for providing strengthened decision-making in

we are ruling out the complete collapse of all our legal and trading arrangements with the Continent.Mr Gove replied: ldquoHis point is correct, the motion commits the Government not to leave on March th without a Withdrawal Agreement, I hope that is clear and unambiguous, but the motion also makes clear that the default position in law is that we do leave the EU unless we can secure assent to a withdrawal agreement.Mr Gove said it was ldquoso disappointing the Government did not secure a mandate last night.Soubry queries whipping plansA cross-party amendment to take no deal off the table may

January she has spent ldquomore than  hours at the despatch box, and: ldquoHas shown fortitude, tenacity, thoughtfulness, diligence ndash and above all an unselfish and unstinting patriotism.Mr Gove

Procuring them in the vicinity of the feasting sites would have been relatively easy.ldquoPigs are not nearly as well-suited to movement over distance as cattle and transporting them, either slaughtered or on the hoof, over hundreds or even tens of kilometres, would have required a monumental effort.ldquoThis suggests that prescribed contributions were required and that rules dictated that offered pigs must be raised by the feasting participants, accompanying them on their journey, rather than being acquired locally.The research is reported in the journal Science Advances..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Ancient Britons travelled hundreds of miles to Stonehenge  uraves u article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

How did you get started in the industry  When we first opened Asia Supermarket in , it was the family’s ambition to bring a taste of home to Belfast. We brought the Chinese culture to the local community through cuisine and provided authentic and tasty ingredients for the hospitality trade here. We branched out due to demand to also provide Indian, Korean, Philippine, Thai and Middle Eastern food and are always looking for opportunities to extend our range. Typically, who are your clients or customers  Our customers would be both wholesale and retail to include restaurants all over Northern Ireland, as well as consumers who want to create some unique dishes in their home kitchens. Do you enjoy what you do, and what in particular  Yes, and in particular having just completed the new build we have enjoyed being involved in the day-to-day aspects, given the bespoke nature of the project, coupled with the hustle and bustle of the day to day challenges of satisfying our customer needs. What is the most dficult part of your job  One of the most dficult parts of the job is sourcing good quality produce at competitive prices and enhancing the range of products available. However, we’re very proud of our new supermarket and warehouse which provides even more quality and choice for our customers. What are the challenges facing your sector, and the economy in general  One of the biggest challenges facing our sector is the cost of goods from our suppliers, particularly those procured in foreign currencies which in turn has a knock-on effect on what we charge our wholesale and retail customers. To maintain our share of the market we constantly endeavour to get the best prices from our suppliers so that we can pass on competitive prices to our customers to maintain and grow our market share. With Brexit looming it will bring a major impact on imports costs and supplier prices which will present a major challenge for our business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cleaver_1.jpg","title":"is the future bright for the ni energy market","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by Ulster Business It is clear that there are a number of signicant challenges facing the energy sector in Northern Ireland but where there are challenges, there are also opportunities, according to law firm Cleaver Fulton Rankin.The ExecutiveNorthern Ireland has just completed its second year without a ing local government and in the words of David Sterling, head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, the Civil Service is “… doing everything we can in the prevailing circumstances…but civil servants cannot take the place of ministers when it comes to strategic policy development or in taking transformative decisions”.  This is very much the case with regard to energy policy. The Department of the Economy’s Strategic Energy Framework, which was endorsed by the Executive in , has over the last nine years, led to some very positive changes to the energy generation and supply mix, particularly from renewable sources.However the  year framework is nearing its end and needs to be replaced. The Department is making such preparations as it can on a draft Strategic Energy Framework across the areas of heat, electricity, transport and energy efficiency which it aims to make public some time in the spring. Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down. So despite the apparent obstacles and challenges, there is opportunity for development and progress in Northern Ireland’s energy sector. The benefits for Northern Ireland will be in terms of security of supply, price and environmental sustainability. Cleaver Fulton Rankin,  Bedford Street, Belfast BT FW.

The proposal for the work to Broadcasting House on Ormeau Avenue in Belfast was approved last March by the BBC board, with the announcement made to staff by the BBCs director general Lord Tony Hall. Now, the plans – which include the redevelopment of the exisiting BBC Broadcasting House building, including the refurbishment and extension of the buildings – will be put to the public, as part of a necessary pre-application event before planning can be submitted. It includes a new extension to the rear, including a landscaped plaza opening onto Linenhall Street. A spokesman for BBC Northern Ireland told Ulster Business: \"As part of the pre-planning application process, public consultation events will take place this month before we can move on to the next phase. The investment to BBC Broadcasting House in Belfast, announced in March last year, will transform the iconic building, its technology and facilities, highlighting the BBC’s commitment to audiences in Northern Ireland. We will share more detail in due course.\" Money invested will go towards structural work on the -year-old building to ensure its long-term sustainability, addressing what the state broadcaster has said are \"critical deficiencies\". Before the announcement last year that the BBC was to stay put and develop its existing building, it was understood the broadcaster had been eyeing up other city centre locations, or could create a new media hub in the Titanic Quarter. The event will take place at the Clayton Hotel on March , between pm and pm, and March  between pm and .pm.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20190201_0983.jpg","title":"pwc investing in people purpose and belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday March  by Ulster Business Almost  years after it moved  staff and , paper files into Waterfront Plaza, PwC will move again – this time taking around , people and some very smart technology to Merchant Square in the heart of Belfast Just  months after being appointed to PwC’s national management board as head of UK regions, Paul Terrington, PwC’s NI regional chair, has no plans to reduce his commitment to keep growing the business locally.“This is an incredibly exciting time to be part of PwC. Since I took on the Northern Ireland role six years ago, we’ve doubled the workforce, become the fastest-growing UK region and are now the biggest office outside London with just over , people,” he says. “Our strategy was to be the leading provider of professional services in the Northern Ireland market but there’s no way we’d be the size we are now had we only focused on that.”Instead Paul built on the legacy of his predecessors and accelerated growth in new, technology solutions, while retaining the traditional accounting, tax and consulting services. Today PwC remains the leading provider of advisory services to the region’s family-owned and owner-managed businesses and multinationals, but has also built an impressive portfolio of cutting-edge technologies, opened the door to signicant export markets and is tackling some of society’s most challenging issues. “We’ve grown in many new areas – blockchain, cyber, cloud-based accounting services – but the single biggest impact has come from developing our distinctive ‘Operate’ ision,” Paul says. ”Operate is our service delivery business, which supports and delivers technology and people solutions to large, often regulated organisations. So instead of just advising clients how to solve their problems, we now do the heavy lting for them.”Run by Ian McConnell, a partner who’s been with the firm for  years, Operate is already attracting global attention. “Clients increasingly don’t want a consulting firm just to tell them what to do: they want a problem-solving partnership.” he says. “In its first year of operation, Operate earned over £m, now has , people and is still growing.”Reinforcing Paul’s confidence to invest in Northern Ireland as a strategic location is a  forecast from TheCityUK that it could become the second fastest-growing financial services region outside London by , helping deliver £bn of additional gross value-addedto the UK economy. But that depends on the ability to recruit the right talent, and he says the challenge now is finding and retaining the skills.That’s an issue that particularly concerns Paul as he looks ahead at the economic picture with Brexit and lack of an Assembly to the fore.“The business community wants clarity and certainty. Ideally we want to see a Brexit withdrawal agreement that then gives the scope for a trade deal that offers Northern Ireland the capacity to trade both with the EU and as part of the UK. The potential competitive advantages and ability to attract investment would be terric and the kind of economic accelerator which we have sought for years, but never managed to gain.“However I do worry about the impact of political stalemate on our long term future. Failure to invest, particularly in education and skills, will impair our competitiveness and make this a less attractive place for business.The decreasing effectiveness of health, environment and infrastructure will mean that talented people will opt to make choices to live their lives where.“In my national role, I see other parts of the country fusing partnerships in innovative and exciting ways between business,education and government. Compared to that, we are already getting left behind. We should be moving forward.”Which brings us to Merchant Square, the £m, , sq ft office development which PwC takes over in . “We have great people and one reason why we’re moving to the city centre is because that’s where they want to be. By the time we’re ready to relocate towards the end of , we will have at least , people moving in to the heart of Belfast.“That makes it important for Belfast too and not just because it’s the city’s biggest-ever private sector office deal. As we were making our decision, the whole Bank Buildings issue was at its height, and we wanted to show our support for the city and its future.” The Merchant Square relocation project is led by Kieragh Nelson, a director who joined the firm in . “We’ve got serious ambitions for Merchant Square,” she says. ”There’s a sense of ‘OK, we’ve just opened flagship offices in London, and Manchester – what more can we do in Belfast how can we make it even better ’ And the vast majority of decisions on how it will look, feel and work are made by the team here. Our goal is to create the most technologically-advanced, innovative and collaborative space for ourselves, our clients, and also for the communities around us.”Doing the right thing is a maxim often repeated in PwC, but it gets backed up. On the morning of our interview, a large group of people from the firm, including Paul, took part in one of their regular ‘Darkness Into Light’ walks to raise awareness of mental health. The firm’s commitment to social mobility has seen a number of employment programmes launched, notably the UK’s first technology degree apprenticeships, with Queen’s University one of five universities selected to run the programme. And it’s expanding its Hive Academy programme, which delivers free technology education to primary and secondary schools, to the Channel Islands.This year the firm challenged itself and created a unique charity partnership – the PwC Challenge – to create innovative suicide prevention programmes.“Our purpose is to build trust in society and solve important problems, and it really does feature in how we look at what we do. We strive to celebrate and share our knowledge widely and unselfishly with our people and communities and not be afraid to take a stand and do the right thing. And we put it at the heart of what we do every day. “Take the PwC Challenge: more people in Northern Ireland have died by suicide since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement than from the violence in the years before. This is a crisis, and it’s one which affects our people, and our communities. So we asked local charities in north and west Belfast, the worst affected areas in the UK, to collaborate and devise really innovative approaches programmes to give opportunities to young people and their families through education, technology, sports, and mental health coaching.“As well as the clubs in PwC which fundraise every year for the challenge, our own people are volunteering every week in ious projects – particularly with our Hive Academy. We want to ensure that people, who are high achievers in many dferent fields, are supported to play their fullest part in society.” For Paul, it’s all about the people. Last year PwC invested around £m on staff development here, and this year, a number of people have begun the first Masters in Operation service delivery, run by Ulster University. “It’s important to support people to develop their careers in ways they mightn’t have considered when they joined. That’s a key building block of our purpose – it drives social mobility, equality and ersity.“It’s true thatsomeone decides they want to head off and join PwC Australia or New York, they can. That’s the beauty of working for a global firm – those opportunities are there. But what I really want to make sure is that you don’t have to leave:you want to live and work in Belfast, and have global clients, work with cutting-edge technology and be part of a firm that’s engaged in society, you can do that too.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/eopen_1.jpg","title":"the open its the biggest thing since sliced bread","story":"Posted on Wednesday March  by Ulster Business With just  weeks until Northern Ireland hosts the biggest sporting event in its history, John Mulgrew speaks to the bosses tasked with organising the legendary Open Championship We’ve come a long way in just a short few years. Despite its huge golfing credentials, especially in the modern game, it had been more than  years since Northern Ireland played host to the Irish Open.That all changed in , when it ed north to Royal Portrush. And that, buoyed on a refreshed and renewed interest in both the tournament, and the sport itself.Now, in  weeks, that same links course will see more than , people flock to arguably the world’s greatest golf tournament and the largest sporting event ever hosted on these shores – The Open – transforming a small Co Antrim town for a handful of summer days.“There is a buzz with everyone at the RA,” Johnnie Cole-Hamilton tells Ulster Business. He’s executive director of championships at the RA – the ruling authority of golf throughout the world, aside from areas such as the US, and organisation responsible for organising The Open.“This will be my th Open Championship, and one reason I continue to be involved is that it’s a challenge every time.”It will see Irish golfing greats, including Open winners Rory McIlroy and Darren Clarke, Graeme McDowelland Padraig Harrington – among others – join the biggest name in sport, Tiger Woods.“One of big drivers to ing to Royal Portrush was the success of the Northern Irish and Irish golfers. They have raised the profile of golf immeasurably. “We are absolutely delighted with the response so far – % of tickets sold in  hours, and sold out within a record-breaking eight weeks.”Johnnie says the decision to choose Portrush, bringing it back to the course after a  year hiatus, was the correct one – buoyed by the support from the community, agencies and organisations. The th Open will be held at Royal Portrush from July -.“In my career, we had a similar scenario, ing to Liverpool for the first time in  years, and we had a very similar response. It ed in , and now Royal Liverpool is firmly on the rota, and I hope that Royal Portrush is similar.”Of course, aside from the golf, both the short-term and long-term economic benefits will trickle down and benefit, not on the surrounding areas, but prop Northern Ireland up on yet another global .According to Tourism NI chief executive John McGrillen that longer-term benefit could be worth up to £m for the wider economy.“There will be , tickets sold for championship days, and % of those sold to people out of state, outside Northern Ireland,” he tells Ulster Business.“It allows us to present an extremely positive image for Northern Ireland, and into key markets across the globe. We will never have experienced the opportunity to provide such a positive image of Northern Ireland. Despite what we might think, there are perception issues.“Northern Ireland has a normalised society and some of the most dramatic golf courses, scenery and landscape to see.“More specically, the fact that the Open will have been here, as one of the world’s top golf courses, will drive up the amount of spend, especially from golf tourism.”That alone makes up around % of Northern Ireland’s tourism intake. John says he wants that to grow to £m by . He says golfing visitors spend around four times that of an average tourist.Johnnie says all signs so far suggest that the Open in Portrush is “going to be an enormous” success. But the process hasn’t come without its challenges – namely theIrish Sea.“This is the first Open Championship we have hosted in my time, in which we have a body of water between our base and our contractor base. There’s getting things across water, and an enormous amount of work on the golf course – new holes, a new road system around the course and a tunnel for the players from one of the new greens to tee. You can’t do that without support from the golf club“The members have been hugely supportive, turning the course upside down, but maintaining integrity and enhancing .”He said, along with the blue light services, local authorities, council and tourism groups, the community in and around Portrush “understands that this will bring great benefits” to the area and Northern Ireland as a whole. “You can overcome dficulties with support,” he says.“Royal Portrush has never had more than , people drive to it, or get the train to it, at the same time. It’s a challenge to make sure we deliver a wonderful Open Championship and a spectator experience.”John McGrillen says the triumph in landing the Open itself was down to the success of the Irish Open in the last few years. “You had more than , people turning out at Portrush… visitor numbers had been dwindling.“That allows us to demonstrate that the course can deal with that many people. Everyoneworked very well, collectively, and that gave confidence to the RA that we would have the capacity to deliver it. The risk factors they had were eliminated because of the success of the Irish Open, and that was very critical.”As for boosting many of the hundreds of businesses in and around the area, John said: “It will do, as it’s showing off Northern Ireland… we have seen a big boost in the number of Americans playing golf. We don’t have to wait until after the event. “The visibility the Irish Open has given us. We have Royal County Down, Royal Portrush and Portstewart – that’s increased signicantly. It’s not just those courses which are benefiting – it’s being spread. People will typically stay in Belfast and travel around.”For John, the best outcome is, of course, an Irish winner. Oh, and clear skies. “A local winner would be phenomenal. It would be fantastic to see Rory win, or Tiger Woods.“If Tiger Woods won the Open in Portrush, that would remain in peoples’ memories forever. While we would love Rory or other locals to win, I would not be disappointed in Tiger winning it.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pwc_1221.jpg","title":"pwc ni to crack  staff by ","story":"Posted on Thursday March  by Ulster Business PwC is set crack the , staff mark by the end of next year as it moves into its new £m offices in the heart of Belfast city centre, Ulster Business can reveal.Just  months after being appointed to PwC’s national management board as head of UK regions, Paul Terrington, PwC’s NI regional chair, has no plans to reduce his commitment to keep growing the business here.“This is an incredibly exciting time to be part of PwC.
