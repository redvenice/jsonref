Culture Minister Helen Whately said she had \u0027met people whose lives have been turned upside down by gambling addiction\u0027A public consultation on the issue was carried out between August and November 2019.Neil McArthur, the commission\u0027s chief executive, said: \u0027Credit card gambling can lead to significant financial harm. \u0027The ban that we have announced today should minimise the risks of harm to consumers from gambling with money they do not have.\u0027Research shows that 22 per cent of online gamblers using credit cards are problem gamblers, with even more suffering some form of gambling harm.\u0027We also know that there are examples of consumers who have accumulated tens of thousands of pounds of debt through gambling because of credit card availability. \u0027There is also evidence that the fees charged by credit cards can exacerbate the situation because the consumer can try to chase losses to a greater extent.\u0027         Gambling Commission boss Neil McArthur (pictured in an announcement today) said the ban \u0027should minimise the risks of harm to consumers from gambling with money they do not have\u0027Mr McArthur said he understood some consumers used credit cards because of their convenience, but the risk of harm to others was too high to allow this to continue.He added: \u0027We realise that this change will inconvenience those consumers who use credit cards responsibly, but we are satisfied that reducing the risk of harm to other consumers means that action must be taken.\u0027But we will evaluate the ban and watch closely for any unintended circumstances for consumers. The ban is part of our ongoing work to reduce gambling harm. \u0027We also need to continue the work we have been doing with gambling operators and the finance industry to ensure consumers only gamble with money they can afford to spend.\u0027The Government has come under pressure to introduce bans for the use of credit cards for online bets over the past two years by charity groups including Gamble Aware and Citizens Advice.In 2018, the Responsible Gambling Strategy Board (RGSB) called on the Gambling Commission to consider restrictions on the use of \u0027borrowed money\u0027 for online gambling.Early in 2019, the watchdog launched a call for evidence on the matter \u0027to explore the consequences of restricting or prohibiting the use of credit cards in gambling\u0027.An estimated 24 million adults gamble in Great Britain, with 10.5 million of those placing bets online.It is thought that around 800,000 people use credit cards to gamble, with the regulator\u0027s own data showing that more than 165,000 customers made £46 million worth of credit card deposits in February last year.         The Gambling Commission made the announcement this morning, with its Twitter post aboveThe announcement is the latest blow to gambling businesses, after the Government introduced a crackdown on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs), which saw the maximum stake for bets cut from £100 to £2.Last year Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport ministers also met with banks and gambling operators to discuss their concerns.They also looked at how companies could use technology and customer data to help those at risk of developing gambling problems, including those using credit cards.Culture Minister Helen Whately said: \u0027Whilst millions gamble responsibly, I have also met people whose lives have been turned upside down by gambling addiction.\u0027There is clear evidence of harm from consumers betting with money they do not have, so it is absolutely right that we act decisively to protect them.\u0027In the past year we have introduced a wave of tougher measures, including cutting the maximum stake on fixed odds betting terminals, bringing in tighter age and identity checks for online gambling and expanding national specialist support through the NHS Long Term Plan. \u0027We have also secured a series of commitments from five leading gambling operators that will include £100 million funding towards treatment for problem gamblers.         Tracey Crouch, who resigned as sports minister in 2018, wrote on Twitter: \u0027Overwhelming debt accumulated via credit was a recurring theme by those addicts I met and heard from\u0027\u0027But there is more to do. We will be carrying out a review of the Gambling Act to ensure it is fit for the digital age and we will be launching a new nationwide addiction strategy in 2020. We will not hesitate to take any further action necessary to protect people from gambling harm.\u0027Adam Bradford, co-founder of the Safer Online Gambling Group, said: \u0027This is excellent news and it will provide an extra layer of support for people who are addicted to gambling.\u0027It has been a long time in coming and we are glad the Commission have acted decisively on this matter.\u0027The announcement comes amid a period of increased scrutiny on the gambling sector, which has seen criticism in recent weeks over its close relationship with professional sport.Last week, government ministers were told that the Football Association will not renew a controversial deal allowing gambling websites to screen live football matches.The sport\u0027s governing body faced pressure over its deal with Bet365 which allows people to watch live matches if they create accounts with the gambling firm.The Gambling Commission is also reportedly considering whether to clamp down on VIP schemes which can reward gamblers who habitually lose money with perks such as free bets, cashback on losing wagers or football tickets.         SNP MP Ronnie Cowan, who has spoken out about the industry, said: \u0027This is welcomed but we mustn\u0027t take our eyes off the prize and that\u0027s a completely new Gambling Act\u0027Brigid Simmonds, chairwoman of the Betting and Gaming Council which represents the industry, said: \u0027The Betting and Gaming Council is a body firmly committed to raising standards, safer gambling and change.\u0027We will implement a ban on credit cards and indeed our members will go further to study and improve the early identification of those at risk.\u0027The use of credit cards were previously used as a potential marker of harm which might lead to further intervention with customers.\u0027Tracey Crouch, who resigned as sports minister in 2018, wrote on Twitter: \u0027Overwhelming debt accumulated via credit was a recurring theme by those addicts I met and heard from.\u0027This is definitely a positive safeguarding measure that will help many people at risk of harm from gambling.\u0027And SNP MP Ronnie Cowan, who has spoken out about the gambling industry, said: \u0027This is welcomed but we mustn\u0027t take our eyes off the prize and that\u0027s a completely new Gambling Act.\u0027Gambling firms saw their shares slide in reaction to the new legislation to ban the use of credit cards for online bets when the markets opened.Online specialist 888 saw shares slide 3.3 per cent, William Hill shares fell 3.2 per cent, Ladbrokes owner GVC Holdings dropped 2.8 per cent and Paddy Power owner Flutter sank 1.4 per cent in early trading."},{"url":null,"title":"Royal commentators verdict Sandringham summit Queens statement Harry Meghan","story":"Share this articleImagine if Meghan is selflessly saving Harry from a mental breakdown, says VANESSA FELTZ | Vanessa Feltz | Columnists | Comment | Express.co.ukPrince Harry\u0027s regret as \u0027transition\u0027 crisis damages family relationshipsRussell Myers: \u0027Any doubt over which royal remains in charge has been laid to rest\u0027 - Russell Myers - Mirror OnlineAs Harry and Meghan are finding out, the royals don’t do ‘progressive’ | Simon Jenkins | Opinion | The GuardianRoyal Family will engage in a careful balancing act to avoid the nuclear option for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle | inews"},{"url":null,"title":"Oprah Winfrey denies planning tell interview Harry Meghan","story":"Share this article A royal source said: \u0027Harry and Meghan\u0027s people have been reaching out to all the big US networks to explore the possibilities of a sit-down warts-and-all interview. \u0027Meghan feels she\u0027s been silenced and is no longer prepared to be muted.

These slanders are exceptionally serious,\u0027 Sarah said.

But it crashed 13 months later, leaving a pensions hole of up to £571m.The Pensions Regulator (TPR) immediately moved to protect the pensions of 19,000 members and made three requests for information under a section 72 order. It managed to secure a £363m cash settlement with Green to rescue the scheme.However, Chappell was accused of failing to hand over vital documents to the regulator as it sought to stabilise the pension fund.TPR took him to court and he was charged with three counts of neglecting or refusing to provide documents without a reasonable excuse, contrary to the Pensions Act 2004.During the hearing, the former racing car driver from Blandford Forum in Dorset claimed he was being made a “scapegoat” for the failure of the high street chain and said he wished he had never bought it.Representing himself at Hove crown court, Chappell said that unlike billionaire Green he did not have the money to make the problem go away. “I’m not Philip Green, sitting on a £100m yacht in the south of France, who just wrote a cheque for £350m to make the problem go away.”Chappell said during his 13 months at the helm of BHS he had contributed £4.5m to the pension fund. However, he was convicted of failing to hand over documents to the regulator and ordered to pay a £50,000 fine and £37,000 court costs.In January 2018, Chappell was handed a bill of almost £10m to make up the BHS pensions shortfall. But he decided to fight the ruling and appealed against the decision to the upper tribunal.Now TPR has secured a further £9.5m towards the BHS pension fund from Chappell after his appeal was rejected.Nicola Parish, TPR’s executive director of frontline regulation, said: “We are pleased that the decision to issue two contribution notices to pay money into the BHS pension schemes stands.“This case illustrates how the Pensions Regulator is willing to pursue a case through the courts to seek redress for pension savers. It illustrates the situations our anti-avoidance powers were designed to meet and which allow us to protect the retirement incomes that savers deserve.”However, TPR is unlikely to receive the £9.5m. After his initial appeal at the crown court was rejected, Chappell claimed he was facing bankruptcy and would not be able to pay the fine or the pension shortfall.“I’ve been worn out. I cannot play this game any more. I can’t afford to do so,” he said.In October Chappell appeared in court accused of a £500,000 tax fraud. He denied denied three charges of tax evasion, alleging he failed to register Swiss Rock, his bankrupt finance company, for taxes from the correct date, gave false information to tax authorities, did not declare profits and failed to submit VAT returns.The alleged offences took place between January 2014 and September 2016.The case was adjourned and Chappell is scheduled to go on trial in October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0c45036e09783e04424fd84e91fe95f917ac64e/0_174_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68a8f8de364c5bce4ad115ba10c195b2","title":"total to move financial hub from london to paris after brexit","story":"French oil giant will ‘bring cash back to Paris’ along with 60-70 jobsThe French oil company Total plans to pull its cash out of the UK after Brexit and return its financial hub to Paris in a show of faith in Europe, according to its chief executive.Patrick Pouyanné announced plans for Total to move its central treasury, including between 60 and 70 jobs, back to the “heart of Europe’s economic and financial system” in Paris by the end of 2020.“Total will bring its cash back to Paris,” he told a financial conference in the French capital on Tuesday morning.He later confirmed the move on social media, tweeting that it was “a logical decision” given the UK’s decision to leave the EU.Total’s decision to abandon the City will raise doubts once again over whether London can retain its position as Europe’s most important financial centre against competition from Paris and Frankfurt.Pouyanné said that from a legal point of view “it doesn’t change much”, but the company hopes to send a signal that Paris is an attractive place for business.“I think it’s good that the big European groups show their faith in Europe,” he told delegates at the Euronext conference in Paris.Total’s decision to return its financial core to Paris comes six years after the €128bn (£110bn) Paris-listed company moved its financial operations to London to be closer to the oil industry’s most important investors, advisers and analysts.At the time the company said it hoped to “get closer to London, which is the oil trading and financial centre of Europe”.Since then, Brexit has raised uncertainty over the UK’s future access to other EU financial centres, and Total has set out plans to plough a fifth of its investment into low-carbon energy within the next 15 years.Total began its retreat from the UK early last year after announcing plans to move its 200-strong energy trading team from London to Geneva in September.It also moved the London-based team tasked with marketing its liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Paris to join the LNG business it bought from the French utility giant Engie.At the time, the company said Brexit was “not at all” a factor in the plans.But after the move in September, Pouyanné warned that Brexit was a “fundamental mistake” that would deal a greater blow to the UK economy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/042f16dec676e196bd3976336ec0d1fb9ef96243/0_0_2100_2105/master/2100.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47040f3a3d4652f868f452ced9f53835 700w","title":"stock markets record highs currency manipulator us china trade deal business live","story":"Asset management giant promises to put environmental issues at the heart of its investment strategy, following pressure from climate protestersWhile environmental campaigners want more from BlackRock, investors such as Ross Gerber are applauding Larry Fink:Here’s our news story on BlackRock’s move into sustainable investing:Here’s Thomas O’Neill, research director at data analysts InfluenceMap (who helped with our Polluters investigation recently) on BlackRock’s decision to shun thermal coal producers:“This is a positive announcement in the move to make financing of thermal coal more costly.The climate movement will be watching closely to see how BlackRock’s policy of scrutinizing other parts of the thermal coal value chain develops - critically, concerning utilities who continue to plan on new coal generation.”Financial journalist Anne Ashworth reckons BlackRock has been bounced into action by the Greta effect:BlackRock certainly has a lot of catching up to do.As well as holding huge stakes in the fossil fuel industry, BlackRock has also dragged its feet on sustainability in the past, before now seemingly seeing the light.The New York Times sums up the criticism:BlackRock itself has come under criticism from both industry and environmental groups for being behind on pushing these issues. Just last month, a British hedge fund manager, Christopher Hohn, said that it was “appalling” of BlackRock not to require companies to disclose their sustainability efforts, and that the firm’s previous efforts had been “full of greenwash.”Climate activists staged several protests outside BlackRock’s offices last year, and Mr. Fink himself has received letters from members of Congress urging more action on climate-related investing. According to Ceres and FundVotes, a unit of Morningstar, BlackRock had among the worst voting records on climate issues.Extinction Rebellion aren’t very impressed by BlackRock’s move.The activist campaign, whose protests have helped highlight the climate emergency, points out that Larry Fink’s group has endless billions invested in polluting companies.It’s not always the case that something is better than nothing, particularly if it’s used to distract from the truth. And the truth is that the world’s biggest miners and polluters will not be losing any sleep over this.BlackRock remains waist-deep in fossil fuel investments and the world’s top backer of companies that destroy the Amazon rainforest and ignore the rights of indigenous people. BlackRock can rest assured that we will continue to pile on the pressure until they act to protect our children and the natural world.Back in October,  showed how BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street collectively held $300bn in fossil fuel investments.My colleague Patrick Greenfield also highlighted that the companies had failed to support climate activists (something BlackRock is now pledging to address).The big three are among a number of asset managers that offer “climate-friendly” and “sustainable” investment funds that have substantial holdings in fossil fuel companies.Author and journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin says Larry Fink’s move towards sustainable investment is a “watershed” moment:BUT..... Bloomberg’s Mark Gilbert points out that BlackRock’s index-tracking funds aren’t involved. That means the trillions of dollars used for passive investing won’t be directed towards cleaner investments.BlackRock Inc., the world’s biggest fund manager with $7 trillion of assets, says it plans to “place sustainability at the center of our investment approach.” As environmental, social and governance issues become more pressing, especially for younger savers, it’s a savvy business move that will pressure its peers to follow suit.But there’s a problem. With about two-thirds of the money it manages allocated to index-tracking funds, the issue of how to harness the resources in passive products — the bulk of which command fees that are too low to finance costly and time-consuming engagement with company boards — remains unaddressed.Bloomberg’s David Fickling has a good theory about BlackRock’s move towards climate activism.He reckons some CEOs are as scared about the climate emergency as anyone, but can’t reconcile it with their daily lives. This means they end up taking business decisions that make the crisis worse.He cites Siemens’ refusal to abandon a contract to provide rail signalling at a new Australian coalmine, despite also pledging to become carbon neutral by 2030.This prompted a long letter from Siemens CEO Joe Kaeser trying to justify the decision, in which he sound genuinely torn by the dilemma.BlackRock’s move has been welcomed by the US senator for Hawaii, Brian Schatz:Not everyone understands the importance of the climate emergency, of course.If you want to keep putting money into fossil fuel producers, or other companies who contribute large CO2 emissions, BlackRock will happily invest it for you.After all, it’s your money.So after outlining its new commitment to sustainable investment, the company’s letter to its clients concludes by pointing out that the world will be burning hydrocarbons for some time.We invest on your behalf, not our own, and the investments we make will always represent your preferences, timelines, and objectives. We recognize that many clients will continue to prefer traditional strategies, particularly in market-cap weighted indexes. We will manage this money consistent with your preferences, as we always have. The choice remains with you.As we move to a low-carbon world, investment exposure to the global economy will mean exposure to hydrocarbons for some time. While the low-carbon transition is well underway, the technological and economic realities mean that the transition will take decades. Global economic development, particularly in emerging markets, will continue to rely on hydrocarbons for a number of years. As a result, the portfolios we manage will continue to hold exposures to the hydrocarbon economy as the transition advances.BlackRock’s decision to drop major thermal coal producers like hot potatoes is a blow to the fossil fuel sector, says Jeanne Martin, campaign manager at ShareAction, the responsible investment campaign group.But, she insists Larry Fink and colleagues need to do a lot more to actually clean up the financial sector, and put pressure on banks:“BlackRock’s coal estment decision is yet another significant blow to the already dying market. Yet major banks like Barclays continue to prop up coal-heavy companies. If BlackRock is serious about its commitment to phase out thermal coal, it should use its voting rights to get major coal financiers to do the same.She also says Fink has been too secretive, given BlackRock’s massive influence:While we welcome its commitment to improve transparency of its stewardship activities, for far too long the asset manager has kept everyone in the dark about the companies it was meeting with, the topics discussed, and most importantly the outcome of those engagements.But we might not like what we see when we open the door on these activities: BlackRock’s current voting disclosures on climate issues give little comfort that it will vote in a manner fitting of the climate crisis.”BlackRock’s pledge to become a more environmentally responsible investor has been welcomed by some campaigners.Diana Best, senior strategist for the Sunrise Project, says Larry Fink’s decision is a “fantastic start”, which could spur rivals into action.“BlackRock’s new initiatives match the size of the crisis we’re seeing 2020 and are the direct result of an outpouring of pressure from the global climate movement that has zeroed in on the company over the past year. Putting climate change at the absolute center of its business is the way every company should respond to this planetary emergency. “BlackRock beginning its shift of capital out of fossil fuels, including today’s estment of coal in its actively managed funds, is a fantastic start and instantly raises the bar for competitors such as Vanguard and State Street Global Advisors. But Best also warns that BlackRock has more work to do:Even with today’s announcements, based on its size BlackRock will still remain one of, if not the largest, investors in fossil fuels. So we will be looking for additional leadership from the company in, as Larry Fink said, ‘fundamentally reshaping finance to deal with climate change,” including additional shifts of capital out of fossil fuels.”Sunrise is part of the BlackRock’s Big Problem campaign, which calls the company “the biggest driver of climate chaos you’ve never heard of”.BlackRock is also promising to double the number of environmental, Social, and Governance-focused exchange-traded funds it offers.It will add a ‘fossil fuel screen’ to allow investors to keep their money away from big polluters.BlackRock is also (belatedly) promising to play a more active role in fighting the climate emergency, by joining the Climate Action 100+ campaign (announced last week)It is also demanding that companies publish their plan for operating under a scenario where the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting global warming to less than two degrees is fully realized.Given the groundwork we have already laid and the growing investment risks surrounding sustainability, we will be increasingly disposed to vote against management when companies have not made sufficient progress.You can read Larry Fink’s annual letter to the world’s CEOs, warning about the climate emergency, here: A Fundamental Reshaping of FinanceBlackRock’s letter to clients, outlining its new pledge to sustainable investment, is here: Sustainability as BlackRock’s New Standard for InvestingHow, exactly, will BlackRock clean up its act? The investment giant has told clients this morning that it will make several major changes. Some will improve its own practices, and others will make it easier for people to choose environmentally-sustainable products.Some journalists are questioning quite how significant BlackRock’s new environmental pledges will be in practice.Neil Hume of the Financial Times reckons the new anti-coal policy won’t affect the world’s biggest miners. That’s because their coal production, although significant, is only a small part of their overall business.Bloomberg’s Dani Burger points out BlackRock isn’t proposing ditching fossil fuel companies from its passive investment arm (tracker funds that model the broad stock market).BlackRock’s new opposition to thermal coal, and the firms which burn it, could make it harder to invest in China.BlackRock is promising to ditch its holdings in any company that produces more than a quarter of its revenues from thermal coal.Larry Fink says its active investment teams will shun major coal producers, due to the environmental damage they cause.Thermal coal is significantly carbon intensive, becoming less and less economically viable, and highly exposed to regulation because of its environmental impacts. With the acceleration of the global energy transition, we do not believe that the long-term economic or investment rationale justifies continued investment in this sector.Fink adds that BlackRock will also “closely scrutinise” firms that are heavily reliant on thermal coal (which would include power companies and major manufacturers)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09fd298d1657649175797b372aa55f4f5d330f08/0_756_4718_2830/master/4718.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8bedd272da5ba65681251a158893088","title":"my parkdale is gone how gentrification reached the one place that seemed immune","story":"Long an outlier in Toronto’s feverish property wars, Parkdale’s deep-seated problems were being turned around by its Tibetan community – but then the huge global real estate firms rolled inBy now, Michael Nguyen expects them: every month or so, someone representing one international real estate investment firm or another crosses the threshold of the Parkdale Intercultural Centre, a non-profit immigrant settlement agency he runs on a busy stretch of Toronto’s Queen Street West.“It’s the same every time: Who owns the building? How do I get in touch with them? Do they want to sell?” shrugged Nguyen, whose centre has been helping new immigrants adjust to Canadian life for decades. “We’re fortunate — the owner believes in what we do, so we feel safe. But you know the same questions are being asked of everyone all around here. And not everyone is going to say no.”Toronto’s much-vaunted international brand – the poster-child for extreme ersity, a global social experiment done right – has become a faded myth in many of its inner-city neighbourhoods. Property values have soared beyond the most fevered speculators’ imagination, mostly relegating those representing Toronto’s vast swaths of difference to the suburbs.Parkdale, however, an inner-city neighbourhood just six kilometres west of downtown along Lake Ontario’s shore, has long been an outlier. As Nguyen spoke, runny-nosed toddlers fiddled with coloured blocks, while their parents, all recent immigrants, tried to focus on an English as a second language class. Outside, Queen Street bustled with an almost fairy-tale version of multicultural Toronto: Tibetan monks in flowing orange robes slipping into a flow of South Asian, Caribbean and African immigrants a mom-and-pop grocer sells roasted barley, a favourite Tibetan snack other restaurants offer roti, a JamaicanIndian wrap that fuses the spicy flavours of both cultures.But the lively streetscape here masks a threat to what could very well be the last island of ersity in a city swamped by the flood waters of global capital. Huge international real estate investment firms have embedded themselves in Parkdale’s urban fabric, buying dozens of apartment towers and thousands of rental units. Residents claim that threats, intimidation, rampant eviction notices and strategic neglect have become common. So too have tenant protests and rent strikes, where slick corporate offices find themselves occupied by hundreds of angry tenants demanding redress.Those protesting, however, are the lucky ones. In a city famous as a landing pad for immigrants, many recently-arrived residents, often without either English or an understanding of Canadian legal protections around tenancy, simply pack up and leave.“Gone are the days of the mom-and-pop slumlord, which was the dominant make-up of the rental housing market in Parkdale for years,” says Cole Webber, a legal aid worker with the Parkdale Community Legal Services (PCLS), a provincially-funded agency for free legal services (which was itself evicted from its long-time Parkdale offices last year). “The fact of it is that the primary impediment for these corporations increasing their profits is the ongoing tenancy of working-class people who live in Parkdale. The only reason these companies bought these properties is so they can turn over the units. Period.”Parkdale has become one of those neighbourhoods, following a familiar script. Inner-city working-class suburb, the last bastion of affordable rent, becomes popular with artists and students, who lend it a certain zeitgeisty sheen property speculators follow rent and property value increase condos sprout like weeds neighbourhood becomes a whitewashed nowhere, like so many before it: Brooklyn’s Williamsburg, London’s Hackney, Berlin’s Kreuzberg, San Francisco’s Mission. Indeed, Akelius, the Swedish investment firm that now owns many thousands of apartment units throughout Europe, made that exact comparison about Parkdale in its most recent annual report.“There goes another community center,” quipped the Instagram account @parkdalelife about an infamous all-night McDonald’s being demolished to make way for a 700-plus unit luxury condo building, leeringly named “XO.” It was just the kind of hipster fatalism that infects neighbourhoods in the grips of late-stage gentrification. The McDonald’s, at Parkdale’s nexus of Dufferin and King Streets, had served as an informal refuge for Parkdale’s legions of homeless and mentally ill for decade. And by the time blasé youth in search of urban grit arrive just in time to become cheekily indignant about displacement, it’s already far too late.I lived in Parkdale’s orbit for almost 20 years, first in the late 1990s on its eastern boundary, and then its west a decade later. The neighbourhood’s infamous liquor store at Queen and Brock Streets was the only one I knew with a full-time police detail. Depending on the night, you could see a scuffle in the whiskey aisle, an arrest, or a fistfight or overdose in its parking lot often, there would be a solicitation for a low-priced trick from one of the prostitutes who routinely patrolled its perimeter. Once, I was witness to a tooth being knocked out, one homeless man to another, over an allegedly stolen beer. (In one of the few good news stories to come out of Parkdale recently, the city is trying to acquire the site of the store, now closed, to build affordable housing.)In a country like Canada, where we speak smugly of social safety nets and institutionalized humanity, here was a place that made it feel like that was all talk. In the late 1990s, Parkdale could be chilling: group homes housed hundreds battling mental health and addiction issues the less fortunate were left to the precarious realm of government rent subsidies and dilapidated, poorly-maintained rooming houses – or, just as often, the street. Along a deadened streetscape of mostly empty storefronts, drug deals happened in broad daylight, addicts raged and twitched, and Parkdale earned another name, Crackdale, day by day.It’s not hard to see Parkdale as doomed from the start. It was built in the late 19th century as a summer refuge for the city’s wealthy, with opulent brick mansions on a small bluff overlooking the water. Six kilometres from the smoky and bustling downtown, it was close enough for those with means to easily reach – and to keep those without away.In less than two decades, rapid industrialization clustering along the water’s edge changed all that. Apartment houses were built to accommodate workers, many of them immigrants, for the nearby factories and abattoirs hastily-sold grand Victorian homes were repurposed into multiple single-room dwellings.The decline of industry across North America in the 70s and 80s dealt Parkdale another blow, leaving the spartan workers’ housing to rot. The nearby lake – now toxic – and the six-lane expressway, built in the 1950s along the shore, ensured its squalor. Around the same time, the province of Ontario deregulated mental health care and shut down psychiatric hospitals, releasing psychiatric patients to seek refuge in privately-run care homes they found Parkdale’s chopped-up manses ready to receive them.Over the years, poverty and marginalization became deeply embedded. Social service agencies clustered in Parkdale to serve a disempowered population, and, by their sheer density, drew more into the neighbourhood’s orbit. Addiction made Parkdale a hotbed of a predatory illegal drug trade prostitution became rampant. Concrete slab apartment towers, built as slum-remediation in the “urban renewal” zeitgeist in the 50s and 60s, became vertical manifestations of the social ills they had been intended to erase. Drugs and crime settled into their concrete walls.Gentrification, on the surface, seemed less of a threat than an impossibility. As the rest of Toronto surged upward in the early 2000s, Parkdale was forever “up and coming” – real estate code for a litany of social ills – and a target for only the heartiest of speculators. Some did come, sprucing up half a block here, a cluster of houses there, but Toronto’s real estate boom left Parkdale’s intractable poverty largely intact.The people who did come were new immigrants and refugees, heading to the last inner-city refuge of low rent. The tower units were squalid but cheap. And slowly, the tide of crime and drugs began to recede. Thanks to a long-standing federal policy, Tibetan refugees fleeing persecution in China took particularly strong root through the 2000s and 2010s, opening restaurants and grocery stores along Queen Street.Immigrant groups had always filtered through Parkdale, finding their feet in a new country before moving on. But the Tibetans stayed, slowly transforming the broken and neglected district into a bright, vibrant family neighbourhood. Look at Google maps and you’ll see “Little Tibet” in the crook where Queen Street and Jameson meet. “Tibetans really broke the mould here,” Webber said. “They turned the neighbourhood into their social and cultural hub. They’re a stabilizing force, for sure.”Approximately 8,000 Tibetans call Canada home, and more than 6,000 live in Toronto, the bulk of them in Parkdale. That makes the neighbourhood the largest Tibetan community outside the country’s borders, though for how much longer is anyone’s guess. “All my family and friends who are in Parkdale, they tell me about people coming to Canada and not able to find a place in their budget in Parkdale anymore,” said Tenzin Tekan, one of Webber’s colleagues at PCLS, who came to Canada in 2006 with her family. “It’s not going to be Little Tibet much longer. We’re losing the community we built over years.”Parkdale’s burgeoning crisis isn’t unique. Working class neighbourhoods in cosmopolitan cities all over the world have been transformed into urbane playgrounds for the moneyed set. And global investors muscling into the rental housing market is no Toronto phenomenon. After the sub-prime mortgage crisis in the US cratered the property market there, note Canadian professors Martine August and Allan Walks, huge swaths of rental housing were acquired by investment firms willing and able to wait out the market dip to recapitalize on the rent gap as the economy recovered.Last year, one of them, Blackstone, an international private equity firm that the UN recently accused of “wreaking havoc” on the global affordable housing market with “aggressive evictions” of low and middle income tenants, recently entered an acquisition deal with the Toronto-based firm Starlight Investments. In the fall, Starlight bought a $1.72bn (£1bn) portfolio of apartment towers one of the largest is in Parkdale.It’s a narrative of numbing sameness from which no city – no desirable city, at least – is immune. But things were supposed to be different here. As Manhattan became a mall for the global elite, and as San Francisco’s homeless population climbed into the thousands, Torontonians like me were smug civic boosters of our anomaly status. Here we were, a big city that worked, where different kinds of people could choose – and afford – to live shoulder to shoulder and be better for it.And for a moment, it was true. But capital moves quickly, and policy much less so. In less than two decades, housing prices in Toronto doubled, then trebled, then quadrupled: the average price of a single-family home went from $251,267 in January 2000 to $1,044,527 in late 2018. Toronto, a fabled city of immigrants, was fast becoming something else entirely. Whole immigrant communities who had gained a toehold in the city’s core were selling high and decamping for the suburbs, which is where the city’s vaunted ersity now lives.Real estate became a bloodsport, and Parkdale became convenient hyperbole for last-resort gentrification narratives. “We Bought a Crackhouse” read the headline of an infamous 2017 story in Toronto Life magazine, about a young family’s Parkdale renovation journey that included moving on the addicts splayed unconscious in the basement. The story tore open a gash in an urban skin already rubbed raw with rising inequity. The backlash was intense, vicious and unrelenting. It became an emblematic tale of the city’s escalating class war, pushed past the point of no return.“I used to say, in a kind of flip way, that I gave up on the inner city years ago,” says Deborah Cowen, a professor of geography who studies cities and social justice at the University of Toronto. Cowen lived in Parkdale in the 90s, when it was bottoming out. Even then, she says, you could see subtle pressures of gentrification building. “In terms of being homogenous, predictable, corporate and maybe even securitized — that certainly seems like the fate of Toronto, and without some kind of dramatic change, it will be.”How dramatic? Just last month, Cowen says, the city announced a $24bn affordable housing strategy with provincial and federal support. “I’m not convinced even that is enough to effect the change we need,” she says. Bureaucracies walk, while capital sprints: by the time anything gets built – eight to 10 years from now, or more – “what kind of city will be left to save?”Nerupa Somasale doesn’t need academic studies or government statistics to understand what she’s lost. Somasale, 23, bright and articulate with an engaging laugh in many ways epitomises Toronto’s global brand of harmonious multiculturalism. In the 1990s, her mother, from the Philippines, landed in Parkdale where she met Somasale’s father, a refugee from India.“Oh my God, I hate that. I hate it so much,” Somasale says, when I ask her about the city’s rosy reputation. “This whole idea of multiculturalism, ersity – it’s still used as something we should be proud of. But it suggests equity, like we all have a stake. It’s just not true. It’s the opposite. It’s branding for politicians and for tourists, nothing more.”Somasale, an undergraduate student in her final year of curatorial studies at Ryerson University, was born on the 19th floor of the building at 105 West Lodge Avenue in Parkdale – where recently the elevators stopped working, prompting raucous protest at the landlord’s offices over its alleged mass-eviction campaign. For better or worse, Parkdale has always been her home: through the 90s, when the crack trade was brisk and relentless through the 2000s, when adventurous urbanites were drawn further westward to a growing array of nightclubs and late-night restaurants and finally the last decade, where change was inflicted most visibly by a particularly aggressive corporate newcomer that saw the opportunity to craft a new identity for Parkdale entirely.It started in 2016, when an outpost of the Los Angeles vegan restaurant Doomie’s opened on Queen Street, swiftly followed by a non-dairy ice cream shop and a lifestyle boutique. Last year, 5700, which owned all these ventures, announced it was “rebranding” the neighbourhood “Vegandale,” with a slate of international food events under that banner.“Vegandale,” to many, was the same brutal invasion at street-level that was happening in the towers just a few blocks away. “It was a really tumultuous moment, like everything that had been happening here the past few years just burst out on to the street,” Somasale said. It shifted things for her. She became more engaged in activist efforts, more involved in the protest movement. “It was an erasure of history, and an intentional one,” she said. “They wanted to change a chunk of the neighbourhood in a way that didn’t benefit anybody that had lived here for years. It had that feeling: ‘There’s nothing here, so let’s just make it into whatever we want.’”There is, of course, a great deal here, which makes Parkdale’s quick transformation so alarming. But for Somasale, there’s little reason for hope. “Half the people I grew up with, whether they were my age or they were family members that were much older who had lived there for decades, have been displaced,” she says. “Because they can’t afford it – me included.”On a bright, early autumn day, Somasale asked that we meet in Kensington Market, a vibrant, ramshackle cluster of Victorian houses converted into cafes, fruit stands and vintage shops on the western fringe of Toronto’s downtown. Earlier this year, Somasale left her lifelong home, finally broken by non-functional elevators, floods and the enveloping chaos of the landlord-tenant war. In Kensington, she shares a one bedroom apartment with two friends – there is no escaping Toronto’s merciless rental rates.“I wanted so, so badly to stay in the neighbourhood. I looked for a year-and-a-half. It was like a horror story. For $600, I couldn’t believe what I saw. It was disgusting, terrifying. But they’d get away with it because someone would be desperate.”She sighs. “I have a weird relationship to this feeling of home, because I can’t even live there,” she says. “I visit every other week. But it changes so fast. It feels like neighbourhood amnesia.”What the data didn’t pick up was how the neighbourhood had changed on street level, and the three-year gap between then and now might as well be a lifetime. When Akelius, the Swedish real estate juggernaut with some $8bn in global assets settled its gaze on Toronto in 2011, Parkdale was a low-income immigrant neighbourhood. But it was no longer a bleak urban sinkhole. Thanks to the Tibetan community, and the hipster incursion that the Tibetans’ stabilising presence had drawn, it was an opportunity.In 2012, the firm started acquiring mid and high rise concrete slab apartment buildings in Toronto by 2016, it had amassed 37, and more than 3,000 apartment units. Many of them were along Jameson Avenue, which links Parkdale to the Gardiner Expressway, shuttling commuters to and from the city’s core.Akelius had already developed a successful business model in Sweden, Germany and the UK: identify neighbourhoods adjacent to fully gentrified districts – like Kreuzberg, a longstanding haven for Berlin’s Turkish population – and exploit the undercapitalization of its rental housing.Other landlords took Akelius as a model. MetCap Living, Parkdale’s biggest landlord with more than 20 apartment buildings, was accused of starving out tenants in 2017 on unheeded maintenance requests and issuing heavy rent increases in an effort to drive out low income tenants and attract new ones. Current rents on new units are said to often be double those paid by longtime tenants. MetCap president Brent Merrill, also speaking to the Star, said he had made every effort to manage maintenance requests, including a tenant hotline. After a rent strike by hundreds of tenants stretched out over two months, the company agreed to reduce its above-guideline rent increases to the provincially-mandated levels.Tenants pushed back with a rent strike at 12 buildings. The conflict peaked when a video emerged of Merrill narrowly missing a protester with his pickup truck. Merrill told the Toronto Star he was rescuing a terrified property manager from an angry mob.As the rental market tightened, the presence of private equity firms grew. Timbercreek, with $10bn in assets across North America, Europe and Asia, bought several Parkdale buildings in the fall of 2018, including the two hulking towers on West Lodge Avenue where Somasale grew up . Tenants there had endured semi-functional heat and hot water for years, as well as leaks, floods and pest infestations. Elevators in the two 19-storey towers were often out of service for weeks. By the winter of 2019, tenants reported a rash of eviction notices. In March, dozens of hired a bus to take them to Timbercreek’s corporate head office in Toronto to serve their new landlord with hundreds of maintenance requests and a notice of their own. In a video of the event, one of the protestors made clear their chief concern: that the company was taking people to the landlord-tenant tribunal to evict them, and that, internally, Timbercreek had likened tenant removal to “putting a building through a car wash”. “This is the dirt you’re trying to wash away,” the protestor continued, gesturing to her protest sign-holding neighbours. “We are here to put you on notice: You have no idea the neighbourhood you are messing with.”Colleen Krempulec, Timbercreek’s executive director of marketing told the  that the company had evicted some tenants, usually for non-payment of rent, but the number was small: 17, in a property with more than 700 units. “And we’re not talking about a few weeks of arrears —we’re talking about months and months,” she said.In the months that followed Timbercreek’s acquistion, Krempulec said, the enormity of the maintenance challenge emerged. “These buildings were neglected for decades,” she said. “I would say West Lodge was in the worst state of repair we’ve ever seen.” Since taking ownership, Krempulec said the company had worked through more than 2,500 tenant maintenance requests, and had replaced all eight of the buildings’ elevators, as well as the heat and hot water systems.“The accusation that we’re deferring maintenance to encourage people to leave – nothing could be further from the truth,” she said. “It’s been a challenging project, there is no doubt – more challenging than we had originally bargained for. But we’re a long-term investor. We’re not coming in to flip the property. We have a long-term horizon.”In November 2019, Starlight – Blackstone’s Canadian partner firm – found itself on now-familiar ground: tenants, angry at rent hikes they claimed were well above the guideline rate, occupied its head office with a stack of unheeded maintenance demands. For Katrina Potts, who led the protest, the gap between tenant and landlord was stark. “The office was all waterfalls and glass and luxury,” she said. “We’re arguing with them over $100, $200, $300 a month, and they’ve just spent $1.72bn. You have to wonder if that’s a war we can win.”Parkdale, though, is not the kind of place where people give up. Tenant groups are organized and armed with legal aid, and new ideas incubate here among academics and activists. The pace of change, however, is something none seem able to solve. In 2010, Kuni Kamizaki, then a graduate student at the University of Toronto’s urban planning department doing a placement at a community agency and social hub for Parkdale’s low-income residents, developed an idea. He wanted to build a non-profit community land trust, in order to bank land and housing and rent it back to low-income residents at fixed rates below market value. Government had long-since abandoned building affordable housing itself, choosing instead to subsidize rent for qualified tenants in privately owned buildings. That meant public money was being used to pay off private mortgages, with nothing to show for it at the end. Wouldn’t that money be better spent paying for a permanent community asset? Kamizaki thought so, and the trust was born.In 2010, its goals seemed reasonable. Land values were rising, but Parkdale’s built-in buffers – the towers, a welter of social service agencies, dilapidated housing stock – made the pace seem manageable. There was time. When the trust finally secured seed funding and undertook a community-based planning initiative, it was 2015, and the landscape in Parkdale had shifted intensely. Akelius was ensconced others had followed and were applying its techniques with ruthless efficiency. And no fewer than a dozen new luxury condo developments were on the horizon.“Everything was just happening so, so fast,” Kamizaki said. “Big corporate investors were suddenly everywhere – how could we even start to grapple with that?”The land trust is still up and running, and can claim some small victories: a community garden 15 refreshed apartments it rents to vulnerable tenants at rates well below the market rate.Joshua Barndt, the trust’s development coordinator, is clear-eyed about what the trust can achieve in this climate, and what it cannot. In the face of multi-billion dollar acquisitions, “it’s not ‘how do we stop it’”, he said. “It’s ‘how do we capture some of the benefits of the changes for people who live here now?’ How are we intentionally a part of it? Instead of being pushed down the river, how do we ride along with it?’”Many others are struggling to simply leave the river behind. On a bright day far from Parkdale, Somasale is haunted by a past to which she can no longer connect. “For my family, Parkdale wasn’t a choice,” she says. “It was all we had. So it’s hard to move on.. I don’t feel like I can make it here in Toronto any more,” she says, musing about new horizons – Montreal, maybe, where rent is lower. “It’s sad,” she says. “Parkdale will always feel like home, but it doesn’t look like any home I ever knew anymore. My Parkdale is gone.”For Somasale and thousands of others, the loss is absolute – a place knit into your psyche, torn out and walled off, forever. For the rest of us, the loss is more abstract: of a city we were foolish enough to believe was different, or better, that was more than land values and profit margins – that, against all reason and odds, worked. A city we dared to love, and believe in, never more to be.Murray Whyte, the long-time art critic at the Toronto Star, is now the art critic at the Boston GlobeFollow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion or catch up on our best stories"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5a4f2c5609a3dc8de1d264d639904d1032d52c3/0_31_3725_2235/master/3725.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9c42fe02ebf9454b119719b33810325","title":"aoc setting terrible example with her adorable new puppy","story":"The congresswoman’s choice of a French bulldog – a breed prone to serious health problems – is disappointing. Let’s hope it doesn’t lead others to buy Frenchies they can’t look afterThere’s a new pup in politics. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez recently introduced the world to her freshly acquired French bulldog via Instagram. He is called Deco, after the art deco movement, and he’s very cute. He has also proved very controversial. The congresswoman’s apparent decision to purchase a purebred puppy instead of adopting a rescue dog has set tongues wagging and prompted a condemnation from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta).Peta can be an insufferable attention-seeker but I’m with it when it comes to this issue. Ocasio-Cortez has more than 10m followers across Twitter and Instagram she is highly influential and a role model to many. It is disappointing that she appears to have purchased a dog, when there are so many rescue dogs waiting for homes. I say “appears”, by the way, because Ocasio-Cortez hasn’t clarified how she acquired the pup, despite having been asked multiple times. So it is possible he is a rescue – although I’ve got a feeling that AOC, who is fond of a teachable moment, would have let people know this upfront.Wherever little Deco comes from, there is also the fact that he’s a French bulldog. Frenchies have soared in popularity in recent years – in part, because they have become a celebrity favourite. However, as Peta notes, they have been bred to be cute, not healthy, and are prone to serious breathing issues that many owners aren’t fully prepared, or financially able, to handle. Dogs are major responsibilities, not cute accessories, and it will be a shame if AOC’s new pup prompts people to buy Frenchies they can’t look after. Having said all that, I would like to clarify that I still think Deco is a very good boy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9c5db32d0127bbeecd71dd26ae41d43bff983dd/0_169_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=619ab6a74b882f21dfadf30b64efcde5","title":"driving city clean air zones birmingham","story":"Clean air zones, such as the one proposed in Birmingham, can work if we increase people’s options. Ministers must get involvedImagine a capital city where nobody has to die on the roads.It may sound almost impossible, but last year not a single pedestrian, cyclist or child lost their life on the streets of Norway’s capital, Oslo the only fatality recorded was a motorist crashing into a fence. (By comparison 12 people were killed in Bristol, a city slightly smaller than Oslo, in 2017 – and over half of them were pedestrians or cyclists.)The catch? The lives saved in Norway seem to have been a byproduct of a bigger plan to become a carbon-neutral city that would probably spark a mutiny if you tried it here. Oslo has closed some streets to traffic entirely, removed parking spaces across the city to deter drivers, introduced measures to stop parents doing the school run by car and reduced speed limits. There’s plentiful public transport and lots of bike lanes but the bottom line is, as Oslo’s mayor says, that while cities will always have traffic, “the drivers should act as guests”. And not very welcome guests, by the sound of it.Something like this would probably be the future for British cities, if we were serious about dealing with the air pollution filling urban children’s lungs, as well as tackling the climate crisis. This week, Birmingham announced proposals to stop people driving across the city centre, amid research suggesting that illegal levels of air pollution may be shortening the lives of children growing up in the city by up to half a year. Cars will be allowed into a new clean air zone, but not through it to reach other parts of the city, forcing them out around the ring road, or otherwise encouraging drivers on to the bus.It’s following in the footsteps of other cities, including Bristol, which unveiled proposals last autumn to ban diesel cars from parts of the city in daytime, and Oxford, which this week published plans for a zero-emission zone in the centre with a £10 charge for non-compliant vehicles. Suddenly you can imagine a time when driving into a smog-laden city, in all but the greenest cars and for all but the most essential journeys, will feel as antisocial as smoking on the bus.But there’s bound to be a backlash, as there was in Oslo initially, and sometimes for reasons that aren’t so easy to dismiss. In Bristol there have been awkward questions about whether a ban would be fair on sick and frail people trying to reach hospitals inside the zone. Keeping polluting cars out of town, but letting drivers of new electric ones go where they like, meanwhile, hurts poorer families who can’t afford to replace their old car.It would be wholly unfair for ministers either to sit back and let local councils bear the brunt of motorists’ anger over all of this when they’re responding to national imperatives (Birmingham is one of five cities asked by central government to introduce clean air zones after a court ruling that Britain was breaching EU air pollution limits) or to expect this to work without serious improvements to public transport. We’re overdue an honest national conversation about how to do this fairly – and national politicians should summon the nerve to lead it from the front.Nobody drives in a city for the thrill of the open road, to put it mildly. There’s nothing fun about stewing in bumper-to-bumper traffic, and while sometimes drivers do it out of laziness, more often it’s just because it works because it would be lovely if everyone cycled Nordic-style to school with the kids, stopping en route for cinnamon rolls and neighbourly conversation, but sometimes life isn’t like that. Sometimes stuffing the children into the car is the only way to manage school and nursery runs in two different directions, plus getting to work on time, plus grabbing a supermarket shop on the way home – because too many Britons live frantic lives with no slack in the day and dismal public transport options.If you want people to drive less then you have to organise society in a way that makes that bearable, and that’s ultimately a job for central governments. It’s time national politicians stopped being backseat drivers here, and took the wheel."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11bd58efa0d74ae93cd5bc6ef7ca4853457b484a/0_338_5072_3044/master/5072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e54c0c8fa417c2e799974946422b30b","title":"how to be a commuter student and keep your social life","story":"Weighing up the full student experience versus a peaceful home life can be hard, but there are ways to enjoy bothFellow commuter student Eleanor Penny faced a similar dilemma. “Many people made me feel like I would be missing out by not moving into student accommodation,” she says. “I suffered from mental health issues which made commuting an easier option for me.”Recent graduate Chloe Halliday, meanwhile, felt torn but ultimately chose to stay at home. “It was the easiest option,” she says. “I didn’t want to move away from family or friends.”Weighing up the full student experience versus a peaceful home life can be hard – but I found there are ways to enjoy both.As a commuter student, you’ll miss out on a big chunk of freshers’ week. You won’t have been forced into friendships with flatmates and you’ll have nowhere to stay in town. The best thing you can do to tackle first-week nerves is join a club. You’re bound to meet a group of like-minded people somewhere, whether it’s the football team or the larping society.What I didn’t realise when I started my lectures, workshops and seminars was that my coursemates would all be in the same boat. We were all thrown in at the deep end with a group of people we’d never met. After my worries about being the odd one out, sitting next to someone and letting a conversation begin naturally was a great feeling.Once you’ve made a few friends, free evenings up to socialise outside of class – or if you’ve got work to do, get together and write that assignment you’ve been putting off. Arrange to meet at the library, invite them to yours, or go back to their flat. It’s a good way to get to know people better. You never know, you might get on with their flatmates as well.Since you’ve already lived in the area, you’re more likely to know the best clubs, cafes and bargains – so why not impress your friends by inviting them on a night out? “I’ve taken my friends on dinner dates, and to local gigs and bars,” says Halliday. Your friends will be indebted to you once you’ve revealed the town’s secrets.Themed nights and student union parties usually pop up towards the end of the term.

At midday the university decided to cancel it because disruption looked inevitable, and proper academic discussion unlikely.“I was furious,” Phoenix says. “It was very clear to me that those agitating were fundamentally anti-academic because they condemned me and my research without hearing what I had to say.”Phoenix, who is adamant she is not transphobic, had given the same talk at the University of Newfoundland in Canada a month earlier, to an audience that included trans scholars, without controversy. “They all liked it. So there is something unique about what is going on in the UK,” she says.The talk explored tensions around placing trans women in British prisons, and argued that there are problems with applying trans rights to criminal justice.Universities are negotiating a minefield, trying to maintain free speech while faced with two groups of people who both argue they are being made to feel unsafe.The vice-chancellor of Essex, Anthony Forster, has promised a review into what happened in December, and says the university expects its community not to interfere with “the rights of others to express views with which they might disagree profoundly”. He adds that Essex has “an equally clear commitment to being an inclusive community”.The transgender debate cuts across many academic disciplines, including law, education, gender studies, philosophy and history. So-called gender-critical feminists, who believe that gender is a social construct rather than innate, say they want to explore trans issues within their fields, but that they, and the debate as a whole, are being stifled in British universities.However, academics such as Tam Blaxter, a historical linguist at Cambridge University, who is a trans woman, say these arguments make trans staff and students feel vulnerable. “Universities are communities of staff and students first and foremost,” she says. “They will always have a function of discussing difficult issues, but making minority members feel safe and welcomed must come first.”Kathleen Stock, professor of philosophy at Sussex University and a gender-critical feminist, claims that last month Oxford University Press abandoned a book on female philosophers because her inclusion was deemed too controversial.Stock, who insists she is not transphobic, is one of the most prominent advocates of gender-critical feminism, and has faced calls for Sussex to sack her. She says that one reason the American office of OUP gave in December for dropping the latest book in a series called Philosophy at 3am, was that she was involved and would attract negative attention. “I think that is terrible and cowardly,” she says.  A spokeswoman for the OUP said it would not comment on the review process for inidual projects, but that it did not often publish collections of interviews and this was “a contributing factor to our decision not to pursue this project”. Dr Kath Murray, a research associate in criminology at Edinburgh University, says there are many obstacles to organising gender-critical events on women’s rights. An event was cancelled at Edinburgh in December because of fears the speakers would face abuse.Murray says one event that went ahead last year on sex-based rights required extensive security because of anticipated opposition. “There was a one-hour security briefing for speakers, seven security guards attending the event, a security sweep of the lecture theatre beforehand, and ID checks for all attendees,” she says.In December, another event was due to take place, on schools and gender ersity. Dr Shereen Benjamin, senior lecturer in primary education at Edinburgh and the event organiser, says it was intended to show teachers both sides of the debate. “I wanted to bring together gender-critical speakers who see the increase in referral rates of children to gender identity clinics as problematic, and believe it has multiple social causes, with speakers from trans rights organisations who believe it is due to young people discovering their true identities at a younger age,” she says.Benjamin says she was unable, however, to persuade any trans rights organisations to share the stage with gender-critical speakers, so the event was redesigned as a research seminar without teachers involved. However, when booking went live in December, the university’s staff pride network criticised it in an email to hundreds of staff, and on its blog, citing guest speakers “with a history of transphobia”.With at least one academic urging opponents to protest, Benjamin cancelled, fearing speakers would face abuse. “It is now so risky and frightening for people to talk critically about gender identity on campus,” she says.“We need universities to establish and maintain the boundaries of acceptable protest from within their communities, and to intervene quickly and decisively if there are any attempts at intimidation.”Jonathan MacBride, co-chair of Edinburgh’s staff pride network, says his committee felt the event “would be upsetting and hurtful for anyone who is trans or an ally to the trans community”.He says universities should not provide platforms for outspoken gender critics. “When someone has said publicly that they don’t believe trans women are women or, more harmfully, that trans women are men and should somehow be held accountable for the actions of a minority of predatory men in the world, that isn’t really a debate, it’s just hateful speech about an already marginalised minority.”Universities say privately that they are finding the debate difficult to navigate, because their obligations under the Equality Act seem to clash with freedom of speech. But Colin Riordan, vice-chancellor of Cardiff University, a member of the elite Russell Group, says: “This is a isive issue and rouses strong emotions, but if we don’t have the debate, how will we ever resolve it?”Riordan faced down heated demands in 2015 for Germaine Greer, the celebrity feminist, to be banned from lecturing at Cardiff on the grounds that she had made transphobic comments. He says: “The way universities have to approach this, like other difficult issues, is to defend academic freedom and uphold free speech, as long as it is within the law.” Sarah Honeychurch, a fellow at the University of Glasgow’s business school, says the problem extends beyond university management. She was sacked last summer as editor of the academic journal Hybrid Pedagogy, after signing a public letter by feminists questioning universities’ relationship with the LGBT+ charity Stonewall.“One of the founding members of the journal said on Twitter that my position was at odds with values he considered to be central to education,” she says.The journal managers blocked her from accessing any documents and have not spoken to her since, she says. “My background is philosophy. The idea that I can’t challenge anything is deeply troubling.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87e4b7d022ea3643db7a261c9393d159db9ab4b0/0_90_6000_3598/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d341be72e0c4fa303712ca60a8a6c95d","title":"colgate launches vegan certified toothpaste in recyclable tube","story":"Smile for Good brand on sale in Waitrose and Boots, at £5 for 75ml tubeColgate has launched a new toothpaste which is being billed as the first of a kind because it comes in a recyclable tube.Toothpaste tubes have traditionally been impossible to recycle because they are made from a mixture of plastic and aluminium. Consumers get through 20bn packs of toothpaste every year with discarded tubes contributing to the plastic pollution crisis.But Colgate’s new Smile for Good brand, which has also been certified by the Vegan Society, comes in a tube made from high density polyethylene (HDPE) which is the same plastic as milk containers.Colgate said its engineers had figured out a way to turn the hard plastic, which is widely recyclable, into a “comfortably squeezable” tube.The technology will be shared with rivals, Colgate-Palmolive said, as part of its commitment to reduce usage of what is one of the most widely used forms of plastic packaging that cannot be recycled.However, the green toothpaste, which is on sale in Waitrose and Boots, comes at a high price. At £5 for 75ml, Smile for Goods costs more than six times as much as a regular tube of Colgate.Colgate-Palmolive’s chief executive, Noel Wallace, said: “Colgate wants to make tubes a part of the circular economy by keeping this plastic productive and eliminating waste. If we can standardise recyclable tubes among all companies, we all win. We can align on these common standards for tubes and still compete with what’s inside them.”Colgate has also taken the unusual step of listing the toothpaste’s ingredients on the tube alongside a simple explanation of their function. Consumers trying to buy greener products were confused by the role of the various ingredients, the company said. While the role of fluoride is probably well understood, the tube explains that silica cleans and polishes while glycerin prevents the paste from drying out.Last year Unilever said it would halve its use of virgin plastic by creating greener versions of its household products, a shift that could make shampoo refill stations, cardboard deodorant sticks and toothpaste tablets the norm in supermarkets."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1898bde64a7baa30c788109f73b4097ca8e3f2a/1010_0_1648_989/master/1648.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83a819b6cc3b97a6aa63f399b8b22564","title":"caitlyn jenner it was tough wearing a bustier for vanity fair","story":"The TV star and Olympic champion discusses her approach to fashion and her favourite outfit – the Donatella Versace dress she wore for her first public appearance after transitioningIn the old days, buying clothes was one of the most difficult tasks.

But the three-time nominee’s long-gestating passion project (a starry adaptation of Jonathan Lethem’s award-winning noir) was ultimately more of a vanity project, complete with a mannered, almost parodic Norton central performance. It wasn’t a complete disaster but it felt like the kind of competent Miramax prestige pic that would have been pushed in 2003 and forgotten about by 2004.Clint Eastwood has developed an impressive habit of sneaking into the awards race at the last minute, dropping films late in the day, often speedily made yet always finely crafted. It’s a strategy that’s paid off on a number of occasions – Million Dollar Baby, American Sniper – but last year, the sterling credentials of awards-friendly fact-based drama Richard Jewell weren’t enough to make a mark. The film, which tells the story of the security guard falsely accused of planting a bomb at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, received solid reviews but also faced controversy over its inaccurate portrayal of a female journalist, alleging she swapped sex for tips. Audiences responded with apathy and the film gave Eastwood one of his worst-ever openings. As Jewell’s mother, Bates scored a supporting actress nomination at the Golden Globes and the Oscars but it’s a poor showing for a film that was aiming for so much more.When the fact-based legal drama Just Mercy premiered at last year’s Toronto film festival, complaints about its by-the-numbers storytelling were outweighed by both the film’s undeniable emotive power and praise for Jamie Foxx’s turn as a man wrongly accused of murder. He was seen as an instant lock for best supporting actor but as we edged closer to awards season, the film, and Foxx, started to lose steam. He picked up a Screen Actors Guild nomination but was shut out elsewhere and the film’s late release strategy meant that for many, it was unfairly buried underneath contenders with a more distinctive edge.Rushed by the director Tom Hooper in order to meet an Oscar-friendly release date, Cats was unleashed in such a shoddy state that a tweaked cut was shipped to cinemas just days after it went wide. Quite why Universal thought a plotless musical populated by nonsensically named CG monstrosities would appeal to voters is a mystery but the reception for the film was so bad that the studio removed it from its “for your consideration” roster soon after it tanked. Even Taylor Swift’s original, but forgettable, song couldn’t claw its way into this week’s list of nominees. The lessons should hopefully be clear: not every well-known IP should be resurrected, Tom Hooper can’t be trusted and, most importantly, don’t fuck with Cats.Like Just Mercy, Dark Waters took an aggravating real-life legal case and turned it into an involving, sturdy film – and like Just Mercy, it also failed to make a convincing enough argument for inclusion to Academy voters. A muted thriller about a staggering case of corporate negligence, it acted as more of a call to action than a fully formed movie, with the director Todd Haynes and stars Mark Ruffalo and Anne Hathaway mostly coasting. It’s the kind of story that viewers have become more accustomed to finding on Netflix and its underwhelming box office suggests that the small screen might be where similarly plotted stories belong in the future.Reuniting the stars of The Theory of Everything, Oscar-winning Eddie Redmayne and Oscar-nominated Felicity Jones, the ambitious period adventure The Aeronauts was sold on the strange assertion that audiences would care about seeing the pair together again. But while the Stephen Hawking biopic made an impact upon release, it’s not a film that’s stuck in the years since and Amazon’s ballooning semi-biopic was deflating for a number of reasons. A restrained release – the film was originally set to be on Imax yet ultimately in most territories reserved to streaming only – and polite, if unenthused, reviews meant that it couldn’t work as either a mass market effects extravaganza or an awards-friendly critical darling.On paper, so much suggested that a prestigious adaptation of The Goldfinch would be a natural fit for the Oscars, from the award-winning cast (Nicole Kidman, Jeffrey Wright, Sarah Paulson) to the Pulitzer prize-winning source material from Donna Tartt to a director whose last film, Brooklyn, was feted by the Academy. But when it came to the film itself, based on what’s been called unfilmable source material, Warner Bros granted it a token Toronto film festival premiere just days before it crash-landed into cinemas with one of the year’s worst openings and some of the season’s most hateful reviews.One of the many surprise snubs from this week’s Oscar nominations was the exclusion of the blaxploitation biopic Dolemite Is My Name. At this stage of the season, most hadn’t predicted it to figure in the best picture race but Eddie Murphy, who had been figuring heavily in the circuit, was seen as a strong contender for best actor. It’s a disappointment with a number of possible explanations: an unusually stacked category, some ill will toward Murphy for prior behaviour and also a refusal from some Academy members to take comedians seriously (Adam Sandler’s career-best turn in Uncut Gems was also left out in the cold)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c020ba23a1fe3b07ffd72b3cbf3600f39c241b41/0_178_5393_3236/master/5393.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3affbbd4594541fcd8c6203e7a9d4b99","title":"lucian freud a self portrait review documentary","story":"Detailing an epic social life as well as an obsession with painting himself in to his own works, this is a fascinating, if limited, overviewThe latest in the excellent Exhibition on Screen series is pinned to the current Lucian Freud: The Self Portraits show at the Royal Academy, which is due to end later this month. It’s really designed to fill in the gaps and provide context a slightly purer form, perhaps, of the gallery film mini-genre we have got used to.Well, this film – with its subtly edited subtitle, A Self Portrait – is well up to standard: it takes us through Freud’s upbringing, education and early development as an artist, pointing out (naturally) his epic social life as well as his fervent dedication to painting. The film also takes advantage of interview material with the artist (who died in 2011) shot by his former assistant David Dawson, who also took the famous photograph of Freud painting a tiny picture of the Queen.Freud’s early work, with its precise outlines and mysterious symbolism, is given its due, though of course most of the attention is devoted to his thickly painted later masterworks, which reflect the artist’s own piercing gaze. (There’s a fascinating section devoted to Freud’s habit of painting himself almost invisibly into his pictures, via shadows, or mirrors, or indeed other self-portraits, as barely noticeable props.) There’s the usual informed comment from curatorial talking heads, one or two of whom ended up sitting for Freud and the comparisons to Rembrandt, advanced at some length, don’t seem entirely overblown.If there’s a slight drawback, it’s that the remit of the format, which focuses on a single aspect of Freud’s work, ends up feeling a little narrow. There’s an unavoidable temptation to want to wander into areas not connected to self-portraiture. But there’s no harm in leaving the viewer wanting more.•Lucian Freud: A Self Portrait is released in the UK on 14 January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b325e0be3f3e2dc164fbcf98982469aa2c2b7e8f/0_53_2250_1350/master/2250.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c96815faa1496ca7551985187aeccbf","title":"slaves nannies and maids how oscars value female actors of colour","story":"For non-white actors, an award nomination seems to depend on whether the role is deserving of white pity – making recent ersity moves look patheticFor Oscar voters, what makes a great performance has disturbingly narrow criteria for non-white performers. The observation that people of colour are only ever recognised for playing slaves and criminals, that their stories are only ever seen as important when they deal with tragedy and suffering, does not strictly belong to the unenlightened past. This week’s Oscar nominations prove that such judgments are planted firmly in the present.The kinds of roles being written for people of colour over the past decade have begun to expand to encompass a wider range of experiences. Just recently we were graced with the luminous Jennifer Lopez as savvy stripper Ramona in Hustlers newcomer Nora Lum (Awkwafina) as the conflicted granddaughter of a dying matriarch in The Farewell Lupita Nyong’o in a remarkable two-in-one turn in Jordan Peele’s Us. This all goes without mentioning the incredible performances that never quite picked up steam: Alfre Woodard in Clemency, for instance, or Song Kang-Ho in Parasite. But never mind the fertile pickings. This year the Academy has nominated one person of colour – Cynthia Erivo as Harriet Tubman in Harriet. This outcome is dismaying, partly because it falls neatly into a familiar pattern: a person of colour performing a racially specific form of suffering, the outlier in a sea of white nominees.Erivo’s nomination for Harriet, a film that received middling reviews, is not a preposterous decision. Actors are often recognised for inidual work that might stand out in an otherwise mediocre film (take Renée Zellweger in Judy). I’m not bothered by the quality of Erivo’s performance. There are far more egregious entries on that front, with the likes of Charlize Theron for Bombshell, or Scarlet Johansson for Jojo Rabbit, reaping nods (have the Oscars ever been a legitimate meritocracy?). Far more worrisome is what Erivo’s nomination suggests about the way Academy voters evaluate performers of colour, who seem to be the most visible, and taken the most seriously, within the trappings of white pity.That voters overlooked a performance like Nyong’o’s in Us, a chilling interpretation of two sides of the same self, is telling. It doesn’t matter that this performance matches, if not surpasses entirely that of Joaquin Phoenix’s in Joker, even though both actors play, with tremendous physical commitment, psychologically tormented characters in genre films. Instead, the Academy prefers the Nyong’o who starred in 12 Years a Slave (2013), a film in which she is a slave, raped and humiliated. For these efforts, so difficult for the conscience to ignore, she was awarded best supporting actress.In the last decade, only 14 women of colour were among the 100 women nominated by the Academy for the best actress and best supporting actress awards. There were even fewer men of colour (nine out of 100). That the same types of roles – slaves, nannies, and maids – continue to be the magic ticket to the red carpet, feels particularly ugly considering the range of parts played by white nominees. This year, for instance, the characters of Erivo’s fellow best actress nominees include a Fox newswoman, an icon of classic Hollywood, an aspiring young writer, and a hopeful orcee. In 2019, Yalitza Aparicio was nominated for her performance in Alfonso Cuarón’s Roma. Aparicio is one of the few Latin American actresses to receive the honour, joining Adriana Barraza as a deported nanny in Babel, and Catalina Sandino Moreno as a drug mule in Maria Full of Grace.As moving as these performances are, these films leave a bitter taste as they reaffirm tired conceptions of Latin American women. Aparicio plays a housemaid silently enduring racism and neglect, which recalls another Academy favourite – Tate Taylor’s The Help (2011), which stars Octavia Spencer and Viola Davis as resilient maids, as well! Such slim parameters betray the desire, perhaps even the need by Oscar voters, for a particularly cheap form of pathos, one that simplifies and minimises the experiences of non-white people by placing them on the margins or in the past. Those performances that don’t square with this mould are often considered too “light,” too niche, or too subversive for the Academy, all of which indicates the incredible myopia of its voting body and the thinly veiled racism that guides it.Perhaps hoping for a consistently erse pool of Oscar nominees is blind optimism the more time passes, the anomalous triumphs of films such as Barry Jenkins’ Moonlight, feel like a fever dream. By opening up its membership to more women and people of colour, and enlisting erse talent such as John Cho, Issa Rae, and Tiffany Haddish to present its nominations, the Academy has attempted to create an image of inclusivity. But given this year’s batch of nominees, that commitment has proven to be both superficial and a bad joke."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a32eec7507115be3c2864539cbd4fb8ba3f1140/0_266_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8165092224781b77e3a5fa3fd29f682","title":"how to make the perfect pie kitchen aide","story":"It all starts with great ingredients, then fill with care – and don’t overwork that doughWhat’s the secret to the perfect pie?Steffi, ChichesterThis sounds like a job for a proper, old-school butcher, Steffi. Not just any butcher, either, but Jon Thorner’s in Somerset, the nation’s reigning pie champion. And it turns out there’s no secret at all, says general manager Dan Snook: “Just lots of care and attention, plus quality ingredients of good provenance.” So a bit like just about any culinary endeavour, then.But there are a few basics that anyone in pursuit of pie perfection should maybe bear in mind. First off, the pastry: whether you opt for puff, shortcrust or pâte sucrée, don’t overwork the dough, or it will be dry and tough and only add enough water just to bring it together, or it won’t bake through properly and will end up unpleasantly rubbery and chewy.Thorner’s pies are all made from scratch by hand, and they all feature a shortcrust pastry that just happens to be vegan by default, rather than by design. This came in very handy indeed last year, when their curried butternut squash and sweet potato pie took the top prize at the annual British Pie Awards in Melton Mowbray. The gong turned Thorner’s vegan pie from something of a niche product at their Shepton Mallett shop, where they shift about 3,000 pies a week, into a much more mainstream one, though Snook doubts it’ll ever rival their bestseller. “That will always be the steak and ale,” he says. “With pies, people are traditionalists.” Still, a much-hyped vegan product never did Greggs any harm, did it?What you put in your pie obviously depends on what you fancy at the time, while the filling to pastry ratio depends mainly on how many it’s feeding. “With our small, inidual pies, that works out at roughly 50:50,” Snook says, “but with larger ones it’s more like 65:35.” And never, ever cheat on the filling, he warns: “Few things are more disappointing than cutting into a lovely-looking, golden pie only to find it’s half empty. That’s why we fill ours almost to the brim.” But only almost, or that delicious filling you’ve spent time and money on will very likely bubble up during the baking and turn the lid soggy, or burst through entirely, leaving your pie looking like an unholy mess and the inside of your oven even worse.Whenever possible, make the filling ahead of time, advises the UK’s unofficial pie king, Calum Franklin, executive head chef of Holborn Dining Room in London and purveyor of some of the most staggeringly intricate and beautiful pie-based creations known to humanity. “Not only because the filling needs to be cool before going into its pastry parcel,” he says, “but it also gives you the luxury of time to build a spectacular pie without the pressure of having to do everything at the last moment and your guests starting a riot because it’s midnight and they still haven’t eaten.” And if the filling features gravy or sauce of any kind, “make sure it’s thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, or it will be very hard to cook the pastry well – watery sauces just soak into the dough.”As for the baking vessel, Franklin prefers a spring-form cake tin to more traditional pie-ware: “It’s a cracking mould to build a pie in, because it’s so easy to remove the finished article from, and it guarantees you a gorgeous, high-sided, deep-filled pie.”Franklin doesn’t have much truck with obsessives who argue that, to qualify as a pie, the filling has to be fully encased in pastry, and who dismiss anything else as just a stew with a lid. “It would be more accurate to call that a ‘pot pie’, but while I personally prefer the spectacle of a free-standing, fully wrapped pie – historically, it’s more accurate to say that that’s what constitutes an actual pie, anyway – it’s not something to get stressed about. It’s your dinner, so you can call it whatever you like.”• Do you have a culinary dilemma?

Use pancetta in the block rather than in thin rashers, so the pieces are more like large lardons rather than shreds.Field mushrooms, the large flat variety, would make a good substitute for the pancetta. They will need a little more oil in which to cook, as they tend to sponge it up. Most blue cheeses are suitable in this recipe, particularly the softer sorts, such as gorgonzola or roquefort, as they melt easily into the hot mashed potato, but other soft cheeses will work well, too.

Now you can buy varieties from bratwurst to spiced cola. But what inspired this explosion?When she was a little girl in Essex in the 50s, Linda Miller would go over to her neighbour Barbara’s house every Friday night and together they would sit on the front step eating crisps. There was only one flavour widely available back then – Smith’s plain potato crisps, which came with a small blue sachet of salt that could be sprinkled over them. One Friday night, the two friends struck upon an idea. “We thought we’d invented a new crisp,” says 68-year-old Miller. Inspired by their weekly fish and chip takeaway, the pair “saturated” their plain crisps with a bottle of vinegar. “It was lovely, lovely – very tasty,” Miller says. “When salt and vinegar crisps came out, I remember thinking: ‘They’re not as good as what we do.’”Crisps were first mass-produced in the early 20th century, but the first flavoured crisp was released only in the late 50s, after Joe “Spud” Murphy, the owner of the Irish company Tayto, developed a technique to add cheese and onion seasoning during production. Salt and vinegar crisps were launched throughout the UK a decade later, in 1967, when Miller was 16.In her lifetime, a transformation has taken place on supermarket shelves. Should you want to, you can now buy not only bacon, chicken, chilli and pickled onion crisps, but truffle, pink peppercorn gin, baked camembert, masala chicken, brie, Aberdeen Angus beef, salted caramel, katsu curry and sriracha. (To this day, Miller prefers to vinegar her own crisps.)How is it possible that, in 60 years, British shops have gone from selling one crisp flavour to selling hundreds – and why are seasonings becoming more unusual? What led Kettle Chips to release a “truffled cheese and a splash of English sparkling wine” flavour in October? Was there a mad scientific breakthrough that caused Walkers to release bratwurst, paella, haggis and spaghetti bolognese crisps in 2010?In the beginning, says the food historian Nadia Berenstein, industry experts thought of crisps as potatoes. What this means, she explains, is that early seasonings mimicked the flavours that would accompany traditional potato dishes – salt and vinegar, cheese and onion, and barbecue sauce in the US. Although synthetic chemical compounds for flavouring were developed in the middle of the 19th century, Berenstein says the industry exploded after the second world war with the invention of a device called the gas chromatograph, or GC.“The GC was a really powerful tool for identifying the volatile compounds that are present in and contribute to flavours,” Berenstein says. “Just being able to figure out, isolate and identify these things prior to the GC took a long time. To study the flavour chemistry of apples, you’d have to start with a literal tonne of apples and then process those down to a concentrate of a couple of milligrams.” For the first time, gas chromatography allowed food scientists to quickly understand the chemical compounds behind complex flavours such as cheese.In an October 1955 issue of a US industry magazine called Potato Chipper, “Bar-B-Q” flavouring was described as “the most sensational new development in the industry”. The excitement around the new possibilities was palpable. In a later issue, an X-ray nurse from Cincinnati was crowned “Miss Potato Chip of 1956” (“She is five feet eight inches, blonde, and weighs 125 pounds,” declared the magazine). Pete Cardy, a 63-year-old from Hertfordshire, recalls visiting the Ideal Home Exhibition at Olympia in London as a child in the 60s and seeing a vendor selling smoky bacon crisps. “It really blew my mind,” he says of sampling the snack. “It was: ‘Wow,’ it was just so exotic.”Crisp history is remarkably spotty: debate rages about which company invented which flavour. When I contact Walkers to ask for a rough timeline of when its flavours were released, I am sent a document with “????” written between the 70s and the 00s. Amateur archivists paint a fuller picture. Wayne Tomlinson, a 51-year-old from Doncaster who has collected more than 8,000 crisp packets since the 80s, stores them, neatly pressed, in cardboard boxes around his home. He also has four boxes of new, unopened flavours waiting to be tried. Over Christmas, he tasted and reviewed a new packet every day, including lobster cocktail, ham with spiced cola and even roast potato flavour.“A big 80s flavour was spring onion,” says Tomlinson. “Now virtually no brands do it.” Tomlinson – who helps run the 972-follower Facebook page Crazy Bout Crisps and is on the Seabrook Crisps taste-teste panel – says the 80s were “experimental” he started collecting crisp packets after enjoying unusual limited-edition flavours such as Smith’s gammon and pineapple. He reminisces fondly about unusual early flavours such as Tudor’s limited-edition chocolate (he posted the flattened purple and brown foil packet to the Facebook page) and Smith’s novelty run of hedgehog flavour, although he shudders at the memory of Seabrook’s sweetcorn. As a teenager, he was allowed a packet of KP cheese and onion crisps for supper at exactly 8.30pm. “Every night, we would eagerly await it.”But the market changed again, Berenstein says, roughly a decade ago. “It’s not that there’s been any kind of technological breakthrough that has allowed for these things that were previously only dreamed of,” she says. “It’s a new understanding of consumer desires and a new pace of production. It’s a bloodbath out there in the supermarkets.” New, limited-edition and mystery flavours attempt to capture the market by “promising something new and different”, she says.For Walkers, novelty arrived in 2009 in the form of its “Do us a flavour” competition, which asked the public to come up with seasoning ideas. The winners – among them chilli and chocolate, cajun squirrel and builder’s breakfast – led the way for the brand’s 2010 World Cup range, including yorkshire pudding, bratwurst, garlic bread, salsa, paella and haggis flavours.Tassy Goodall, a chef who works with Sainsbury’s to develop its Taste the Difference crisps, says that the UK crisp market has been influenced by global food trends. “Because the UK is so multicultural and we’re quite well connected with different cultures through restaurants specialising in different cuisines like Middle Eastern food and regional Indian dishes, it gives us more leeway to use more unusual or interesting flavours.”In the past few years, a number of studies have found that Britons and Americans are increasingly replacing their meals with snacks, with a 2018 survey by Listerine reporting that one-third of Britons eat only one meal a day. Matt Smith, the marketing director of the Northern Irish crisp-maker Tayto (a separate brand from the Irish firm of the same name), says earlier crisp flavours were inspired by things you could put in a sandwich (hence the launch of prawn cocktail flavour in the 70s), but because potatoes have a “clean flavour” they are the perfect vehicle for emerging food trends. Berenstein concurs: “In contrast, something like yoghurt or a beverage can be challenging to flavour because you have to design flavours that go along with the acid and the dairy.”Sweet flavours such as Christmas pudding started cropping up in 2016 (the Scottish brand Mackie’s launched strawberry, while Pringles released sugar cookie and pecan pie). This led the way for the launch of alcohol flavours. Phil Hovey, a developmental chef at Kettle Chips, created the brand’s truffled cheese and a splash of English sparkling wine flavour because it was looking for a little luxury. He explains how, when eating crisps, you may pick up some flavours first and then be hit with an aftertaste. Seasonings are made in everything from fine powders to large grains “the larger pieces you taste later, the smaller pieces you taste earlier”.Hovey works on roughly 12 new flavours at any one time, but he says only half of these see the light of day. “I spend a lot of time working in the future. It takes me eight months to make a seasoning, so I’m trying to make something that’s going to be bang on trend in eight months’ time.” Sometimes this means the chef misses the mark – his team have been known to cry: “What are you making?!” – while other flavours make it to taste-testing groups that ultimately disapprove.Like Sainsbury’s developers, Hovey agrees the current snacking trend is all about “food adventure” – he travels around street markets, food fairs and festivals to get inspiration. Yet Lawson at Tyrrells says an appetite for luxury also drives trends, arguing that economically uncertain times means people treat themselves in smaller ways. “People tell us it’s a way of showing how much they care about their friends and families because they’ve given them something special they’ve gone out and found. So it’s quite an emotional thing – it’s not just: ‘Oh, I’m going to try these crazy crisps,’” she says. To tie in with the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in 2018, the brand launched ginger-flavoured crisps that were dusted with edible glitter.Yet Lawson says Tyrrells is moving away from anything “a bit wacky” to focus on firm British favourites. In 2018, the brand’s raspberry bellini flavour was a flop. “I think the flavour was probably a little too out there for some of our fans and we’ve learned from that,” Lawson says. “Sometimes when we launch something new, you get a bit of excitement, but it doesn’t actually perform that well.” The exception is the brand’s truffle flavour, which is now its fifth-most popular seller. Lawson puts this down to Tyrrells’ demographic – older shoppers with “foody interests” and “discerning palates”.It seems that lessons have been learned from flavouring fads – many sweet flavours have disappeared. Indeed, there is still an overwhelming appetite for the staples. At Tayto, Smith says cheese and onion represents one-third of its sales, while ready salted remains the most popular on the market as a whole. “However many years on, they’re the ones we still all go back to,” he says.So, what is next for crisps? Hovey believes the demand for “bolder and bigger” flavours isn’t going anywhere, while Berenstein says that nothing – not even a climate apocalypse – can break the seasoning spirit.“Climate change is going to change agricultural production: people will eat less meat, there will be finite availability of certain kinds of produce, or at least a higher cost to pay,” she says. “But I think, because flavour is potent in very small quantities, it’s one of the things you’ll be able to expand.” As our food options shrink, Berenstein argues, artificial flavourings could become more prevalent as we look to mix up our limited diets.“It’s easier for me to imagine a climate change dystopian grocery store that is full of potato chips perfectly enhanced with cricket protein, in every flavour imaginable, than it is for me to imagine a shrink in the number of flavour opportunities,” she says.As for Tomlinson, he says he picks up two to three new flavours to try every week – and there is no sign of things slowing down. “Some days you can eat more than others,” he says. “I live on my own, so I can be quite non-standard with my meals … I try to eat at least one proper meal a day and, for the other meals, either in the middle of day or the evening, just have a couple of bags of crisps.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2056f4bea8afb4f42e511902ee23dedca299d7dd/0_0_4581_2749/master/4581.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d671debcbca6434098ee7b0850087d6","title":"quique setien barcelona job cows new manager","story":"Quique Setién says he did not imagine in his “wildest dreams” becoming Barcelona manager and that he was walking in his home town with cows around him hours before his appointment.Setién has replaced Ernesto Valverde on a contract until the end of the 2021-22 season and was unveiled at a press conference on Tuesday.“I want to thank this institution for giving me the chance,” Setién said. “Not even in my wildest dreams could I have imagined this. I have to thank the club. I’m excited about this challenge and this project.“That is the biggest thing I have to transmit to the players.

It doesn’t always happen but it’s not just about one day, it’s about keeping it going.”Setien was asked about Lionel Messi because he has said in the past that he would cry the day the Argentinian retired. “I said that about a lot of players,” he said. “I have enjoyed watching Barcelona for several years, watching them on television.“To be able to manage the best in the world, and his teammates - he has great teammates - I have spoken to him and others. I have always said that the admiration is one thing but reality is different. Everyone needs to have their place. Messi is Messi, Busquets is Busquets.”Setien will be in the Barcelona dugout for the first time at home to Granada on Sunday. On his arrival, he said: “Every time a new manager comes in, there is a stimulus for everyone inside the dressing room. You notice it immediately.“This stimulus that we saw in the session today, we need to maintain that and I have never met a coach who is the same.“Many people say ‘this coach is exactly the same’, but the reality is we are all very different. I am very clear as to what Barca needs. I’ve seen this from outside, we’ve watched them and analysed them.“There are a lot of things we are very clear about and we will try to transmit that. These are just words, though, and we want things that are long-lasting.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2a0f8af5a439d27bd1c42f7510c6e9e955d8da8/1011_1064_935_560/master/935.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f42ab2a79271d19c68c49a22c4a2af07","title":"the dates are drying profits shrivel for farmers as the heat rises in tunisia","story":"Irrigation systems and oases in the arid south are failing to keep up with the demands of thirsty palm plantationsMansour Rajeb is wrapping a plastic protective sheet around the branch of a date palm in his oasis near the village of Bchelli, in southern Tunisia. Tying it up, he lingers.“I’m worried,” he says. “The quality is getting worse. The dates are getting drier.”Like thousands of farmers across the region, the effects of the climate crisis and water scarcity are threatening his livelihood. “When the quality is poor, we receive lower prices. I’m earning less. This year, I’ll earn a third of last year, which was an average year.”On the road out of Bchelli, a gust of wind makes the sand rise like steam. Beyond the palm trees lies desert, a flat, barren terrain of scrub, rock and sand. Communities have survived here for thousands of years, but the changing environment may soon make it uninhabitable.Overall, temperatures here have risen by about 1C (33.8F) since 1988, according to data collected by the meteorological office in Tozeur, the capital of the region’s western district. “Temperatures used to peak in August and then fall, but now the heat persists until October,” says Taieb Foudhaili of South Organic, a date exporting company based in Kebili. Given this pattern of warming, humidity levels are falling and the plants adapt by releasing water. The result, says Foudhaili, is a drier, poorer product. His company must now do more sorting to maintain quality standards.Global heating has also created shorter periods during which date palms can flower and pollinate, according to Nabila el-Kadri, an agronomist based in Kebili. As a consequence, Kadri has observed a decline in the productivity of dates per hectare.But it is not just rising temperatures causing anxiety. Over recent decades, and particularly after Tunisia’s 2011 revolution, unlawful plantations have spread like blots across the white landscape. The state has failed to exert proper controls. There are now 38,000 declared hectares (93,860 acres) of palm tree across the Kebili region, though Kadri believes the real figure could be as high as 50,000 hectares. More than half of the country’s dates are produced here.After olive production, dates are Tunisia’s second most valuable agricultural export, generating more than $200m (£154m) a year. A consequence is growing water scarcity: date palms are thirsty. On each plantation, Kadri estimates there are between 100 and 140 palm trees per hectare, with each tree requiring roughly 20–25,000 cubic metres of water each year. Neither natural springs nor groundwater can meet this demand.“If we keep creating these new oases, with thousands of hectares of new trees, then over 10 to 15 years we won’t have any water left,” says Kadri.Some are already suffering. Rajeb says he has farmer friends who have already sold their trees in the new, poorly irrigated oases, because their crop was “so feeble”. Kadri says it is only a matter of time before date production as a whole will have to migrate north to Gafsa.Ultimately, the problems of global heating and water scarcity facing Tunisia’s date farmers arise from a similar myopia: a common failure to see things holistically.“We are only thinking about the product,” says Foudhaili, “when we should be thinking about the air, the tree and the soil. We need to change the way we think.”Many of Tunisia’s modern palm plantations are monocultures, producing the valuable Deglet Noor variety of date and little else. When this crop fails, farmers have little to fall back on.Lying in the shade of a palm tree in Chebika, 71-year-old Younes Belgasim is a figure of hope. His oasis is thriving.He is one of an estimated 18,000 people benefiting from a $5.7m World Bank project that launched in 2014. The project provided him with seeds for vegetables and fruit trees, helped him improve his land’s soil and irrigation, and allowed him to erect better fencing to protect his plot from local wild boars.The initiative supported Belgasim to restore a “three-level” system of inter-cropping. On his oasis, the date palms give shade to vines, banana, pomegranate and fig trees, while vegetables and wild grasses grow beneath.This system demands more from farmers, and it may deliver less immediate commercial payoff than date production. Both factors may deter farmers looking to earn their revenue in one date harvest season.But while some inter-cropping farmers in the oases say the system can demand more water, they also report that it maintains humidity levels, improves the soil quality and strengthens bioersity. It also ersifies farmers’ assets.These successes suggest ecosystem-based farming can be a win-win: protecting farmers from climate, economic or disease-related shocks, while also preserving the natural environment. For this reason, Belgasim is more relaxed about the future.“It is getting hotter,” he says, “but I’m not worried about climate change.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c65e3926f073a0cd50fc75c2abebb1632f76ecba/0_58_5019_3011/master/5019.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ddd4894b2c3aa2702917cc5448e0715e","title":"how happy were you at the age of 47 share your experiences","story":"A study has found that people experience ‘peak unhappiness’ at the age of 47.2-years-old.

Out goes the Christmas music back in flood the familiar faces of Lewis Capaldi, Stormzy and Dua Lipa. But for a few hours on 8 January, an Irish rebel song about defying a notorious, 10,000-strong temporary police force sent by Churchill to Ireland in 1920 topped the UK iTunes chart. “Tell them how the IRA made you run like hell away,” runs the refrain of Come Out Ye Black and Tans, this version recorded by traditional Dublin folk band the Wolfe Tones, “From the green and lovely lanes of Killashandra.” Its wildcard success has as much to do with Alan Partridge and a ham advert as it does the legacy of Irish police brutality.Widely believed to have been written by the Irish writer and songwriter, Dominic Behan, as a tribute to his father, Stephen, the song denounces the British force of mostly former soldiers recruited to the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) in Ireland following the 1916 Easter Rising. Not exactly smitten by the British answer to the revolution – namely further repression – the author’s intention would later resonate with the Wolfe Tones. Since 1963, they have packed venues across the world with their siren song of national autonomy, exemplified by the sentiment of Come Out Ye Black and Tans.How has a song ostensibly rooted in Irish republicanism – a heady tale that is essentially an anti-colonialist anthem at its core – burrowed into the imagination of so many listeners? While it has, ahem, occupied a certain place in the minds of Irish people regardless of creed for decades, the broader phenomenon can (perhaps best disregarding a reworking for an Irish ham advert last year) be traced back to two disparate happenings.Last March, Steve Coogan ended an episode of This Time With Alan Partridge by singing the rebel song in character as eccentric rural Irish farmer and Partridge impersonator Martin Brennan. Irish Twitter went wild and the Wolfe Tones’ rendition of the song started to penetrate foreign consciousness on easily the biggest scale since Behan apparently put pen to paper.Then, last week, an event organised by the Irish government that was poised to commemorate the role of the RIC and Dublin politan Police (DMP) – two forces that acquired a reputation for brutality against civilians in the aftermath of IRA attacks during the Irish War of Independence – was deferred following kickback from the public and politicians. No doubt bolstered by fond memories of Martin Brennan, Come Out Ye Black and Tans not only briefly topped both the UK and Irish iTunes charts, but entered the Australian iTunes Top 5. The meme doubled as a signal to Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and co.Admittedly, the iTunes charts are very reactive and easily swayed, and rarely reflect the Official Charts Company’s weekly rankings. (There was a brief furore around Jarvis Cocker’s Running the World hitting the UK iTunes chart top spot before Christmas, only to miss out on the festive Top 40 altogether.) But the song’s unlikely moment in the spotlight reflects the newfound prominence of many Irish voices and communities online. Late last year, the punmanteau “tansplaining” got a delightful debut outing in the New York Times (defined as “the phenomenon in which Irish people suffer inept lessons in their own history from British people”). The Wolfe Tones’ minor success signifies a broader trend of razor-sharp in-joking and commentary from Irish Twitter, both diaspora and those at home.The song looks beyond Ireland, too, succinctly relating the Irish experience to other peoples’ historic struggles against the British Empire: “Come tell us how you slew them poor Arabs two by two  Like the Zulus they had spears and bows and arrows.” The broader essence of the song hits home. Some concrete good has stemmed from it all, too. Founding Wolfe Tones member Brian Warfield has said that proceeds from the track will benefit wildlife and firefighter charities in Australia, and a leading Irish homelessness charity.Inevitably, Come Out Ye Black and Tans didn’t trouble this week’s official Top 40. Still, its day in the sun has given a song about the patently isive legacy of the Black and Tans an honourable revitalisation – and brought historic intrigue and characteristic upset to the lamentably stagnant charts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64171041dd4eecb2bb71e96487bd7e7a0e8b2d69/0_57_4298_2579/master/4298.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de8a5bdeae77d3092dab38122f37ddae","title":"k pop art bts teams up with antony gormley for global project","story":"Korean boyband funding works in five cities by 22 artists ‘to send a positive message to the world’They are clean-cut superstars of K-pop, arguably the most adored boy band in the world, and now BTS can add a new label: global patrons of contemporary art.Details were announced on Tuesday of experimental and technically challenging art projects in London, Seoul, New York, Berlin and Buenos Aires by artists and curators who, the people behind the project said, resonated with the band’s philosophy and principles.It will involve Antony Gormley installing a sculpture using 18km of coiled up aluminium tubing next to the East river in Brooklyn and Tomás Saraceno floating a human being upwards powered only by the sun and air.With a global fanbase of tens of millions of young people, together known as the BTS Army, the idea is seen as an opportunity to introduce contemporary art to completely new audiences.Daehyung Lee – the curator who helped conceive the Connect, BTS initiative and approached the band – said the project was rooted in the idea of “solidarity”. He said: “We can connect with people at opposite ends of the world but we sometimes forget to communicate with our own neighbours or relatives. We are losing solidarity, we have forgotten how to communicate properly with each other.”The Korean band are the main funders of the projects which will involve 22 artists and take place across the world in the coming months.

Even runners who dislike tech can’t bear to be without it. By  Rose GeorgeOn Ilkley Moor in west Yorkshire on a Tuesday evening in May, 200 people milled about in glorious sunshine, ready to run the five-mile Jack Bloor race over moors recently blackened in a fire, but still beautiful. The air was clear, the good cheer was tangible, the moor birds clucked high up on the hill that we would soon have to climb.We gathered at the start, and everything proceeded as it does at fell races: someone gave inaudible instructions and then said something like: “Right then, off you go.” Fell running – making your own way between checkpoints over moorland, hill or mountain – thinks itself a pure yet humble sport. Fell runners have no truck with fancy gear like road runners do, or shiny poles like ultrarunners. We don’t even need paths. Some of this purist attitude comes from where we run, through thigh-deep bogs and leg-scraping bracken, down scree and boulders at the pace of a fearless child. We run against the elements as much as against other runners.Yet, at the start of the race, two things happened: 400 feet started to move, and 200 fingers pressed a button on a wristwatch equipped with GPS, setting the devices to record. The moor birds’ cheeps were now accompanied by beeps. When it comes to tracking and measuring runs, and being obsessed with data, we are right up there with the rest of the field. But tracking and measuring were just the start. Soon after finishing the race, most of the runners would upload that GPS data to a digital platform that has changed the world of amateur sport. The fell runners knew, as millions of people worldwide do, that if it isn’t on Strava, it didn’t happen.Strava is a fitness and sports tracking platform that launched in 2009 and bills itself the “number one app for runners and cyclists”. As long as you have a smartphone, watch or bike computer that records your activities using GPS, you can sync it with Strava, then upload your run, cycle, ski or almost any other activity, and be rewarded with astonishing levels of data analysis. For an amateur, the data available from Strava is like having a Team GB coach in your phone, for free.Strava tells me how fast I ran in May 2015 or last Thursday, and how much improvement I have made. Every run I do is recognised and automatically matched to anyone else who has run the same route, or part of it. Athletes – as Strava flatteringly calls its users – can create a “segment”, a portion of a route, perhaps featuring a hill or a stretch of lake, against which other athletes can then match their own efforts. In my local park, I can see how my 2017 self did on a segment someone has named Up the Bloody Hill, or on Stairway to Heaven (actually steps to the car park), or on #Weeeeeeeeeee! My efforts can be scored on “leaderboards” so that I can compare myself with myself, with my Strava followers and friends, or with strangers from Korea to Kansas.Because of Strava, I know how many miles my shoes have covered and whether I need new ones, as the app will email me to tell me (without sending me ads for shoes). After a race, I can launch Strava’s Flyby feature, an ingenious interactive map, and watch my digital self rerun the race route alongside anyone else who ran it. It is addictive, to watch these ghosts in the machine, and see where they got away, or where I caught them up, to see if they went wrong and how badly. For my efforts, I can be given “kudos” by anyone who follows me – the Strava “like”, signified by a thumbs up – and I can do the same for them. I can leave supportive comments and add photos. I can change the name of my activity from the default “morning run” or “lunch ride” to something witty and punning, and it is one of the unwritten rules of Strava that I should.Because of Strava, I also have a ringside seat into how elite athletes train and race: more than half of the Tour de France peloton last year uploaded their stages. I can follow the training of Kílian Jornet, the world’s best mountain runner, or champion distance runner Aly Dixon. Strava has been downloaded by 49 million people in 195 countries, and the company claims it attracts a million new users a month. In total, these people upload 25 activities a second, or 15.3m a week. They share 4 million photos a week and last year gave each other 3.6bn kudos. In the reward loop of Strava, activities get kudos, which encourages more activities. Adding funny names, emojis or photos increases the number of kudos by up to a third. More kudos, more exercise. The more people share their data, the better the experience.The essential goal of any tech platform is to make you use it again. This is called “stickiness”. But one step beyond stickiness is community: the key is to embed a tech platform into someone’s life, including their friends and wider circle of acquaintances and fellow athletes they haven’t even met. Group encouragement is proven to have a positive effect on fitness: users who belong to a club (including virtual ones) upload three times more activities than non-members.Ben Mounsey is a top mountain runner from Yorkshire, and formerly a school photography teacher in Elland, near Halifax. Before he discovered Strava, he was a good enough runner to make national teams. “But I didn’t have any focus. I was just running on natural fumes,” he says. He never kept a diary and could not remember his run times. In 2014, a friend mentioned Strava. He signed up, got a GPS watch and started recording his times. “I became obsessed, from day one,” he says.I don’t consider myself addicted to Strava: I don’t check in unless I’ve done an activity. I don’t get notifications. I have never created a segment and don’t know how to. I would never log into Strava just to browse. And yet, looking at the data has become an essential part of my exercise regime. Once, my phone broke when I was travelling without a computer to hand, and my first action when I got a new one was to manually upload to Strava the runs I had done without it. My data shows I have done 171 runs in the past 12 months: my memory has recorded that I did fewer than half a dozen that weren’t logged. What I don’t know is how a middling, menopausal fell runner, who only began running at the age of 41, and will never win much, got to care so much about any of this.In the mid-90s, two former college friends, Michael Horvath and Mark Gainey, met to discuss an idea. They had been competitive rowers at Harvard, and both missed rowing life: its competition and camaraderie were hard to recreate when they no longer had time for team sports. Gainey and Horvath’s idea was to create a “virtual locker room” where people who exercised alone could still find a community. But the technology wasn’t good enough to build what they wanted. Instead, they founded Kana, a company selling email and marketing software which, at its height, was valued at $10bn (£7.7bn).In 2006, they came up with the idea for a social network for athletes, with “athlete” meaning anyone who took fitness seriously. (Strava’s CEO until November last year, James Quarles, defines an athlete as “anyone who sweats”.) They chose the name Strava, from the Swedish “to strive”. By then, technology had progressed enough for people to carry GPS devices in their pockets, and strap on lightweight heart monitors.Gainey and Horvath had observed that digital sharing was rising at the same time as communal activity was declining. They targeted what they called “avids” – cyclists who rode frequently – and hoped that word would spread. From the beginning, the big hook was the leaderboard, a ranking of anyone who has cycled a particular route. This was not unique, but was borrowed from online gaming. The difference was that this scoreboard was linked to real-world physical activity. Strava offered the competitive draw of segments and the gratification of kudos. There were also rewards: as the quickest rider of any segment, you would be labelled King of the Mountain (KOM) or Queen of the Mountain (QOM). That these prizes are fleeting, lasting only as long as it takes for someone to beat your time, only increased the addictiveness.These features – lures, rewards, competition – are now considered standard in gamification, which apps use to get us to return. Strava’s ace was to combine the competitive appeal of the segment with a community of likeminded people who knew how much it meant to come back from injury or miss a personal best. Add an interface that is widely accepted to be clever, clean and extremely simple to use – along with the increasingly rare situation of being free from ads – and Strava was a hit.The first Strava user was David Belden, a cyclist from California. (He is still on Strava and, in 2019, he covered 1,455.8 miles and climbed almost 40,000 metres.) For the first years, the main users of Strava looked similar to Belden, in that most of them were male and on a bike. Growth was steady. In 2011, Strava offered a separate running app, before merging everything in 2014. Strava staff like to call their product “agnostic” because it doesn’t care what device or app is used to upload data. “We are the Switzerland of tracking platforms,” says Gareth Nettleton, vice-president of marketing at Strava’s UK base in Bristol.Strava is not the most-used fitness app in the world. Runkeeper has 50 million users Runtastic claims more than 147 million registered users and is popular in Europe. Other strong competitors are MapMyRun, Endomondo, Nike+ and Google Fit. Most offer some variety of tracking, recording and sociability. Many are owned by big sports shoe and clothing corporations (Asics, bought Runkeeper in 2016 for $83m Under Armor bought MapMyRun and its 20 million users for $150m).Strava does not sell clothes or shoes. Quarles, former CEO, came from Instagram, where he had introduced ads, but there are no plans to do the same at Strava. More important is building goodwill in the community. “I worked for a long time at the intersection of technology and communities,” he told me on the phone from the US last spring, “and at how technology brings people closer together, not turns into this dystopian thing of them spending time apart.”Strava users may start as loners, only tracking their own activities, but the hope is that they will soon be hooked into tracking friends and peers, and that this will push them to go further and faster. But the friendly competition of a supportive, likeminded community can sometimes lead to darker impulses.Mounsey, the mountain runner, found the segment a powerful addiction. For months, he “went crazy” trying to win every segment within a 10-mile radius. “Everyone hated me for a long time in Elland.” Once, he says, a clubmate took a segment off him on a local steep hill called Trooper Lane. “I couldn’t believe it. I tried not to be bothered by it, I saw it at 7.30pm and by 8pm I was analysing it.” The next morning, he got up an hour earlier than normal, ate nothing, stopped off at Trooper Lane, did a hard session of 35 minutes, beat his clubmate by five minutes, then went to work and fell asleep in the classroom. “I felt really ill, I’d pushed myself so hard, all for a bloody segment, for male pride,” he says. Then adds: “I’m portraying myself as a bit of a psychopath here, aren’t I?”When he found himself running miles on a Sunday just because he hadn’t reached his self-imposed weekly target, he pulled back. “I can see the good and bad in Strava.” (He’s still on it, though. Disclaimer: he is an unpaid Strava ambassador.)Strava says segments don’t just appeal to men, although I have never seen a female runner suddenly set off at speed shouting “segment!” as a male clubmate once did. This pursuit of a record can encourage dangerous impulses. In 2010, a cyclist named William “Kim” Flint was killed chasing a fast downhill segment when his bike, travelling at 40mph, crashed into a car in Oakland, California. (His family sued Strava and lost.) Forbes magazine called this “a quantified-self fatality”. Mountain bikers frequently report being pushed off trails by other bikers descending at speed and yelling “STRAVA!”. In 2016, alarmed by the speeds recorded on Strava segments, a council in Los Altos, California, banned mountain bikers from Byrne Preserve. Strava now lets users flag a segment as hazardous, and its terms of service absolve the company of any responsibility for “known or unknown risks associated with these activities even if caused in whole or part by the action, inaction or negligence of Strava”.Once, I got a CR – course record, the equivalent of Queen of the Mountain – on a random stretch of trail in south-west France. This is a rare enough event that I remember it vividly. Within hours, a Strava email alerted me that I had lost the record I immediately logged in to see who had taken it. Then I checked how fast she had run it and compared her time to mine. Then I went to her profile and checked how old she was and all her other activities. A year later, I am still planning to go back to that unremarkable forest track up the hill from Belesta and sprint up a random 400 metres as fast as I possibly can.Strava forums have plenty of fuming users enraged about cheating. E-bike users who “forget” to mark their rides as an e-bike and end up on leaderboard are a growing problem. Taking your GPS watch for a drive is another. In Hong Kong, one user wrote on Strava’s forum: “A large percentage of segments is polluted by people using cars or electric scooters.”Some of this is accidental, as e-bike users have to manually change a setting on Strava to mark their rides as assisted. Some of it is not. An e-biker named Matt May has a profile picture of a bottle of vodka attached to his bike, and delights in annoying Strava purists. There are legitimate third-party apps that claim to help people improve their Strava stats by alerting them, for example, to wind conditions. Then there was the short-lived website Digital EPO (named after erythropoietin, a common illegal drug in sport) that allowed people to alter the GPS data to show they had gone faster than they had in reality. This inflamed plenty of cycling and running forums.On his podcast, the California-based ultra-endurance athlete Rich Roll hints at why what people post on Strava matters: “There’s something uniquely special about being privy to the daily grind of my favorite multi-sport athletes. Their transparency holds me accountable. In turn, I help hold my community accountable. And openly sharing our collective fitness experience – the highs and the lows – makes all of us better.”I did once report a cheat. Strava lets you do this by “flagging” a suspect activity, such as a ride or run that has clearly been done in a car, or on an e-bike. Why did I care? It was a woman who had apparently run a stretch of my local park in about 10 seconds. I cared because I had just run that same stretch and it had taken more than two minutes. I cared because it was physically impossible to do what her upload said. I am never going to be an elite athlete. I am competitive, but only with myself, and only because I want to disprove the idea that a 50-year-old woman cannot improve. Yet, suddenly, when I saw that improbable segment, I was seven years old again and someone had cheated in the playground. My emotions had the purity of childish rage, that white heat of unfairness. I flagged the segment, which meant she would have been given an option to delete it, which she did. I’m not sure if I felt bigger or smaller for doing it. (I’m lying. I would do it again.)Brazilians are social, and they also love sport, making Brazil a perfect society for Strava (they also like to work out with their family, unlike any other country). The French are equally into running and cycling Germans prefer bikes. Strava’s yearly data report offers other revelations. The most active day of 2018 for German cyclists was 6 May for French cyclists it was 9 September. Americans ran more on 23 November than on any other day in 2018 Japanese runners were busiest on 16 September. Globally, most people exercise on a Sunday except in the UK and Ireland, where we prefer Tuesday. Runners talk about beer in their activity uploads cyclists talk more about coffee. From Strava data, the media concluded that the second week in January is “quitters’ week”, when newly active users give up (although women will last two days longer than men).This data also offers a “heat map” – a record of activities in any given area. In 2018 Strava’s global heat map, a record of 1bn activities worldwide, accidentally revealed the location of secret US military bases, because personnel had uploaded their activities to Strava and failed to opt out of heat maps. Fitness tracking data can have other uses: one user concluded her boyfriend was cheating by noticing how often his Strava rides were done in the company of another woman. Fitbit and Apple Watch data has been used to solve murders (in one case, showing that the victim’s heart rate had spiked during the suspect’s visit and been silent thereafter). Those that opt in to Strava heat maps become a saleable product. Under a project called , Strava sells anonymised data to cities about where and when its users ride and run and exercise. More than 70 cities have used  in the US states of Colorado, New Hampshire, and in the UK as have academic and non-profit organisations such as Glasgow University’s Urban Big Data Centre. Strava offers a paid subscription called Summit with additional features – more heart data, the ability to filter leaderboards by age and weight, and a useful location-tracking feature called Beacon – for about £4.50 a month. The company doesn’t release figures about how many of its athletes pay for Summit, but it is thought to be a percentage in single figures.Athletes who use products from companies with whom Strava has set up commercial partnerships now find their activities attached to a banner proclaiming that they “ran with Suunto” or cycled with Zwift. For the first time this year, Strava’s Year in Sport report included a section on “the world’s hottest gear”, a list of the most popular brands used by people on the platform. It is not an ad, but it smells like one. “Wahoo doesn’t sponsor me,” said one user in Strava’s forum, among many objectors. “There is no reason I should be forced to sponsor them.”When we spoke in early 2019, Quarles was optimistic that profitability wasn’t far off, but he was suddenly replaced in November 2019 by co-founder Mark Gainey, with Michael Horvath also returning to an active role. Strava also lost its high-profile chief technology officer, Stephanie Hannon, who had been digital chief for Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, after only a year. There are a few options for Strava to make money: becoming a subscription-only service, selling up, selling its users to advertisers, or selling more data than it does currently ( data is anonymised, and Strava’s terms of service say that users own their data, but that they grant Strava a huge licence to use it).Perhaps the golden years of this clever, uncommercial app being available for free are numbered. But Strava is still a beacon of positivity among the bile and manipulation of other social media. Trolling is rare and usually only takes the form of excessive kudos from randoms – and what’s wrong with that? I get regular abuse on Twitter on Strava, I have never had anything but encouragement. The company says its currency is effort, but it is also largely goodwill. The platform’s privacy controls now are good enough that I can hide my home and my place of work, and I can stay off leaderboards. I could stay off Strava, too, but I don’t intend to. It is a guidebook and a corkboard (posting photos, Strava believes, enables powerful “memorialisation” of activities). It is training log, chat room and map room. And in these days of public carping and rage, it is something I prize more than race prizes: it is a refuge.Richard Askwith, a British writer and fell runner, is the author of Running Free, a book about the over-commercialisation and datafication of running. He gave up running with a smartwatch years ago. “I think if I was constantly wanting to tell other people about my runs I would be losing out on the experience of the run itself. If you’re running off-road, then you’re inhabiting your environment and you’re sensing how your step feels and you’re thinking about where your next step is going to go. Then if you want to think about how much effort you’re putting in, you just sort put your foot on the pedal a bit, but it’s all subjectively measured.”Or, as one cyclist who had given up quantifying wrote: “I remember when cycling used to be fun.”The British Medical Journal provides a service assessing some fitness apps. Its entry on Strava lists the obvious pros (it’s free, it’s easy to set up, it encourages users to push harder than they would alone). The writer also warned of the cons: “Owing to the competitive nature installed in users of the app, risk-taking behaviours may be increased that could lead to musculoskeletal injury or road traffic collisions.” Also, “one may forget what a leisurely bike ride or jog used to feel like.” A paper presented at the Royal Geographical Society in London in 2013 by Dr Paul Barratt of Staffordshire University suggested that Strava was, perversely, making group rides antisocial, as riders concentrated on winning segments from virtual strangers rather than focusing on their fellow riders in real life.Fell runner Tim Dempsey gave up using technology on the hills three years ago. “Thinking forward to the completed run on-screen while running, only to finish and use the screen to look back. It removes you utterly from the moment. Two years on. I still look at my naked wrist for cues.”“I love it and hate it in equal measure,” says the runner and coach Anji Andrews. “It’s great for logging training and keeping track of pace, routes, mileage. It’s horrific in being, to many, just an online log of excuses and encouraging comparison (the thief of joy).”Recently, on occasion, I have forgotten to wear my GPS watch at races and runs. At races, I experienced mild concern: if it is not recorded, then how will I know how fast I have run? How will my miles count towards my yearly 1,000-mile target? But then I set off, on a recreational or competitive run, and something happens. I feel freer. I run across moorland and stop to look around, and don’t worry about pausing my watch, about someone later looking at my data and seeing that I stopped for a gawp of the purple heather and the eerie calm of the stone circle. I walk for a bit and revel in not being recorded. No one is looking. No one cares.At the biggest race in my calendar, the Yorkshire Three Peaks, I didn’t dare leave my watch behind. I had certain cut-offs – set times – to reach, so I needed to know what the time was. But as I set off up Pen-y-Ghent, I did something strange, and turned my watch to the inside of my wrist. That made it slightly harder to check, and so I hardly checked it. I ran according to feel, as the training term goes, and despite hailstorms and cramp and only looking at my watch three times over 23 miles, I got the best time I had ever done.Maybe I had learned to pace myself so well by using tech that I could do it without? I was a fell running equivalent of Luke Skywalker in his X-wing fighter, switching off the targeting system and feeling the Force. Unchained from data, I felt free and powerful. And within a couple of hours of finishing, after sitting among my real life running friends in the race marquee, all of us glowing with achievement, and scoffing stew in likeminded company, I uploaded the run to Strava. How else would I get any kudos?• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/612650666facab7182722f84dc82f8f4aa58003d/0_194_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16dfa16e20635af3ef17e4a7f3a02684","title":"why did former nissan boss carlos ghosn choose a life on the run podcast","story":"The former CEO of Nissan, Carlos Ghosn, was once one of Japan’s most respected business people.

It was humiliating and again I had no control. I was worried how I would manage without the universal credit money. I had to feed my children.

The ban that we have announced today should minimise the risks of harm to consumers from gambling with money they do not have.”The consultation that led to the commission’s decision included e-wallets, indicating that payment services such as PayPal will probably be included in the ban.  revealed last year that such providers had allowed problem gamblers to circumvent banking limits and spend up to £150,000 a day.The culture minister, Helen Whately, said: “There is clear evidence of harm from consumers betting with money they do not have, so it is absolutely right that we act decisively to protect them.“In the past year we have introduced a wave of tougher measures, including cutting the maximum stake on fixed odds betting terminals, bringing in tighter age and identity checks for online gambling and expanding national specialist support through the NHS Long Term Plan.“We have also secured a series of commitments from five leading gambling operators that will include £100m funding towards treatment for problem gamblers.“But there is more to do. We will be carrying out a review of the Gambling Act to ensure it is fit for the digital age and we will be launching a new nationwide addiction strategy in 2020.”SNP MP Ronnie Cowan, who has spoken out about the gambling industry, said: “This is welcomed but we mustn’t take our eyes off the prize and that’s a completely new Gambling Act.”Brigid Simmonds, head of the Betting and Gaming Council which represents the industry, said: “We will implement a ban on credit cards and indeed our members will go further to study and improve the early identification of those at risk.“The use of credit cards were previously used as a potential marker of harm which might lead to further intervention with customers.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d02cbd707a79b8925f44fcaadee8c6fa9e2f6505/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72b48c857f16f64e7b166f69c72e50c5","title":"safety first as australian open qualifying delayed due to poor air quality","story":"The safety of players at this year’s Australian Open has been brought into sharp focus after a day of poor air quality in Melbourne forced the abandonment of the former world No 1 Maria Sharapova’s match in a warm-up event at Kooyong. Another player, Dalila Jakupovic, collapsed on court at Melbourne Park in jarring scenes at the venue for the year’s first grand slam.Jakupovic was forced to retire midway through her qualifying match when she suffered a coughing fit. The match had been given the green light to go ahead by tournament organisers after the day’s play had initially been delayed for an hour due to the blanket of bushfire smoke enveloping Melbourne on Tuesday.Jakupovic, who was looking to qualify for the main draw of the tournament which is slated to start on Monday, was one set up in her match against Switzerland’s Stefanie Vögele when she fell to her knees on court. Suffering breathing difficulties, the world No 180 withdrew.She later said she had no previous respiratory issues and had never suffered from asthma. “I was really scared that I would collapse. That’s why I went onto the floor because I couldn’t walk any more,” she said. “I don’t have asthma and never had breathing problems. I actually like heat. The physio came again and I thought it would be better. But the points were a bit longer and I just couldn’t breathe any more and I just fell on the floor.”Jakupovic took aim at officials for allowing the match to go ahead in the first place, saying it was “not fair”. “It’s not healthy for us,” she said. “I was surprised, I thought we would not be playing today, but we don’t have much choice.”Eugenie Bouchard, the former Wimbledon finalist, also struggled in her opening match and called several medical timeouts during the eventual win over China’s Xiaodi You. “I felt like it was tough to breathe and a bit nauseous,” Bouchard said. “I felt like the conditions got worse as the match went on...but I was out there for a long time. As an athlete we want to be very careful, our physical health is one of the most important things. It’s not ideal to play in these conditions. Just like the heat rule, there should be an air quality rule.”At Kooyong, Sharapova said smoke from the bushfires still raging in Victoria and New South Wales was behind the decision to call time on her match late in the second set against Germany’s Laura Siegemund. Organisers of the tournament in the inner Melbourne suburb pulled the plug on play with Siegemund a set up and the score locked at 5-5 in the second, as the city was enveloped in a smoke haze and was rated in the morning as having the worst air quality in the world.“I started feeling a cough coming toward the end of the second set but I’ve been sick for a few weeks so I thought that had something to do with it,” Sharapova told SBS after the match. “But then I heard Laura speak to the umpire and she said she was struggling with it as well. We were out there for over two hours, so from a health standpoint it’s the right call from officials.”Earlier, practice at Melbourne Park had been suspended and the start of the first round of qualifying delayed by an hour due to the poor air quality. But tournament organisers deemed it safe enough to start at 11am local time, once they said the air quality had sufficiently improved.Tom Larner, Tennis Australia’s chief operating officer, indicated the situation was comparable to other delays caused by atmospheric conditions, such as extreme heat, or rain. “We’re treating any suspension of play like a rain delay or a heat delay, in that we will stop if conditions become unsafe based on medical advice, and once those conditions are safe to play, players will get back on court.”Tuesday’s delay lasted only one hour, as, according to Tiley, “during the period in which we suspended practice there was an improvement in conditions”. The suspension, and subsequent resumption of play was based on air quality measurements taken on-site using devices sourced specifically for this eventually, as well as advice from tournament medical staff.Victoria’s Environment Protection Authority issued a warning on Monday evening that conditions in Melbourne on Tuesday would be poor to hazardous as a consequence of the bushfires raging across the state and neighbouring New South Wales. The Victorian government’s advice is for residents to “minimise the time spent in smoky conditions whenever practical to do so,” and “avoid exercise”. Both are considerable challenges for a major outdoor sporting event.There has been no official response from the players about the circumstances at one of the most popular events on the circuit, but Tiley indicated the WTA and ATP Tours were supportive of the decision. “This is new for all of us,” Tiley said. Novak Djokovic, president of the ATP Player Council, has already indicated competitors would have to consider their options, with delaying their participation among them, should Melbourne’s air quality continue to prove hazardous.Tiley would not be drawn on radical contingency plans, such as the steps taken earlier this month to relocate the Canberra International Challenger event from the ACT to Bendigo in Victoria to avoid hazardous playing conditions. “The expectation, because the long-term forecast, and even the short-term forecast is good. We’ll just take it a day at a time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5904bbcc5f81ee7476067923574f86be42bd06fd/0_44_1982_1189/master/1982.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f5a252c88cc704be2d91f49f2aedf7b8","title":"india v australia first one day international live","story":"32nd over: Australia 215-0 (Warner 104, Finch 92) Target 256. Stand and DELIVER from Finch! Kuldeep gives him some air on middle stump so the captain clears his front pad to lift him straight over long-off for SIX! That was in response to the googly too, which has been a slight vulnerability for him tonight. Range hitting, they call it. Into the 90s he goes with a couple more, cut off the back foot. I should note that Warner has pulled level with ME Waugh as the second most prolific century-maker for Australia in ODIs, only Ricky Ponting ahead of them with 29.31st over: Australia 205-0 (Warner 104, Finch 83) Target 256. It continues for Warner, starting the over with a century and finishing it with a magnificent off-drive, giving the fielder on the circle no chance. They need 51 runs in 19 overs. And what a shot to bring it up, cutting Bumrah expertly behind point for four. There’s that familiar leap. What a brilliant hand. It also brings up the 200 stand.30th over: Australia 197-0 (Warner 96, Finch 83) Target 256. Ohhhh! Warner is now batting without anything on his head. He’s going to bring up an international ton without a helmet or a hat. What a wonderful development. He’s four closer to that with a hammered cover drive, pinging Kuldeep to the rope in an instant. NOT OUT! Yep, there was a thick edge on the missed sweep. A ton surely awaits.HAS JADEJA TRAPPED WARNER LBW? It is given out on the field but he reviews it straight away, punching gloves with Finch. He hit it. Stand by in any case. 28th over: Australia 187-0 (Warner 89, Finch 81) Target 256. Michael Slater could not be more excited about how this has all played out tonight. Good on him - I’m probably a bit of a Slats apologist, in truth. He gets another moment to celebrate when Warner jumps across his stumps to glance Thakur away for four more. This reminds me of when this two knocked England over without losing a wicket at the MCG to start the ODI series against England in January 2014. “Any word on Pant?” asks Brandon Green on twitter. “Know he copped a concussion, was it the ricochet from his bat that he was out on?”We haven’t had anything further on the TV broadcast. And yes, I believe that’s when he did it - that’s certainly what they brought up on screen at the start of this chase when explaining why the Indian wicketkeeper is off the ground. 27th over: Australia 179-0 (Warner 83, Finch 80) Target 256. Jadeja does what he does best: racing through a 60-second over before they’ve had a chance to really look up. In saying that, three singles come, Finch joining Warner in the 80s.26th over: Australia 176-0 (Warner 82, Finch 79) Target 256. Thakur to Finch, and down the legside to begin. No good. He’s back where he needs to be after that but with just over three an over needed, they are comfortable with that approach.“Hi Adam, Hope you’re well.” And you, Ruth Purdue! “It may be a tired topic but can I call for Maxwell to be in the team again? That genius needs to be on the platform he deserves.”No complaints from these quarters. However, I’m glad he’s been left at home to dominate the BBL. That’ll live longer in the memory than this series. He can then return for the New Zealand matches in March before the IPL. Something like that? 25th over: Australia 172-0 (Warner 81, Finch 77) Target 256. Warner gets into the 80s first, albeit off another edge. He went hard at Jadeja, who did him in flight, saved only by the inside feather of his blade. Sure enough, given the way these two have gone tonight, it evades Rahul’s gloves and runs away for four. The crowd are chanting for Kohli? Or is it Dhoni? Probably the latter, come to think of it.24th over: Australia 166-0 (Warner 76, Finch 76) Target 256. Australia are on track to get this inside 40 overs - what a performance. Ten more added here, Finch joining Warner in the 70s lashing Shami through point, then drawing level on 76 off the outside edge. It doesn’t matter from here, they’re toying with the hosts. 23rd over: Australia 156-0 (Warner 76, Finch 66) Target 256. Kuldeep now bowling his seventh over, worked through the legside early in the over - the 150 partnership coming along the way, the fourth time this pair have achieved that - before Warner decides to go BANG over long on for SIX! The third time he’s cleared that boundary through the course of this fantastic innings. 100 runs to go.“This has been a magnificent effort by our Australian friends against a very good Indian side,” observes Martin Fairhurst. “I look forward to the rest of the series - can India fight back? It’s food for thought too for the upcoming T20 World Cup this year in Australia.” That’s where all roads lead for this Australian white-ball team after this series. They have never won (or hosted) the T20 World Cup before, of course.22nd over: Australia 146-0 (Warner 69, Finch 63) Target 256. Despite the fact that we’re only 21 overs into this chase, India are just about up to their last chance with Shami now back into the attack. Mindful of this, I’m sure, there are no risks here. Finch did get a chance to cut and did so well but Jadeja was at backward point with the flying stop, pulling the ball down without a bother. What a gem he is.21st over: Australia 143-0 (Warner 67, Finch 62) Target 256. Kuldeep beats Finch again with that googly, the bails taken by KL Rahul. It’s sent upstairs to check for the stumping his foot never leaves the ground. A couple of singles are Australia’s lot until the final ball, which spins down the legside. Kuldeep, re-bowling that delivery, is insistent that he has Finch lbw to finish but it’s turned down. Kohli, upon realising that he already torched his review, gets in the umpire’s face. In my experience, umpires don’t tend to change their minds after they’ve said not out.“This opening stand has been antithetical to the Indian approach when it comes to constructing an ODI innings,” writes Abhijato Sensarma. “The openers are willing to take risks and not rely on solely running between the wickets during the early stages of the game. England have proved that you can be successful with this approach, especially by taking out the fine margins which come with lower scores produced as a result of caution. Hopefully the home side’s management decides to put enough faith in the entire line-up to back the top three to unleash their full potential for aggression henceforth, because their current approach seems more outdated with every passing day.” 20th over: Australia 140-0 (Warner 66, Finch 61) Target 256. So, India have burned their review now too. Before the appeal, Warner was given another half-tracker by the usually-accurate tweaker, once again carving it for four. Cruise control.HAS JADEJA TRAPPED FINCH LBW? Michael Gough doesn’t think so but Kohli has sent it to the TV umpire and technology to decide once and for all. Stand by. 19th over: Australia 133-0 (Warner 61, Finch 60) Target 256. Some good news here: Warner has called for his canary yellow cap. When I’m king, the Baggy Gold will return to the kit for Australian ODI players - one day. But small steps. The next is the gold helmet, which they haven’t used for about 15 years. None of this is probably of interest to Finch, the captain well on top of Kuldeep’s top spinner to start the new over, crunching it past point for his ninth four. The required rate is under four an over now, with both openers wonderfully placed to reach tons.18th over: Australia 125-0 (Warner 58, Finch 55) Target 256. Jadeja has Finch in a bit of bother early in the over, finding his leading edge when trying to tuck him into the legside. But just when the experienced spinner seems to have found a groove, he gives a half-tracker to Warner, slapped away for four past cover. Easy.17th over: Australia 118-0 (Warner 54, Finch 52) Target 256. India are going to have to bowl Australia out, that much is clear. Kohli looks relatively calm at drinks, avoiding the temptation to give his charges a spray. Kuldeep has been the man most likely so far, at Finch at least, so they are happy enough taking the singles on offer rather than attacking the boundary. There really is no rush whatsoever. 16th over: Australia 115-0 (Warner 53, Finch 50) Target 256. With one to cover off Bumrah, the Australian captain raises his bat from his 52nd ball - the 39th time he’s made at least 50 in an ODI. It’s another good set from Bumrah but he is already through half of his overs with 31 taken from them. DRINKS are called with Australia needing just 141 further runs at 4.2 per over from here. Top batting. 15th over: Australia 110-0 (Warner 50, Finch 49) Target 256. For real this time, Warner is the man who gets to raise his bat for the first half-century of the innings with a single down the ground off Kuldeep. He reaches the mark in 40 deliveries, the 38th time he’s gone beyond 50 in ODIs. The wrong’un has Finch in a bit of strife for a second time, beating his edge when attempting to cut. In turn, the captain elects to defend the rest of the over. The best set of India’s defence.14th over: Australia 109-0 (Warner 49, Finch 49) Target 256. Anything Finch can do, is it? Warner starts this new over - Bumrah back into the attack - with another imposing pull shot, giving the sweeper no chance to cut it off. Bumrah is too classy for that to bother him that much, beating the outside edge with one that goes a long way with the angle. Later, in at Finch, he bowls a very similar delivery and cuts the right-hander in half. It’s such a good delivery that after pitching off and clearing leg, it beats the ‘keeper’s gloves, running away for four byes. Ouch. 13th over: Australia 100-0 (Warner 44, Finch 49) Target 256. It’s a bit unclear, some scoreboards onlineat the ground putting Finch beyond the milestone, others leaving him one short. He certainly raised the bat when smashing Kuldeep right back over his head for SIX early in the over, also bringing up the Australian 100. Anyway, whether or not the personal milestone has been reached (I suspect it hasn’t), this has been a wonderful partnership, going at 7.7 runs an over. 12th over: Australia 94-0 (Warner 44, Finch 43) Target 256. Jadeja joins Kuldeep at the bowling crease and Warner makes an immediate statement, flat-batting the orthodox tweaker over midwicket for SIX MORE! The required rate is now 4.3. 11th over: Australia 87-0 (Warner 38, Finch 43) Target 256. They nearly get one first ball after the field is spread, Kuldeep winning Finch’s top edge via a misread googly. He’s very lucky that didn’t go to hand. As is the custom in the over after the power play, they play the rest conservatively after that near mishap. Of course, the left-arm wristspinner has been extremely effective against Australia. 10th over: Australia 84-0 (Warner 37, Finch 41) Target 256. What a power play for this pair, sticking the landing with 13 further runs before the field goes out. Warner pulled Thakur twice in identical fashion, prompting a ropey bouncer, called a wide. They’re running wonderfully, too. India need something... right now.9th over: Australia 71-0 (Warner 26, Finch 40) Target 256. Ten more runs are piled on here, Finch striking another picture-perfect cover drive to begin Shami’s new spell, spun around to follow Bumrah. He then overcorrects with an offering that’s too short, slapped away for four more by the skipper. India are in a fair bit of strife.8th over: Australia 61-0 (Warner 25, Finch 31) Target 256. BIIIIIG from Warner! Thakur was excellent the first time around but the opener has his measure now, popping him way back into the crowd at midwicket for Australia’s first SIX of their chase. Earlier in the over, with his eye well and truly in now, he picked up the seamer over mid-on for four then heaved him over square leg for another. 15 off it. The required rate for the Australians from here is already just 4.64 an over. 7th over: Australia 46-0 (Warner 11, Finch 31) Target 256. Warner moves to 5000 ODI runs with his best shot of the innings so far, a punishing pull through square leg off Bumrah. The TV tells us that he has reached the mark (in 115 innings) faster than every batsman with the exception of Amla (101), Richards and Kohli (both 114). He celebrates with another four, through point this time. Here we go.There’s some further commentary chat about Marnus’ name, the message through to the box about the Labu-shane preference. That’s accurate to an extent. I was there when this first came up when he joined the team in 2018 in the UAE. He was clear then that the Australianised version was fine with him because it was easier but he was equally happy with the accurate pronunciation being used.6th over: Australia 36-0 (Warner 6, Finch 27) Target 256. Earlier in the over, Warner was also fortunate to survive a leg before shout from the new bowler Thakur, beaten on the inside edge from a delivery that really hooped in at him from around the wicket. Despite hitting his back pad, it was given out on the field. The technology showed that it would have been umpire’s call had it been reviewed. A eventful and frugal start from the first-change seamer.NOT OUT! Warner is correct, he didn’t hit it. The decision is overturned by the TV umpire. India were absolutely convinced in their appeal but it is not to be. WARNER REVIEWS! He’s been given out caught behind hooking down the legside off Thakur. Upstairs we go. Can he get it overturned? Stand by. 5th over: Australia 33-0 (Warner 5, Finch 25) Target 256. Four more! Of Finch’s five boundaries, four of them have been through point, this another square drive from the very middle of his bat. Warner, by contrast, is being kept quiet by Shami. He’s helped by a misfield at midwicket from the final ball, three taken from a compact push. The TV commentators are having the usual debate about Marnus Labuschagne’s name, Murali Karthik making the very reasonable point that it is a South AfricanAfrikaans name and deserves to be pronounced accordingly. 4th over: Australia 25-0 (Warner 2, Finch 21) Target 256. Finch is flying here, 11 taken from this Bumrah over. He timed the pants off his first boundary, skipping through cover with no backswing required only a forward push. The second is an even better stroke, off the back foot through point. Exceptional batting. “Nothing gives me a greater satisfaction than V Kohli facing the mic after a loss,” says Krishnamoorthy. That’s quite punchy! An interesting read last weekend about the Indian skipper and the high-regard he’s held in off the field. 3rd over: Australia 14-0 (Warner 2, Finch 11) Target 256. Shot! Finch gets forward to Shami early in his fresh over, crashing him through the covers for a second boundary, quickly into double figures. Later in the set, Warner nearly does the same but Pandey, on the field at cover as Pant’s substitute, makes a well-timed ing stop. Shami beats the left-hander with a beauty to finish, angling in from around the wicket before straightening off the seam. That’s where he’s so good.2nd over: Australia 8-0 (Warner 1, Finch 6) Target 256. Bumrah to Warner, who leaves carefully to begin before getting off strike with a delivery that smashes into his thigh pad. Finch’s turn to take on his old nemesis and he pushes him with lovely timing through point for a couple. Given how frequently Bumrah has crashed into his stumps over the last 18 months, that’ll help with his confidence. “Hiya Adam.” Emails Peter Gibbs, watching with his mum - loyal OBOers! “Happy New Year to you and all.” Great to have you with us. You can also drop me a line.1st over: Australia 5-0 (Warner 1, Finch 4) Warner is off the mark down to third man, Shami finding the outside slither of his bat second ball. Finch is moving first up himself, throwing his hands at a wide half volley and placing it safely enough through the gap at point for four. There’s an update on the commentary explaining why KL Rahul has the gloves for India: Rishabh Pant is off the field after copping a whack to the head during his innings of 28 earlier. He hasn’t yet been subbed out.The players are back on the field in Mumbai! To begin, Warner and Finch against Bumrah and Shami, the latter taking the first over. It doesn’t come much tastier than that in one-day international cricket. The visitors’ target is 256. PLAY! Something of mine to plug, too. For those of you who followed the 1999 World Cup podcast last year, we’re back on The Greatest Season That Was with another walk down memory lane, this time documenting the famous 1994-95 Australia ‘A’ series. Yes, that was the summer where administrators brought a fourth team into the traditional ODI series because they didn’t trust England or Zimbabwe to put up much of a fight for Mark Taylor’s men. It turned out to be an inspired decision. Some reading during the break. Check out our weekly Spin column, Ali Martin talking to England’s champions from the Under 19 World Cup of 1998. Thanks, JP. Our man put in a huge tennis shift today before taking care of the first innings. Well played. Australia did that nicely, denying India the chance to explode the old fashioned way with consistent wickets in the middle overs.You find me watching Star’s coverage in London, where Michael Slater is currently learning Hindi. Just another day in 2020. Good afternoonevening to you all.Australia will be the happier of the two sides at the changeover. They never allowed India to get away from them, took wickets at regular intervals after that long second-wicket partnership, and they will be confident of chasing down 255 with the fast outfield at the Wankhede Stadium, especially if the dew settles and makes bowling awkward. The three pacemen all bowled superbly, each deserving their multiple-wicket hauls, while the two spinners kept India in check when their innings was meandering. Not a great day at the office for India’s much vaunted batsmen. Rohit and Kohli both fell cheaply while Dhawan was one of a number of Indians to give their wicket away needlessly. Find out if Australia can chase down 256 with the incomparable Adam Collins. Shami tries to smash Richardson into the sea but can only skew a top-edge high into the air that Carey does very well indeed to circle around and pouch. That’s your lot.Lovely from Kuldeep, giving himself room and drilling Starc through the covers for four, the bowler then overreaches with his reply and flings a wide well down the leg-side. Four more for Kuldeep! Stand and deliver this time, walloping Starc back over his head. The crowd is back into this and India, creeping over 250, have something to defend. They might not get much more than 250 though because Kuldeep has run himself out, chancing Steve Smith’s arm with a suicidal single and coming a cropper. Smith threw down the stumps from the ring behind point with plenty of time to pick his target. I was only thinking the other day how few direct run outs we see, considering the increase in fielding drills.48th over: India 243-8 (Shami 9, Kuldeep 7) Richardson returns in the final bowling change of the innings, and he sends down a beauty. Slower balls, line and length, bumpers, the full shebang, and India can only muster three singles. 47th over: India 240-8 (Shami 8, Kuldeep 5) Starc, like Cummins before him, is not a bowler these batsmen are capable of dispatching with ease. Five deliveries go for very little but spirits are lifted in the crowd when an attempted yorker becomes a full toss and Shami gets enough bat on it to pierce the covers for four. Slightly off topic, but very interesting nonetheless.46th over: India 233-8 (Shami 3, Kuldeep 3) India’s tail does its best to keep the runs flowing but Pat Cummins is too good to take on. Three singles off the over leaves Cummins with figures of 244 from his ten. Another outstanding performance from the star paceman. Ian Forth, a key contributor to the hive mind, has come good for Martin Fairhurst. “George Lohmann has the best Test strike-rate amongst all bowlers from any country at 34.2 which is a clear 3.6 off second place (qualification: 2,000 balls). Amongst English test bowlers this century it’s Simon Jones at 47.8, while amongst players still active Steve Finn has a 51.2 SR (but hasn’t played since 2016) while Jimmy Anderson’s is 56.1.” And Pete Naylor has done the ODI maths for goo dmeasure.45th over: India 230-8 (Shami 1, Kuldeep 1) This has been an impressive performance from Australia in the field. Starc, the ODI wizard, now has 337. Shardul gets a life. He mistimes a very full toss from Starc that looks to be heading to Richardson at long-on but the fielder is slow to move off the fence and drops what becomes a difficult ing effort. Then it’s Shami’s turn to deny Starc another scalp! The on-field decision is out when Starc appeals for LBW after hitting the batsman’s toes but India review and ball tracking indicates leg stump was not in the missile’s flightpath. Finally, finally Starc has his pole. And that’s the way to do it, remove any chance of a fielder dropping a catch or an LBW appeal not being upheld by making the mess of the stumps with a searing yorker. Sublime pace bowling at the death. 44th over: India 227-7 (Shardul 12, Shami 1) Excellent bouncer from Cummins there on his recall into the attack, too quick for Pant who, I presume, the umpire was expecting to walk.

The cost of offsetting will be reflected in a slight increase in the cost of holidays.The introduction of offsetting through Climate Care is part of a sustainability strategy that will see Explore “look at everything we do overseas”.“Offsetting is a not a band-aid solution but there is a climate emergency and we wanted to look at what can we do in the short to medium term as the industry moves towards net-zero territory,” said deputy managing director, John Telfer.Telfer said calculations are based on a “worst-case scenario” for each trip, to ensure the amount offset is always over-calculated rather than under. For example, flight distances are based on an indirect flight to the furthest point in 15 geographic regions all trips will be rounded up to seven or 14 days (a four-night trip will be counted as a week 11 days as a fortnight).Despite criticism of offsetting, a growing number of tour operators are using it to try to reduce their carbon footprint, particularly in the adventure travel market. World Expeditions, Much Better Adventures and Bamboo Travel are among recent adopters of offsetting – arguing it offers the best solution at the moment. While Australian-based adventure specialist Intrepid extended offsetting to flights this month.“Companies can hope the government does something and hope iniduals do something, but we also have a responsibility as a business. We feel this is the right thing to do,” said Telfer.Much Better Adventures has gone a step further declaring a climate emergency, with the hope of encouraging other travel businesses and organisations to do the same. Announcing the move on 14 January, founder Alex Narracott acknowledged that the company has laid itself open to accusations of greenwashing but said: “We’ll do everything we can to cut the carbon emissions we have any say over, encourage others to do likewise, and campaign for the wider system changes needed to move travel, and aviation especially, towards a low-carbon future. We’ll talk openly and invite criticism. Only by doing so do we have a chance of getting to our goal, not just as a company, but as a society.”Explore and Intrepid are among the 19 travel companies and organisations to have added their names to the declaration.Climate Care is partnered with Gold Standard, which was founded in 2003 by the WWF and supports a variety of off-set projects around the world such as clean water, fuel efficient stoves and wind power.Explore’s announcement coincides with the appointment of its first head of sustainability, Prue Stone, whose remit covers working with partners in destinations to reduce single-use plastic and swapping domestic flights for rail travel within countries."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ca457fe741e26d77e53f78a767adaf573a5afa4/0_24_2186_1312/master/2186.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aadd67a96ec78f05933a974ed638c5f5","title":"angela merkel under pressure spend germany record budget surplus","story":"End obsession with balancing the books, and cut taxes and boost infrastructure instead, government toldAngela Merkel’s government is coming under increasing pressure to spend some of its record budget surplus on tax cuts and investment in Germany’s ageing infrastructure.Despite months of weakening economic growth, the German state had a surplus of €13.5bn (£11.6bn) of income over expenditure at the end of 2019, thanks to increased tax revenues and a low interest rate.On Tuesday a banner headline in the Bild newspaper read “Chancellor, Hand Out the Money!” summing up the mounting cries by economists, commentators and lobbyists for the government to abandon its obsession with balancing the books – known colloquially as the Schwarze Null or black zero – and to use the money to invest in much-needed infrastructure projects across the country, as well as to reduce income tax levels.The government on Tuesday signed a multibillion investment deal with the national rail network, Deutsche Bahn, to which the government will contribute €62bn, and the company €24bn.But critics said much of the money, which was announced last year, would be insufficient to make up for years of neglect.By comparison, the most recent projections of the costs of Britain’s High Speed 2 project are £88bn.Across Germany, the strains of underinvestment in everything from school buildings to bridges, parks and town halls is growing increasingly visible. A lack of infrastructure in rural areas including a failure to address digital technology, is contributing to economic decline and forcing people to move away.On top of the €13.bn at the finance minister Olaf Scholz’s disposal he has a further €5.5bn that was set aside during the refugee crisis of 2015.Announcing the surplus, Scholz said: “We had a bit of luck, but of course this is also down to our good economic management.”He has categorically dismissed the idea of lowering the tax rate and has rejected plans to reduce the so-called solidarity tax, payable from all German incomes to finance the almost 30-year-old German reunification project.Meanwhile, the issue of what to do with the surplus is causing open rifts within the government. The economics minister, Peter Altmaier, is reported to have concrete plans to reduce corporate tax and to get rid of the solidarity tax, or Soli as it is known.The president of Germany’s taxpayers’ association, Reiner Holznagel, said it was time Germans saw something of the surplus. “This overhang of billions of euros obliges Scholz and Altmaier to bring forward the end of the Soli completely,” he said.Marcel Fratzscher, head of the German Institute for Economic Research, likened tax cuts to distributing water with a watering can “that would be the worst thing the government could do with this excess”.He added: “We should be clear that these immense surpluses despite shaky economic growth are very lucky and a chance that should not be lightly given away. The need for investment in infrastructure, education, digitalisation and climate protection is overwhelming. What the government needs to do is to come up with a clear and long-term plan which will make the German economy fit for the future.”The Green party, as well as some members of Merkel’s own Christian Democrats, are pushing for surpluses to be invested in climate friendly technologies and climate shares, which would connect economic growth more directly to climate protection."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4186da869ca6fb7e38345f72a6a6eed6ee885d80/406_82_510_306/master/510.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ffce2ef829e0b3f077e60fae69ebc3af","title":"belgian doctors go on trial for for helping woman end life","story":"Medics accused of poisoning Tine Nys, 38, in country’s first euthanasia criminal caseThree Belgian doctors go on trial for murder on Tuesday for helping a woman end her life in the country’s first criminal case concerning euthanasia.The doctors, whose names have not been made public, are accused of unlawfully poisoning 38-year-old Tine Nys on 27 April 2010.

It was extended to terminally ill children in 2014.Most patients choosing medically assisted death have terminal cancer, but mental suffering has extended, for example, to twins born deaf and becoming blind who are unable to bear not being able to see or hear each other.In the neighbouring country of the Netherlands, where euthanasia is also legal, a doctor was acquitted in a trial in September after being accused of failing to secure proper consent from a woman who had Alzheimer’s disease.

The book is published in France on Wednesday.Francis’s supporters claimed the increasingly frail Benedict, 92, had been manipulated by members of his rightwing entourage into writing something that amounted to a frontal attack on Francis.Sarah, who heads the Vatican’s liturgy office and co-authored the book with Benedict, posted to Twitter a series of letters from the former pope late on Monday making clear he had written the text and approved its publication after news reports quoting “sources close to Benedict” claimed he never saw or approved the finished product.“I solemnly affirm that Benedict XVI knew that our project would take the form of a book. I can say that we exchanged many drafts to make corrections,” he said.Gänswein, however, told Ansa that “Benedict did not approve a project for a co-authored book and he had not seen or authorised the cover” and therefore asked the publishers to remove Benedict’s name from the cover, the introduction and the conclusion.“The pope emeritus knew that the cardinal was preparing a book and he sent him a text on the priesthood authorising him to use it as he wanted. But he did not approve a project for a co-authored book, and he had not seen or authorised the cover.”Gänswein said it was “a misunderstanding that does not raise questions about Cardinal Sarah’s good faith”.Sarah tweeted minutes later that future publications of the book would name him as the sole author “with the contribution of Benedict XVI”.“Considering the controversies that provoked the publication of the book From the Depths of Our Hearts, it is decided that the author of the book will be for the further publications: Cardinal Sarah, with the contribution of Benedict XVI,” he said. “However, the full text remains absolutely unchanged.”Benedict’s intervention had been seen as surprising since he had vowed to live “hidden from the world” when he retired in 2013, specifically to avoid any suggestion that he still wielded papal authority. He has come forward on various issues over the past seven years, but this is the first time he has intervened on a matter that the more liberal Pope Francis is actively considering.The Vatican insisted the book was a mere “contribution” to the discussion about priestly celibacy written by two bishops in “filial obedience” to Francis."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50d3f3ef41eff7d097f978ac330b5a4971976cff/0_259_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9698e164bd09558d364942e6e0bd118","title":"first orca stranding england wales since 2001","story":"Discovery of dead juvenile killer whale is first confirmed stranding in nearly 20 yearsExperts are investigating the first confirmed stranding of an orca in England and Wales for almost 20 years, the Zoological Society of London has said.The juvenile male killer whale, approximately 15ft long, became stranded in salt marsh in the Wash on the east coast of England.It is the first confirmed orca stranding that the Cetacean Strandings Investigation Programme, of which ZSL is a partner, has investigated in England and Wales since 2001.Orcas are a priority species for research by ZSL as they are top predators that can absorb significant concentrations of marine pollutants, such as chemicals known as PCBs, which accumulate as they go up the food chain.ZSL’s Rob Deaville and Matt Perkins collected blubber, liver, muscle and kidney samples from the mammal, which was internally mostly intact despite its decomposed condition, having probably died weeks ago.Tests will analyse the samples for marine contaminants, while genetic analysis will help determine which population the animal came from, and teeth have been collected to accurately assess its age.The experts said there was no evidence of recent feeding as its stomachs were largely empty.

Now is that time,” he said.Unusually the election will take place on a Saturday – and coincide with a Six Nations rugby match against Wales at the Aviva stadium.An election had been expected. Varadkar’s Fine Gael party leads a minority administration reliant on dwindling support from independent TDs (MPs) plus a nearly expired confidence and supply agreement with the main opposition party, Fianna Fáil.Opinion polls closely match Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, both centrist parties. Neither is within range of a majority so the winner will be whichever party succeeds in forming a viable coalition with smaller parties after the election.Varadkar and the Fianna Fáil leader, Micheál Martin, have both ruled out going into government with Sinn Fein. That leaves the Labour party, the Greens and a clutch of leftwing groups and independents as potential partners.The Green party’s success in European and council elections last year, plus youth-led climate protests, has prompted Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil to tout environmental credentials.As Ireland’s first gay prime minister and the son of an Indian immigrant, Varadkar attracted global attention when he took office in June 2017, aged just 37.He did so not via a general election but by succeeding Enda Kenny, who stepped down as taoiseach and leader of Fine Gael after winning elections in 2011 and 2016.Varadkar earned widespread praise in Ireland for rallying European Union support behind the backstop, a mechanism to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, during Brexit negotiations with the UK. His meeting with Boris Johnson in Liverpool last October paved the way to an eventual deal.Liberals also applauded Varadkar for his role in a 2018 referendum that legalised abortion, a milestone in Ireland’s transformation from a socially conservative Catholic society to secularism and and pluralism.Fine Gael will fight the election on its record on Brexit and the economy, which has bounced back from the Celtic Tiger crash with high growth rates, near-full employment and bountiful tax revenues swollen by tech giants.However the party risks voter fatigue – it has ruled for almost a decade. And it has presided over crises in housing and health.A shortage of accommodation in Dublin and other cities and towns has sent rents rocketing, forced many people to make long commutes and others to live in shelters or on the streets.The government has failed to tame a dysfunctional health service that swallows huge resources but produces patchy results, with record numbers of patients languishing on trolleys.Unexpectedly huge costs for a children’s hospital and national broadband have hit the government’s claim of competent financial stewardship."},{"url":null,"title":"college","story":"Can you put the facts about yourself together to see what picture may emerge?College application process can seem intimidating and complex \u0026ndash here\u0026rsquos how to do itA reduction in the artificially inflated range of choices would lead to lower drop-out ratesEmployers will be interested in your range of problem-solving and lateral thinking skillsParents\u0026rsquo perception of the education options for their children are often outdatedAs numbers of students choosing to study abroad increase, we look at the optionsThe costs of college are particularly high for students living in rented or student accommodationPrimary and secondary school may be expensive, but costs climb sharply at third levelWhat do Ireland\u0026rsquos universities offer students by way of sports and health facilities?Download PDFs of our comprehensive list of level 8 and level 67 courses"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4138744.1578951140!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"leaving cert marking rushed unfair and lacks precision","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe commission’s method of altering marking schemes is very unusual internationally. It involves erting marks  from questions that are “easy” if too many students score high grades. The marking process for the Leaving Cert exams is rushed, unfair and risks compromising the accuracy of students’ grades, according to an internal State Examinations Commission report.The concerns stem from the way marking schemes for inidual State exams are altered to ensure up to 100,000 students achieve grades broadly consistent from year to year.The unpublished research report produced by the commission outlines key ways this form of standard-setting makes the final marking scheme for exams “less valid” and “reduces fairness” by benefiting some students and penalising others.Among the key concerns outlined in the paper are that the process currently used by the commission “distorts” the marking by changing the weighting attached to inidual questions, rendering the marking scheme “less valid”.The process is described as being of “questionable fairness” as it can lead to some students benefiting or losing out more than others due to changes to marking schemes.It erts attention from a focus on accuracy in the marking of exams to a focus on achieving a similar proportion of grades year-on-year and “compromises the accuracy of marking” because, while examiners are trained to mark accurately using the original marking scheme, they receive no training on applying changes to marking schemes.Altering marking schemesThe process lacks “precision and efficiency” in marking exams and impacts negatively on the recruitment and retention of examiners, the report states.Most exam authorities seek to ensure exams are of a similar level of difficulty for candidates each year and that grades are broadly consistent.However, the commission’s method of altering marking schemes for exams is very unusual internationally.It involves erting marks away from questions that are “easy” if too many students are scoring high grades. Conversely, it involves giving extra marks for more challenging questions, if too many students are scoring lower grades.The precise details of how these marking schemes are applied and subsequently changed has been hidden from public view until now. The commission has previously refused to release details under the Freedom of Information (FoI) Act of how marking schemes for inidual exams have been changed.However, this report, seen by The , says the only benefits of maintaining the current process are that it has “the appearance of objectivity”, is “familiar”, “enjoys widespread public understanding” and “may contribute to keeping the standard of the paper consistent”.‘Validity’ of resultsProf Michael O’Leary, director of the centre for assessment research policy at Dublin City University (DCU), said the internal report highlighted an urgent need for a more robust and transparent system.“The suspicion that it may be undermining the validity of what a mark on an exam means and disadvantaging some students is worrying,” he said.In response to queries, the State Examinations Commission said it could provide “absolute reassurance” the existing exam standard-setting process was “fit for purpose, represents a valid and reliable approach to the marking of candidates’ work and is fair to all candidates”.It said the document seen by The  was an early draft from 2018 of an internal research paper and was intended to provoke initial discussion, consideration and debate on what is a “complex and challenging process” in any examinations system.In the development of the paper, it said a “deliberately critical lens” was applied to the current standard-setting process in order to “stimulate debate”. “The paper has been subject to further revision, remains a work in progress, and is part of an ongoing review in the context of senior cycle reform and development,” the commission added."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4138531.1578936579!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"questions raised over state examinations marking process","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSorting and despatching of  Leaving Certificate and Junior Certificate exam scripts   at the State Examinations Commission in Athlone. Photograph: Alan BetsonThe Every year more than 100,000 students receive their Junior and Leaving Cert exam results.The fact the exams are marked anonymously and major errors are relatively rare means they have widespread public confidence.The State Examination Commission (SEC) says it is dedicated to providing a “high quality examinations and assessment system incorporating the highest standards of openness, fairness and accountability”.However, an internal report prepared by the commission raises urgent questions over whether the system really is fully transparent, fair and fit-for-purpose.ConcernsThe findings are contained in an unpublished research paper, Standard setting procedures in the Leaving Certificate Examination.The concerns stem from the measures used by the commission to ensure consistency of standards in students’ overall grades from one year to the next.Nowadays, students are entitled to see their marked exam papers and appeal their results if they feel they have grounds for an upgrade.This has been a big step forward in promoting greater transparency over candidates’ grades.However, students do not have sight of the measures used to ensure consistency of standards in candidates’ overall grades from one year to the next.The commission achieves this by adjusting marking schemes during the marking process to ensure a similar proportion of candidates are awarded As, Bs and Cs (or H1s, H2 and H3, as they are now known) each year.As a result, it adjusts the marking schemes for inidual exams.This can involve erting marks away from certain questions that are “easy” (if too many students are scoring high grades) or allocating extra marks for more challenging questions (if too many students are scoring lower grades).The precise details of how this takes place has been hidden from public view. Requests by The  to see the details of how marking schemes are altered have been refused by the commission.However, an internal research report produced by the SEC outlines several key ways the standard-setting process makes the marking scheme for exams “less valid” and reduces fairness by benefiting some students and penalising others.1. Distorts\u0026nbspthe marking scheme The report says a “critical disadvantage” of this approach is the “distorting effect” the procedure can have on marking schemes.For example, when marks are erted away from challenging questions, or towards easy questions, it has the effect of changing the weightings for different skills being assessed.This discrepancy between the original marking scheme and the final one renders the exam “less valid that it would otherwise be”, according to the report.2. ‘Questionable fairness’ Changes to marking schemes vary from subject to subject – but in most cases it will change the “rank ordering” of candidates.For example, let’s say John scores 92 per cent or a H1 under the original marking scheme, while Mary scores 88 per cent or a H2.When the marking scheme is altered to get a similar proportion of grades to last year, John loses marks and ends up with 89 per cent or a H2, while Mary gains marks and secures a H1.The report points out that changes to marking schemes affect this “ranking ordering”, which in many cases affects the grades students obtain.These can be crucial differences for students who are chasing valuable CAO points for their chosen courses.Significantly, a student will not know this has happened – even if they view their exam script this is because only the final marking scheme counts and earlier versions are not published.The report also notes the original marking scheme was designed to reflect, as accurately as possible, how skills being measured ought to be valued relative to each other. Therefore, any changes move it further away from this intended balance.These factors and their impact on the rank ordering of candidates, the report says, is “more likely to reduce fairness than increase it”.3. Distorts the management of the marking process Ideally, the main focus of exam authorities is to ensure examiners are marking accurately and identifying any deficiencies.However, the focus on the distribution of grades and the need to change marking schemes dominates the attention of authorities, according to the report.The more time and attention devoted to this, the less time and attention that is available to focus on what should be their primary concern.4. Compromises the accuracy of marking Much time and money goes on training hundreds of examiners to mark accurately using the original marking schemes.If these are altered, examiners are required to implement these changes without further training other than a phone call from their advising examiners. “This,” the report says,” hinders the accuracy with which the examiners can do their work.”5. Slows down marking The need to gather data from sample exam papers and determine whether changes are needed to the marking scheme takes a considerable amount of time towards the start of the marking process.The report estimates it takes about five days to do this. Only after this, can the regular marking begin.6. Impacts on the supply of examiners Each year the commission struggles to hire enough examiners to mark hundreds of thousands of examination scripts.The process of altering marking schemes – which involves suspending marking until sample scripts are analysed and revisiting papers which have previously been marked – is a source of frustration for many examiners.Feedback from examiners who have declined to mark exams shows this is a factor in their decision not to take up an offer of reappointment.7.\u0026nbspLacks precision and efficiency The report notes altering marking schemes lacks “precision and accuracy”.For example, a marking scheme may be adjusted because it is proving too harsh by producing too few A or B grades, and too lenient at the other end of the spectrum by producing too few E and F grades.The report notes adjusting marking schemes to address both of these difficulties at the same time is challenging.8. Cannot facilitate ‘linked’ grades Until recently there was no official link between grades at different levels in the same subject. This has changed since 2016 with the introduction of a new common points scale. For example, nowadays a H5 (50-60 per cent at Higher level) is the equivalent of an O1 (90 to 100 per cent at Ordinary level), which is reflected in CAO points. This link is now official and required under Department of Education policy. However, the report says, “under the present arrangement, “this is simply not feasible at all.”9. Limits adoption of new technology to improve marking quality The process of adjusting marking schemes for standardising purposes is highly unusual internationally. This makes it more difficult to find compatible technology which allows for digitisation of scripts and on-screen marking.AdvantagesThe report also examines the advantages of the existing standard-setting system used by the commission. Among these are that it is “familiar” it “has the appearance of objectivity” and may “contribute to keeping the standard of the paper consistent”.The commission’s paper proposes two possible alternatives to the current standard-setting process, similar to systems used in the UK and elsewhere.One involves setting grade boundaries after exams have been marked.This would allow exam authorities to raise or lower the minimum marks needed to secure a grade, if an exam is easier or harder than the previous year.This approach would ensure grades remain consistent year after year in a way in a way that is fairer for all candidates, as all candidates are affected in the same way.Another approach involves applying a “standardising transformation”. This is a relatively complex process which typically involves converting marks into a uniform scale which gives equal value to work at the same level of performance, regardless of the level of difficulty of the exam. In simple terms, it transforms the marks of all students instead of moving the grade boundaries.The research paper says the commission considers this approach would be “significantly better” than the current system."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4138545.1578937630!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"2019 was record year for ocean temperatures study shows","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Great Barrier Reef in Australia: The past 10 years have been the warmest 10 on record for global ocean temperatures.  Photograph: Reinhard Dirscherl\\ullstein bild via Getty ImagesLast year was the warmest year on record for the world’s oceans, part of a long-term warming trend, according to a study released on Monday. “If you look at the ocean heat content, 2019 is by far the hottest, 2018 is second, 2017 is third, 2015 is fourth, and then 2016 is fifth,” said Kevin E Trenberth, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research and an author on the studyThe study, published in the journal Advances in Atmospheric Sciences, follows an announcement last week by European scientists that Earth’s surface temperatures in 2019 were the second-hottest on record. Since the middle of last century, the oceans have absorbed roughly 93 per cent of the excess heat caused by greenhouse gases from human activities such as burning coal for electricity. That has shielded the land from some of the worst effects of rising emissions.“Ocean heat content is, in many ways, our best measure of the effect of climate change on the earth,” said Zeke Hausfather, director of climate and energy at the Breakthrough Institute in California, who was not involved in this study. Surface temperature measurements are more variable from year to year because they are affected by things like volcanic eruptions and El Niño events, cyclical weather patterns that pump energy and moisture into the atmosphere.While 2016 was the fifth-hottest year on record for the oceans, it was the hottest year on record in terms of surface temperatures. There was a significant El Niño that year, Dr Trenberth said, which moved the heat from the ocean into the atmosphere.“And so, the global mean surface temperature is actually higher in 2016, but the ocean temperature is a little bit lower,” Dr Trenberth said. Measuring the ocean’s temperature has long been a challenge for scientists. Thermometers on land around the world have tracked temperatures for more than a century, but the ocean temperature record is spottier. Argo, a global network of 3,000 drifting floats equipped with sensors that measure temperature and depth, was implemented in 2007 and created a comprehensive temperature data record. Before that, researchers had to rely on an ad hoc system of ocean temperature measurements. Many of these were taken from the sides of ships and excluded Antarctic waters until the late 1950s.For the new study, Dr Trenberth and his colleagues overcame some of the gaps in the historical ocean temperature record by exploiting an understanding of how a temperature reading in one area relates to ocean temperatures across the ocean overall gleaned from data from the Argo system. The new method allowed them to take the limited temperature observations from the pre-Argo era and extrapolate them into a broader understanding of past ocean temperature.‘Global reconstruction’“What we find is that we can do a global reconstruction back to 1958,” Dr Trenberth said. That year was when systematic temperature observations began in Antarctica, creating enough temperature points for the extrapolation to be feasible. The past 10 years have been the warmest 10 on record for global ocean temperatures. The increase between 2018 and 2019 was the largest single-year increase since the early 2000s, according to Mr Hausfather. Increasing ocean temperatures have harmed marine life and contributed to mass coral reef bleaching, the loss of critical ecosystems, and threatened livelihoods like fishing as species have moved in search of cooler waters. But the impacts of warming oceans don’t remain at sea. “The heavy rains in Jakarta just recently resulted, in part, from very warm sea temperatures in that region,” said Dr Trenberth, who also drew connections between warming ocean temperatures to weather over Australia. The recent drought there has helped to propel what many are calling the worst wildfire season in the nation’s history.“These sea temperatures influence regional weather patterns and sometimes even global weather patterns,” Trenberth said. – New York Times"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4139429.1579004971!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"analysis big two set to slug it out in most open election for years","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLabour’s Kevin Humphreys puts up election posters ahead of the official announcement of Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to dissolve the Dáil and call a general election. Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill Called a bit sooner than expected, to be held a bit later than expected. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar decided there was no point hanging around, and rather than wait for it to return tomorrow, he will travel to Áras an Uachtaráin later today to ask the President to formally bring the 32nd Dáil to an end. Ministers remain ministers until someone else takes over, but TDs will no longer be TDs.The election will take place on February 8th, which is a Saturday. This is unusual - recent elections have all been held on a Friday, and before that they were held on Thursdays. It paves the way for a campaign that will be three-and-a-half weeks long - though it may feel longer. Like the last two general elections, a February poll, and a campaign fought not on long summer evenings - as Varadkar had initially suggested - but in the dark, wet and cold of winter. That will enhance the importance of the “air war” - a campaign fought in the media and over the airwaves - while the “ground war” of knocking on doors and personally engaging voters will be more difficult. Difficult but still important - election studies consistently emphasise the importance in the Irish electoral system of personal approaches to voters. For all the complaints that they are insulated from the lives of ordinary people, Irish politicians in all parties remain remarkably close to the electorate. Extreme anxiety If they don’t, they lose their seats. All politicians suffer from extreme anxiety about their own seats at election time.Campaigning will be frantic and cacophonous in the coming days as the parties stake out their territory and attack their opponents.Party managers will be opening up their campaign headquarters today and rolling out the message and activity grids they have finalised in recent weeks and which plot out the daily business of the campaigns for all parties.The big two parties will slug it out on their respective records in government and their plans for the future. Elections are about the future, but the credibility of the parties’ promises is influenced greatly by their behaviour in the past. The smaller parties will seek to elbow their way into the debate with sharp and distinctive messages. They’ll get less airtime and fewer column inches than the big parties, so making full use of the coverage they do get is imperative. Spinning from everyone will be dialled up to the maximum immediately.Polls suggest the most open election in many years. The last Ipsos MRBI poll in October gave Fine Gael a small lead, but figures in both big parties accept that there is little between them. Both reckon they can gain seats - but who can gain the most? Fine Gael goes into the campaign with 47 seats, Fianna Fáil with 46, but all the Fianna Fáil TDs are standing for re-election, whereas Fine Gael has several high profile retirees, like Michael Noonan, Enda Kenny and Sean Barrett.‘Coalitionology’And neither of the big parties will come anywhere near the 80 seats required for a majority when the new Dáil meets. That means that the question of how and with whom the next government is formed - derided by Micheál Martin during the last election as “coalitionology” - will be a central one for this campaign. Both big parties are ruling out Sinn Féin, a stance they will be repeatedly required to justify. But the Greens (especially), Labour, the Social Democrats, independents and small parties will also be required to spell out their intentions. A long period of government formation is likely to follow the meeting of a new Dáil, with the numbers dictating the realm of the possible. A return to some form of confidence and supply is not impossible. The transformation of the Irish political landscape as a result of the economic crash of 2008-2011 has meant that government formation is now a much more difficult business. In a way, there are two phases in deciding the future leadership of the country - the election, in which the voters get their say, and then the construction of the new government, in which it’s over to the politicians. The winner of the first phase has the advantage in the second.

Photograph:  Tom HonanThe .The general election will be held on Saturday, February 8th, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar confirmed on Tuesday.Speaking outside Government Buildings at lunchtime before travelling to Áras an Uachtaráin to seek a dissolution of the 32nd Dáil from President Michael D Higgins, Mr Varadkar said the election should happen at the best time for the country: “now is that time.”Outlining his rationale for calling the election now the Taoiseach said a Brexit deal had been achieved which would see the UK exit the EU in an “orderly” fashion.“There will be no hard border, citizens’ rights have been protected and the Common Travel Area will remain in place,” he said.He said an agreement to restore powersharing b in Northern Ireland had also been reached.He said the next priority was to secure a free-trade agreement between the EU, including Ireland, and the United Kingdom, that protected the Irish economy.The capacity for the government to do everything else that needs to be done: in “health, housing, climate action, tax reform,” was dependent on this agreement he said.Mr Varadkar said there was a window to hold an election now with the aim of having a new government in place before the next European Council meeting in March.SaturdayA Saturday polling day is unusual, with elections in recent decades taking place on a Thursday or Friday.Fine Gael figures have said Saturday polling means schools will not be closed so parents will not have to find alternative childcare arrangements.Mr Varadkar spoke to Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin and other Opposition leaders after the Cabinet meeting this morning and informed them of his decision.Fine Gael figures also point to the second Nice Referendum, which was held on Saturday October 19th, 2002, and the Children’s Referendum, which was held on a Saturday, November 10th, 2012.The Children’s Referendum saw a very poor turnout of 33 per cent. The second Nice referendum saw a turnout of 49 per cent.Mr Martin welcomed an end to the indecision but noted the short duration of the campaign.“We want the public to have sufficient time to examine the policies and proposals, and a longer campaign would’ve given greater opportunity for the public to hold the government to account,” Mr Martin said.He added: “For us and the Irish people in particular this is a vital election in terms of their future because we are facing enormous challenges,” he said outside Leinster House.“Particularly in terms of housing the inability of people to afford houses, housing prices and housing rents are simply far too high and there is a deep, deep crisis of homelessness right across every level of housing.“Things are simply not working in this country in so many areas.”DáilHaving been dissolved the Dáil will not meet tomorrow and the election campaigns are effectively under way.Candidates - including the Taoiseach - have already begun to erect their election posters, with Mr Varadkar’s campaign posters going up on the Navan Road in Dublin West this morning.The Taoiseach had previously expressed a preference for a May election but changed his mind as the voting strength of his Fine Gael-led minority coalition weakened in recent weeks.Among those candidates who on Tuesday declared their intention to run were deselected Fine Gael candidate Verona Murphy, who said she will run as an Independent in Wexford, and former MEP Marian Harkin, who will contest a seat in the SligoLeitrim constituency.However, Dublin Bay North TD and Minister of State for Disability Issues Finian McGrath confirmed he will not seek re-election.Speaking before he went to the Áras, Mr Varadkar said it had been a privilege to lead the country as Taoiseach.“Our economy has never been stronger. There are more people at work than ever before, incomes are rising, poverty is falling and the public finances are back in order.He said under a Fine Gael led-government Irish society had been modernised in terms of marriage equality and women’s rights and had made progress in terms of welfare and childcare.“But, it’s not enough. I know it’s not enough. People want their government to do much more. And I want us to do much more.”There are a number of significant sporting events taking place on Saturday, February 8th.Ireland will take on Wales at the Aviva Stadium in rugby’s Six Nations Championship, while the Dublin-Monaghan national football league is scheduled for Croke Park.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4139492.1579010310!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"general election 2020 what slogans are the main parties using","story":"The general election will be held on Saturday, February 8th, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar told the Cabinet on Tuesday morning.Candidates’ campaign posters have already started to appear in some areas with the Taoiseach’s posters appearing before the official date for the election had been announced.In terms of election slogans, Fine Gael has changed its from 2016’s “Let’s Keep the Recovery Going” to “ A future to Look Forward to”.Fianna Fáil is sticking with its 2016 slogan of “An Ireland for all”.Although Labour has not released its slogan yet, Tipperary TD Alan Kelly is going with his own personal slogan of: ’Deliver MORE for Tipp!’The Taoiseach is shortly expected to travel to Áras an Uachtaráin to seek a dissolution of the 32nd Dáil from President Michael D Higgins.The Saturday polling day is unusual, with all elections in recent decades taking place on a Thursday or Friday.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4139287.1579004145!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"verona murphy to run in wexford as an independent","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tVerona Murphy has confirmed she will contest the next general election as an Independent candidate.  Photograph Nick BradshawThe Former Fine Gael candidate Verona Murphy has confirmed she will contest the general election in Wexford as an independent candidate. Ms Murphy said that having reflected on her byelection campaign and subsequent deselection from the Fine Gael ticket, he feels the time is right to run for Dáil Éireann as an independent.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar is set to announce a date for the general election this week, with February 7th or St Valentine’s Day seen as the likeliest dates.Ms Murphy was deselected as a Fine Gael general election candidate for Wexford before Christmas having become embroiled in controversy over comments she made about immigration during the recent campaign.She suggested that some asylum seekers may have to be “deprogrammed” and that young children may be manipulated by terrorist group Islamic State.“My time with Fine Gael is over, I have moved on,” Ms Murphy told the New Ross Standard on Tuesday. “I am now an independent candidate. My brief experience with Fine Gael taught me a lot. I am now satisfied that life as an independent is the appropriate forum for me. It allows me to highlight without fear the issues which affect the people of Co Wexford. After all, politics is not about the politician. it’s about the people they represent.”Ms Murphy came third in the byelection, having been in second place behind Fianna Fáil’s Malcolm Byrne by virtue of a strong 9,543 first preference vote - before being leapfrogged by Wexford Labour Mayor George Lawlor who secured a large number of transfers from Sinn Féin’s Johnny Mythen.Free speechMs Murphy, who is president of the Irish Road Haulage Association, said she would be campaigning on the potential for to develop the Rosslare Europort, the urban rural ide and to speak for voters in Wexford. She said all of the main parties are limiting free speech.“I have learned this first-hand. An independent politician is free to highlight any issues that affect the people of Wexford without fear. Wexford needs is a strong independent voice. I believe I have the skill set to do that job,” she said. When asked is she will be highlighting security issues for the country over the coming weeks, she said: ‘I will always where I feel it necessary and appropriate highlight security issues.’Ms Murphy said her falling out with Mr Varadkar and Fine Gael is in the past. “That campaign is over now. I am very resilient, and I am looking forward to the future.”She addressed the Fine Gael party at a meeting in Enniscorthy last week at which she thanked the party for giving her an opportunity. Speaking at an executive meeting of the party’s Wexford branch in the Riverside Park Hotel last Monday, Ms Murphy became emotional when outlining how her controversial comments were reported in the media in November. A party member who attended the meeting said she never blamed anybody for her performance in the byelection.Ms Murphy received a standing ovation and afterwards a heated 20 minute discussion took place about how she was treated by the party.“It was a full and frank debate. A lot of people came out in favour of her and many said they weren’t happy about the party’s treatment of her,” a source said. The executive committee tried to unify party members behind junior ministers Michael D’Arcy Jnr and Paul Kehoe ahead of what is expected to be a difficult general election campaign over the coming weeks, but a source within the party said there is strong support for Ms Murphy who is expected to get many Fine Gael votes in the upcoming election.Security issuesSpeaking later on RTÉ radio’s Today with Séan O’Rourke show, Ms Murphy said the Government must insist Cherbourg significantly improves it security to stop illegal immigrants getting on board trucks if the ferry link with Rosslare is to continue.Ms Murphy said Calais has spent €19m on fencing within the port, but that this has still not stopped illegals.“The only port that carries security is Le Havre. It has its own police force - 130 police, they don’t have an issue with illegal migrants. The primary sufferers here are the people who are trying to do a day’s work. The drivers are suffering on the basis of not being able to carry out their work.”Ms Murphy said that the point is that the issue of illegal migration has to be addressed. “We have to address the security issue - we have to address the security of our borders, our shipping routes to major ports in the northern corridor.” Ms Murphy denied that she was a racist. “I have been continually misquoted by everyone. I’ve raised the security issue and that stands. Sixteen migrants came in through Rosslare port and no one can say where they are, nobody can tell us who they are, and nobody can tell us why they were here.“We need to address our security, I have spoken many times as President of the IRHA, the security issues that are there, that need to be addressed. I’ve been to Calais, I’ve been at the coal face, I’ve had briefings supported by the EU Commission, supported by many of the security agencies, in which case security issues were being addressed. “We have illegal migration, we don’t know anything about them, they are entering trailers illegally. They were provided with all the necessary requirements, but they absconded - why? It doesn’t work in any other country. I can’t go to any other country in the world without my proper visa or documentation and just say ‘look I’ll go stay with a friend.’“Security is lax. There is no security particularly for one industry and we should be insisting at government level that this is addressed. I want legal migration. Illegal migration is absolutely heinous, we support refugees under the UN protocol and we are meeting our obligations, the problem is illegal migration.”"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Move pushes 2015 accord closer to collapse after Iran breached enrichment limitsAnti-government protests triggered by disaster in which 176 died enter a fourth dayDemonstrators shout \u0026lsquoClerics get lost!\u0026rsquo as fury directed at supreme leader Ali KhameneiRiot police deployed in Tehran, as protesters chant anti-government slogansUK ambassador to Iran detained after vigil for victims of Ukrainian plane shot downRebel commander Khalifa Haftar reacts in wake of call for truce by Erdogan and PutinMilitary apologises as it says aircraft was mistaken for a \u0026lsquohostile target\u0026rsquoRuler was the Middle East\u0026rsquos longest-ruling monarch, having been in power since 1970If Donald Trump has a policy on the Middle East, it is incoherent and crisis-led.

It is making people scared, and making people wonder.”Brexit latest news: Boris Johnson calls on public to crowdfund Big Ben bongs for BrexitComment: Why Britain\u0026#39s spooks are wrong to downplay the risks of HuaweiComment: Why are the authorities so embarrassed about celebrating Brexit Night?

How idyllic the countryside must look when you finally get to put your feet up and switch on the TV. Whether it’s watching somebody search for their very own rural retreat on a property programme or a drama like Midsomer Murders, the chocolate-box world of thatched roofs, oak beams, cottage gardens and local pubs portrayed in some of our favourite shows is a glorious sight to behold.The problem is that this is a deeply skewed view of country life. And in an era when we can hardly move for talk of a “ided Britain”, it means we all too often overlook one distinction that really matters – the difference between rural and urban.The latest illlustration comes courtesy of a report from the County Councils Network. Where I live, we have had enormous problems with potholes. They are at their most dangerous on country lanes where you cannot see them and I have several friends who have sustained serious damage to their cars, most while driving in the dark. And yet it is cities, as the report sets out, that are likely to receive vastly more money for road repairs.There is nothing new in this. J B Priestley, writing in the Thirties, noted the lack of sanitation, damp and overcrowding. Of course, some things are different. The villager of Priestley’s day is now more likely to be in a comfortable council house while the old cottage, much renovated, is occupied by a wealthy incomer, sold on for eye-watering sums.England\u0026#039s lost county – where warm beer and village cricket are eternal virtuesBut our village is a good example of pretty strong continuity. Everybody seems related, which means you have to be cautious before airing your views, sometimes. While, healthily, there are people who have come to the village to live and been absorbed into the fabric, we also have a good proportion of farmers and most are succeeded by their children. There is a significant tourist income for holiday cottages. We have a thriving pub, though no shop or school.We count ourselves among the lucky ones. And yet my husband, who has lived in the same house since he was born, remembers how much more used to be done. There was much more gritting of the roads in winter, a local farmer employed by the council for snow ploughing, more hedge trimming and more clearing of drains. These are vital – without drainage we have floods, a terrifying prospect for farmers, and hedges, apparently allowed to run wild for environmental reasons, reduce visibility and force motorists, cyclists and pedestrians into the middle of the road.One trend I have noticed, though, is that people in their seventies so often move out of the village into the town. This is a sad but pragmatic move. There is no longer any way to travel if you reach the stage of no longer being able to drive. There’s no doctor, no way of getting your shopping, no post office.

We did so with the permission of Westminster City Council and the Mayor’s Office. Although we had been let down by the government, and remained stuck in the bloc, a good-natured atmosphere prevailed.Given that background, I had thought it would be a formality to get permission from the same authorities this time around. Yet still nothing has been sanctioned at an official level.There is certainly a demand for it. As a result of the Brexit Party sending just one email, more than 15,000 people have registered their willingness to attend. We hope for positive news from the Mayor’s office. We need it quickly to make this gathering a success. But I am beginning to think the attempts to block this celebration go to the heart of government.The Leave Means Leave rally on 29th March 2019Soon after the Brexit Party chairman, Richard Tice, and I announced we were planning this event, No 10 announced that it would also be marking this moment. Oddly, so far, no tangible arrangements have been confirmed. And, with the exception of Tory MP Mark Francois, those who I had assumed would be most enthusiastic about this bash – such as the ERG faction of Conservative MPs – have been actively putting people off coming to speak. Why would they do this? The answer, apparently, is that Nigel Farage will dominate it. This really is pathetic. They are all welcome to attend, to join in, and to speak. But perhaps the worst of the obstruction we face comes from the House of Commons Commission. This administrative body has claimed it will cost £500,000 for Big Ben, which is undergoing repair, to chime at the appointed hour. Really? It tolled on New Year’s Eve, on Remembrance Sunday and on Armistice Day. Did this cost £500,000 on each occasion? I would love to know the answer.If money really is the problem, crowdfunding plans have already been hatched. Businessmen including Lord Ashcroft have offered to underwrite this effort. Given the amount of public cash-raising schemes launched since 2016 by Remainers in their various bids to derail Brexit, there would be a certain sweetness in our paying en masse for Big Ben to work its magic in any case.The prime minister has said the government is “working up” a strategy to allow people to donate cash to pay for Big Ben to bong. He must go further. Can the Government underwrite it? If they are serious about Brexit and not embarrassed by it, they would make this commitment. Either way, this must move quickly.Come on, Boris. Announce that Big Ben will chime. And then appear on stage in Parliament Square as Prime Minister to mark this extraordinary date.

It would appear that the UK’s spymasters have decided – much like Britain’s telecommunications companies – on a policy of asking the right questions in order to guarantee the right answers.The UK needs Huawei’s 5G tech at its laughably cheap prices. And so ignored is the geopolitical context of an increasingly authoritarian China, funding Huawei’s expansion across Europe. Ignored is the company’s role in Xinjiang. Ignored is China’s place as a leading source of global cyber espionage. Ignored is the 2017 National Intelligence Law which requires Chinese companies to cooperate with China’s intelligence agencies, at home and abroad. Ignored are China’s increasing influence operations inside Western democracies.Instead, the decisive question in Britain’s 5G debate has become a comically narrow one: will Huawei’s inclusion into Britain’s 5G networks be a threat to the network’s integrity?The UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) argues that it can mitigate this risk by using multiple vendors – a mixture of Huawei, Ericsson, and Nokia – and by restricting Huawei’s components to the periphery or non-intelligent bits of the network.According to the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), the telecoms network is structured around three functional parts. The transport layer, the physical nodes that transport data the routing layer, which works out the best transport route for the data to use and finally, the edge, where consumers – that’s you and me – interact with it.China | Read more from The Huawei, they tell us, will be kept out of the core, which is a functional name for all the bits that decide who you are, where your data needs to go, and so on. That means they’ll be restricted to antennas, routers, switches, and products at the consumer end such as WiFi boxes, and away from the intelligent bits that have more access to the data. The NCSC seems to indicate that this has long been a deciding principle, but we know that BT began ripping out Huawei components from its 4G core as late as December 2018, meaning either the principle only dates from then, or the NCSC does not keep a close eye on the network. Neither is very reassuring.The NCSC has also said that any code used in components in the network – such as antennas and routers – will be pre-checked for backdoors and vulnerabilities at its Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation Centre (HCSEC) in Banbury, Oxfordshire. It sounds rather good, especially since Huawei has agreed to pay for it all.The problem is that checking code will not work any better than the plan to keep Huawei out of the core. 5G will be a virtual network, in which components of the network are white-boxed, meaning that network administrators can upload patches for fixes and updates remotely. Think of 5G as something akin to your phone. When an app on your phone is updated, that is because someone in Silicon Valley pushed a button, sending updated code – a patch – to all phones with that app.Sir Andrew Parker has sought to downplay the threat of Huawei to British interestsAs one US cyber official recently stated, it’s what makes 5G so attractive to network administrators – site visits become increasingly unnecessary as more repairs to the network infrastructure can be done remotely. It also gives network administrators the ability to move functionality – including the intelligent bits – around the network to fit requirements.But it is this flexibility that makes the trustworthiness of telecoms vendors so important when it comes to 5G. In a virtual network, an untrustworthy vendor can send the good as well as the bad.In order to stop such malware, the NCSC would have to watch hundreds of thousands of antennae and components across an entire national network. As with terrorism, we’d have to be lucky every time, but a cyber hacker would have to be lucky only once.The report continues that they can only give “limited assurance that the long-term security risks can be managed in the Huawei equipment currently deployed in the UK”. Imagine if they were discussing airline safety instead of just critical national infrastructure.Even more damning was a report by Finite State – a private tech consultancy – that sought to replicate HCSEC’s review of Huawei source code. However, instead of using code provided by Huawei, it used code found in Huawei products already on the market. Alarmingly, not only did it find significantly more vulnerabilities than other brands, it found efforts to disguise those vulnerabilities. This past year, Chinese diplomats have threatened economic retaliation against Germany and Denmark if they exclude Huawei in their 5G networks. One wonders what type of pressure Beijing has exerted on the UK behind the scenes. Certainly, Liu Xiaoming, China\u0027s Ambassador, has already openly said that future investment could be at risk.However, Britain does not and should not do business at gunpoint. Before this Government makes a very costly mistake, it must thoroughly explain its technical mitigation measures, both to the public, and to its allies.Anything less smacks of bowing to Chinese pressure. And that’s something we can’t mitigate against.Dr John Hemmings is an associate fellow of the Henry Jackson Society and an associate professor at the Daniel K Inouye Asia Pacific Center for Security Studies.

Parliament will convene again on February 20 but it could take months to form a new government.Opinion polls suggest that the next administration will either be a Fianna Fail or Fine Gael led coalition. Both parties, which are pro-EU with centrist economic policies, have ruled out any form of alliance with Sinn Fein after the election.Fine Gael’s main appeal is its handling of Brexit negotiations and the economy. Ireland has had the highest growth rate of any EU member state for the past four years, but the country is experiencing a chronic shortage of housing and chaos in the health sector.Opinion polls suggest that the next administration will either be a Fianna Fail or Fine Gael led coalitionFine Gael has been in office since February 2011. On that occasion it came close to an overall majority as voters blamed Fianna Fail for the economic crisis that forced the country into an EU-IMF bailout programme in November 2010.Fine Gael lost one-third of its vote in the February 2016 general election but was still able to form a minority government will the help of a number of independent MPs.The political landscape is more fragmented than at anytime in the history of the state, which makes it more difficult to form a government. There are ten political parties and groupings in parliament as well as a number of independents.There has been cross party consensus on the government’s position on Brexit talks, so it is unlikely that a new administration will stray from the strategy adopted since 2016.Brexit latest news: Boris Johnson calls on public to crowdfund Big Ben bongs for BrexitComment: Why Britain\u0026#39s spooks are wrong to downplay the risks of HuaweiComment: Why are the authorities so embarrassed about celebrating Brexit Night?

Canberra recently surpassed an Air Quality Index of 4,500 – and anything over 200 is considered hazardous.The smoke is expected to make at least one full circuit around the globe, Nasa, the US space agency, said.Once in the stratosphere, the smoke can travel thousands of miles from its source, affecting atmospheric conditions globally, it added.On Monday night Melbourne’s air quality was the worst in the world, according to Victoria\u0027s Chief Health Officer, Brett Sutton.More than 100 fires were still burning across Australia on Tuesday, with a number of towns and cities shrouded in smoke, but the prospect of coming rain offers a glimmer of hope.Knitted joey pouches and Koala detection dogs: the struggle to save Australia\u0026#039s wildlife from bushfires, in picturesThe Bureau of Meteorology forecasts rain, possibly ranging from 30 to 80mm, across the east of Australia between Thursday and Sunday. Mark Williams, superintendent at the New South Wales Rural Fire Service’s Shoalhaven Fire Control Centre, told The  last week that tropical storms in Australia’s north offered the prospect of rain in the south east of the country. “A cyclone has hit the north of Australia, that could push humidity into central Australia then flow on to us,” he said. “There is no end in sight (for the fire crisis) in the absence of significant rain.” The heavy rain will most likely fall in the mountain ranges, with isolated daily totals in excess of 50mm per day possible in some pockets.While a welcome respite from hot and dry weather, it is unlikely that enough rain will reach the fire zones to end the long-running crisis.Light rain would do little to stop the huge blazes, but would make it impossible to conduct controlled burns to reduce fuel loads in strategic areas. It could also, as was the case last week, make it difficult for fire fighters to manoeuvre heavy equipment.Helicopters have been loaded with carrots and sweet potato for a food drop to help wildlife Early on Monday, however, the NSW Rural Fire Service expressed some optimism, tweeting that if the forecasts come “to fruition… this will be all of our Christmas, birthday, engagement, anniversary, wedding and graduation presents rolled into one”. More than 11 million hectares has been lost to the blazes this fire season, coming after the hottest and driest calendar year on record in Australia. A recent inquiry by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation found that of the land burnt through in New South Wales this season, only about one per cent can be officially attributed to arson. In Victoria, where more than 1.25 million hectares has burned, only 385 hectares - or 0.03 per cent - have been attributed to suspicious circumstances.Cooler temperatures forecast for the next seven days will bring some reprieve to firefighters in NSW following weeks of emergency level bushfiresThe fire crisis has inspired tens of thousands of people to volunteer for bush fire fighting service. The New South Wales RFS reported 25,000 people applying to join since November, more than five times the usual number for this time of year. The Victorian and South Australian fire services reported big spikes in applications as well.Also, since 2 January, the Tradies for Fire Affected Communities group on Facebook has recruited more than 9,000 members who are tradespeople offering to work for free on fire recovery and reconstruction projects.And a bushfire relief concert featuring Alice Cooper, Queen, Olivia Newton-John and many other artists has sold out within 24 hours.More than 70,000 people are expected to attend the benefit concert in Sydney next month.Organisers of the Fire Fight Australia concert said the response is a “heart-warming display of unity and solidarity during times of national hardship”.Brexit latest news: Boris Johnson calls on public to crowdfund Big Ben bongs for BrexitComment: Why Britain\u0026#39s spooks are wrong to downplay the risks of HuaweiComment: Why are the authorities so embarrassed about celebrating Brexit Night?

At worst, I’ll end up with a broken leg and a wardrobe full of Lycra’, says Will KirbyOut-and-out epiphanies are rare occurrences, but as I stood with my face deeply embedded in the armpit of a complete stranger in the early hours of the morning for the third time that week, I had the strangest feeling that I was, in fact, done with commuting on the Tube.There were other signs of course – like being kneecapped by the men in suits desperate to get onto the train before anyone has got off, or the passive-aggressive call to ‘move down please!’ at every stop as I consider how I could possibly make all 6ft of myself any smaller to allow for more space, or the unrecognisable smells that could honestly be anything from last night’s takeaway to this morning’s missed shower, or being late because of another series of red signals, or the 37 suitcases I had to negotiate because someone’s decided to move house, or looking at my bank balance and realising these joys are costing me more than £40 a week. I don’t know. But whatever it was, I realised then and there that I needed to find another way to get to work.\u0026nbspSo I did some investigating. A commute can make or break your day so it’s important to get it right. Walking was an option (healthy, free) but would have taken almost two hours each way, which would mean spending more than 12 hours a day either going from, to, or being at the office. I could jog, but, sadly, I hate jogging. The bus is doable, and a cheaper option than the Tube, but would involve three separate buses that aren’t very reliable. Which leaves me with one option. The bike.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSeven things no-one tells you when you start cycling to workInitially I wasn’t sure whether I wanted to join the fluorescent, Lyrca-clad hordes that zoom around the capital at breakneck speeds. I’d never really ridden a road bike before, let alone had an argument with a car or a bus about who’s on whose side of the road. How was I going to fit in if I’d never even owned a pair of mirrored sunglasses and didn’t really know what Strava was?! But it didn’t take long to realise that there are some massive benefits that outweigh any nerves or doubts about taking to the road on two wheels.Firstly, it’s healthy. Even a short cycle at the start and end of the day is exercise you probably wouldn’t otherwise have done, and it makes so much more sense to combine your fitness with your commute rather than trying to carve a slice out of your day to go to the gym. It also makes you feel good – if you take a look around the office first thing in the morning, it’s easy to spot the bright faces who’ve biked into work in amongst those who spent at least part of their morning under the ground.\u0026nbspIt is also better for the environment. Public transport, for its many faults (see above), is certainly greener than driving myself to work every morning, but there’s only so long you can tell yourself it doesn’t have a carbon footprint. Transport for London uses more electricity than anything else in the city, consuming enough power to fuel around 360,000 homes each year. By ditching my Oyster, I can hopefully shed with it that last ounce of green guilt.\u0026nbspWhy I\u0027ve pledged to go flight-free for a yearWhy I\u0027m going vegan for 2020This year I pledge to buy local and eat with the seasonsAnd I may as well do what I can to reduce pollution in the city where I live, even if it is on an inidual scale. A recent study found the capital’s poor air quality leads to around 1,000 hospital admissions for asthma and serious lung conditions every year, and another revealed that around four Londoners are hospitalised every day due to asthma caused by air pollution. Breathing London air is like smoking 160 cigarettes a year, according to the British Heart Foundation, and when you then consider that pollution on the Tube is around 15 times worse than above ground, it’s got to be a good idea to spend as little time down there as you can.\u0026nbspThe combination of a bit of light exercise and avoiding the toxic fumes that swirl around beneath the capital also reduces the chance of a heart attack and other cardiovascular diseases. In fact, if the same number of trips were made by bike as they are in Denmark (26 per cent of all trips that are less than 5km), it could save the NHS a staggering £17 billion within 20 years.So, I’m going to give it a go. At best, I’ll get fit, rediscover a long-lost hobby and do my bit to tackle the growing climate crisis. At worst, I’ll end up with a broken leg and a wardrobe full of Lycra.

Can Jessica Jones go a whole year without using anything else?In 2020 I will be pledging to become more conscious of the products I purchase and how they are sourced. Like most of us, I am guilty of buying unsustainable products: I use a lot of toiletries and cosmetic products like perfume, makeup and hair serums. I will try to choose products that are made purely from natural ingredients, and ones which have certifications to support their “natural beauty” claims. Using natural ingredients is crucial in preventing toxic chemicals found in beauty and care products, some of them carcinogenic, from seeping into our environment’s ecosystems and into our bodies.The beauty and personal care industry\u0026nbsphas had immense impacts on the environment but recently, with increased awareness of the issues, measures have been taken to combat these. For example, in June 2018, the UK government’s ban on microbeads came into effect and a ban on cotton buds is set to follow in April 2020.\u0026nbsp11 best plastic-free beauty products that aren\u0027t adding to landfillSharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhilst this is a good start, it is not enough. Microbeads are one small part of a much larger issue: the excessive consumerism of beauty and personal care products leading to vast amounts of wastage and toxic pollution. Other damages include plastic packaging with limited recyclability, the carbon footprint of transporting cosmetic goods, harmful toxins in products that are washed down the drain into marine environments, the water wastage in manufacturing processes, and the use of palm oil.\u0026nbspI want to buy from brands that produce sustainably from the offset, in both interior content as well as their packaging. Companies like Wearth sell glass large glass bottles to dispense bulk-bought or homemade shampoo and conditioner and LUSH offer zero-impact packaging products like shampoo bars which claim\u0026nbspto reduce your carbon footprint: one lorry load of shampoo bars delivers the same amount of hair washes as fifteen lorries of liquid shampoo. I will try to ensure that any plastic or material packaging that I do buy is fully recyclable.Created with Sketch.

I have only recently started to consider what is really in the products I buy and how they affect the environment. I am not used to reading ingredient lists, let alone understanding what most of the chemicals actually are. Finding affordable alternatives (on a student budget!) that do not sacrifice sustainability or quality might prove difficult, especially as there are certain products that I use daily that I love. But homemade alternatives to products like body and lip scrubs, are a good way of saving money, whilst also using more simple and natural ingredients.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHIt was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearThe price of bitcoin is notoriously volatile, making it difficult to attribute specific events or reasons to market movements.But the volatility, combined with a lack of mainstream applications, means bitcoin is consistently referred to as digital gold because it is more commonly used\u0026nbspas a store of value than a currency.Bitcoin is digital gold, explained\u0026nbspBrooke Stoddard, an investor and former Goldman Sachs associate. Bitcoin and gold are borderless, decentralised, and verifiable. Both are worth something, they store value. But bitcoin is easier to transfer, ide, and harder to counterfeit.Bitcoin\u0027s price is therefore often compared with that of gold, though research suggests the two are not linked.Bitcoin has risen by more than 20 per cent since the start of 2020, however it fell by nearly a third between October and November last year during a time of similar uncertainty when the Trump administration was ramping up sanctions on China and the UK\u0027s future in the UK was unclear.Why bitcoin\u0027s bumpy revolution is only just beginningCryptocurrency trader and author Glen Goodman rejected any relation between bitcoin\u0027s price and the US assassination of\u0026nbspSoleimani, or the subsequent Iranian missile strikes on US military bases in Iraq.Bitcoin was already in a strong uptrend before the missiles hit, Mr Goodman wrote on Twitter following the attacks.\u0026nbspGold rose and stocks fell initially, but traders soon relaxed, so stocks recovered and gold fell. Bitcoin stayed high because its rise is not Iran-related.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The portrait\u0027s small size – it measures 77 x 53 cm – can still be a surprise to those jostling for a glimpse of it, but it is the earliest Italian portrait to focus so closely on the sitter in a half-length portrait.230 Johannes Vermeer\u0027s Girl with a Pearl Earring (c.1665) at the Mauritshuis in The HagueAs she looks around with her slightly parted lips, you can’t help but wonder what this painting\u0027s sitter is about to say. There is an almost photorealist quality to this painting of an anonymous girl with a pearl earring – immortalised by Scarlett Johannson in the 2003 film. Vermeer, the Dutch Golden Age painter, died impoverished – he only painted two or three paintings a year because he worked so slowly, and the world forgot about his work until it was rediscovered in the 19th century.330 Peter Doig\u0027s Blotter (1993)  at Walker Art Gallery, LiverpoolThere is something so tranquil and magical about  Doig\u0027s paintings. This purple-hued work from a family snapshot is of his brother standing on a frozen pond and looking down into the reflection. Images reflected in water are common in his work – as seen in White Canoe (1991) and Echo Lake (2000) – and function as “entrances to other worlds.430 Sandro Botticelli\u0027s The Birth of Venus (1485-1486) at the Uffizi Gallery, FlorenceThe Renaissance painting is the highlight of the Uffizi in Florence for good reason – it\u0027s a triumphant celebration of female beauty. Venus, with her long flowing hair, has been blown by the gentle breeze onto the shore of Cyprus and balances on a giant scallop shell. A young woman, thought to be Hora of spring or one of the graces, holds out a cloak covered in flowers.  530 Michelangelo\u0027s Sistine Chapel ceiling (1508) in Vatican CityThis breathtaking sequence of scenes from the Book of Genesis covers the ceiling of one of the chapels in the Vatican, and includes Michelangelo\u0027s best known fresco of the Creation of Adam. The Italian Renaissance painter was commissioned to paint it in 1508 by Pope Julius 11 – he even designed his own scaffold to paint up so high.630 Gustav Klimt\u0027s The Kiss (1907-1908) at the Österreichische Galerie Belvedere, ViennaNothing can be as irresistibly romantic as Klimt’s oil painting, which shimmers with gold leaf and depicts two lovers entwined in a loving embrace. Both wear patterned robes which reference the contemporary style of Art Nouveau and the earlier Arts and Crafts movement. It is a departure from the artist’s usual portrayal of woman as the femme fatale.730 Claude Monet\u0027s Impression, Sunrise (1872) at The Musée Marmottan Monet, ParisIt is easy to get lost for hours in the calmness of Monet’s hazy scene of the port of Le Havre, with a rising red sun casting shadows onto small boats. When it was first shown in a group show in Paris in 1874, the painting that gave Impressionism its name was criticised for looking unfinished.830 Hokurai\u0027s The Great Wave (1829-1832) at The British Museum, LondonThere is something seductively dangerous about this enormous, claw-like wave, that is about to break and engulf three fishing boats off Kanagawa in Japan. The woodblock print is the first in the Japanese artist’s series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji. It is one of the most famous Japanese artworks in the world. 930 Vincent van Gogh\u0027s The Starry Night (1889) at The Museum of Modern Art, New YorkVan Gogh painted this night sky from a view from his room at the Saint-Paul asylum in Saint-Remy, France, where he was admitted for mental illness after cutting off his own ear. With its intense swirling patterns, van Gogh manages to conjure up a whirling vista above a sleepy village, with the crescent moon, stars, Venus and orbs.The Museum of Modern Art1030 Rembrandt van Rijn\u0027s The Night Watch (1642) at Rijksmuseum, AmsterdamThis militia painting threw formality out of the window with its sense of movement and action. Rembrandt even painted himself hidden in the scene, which depicts Captain Banning Cocq and 17 members of his civic militia guards – all of whom commissioned the painting. Rembrandt puts a spotlight on the main characters with his trademark use of light and shadow, including a woman carrying a chicken.1130 Theodore Gericault\u0027s The Raft of the Medusa (1818-1819) at The Louvre, ParisThis lifesize painting, which measures about 16 feet by 23.5 feet, almost takes you with it on its doomed journey. The then-27-year-old Gericault drew inspiration from a real tragedy of men aboard a French naval frigate in 1816. Only 10 of the 150 men who boarded the raft lived. It is regarded as an icon of Romanticism for its emotive composition and interest in the natural world.1230 Tracey Emin\u0027s I Could Feel You (2014) at Tate Britain, LondonThe Young British Artist is better known for her installations such as My Bed (1998) but it is no surprise that her paintings also hint at being candidly autobiographical in her examination of the female body. This is one of six related works on paper, each with a sensual title (Just Waiting, Stay Up, All for You), which is painted in black gouache. 1330 Mt St Victoire, Cezanne (c.1895) at Princeton University Art Museum, New JerseyPost-Impressionist painter Cezanne, with his bold, flat use of colour, painted the mountains in southern France overlooking his hometown Aix-en-Provence many times. His new ways of depicting perspective by simplifying objects to planes and geometric shapes was a big influence on the later Cubists, especially Picasso, who called him “my only master”. Henry and Rose Pearlman Collection1430 Pablo Picasso\u0027s Les Demoiselles d\u0027Avignon (1907) at the Museum of Modern Art, New YorkPicasso used geometric forms to portray the female body in this striking painting of five nude sex workers in a brothel in Barcelona. His new style kick-started Cubism, a movement that he and Georges Braque invented and which resulted in abstract and fragmented paintings. 1530 Marcel Duchamp\u0027s The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even (1915-1923) at Philadelphia Museum of Art, PhiladelphiaDuchamp’s bizarre artwork, that he declared as “permanently unfinished”, is meant to evoke the erotic tension between the bride and the bachelors. Known as The Large Glass, as it is over nine feet, it comrpises two shattered glass panels suspended vertically, which contain a mechanical-like bride, a large shape that references the Milky Way, nine bachelors in geometric shapes and mechanical objects, all painted in oil to give it colour. 1630 Andy warhol\u0027s Campbell\u0027s Soup Cans (1962), Andy Warhol at the Museum of Modern Art, New YorkThis artwork, which consisted of 32 canvases, each painted with a Campbell soup can in different flavour, helped to introduce pop art as a major art movement in the US. It led to many more works depicting Campbell Soup cans over his career – ones with torn labels or opened lids, many being produced at The Factory, where studio assistants created them for him.  1730 Bosch\u0027s The Garden of Earthy Delights (1503-1515) at Museo del Prado, Madrid The central panel of this extraordinary triptych oil painting on oak panel shows a manic utopia of male and female nudes cavorting with wild abandon, often with animals. The left panel shows Christ blessing Eve before she is presented to Adam while the right panel illustrates Hell. It is likely this work, by the Danish artist Bosch, is a warning against lust. 1830 Jasper Johns\u0027s Flag (1954-1955) at the Museum of Modern Art, New YorkThe American artist dreamt he painted a large American flag and got on with it promptly the next morning. Now it is the painting for which he is best known, painted over strips of newspaper visible beneath the see-through paint, locating the painting in the McCarthy era and at the beginning of the Cold War. 1930 Damien Hirst\u0027s Anthraquinone-1-Diazonium Chloride (1994) at Tate Liverpool This famous example of a Spot Painting – rows of randomly coloured circles – was produced by Hirst’s assistants. The artist produced about 60 Spot Paintings a year from 1986 to 2011. For Hirst, who is reportedly now the UK\u0027s richest living artist, they were just “a way of pinning down the joy of colour”. 2030 Salvador Dal\u0027s The Persistence of Memory (1931) at the Museum of Modern Art, New YorkTime and space have a hallucinatory quality in this instantly recognisable surrealist painting of melting watches. The human face, visible on an abstract form, with its long eyelashes, represents Dali. This painting was fuelled by the artist\u0027s interest in the dream analysis of Sigmund Freud, and made him a star at the age of 28. 2130 Lucien Freud\u0027s Girl with a White Dog(1951) at Tate, LondonFreud was known for his psychologically complex figurative portraits, and this painting of his first wife Kitty Garman, who was pregnant at the time of the sitting, is no exception. The artist manages to reveal a multitude of emotions in the composition. He painted her many times during their short marriage, which ended in orce in 1952, due to his many infidelities. 2230 Edvard Munch\u0027s The Scream (1893) at The National Museum, Oslo from 2020This painting came about when Munch was overcome by fear and anxiety during a walk with two friends, and “the sky suddenly turned to red”. The location was in earshot of his sister’s lunatic asylum, but it is said to capture the universal anxiety of modern man. It is currently waiting to be rehoused in the new National Museum in Oslo.2330 John Henry Fuseli\u0027s The Nightmare  (1781) at Detroit Institute of Art, Michigan This sexually charged painting of a woman lying across a bed, as a demonic creature crouches on her chest, has been an icon of horror, ever since it was first exhibited at the annual RA exhibition in 1782. Is she having a nightmare? Is it referencing Fuseli’s own love life? Or is it about female desire?  The artwork created shock and intrigue in its day and made Fuseli famous. Detroit Institute of Arts2430 Bridget Riley\u0027s Nataraja (1993) at Tate Modern, London When Bridget Riley first created her black and white abstract paintings in the 1960s – known as op art – the images seemed to actually move. The brightly coloured diagonal stripes in this later painting, inspired by a trip to India, also creates a sense of movement. She created it on paper in gouache, before handing it over to her studio assistants, to transfer it onto canvas. 2530 Jackson Pollock\u0027s Autumn Rhythm (Number 30) (1950) at the politan Museum of Art, New YorkPollock had already created his first drip painting in 1947, sending shockwaves through the art world. The technique, which involved painting on a canvas laid flat on the floor and pouring, dripping, even splattering paint onto it – with a degree of control – is at its peak in Autumn Rhythm, which is evocative of nature. He died in a car crash aged 44 in 1956. 2630 Édouard Manet\u0027s Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe (1862) at the Musee d’Orsay, ParisThis painting caused a scandal when it was first exhibited in Paris in 1863. The scene of a naked woman having a picnic with two fully clothed men is still jarring. But in Manet’s day, female nudes usually represented figures from mythology, like goddesses. This painting, which places the nude in an everyday setting, was a departure point for Modern Art as Manet refused to toe the line.2730 Frida Kahlo\u0027s Self-Portrait with Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird (1940) at Harry Ransom Center, University of Texas, AustinThe Mexican surrealist artist found painting self-portraits therapeutic. This one reveals her suffering her long lasting pain after a bus accident her infertility her orce from artist Diego Rivera and the end of her affair with photographer Nikolas Muray. Bursting with symbolism from Mexican folklore, it is a jigsaw puzzle of meaning. 2830 Diego Velázquez\u0027s Las Meninas (1656) at Museo Nacional del Prado, Madrid, SpainThe leading artist of the Spanish Golden Age captures himself working on a large canvas in this realistic portrayal of the Spanish court, where he was court painter. The young princess Infanta Margarita Theresa is surrounded by servants, while her parents King Philip 1V of Spain and Mariana of Austria, watch the scene from a doorway. It holds plenty of mystery as to the relationship between the viewer and the characters depicted. For example, does the mirror reflect the hidden picture on the easel? 2930 Henri Matisse\u0027s Conversation (1908-1912) at the State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg What are they talking about? It looks serious. Matisse’s oil painting depicts the artist and his wife Amelie in conversation against an intense sapphire blue colour. Matisse wears striped pyjamas, which were fashionable as leisurewear in 20th century France. It was painted in his country house, and there is a tension in the way his wife sits – understandable, given that he reportedly once told her that he loved painting more than her.3030 Sir John Everett Millais\u0027s Ophelia (1851-1852) at Tate Britain, LondonA drowning Ophelia from Shakespeare’s Hamlet is slowly sinking into the stream. The Pre-Raphaelite artist recreated, with breathtaking attention to detail, the consequence of Hamlet’s murder of her father. His 19-year old model, Lizzie Siddal, nearly died of a cold from lying in a bath fully clothed for hours, long after oil lamps used to keep the bath water warm went out. The artist did not notice but ended up paying her doctor’s bills.130 Leonardo da Vinci\u0027s Mona Lisa (c.1503) at The Louvre, ParisIt\u0027s the mysteriously serene smile of this painting\u0027s subject – thought to be Lisa Gherardini, the wife of a Florentine fabric merchant – that has given it universal fame.

It was painted in his country house, and there is a tension in the way his wife sits – understandable, given that he reportedly once told her that he loved painting more than her.3030 Sir John Everett Millais\u0027s Ophelia (1851-1852) at Tate Britain, LondonA drowning Ophelia from Shakespeare’s Hamlet is slowly sinking into the stream. The Pre-Raphaelite artist recreated, with breathtaking attention to detail, the consequence of Hamlet’s murder of her father. His 19-year old model, Lizzie Siddal, nearly died of a cold from lying in a bath fully clothed for hours, long after oil lamps used to keep the bath water warm went out. The artist did not notice but ended up paying her doctor’s bills.Spears donated her most recognisable paintings, of flowers and swirls in pastel colours, to a Las Vegas charity auction in 2017, where it was sold for $10,000 (£7,708).\u0026nbspSpears apparently said of her work at the time: “The flowers in my painting represent a new beginning, and it’s in that spirit that we move forward.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

When the chain announced that it was on the brink of falling over in the absence of a buyer or an investor, the natural reaction was to dial up a certain Queen song.\u0026nbspYou can probably already hear that thumping baseline and Freddie Mercury intoning “another one bites the dust” in your head. If the ear worm is with you for the rest of the day, my apologies.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe reports of the retailer’s troubles dovetail with some research from Colliers International, a real estate adviser that’s been keeping an eye on Company Voluntary Arrangements (CVAs), a form of bankruptcy that’s proved quite popular with retailers.\u0026nbspThey’ve been used as a means of addressing some of the problems Beales boss Tony Brown identified on the BBC’s Today programme: high rents and the need to close unprofitable stores on long leases to cope with a trading environment mired in an ice age.\u0026nbspBoost for retailers as Carney hints at interest rate cutMost adults think retailers use too much packaging, poll claimsPrimark and Boohoo CEOs top most powerful people in fashion listCreditors, including landlords, are typically presented with a restructuring proposal that includes the closure of some stores together with reduced rents at those that remain. If a majority agree - 75 per cent is required - the minority has to lump it.\u0026nbspThese tend to be a lot harder on smaller landlords, often in the sort of places that Beales calls home, than the big ones that dominate the prime locations in big cities. They are also highly controversial in the property businesses.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspColliers added fuel to that fire. It found that out of 23 retailers that underwent a CVA from 2016 onwards, 13 of them went on to fail. They\u0026nbspended up in administration with the CVA thus serving as little more than “sticking plaster” that delayed the inevitable.\u0026nbspThe problem for landlords is that every time a client forces a rent reduction through a CVA, their other clients start queueing up to demand the same thing, some threatening CVAs of their own.\u0026nbspThere is a more optimistic way of looking at Colliers’ figures. It is that ten businesses came out the other side.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is critical for long-term growth. If current political and economic uncertainties ease, we could see a gradual revival in activity over the course of the year.”Official figures released on Monday showed that the UK economy shrank unexpectedly by 0.3 per cent in November. However, the downbeat message of the Stenn survey runs counter to the consensus in the City of London, which last month\u0026nbsppredicted that on average the UK economy would grow by an anaemic 1.1 per cent in 2020.There was further downbeat news on the UK economy from the retail analysts Springboard, which said there was a 2.5 per cent drop in visitors to Britain’s high streets and shopping centres in December compared with a year earlier.Diane\u0026nbspWehrle, Springboard’s marketing and insights director, said: “The reasons why this occurred are varied but reflect the caution and spending restraint of consumers which typifies low consumer confidence that has been ongoing for the last three years.”She pointed out that the timing of Black Friday and Cyber Monday brought festive trading forward, leading to a noticeable decline in footfall over the two weeks leading up to Christmas.Last week saw a string of downbeat trading updates from major retailers including Marks \u0026amp Spencer, John Lewis and Superdry. Official figures on Friday will show whether retail sales recorded a second successive monthly fall.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Guðnadóttir recently picked up a Golden Globe, Critics’ Choice Award, Emmy, and a Society of Composers \u0026amp Lyricist award for her work on Joker and the acclaimed HBO series Chernobyl.In an interview with Deadline, the composer mused on the impact of her nomination:\u0026nbsp“I think it’s magnificent to be able to be a part of this conversation, and to shed some light on the situation of women in the industry, especially in this category, because it’s a little bit silly how few there are.”\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesCreated with Sketch. Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Before Garden State and 500 Days of Summer, the team behind the adaptation of Nick Hornby’s novel compiled 15 tracks like a mixtape. It was one its lead character would have approved of: as with many of the soundtracks on this list, High Fidelity’s success lies in a balance between old-school gems by the Velvet Underground, The Kinks and Elvis Costello to Noughties newcomers like Stereolab and Royal Trux.This may seem like sacrilege given that the first Dirty Dancing soundtrack is indisputably the more iconic of the two. And yes, the sequel (essentially a remake set in Cuba during the 1950s), starring Romola Garai and future Rogue One star Diego Luna, suffered from a plot loaded with clichés and lack of chemistry between its two lead actors. But the soundtrack – featuring the Grammy-nominated Latin fusion band Yerba Buena, Colombian rock band Aterciopelados, and the Cuban hip hop group Orishasis – is what draws me back to this guilty pleasure of a film. Dirty Dancing 2 didn’t really deserve such a soundtrack, but it adds some actual heat to a film that, asides from the superb dance routines, leaves you cold.Martin Scorsese had strict rules for the soundtrack to his film Goodfellas: each song had to have been around during the time in which the scene was set, and the tracks had to make some kind of comment on the scene or character in question “in an oblique way”. A staggering 48 songs are heard during the film, including classics by Dean Martin, Fred Astaire and The Drifters, Sid Vicious, The Who and The Rolling Stones. One of the most unforgettable moments is when Bobby Darin’s “Beyond the Sea” plays as the Wise Guys cook dinner, which was “always a big thing” in prison.When it comes to soundtracking your movie, it helps if the director is a massive music nerd. Of course, music was always going to play a huge part in a film about a boy in a band and his video game quest to win the girl of his dreams. But Edgar Wright, a former music video director, found a way to seamlessly integrate his soundtrack into Scott Pilgrim vs the World’s narrative. Beck, who wrote the music for Scott Pilgrim’s garage band Sex Bob-omb, was a perfect match for their chaotic, DIY approach, while Metric’s song “Black Sheep” was used for a performance by ex-girlfriend Envy Adams’s (Brie Larson) band The Clash at Demonhead.Drive wouldn’t have worked as well as it did without the soundtrack. Steven Soderbergh\u0027s go-to composer Cliff Martinez assembled the songs for Nicolas Winding Refn’s ambitious indie project, showing an understanding that the most effective soundtracks are often the ones that transport you into the movie without you realising. By using a set of mostly female vocalists, all of whom sing over dry electronic beats, Martinez achieved a sonic portrayal of Drive’s startling juxtaposition between beauty and violence.It’s the biggest movie soundtrack of all time and the 15th best-selling album in the US. Whitney Houston breathed new life into songs by Dolly Parton (“I Will Always Love You”) and Chaka Khan (“I’m Every Woman”). Five of the songs performed by Houston were hits: I Will Always Love You, I\u0027m Every Woman, I Have Nothing, Run to You (both Oscar-nominated), and Queen of the NightYes, it was the Fab Four\u0027s worst film, but the soundtrack is packed with some of their best songs: “I am the Walrus”, She Loves You and “Hello, Goodbye”. Where A Hard Day’s Night, Yellow Submarine and Help were undoubtedly more influential on popular culture, Magical Mystery Tour is the most fun to listen to – regardless of how much effort is required to watch.Few films offer as comprehensive a look at hip-hop stars during the heights of their creative powers – even though the movie itself was a clumsily written crime drama. Belly’s soundtrack captured the East Coast rap scene as it stepped towards a grittier sound and underwent one of the most important transitions for any genre in music history – with contributions from the likes of D’Angelo, members of the Wu-Tang Clan, Nas and Jay-Z.At the time, it felt like Richard Kelly’s dark and gloomy film starring a young Jake Gyllenhaal was one of the few to truly capture what it meant to be a confused, alienated teenager. With composer Michael Andrews, Kelly picked some the best songs from an era that dealt in existential angst via upbeat synth-pop: Echo and the Bunnymen, Duran Duran, Tears for Fears, The Pet Shop Boys and more. By choosing to close the film on Michael Andrews’ cover of Tears for Fears’ “Mad World”, Kelly underpins both the self-absorbed attitude of teenagers convinced that only the artists singing these songs truly understood them, and the nostalgia felt by their parents who were there in the moment.Midnight Cowboy – the first X-rated film to win the Oscar for Best Picture – took original material and pre-existing songs to complement the theme of a naïve cowboywannabe sex worker trying to survive in a big city, and the juxtaposition between Jon Voight’s character Joe Buck and dying con artist “Ratso” (Dustin Hoffman). Fred Neil\u0027s song “Everybody\u0027s Talkin\u0027”, which underscores the first act, won the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Vocal Performance, Male (for Harry Nilsson).Trent Reznor’s work on David Lynch’s 1997 neo-noir movie is loaded with stark electronics and instrumentals by Angelo Badalamenti. In between, you have Smashing Pumpkins, Nine Inch Nails and, of course, This Mortal Coil’s “Song to the Siren” – a track that caught Lynch’s attention and inspired him to co-write two albums for Twin Peaks chanteuse Julee Cruise.1240 29. The Last Days of Disco (1998)Whit Stillman’s 1998 indie-classic starred then-virtual unknowns Kate Beckinsale and Chloë Sevigny as friends and roommates in early-Eighties New York. Add that to a wall-to-wall disco soundtrack and you’ve got an intoxicating film, set 20 years after the genre’s heyday, with classic dancefloor anthems from Chic, Diana Ross, and Sister Sledge belted out one after the other.  In the summer of 1992, the soundtrack to a film that flopped at the box office offered the masses the gateway they needed into the Seattle grunge scene. Cameron Crowe wanted the Singles soundtrack to be “more like a simple mixtape of Seattle’s finest”, and ended up with a veritable who’s-who of every important band from that moment in music history: Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, Smashing Pumpkins, Soundgarden and Mudhoney… everyone apart from Nirvana. Regardless, almost three decades after the film’s release, the soundtrack serves as a landmark for one of the most pivotal moments in music history.Adapting literary classics to modern-day high-school scenarios was the big thing in the Nineties. Cruel Intentions came from Pierre Choderlos de Laclos’s 18th-century work, Les Liaisons Dangereuses, and starred Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe as Kathryn and Sebastian: two spoilt, bored rich kids toying with the naïve and virtuous Annette (Reese Witherspoon). John Ottman was originally enlisted to compose the score, but producers decided that wouldn’t sit well with the teenage demographic it was going for and instead plumped for a soundtrack of Placebo, Blur, Skunk Anansie, Aimee Mann and Counting Crows. This mix of credible and corny mirrors a typical experience we go through as adolescents, discovering iniduality via the music we listen to and trying to leave the theatrics behind. The cult status of both the featured music and the film itself suggests we can never let the drama go completely.Flashdance, the first collaboration between producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, is important because it actually changed how some of the most popular films of the Eighties were shot. For each song featured in the film there is a scene presented in the same way as a music video, like the use of “Maniac” as Alex (Jennifer Beals) trains for her dance audition, or the lead song of the film “What a Feeling”, which plays during the opening montage of the steel mill. The latter, written by Italian composer Giorgio Moroder, Keith Forsey and Irene Cara (who performed the track), became the singer’s first and only number one hit. It also won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, a Golden Globe, and a Grammy for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. Michael Sembello’s “Maniac”, meanwhile, went on to become one of the highest-grossing songs ever written for a film.While Half Nelson isn’t as highly regarded as Lars and the Real Girl or Drive,  it’s the one that helped Ryan Gosling break away from his status as the heartthrob from The Notebook. It also has a phenomenal soundtrack steered by Broken Social Scene, whose brilliant collection of B-sides proved indispensable for this film about a drug-addicted middle-school teacher struggling to deal with the aftermath of a breakup. In between those tracks you’ve got gritty hip hop that shows Dan\u0027s crossover into the world of his pupil, the stoic Drey (Shareeka Epps) – from New York collective Dujeous, to Rhymefest.1740 24. Lost in Translation (2003)Sofia Coppola has a history of needle drops that encapsulate certain moods that can’t be expressed through dialogue, particularly if it involves a medley of shoegaze from Air and My Bloody Valentine, and the full-throttle debauchery of Peaches on “Fuck the Pain Away”. The soundtrack was so influential that several critics suggested it had something to do with the rebirth of shoegaze in the mid-Noughties. Either way, there a few better songs to close a film than Jesus and Mary Chain’s “Just Like Honey”, that plays just after the kiss goodbye between Bob (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) and that indecipherable whisper.Former Massive Attack producer Nellee Hooper is the brainchild behind one of the greatest film soundtracks of all time. Working with composers Craig Armstrong and Marius de Vries, he beta-tested many of the tracks that ended up on the album by playing them at 5am to afterparty guests at his house in London. Others took direct inspiration from Shakespeare’s original text, with Justin Warfield of One Inch Punch and Art Alexakis of Everclear both allowed to watch early edits of scenes from the film to inspire them. Like the soundtracks for Kill Bill, Trainspotting and Marie Antoinette, it’s the vast eclecticism of the songs featured in Romeo + Juliet that make you remember each one, and the scene where each is used, for years after first seeing the film.As well as making a star of reggae singer Jimmy Cliff, both the film and soundtrack for The Harder They Come exposed mainstream audiences to the emerging Kingston recording industry, helping bring the genre to the US and beyond. Only the title track was an original recorded by Cliff for the movie the rest were singles released in Jamaica between 1967 and 1972, including Cliff’s superb “You Can Get it if You Really Want”, plus songs from seminal artists like Toots and the Maytals and Desmond Dekker.A veritable masterpiece: The Beach soundtrack is what gives this film starring a fresh-faced Leonardo DiCaprio its vitality, capturing the essence of the trance music heard during Thai beach parties during the Nineties. It was supervised by Pete Tong, who said the songs, including Moby’s “Porcelain” and Dario G’s “Voices”, are what make the film “watchable time and time again”. The way the music progresses mirrors the grit and darkness that begin to emerge out of paradise.2140 20. Pretty in Pink (1986)John Hughes virtually pioneered the formula for teen movies soundtracked by angsty British post-punk rock. Echo \u0026amp the Bunnymen, The Smiths, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark and New Order all appeared on what is essentially Hughes’s checklist of what cool kids were – or should have been – listening to in the Eighties.    Curated and co-executive produced by Kendrick Lamar, the Black Panther soundtrack brought on a select group of extraordinary talent that would understand the themes in the film, from Anderson .Paak to Earl Sweatshirt. Leading this group is Lamar himself, undoubtedly the best choice of artist for a film that explores responsibility, black power, family dynamics and loyalty. Where Jay-Z failed to step aside on the Great Gatsby soundtrack and let other artists do their thing, Lamar is more interested in highlighting the skills of his fellow artists, like South African singer Babes Wodumo, or Jorja Smith. It’s true that the Black Panther album pales in comparison to some of Lamar’s solo work, but it’s rare to see a soundtrack that so deeply considers the subject matter it has been presented with, and the responsibility of continuing the story through music.2340 18. Dazed and Confused (1993)Dazed and Confused was relatable even if you didn’t happen to spend your teenage years riding shotgun in a 1975 Chevy El Camino. This is largely due to director Richard Linklater highlighting an era of raucous butt-rock anthems and stoner jams, from Alice Cooper’s “School’s Out” to Ted Nugent’s “Stranglehold”.In a year that was saturated with serious historical and period dramas, from a remake of Jane Eyre to The Queen, Marie Antoinette stood out for its highly stylised and fun approach to a well-known figure. Director Sofia Coppola took a similar approach with the music as James Gunn did for s of the Galaxy, mixing new wave and post-punk – including The Strokes, New Order, Adam and the Ants and The Cure – with period music by Baroque composers Vivaldi and Couperin. By doing so, Coppola gave her audience something to relate to, and a soundtrack that suited Marie Antoinette’s rebellious teenage spirit. The best example of this is in the shopping scene – set to the song “I Want Candy” by Bow Wow Wow – that famously included a pair of purple Converse: one of the most defining fashion items of Nineties teen culture. It is a brilliant yet subtle alignment of modern Western consumerism and the outrageous decadence at Versailles during the 18th century.One of the most eclectic compilations to grace cinema-goers’ ears in recent years: the Call Me By Your Name soundtrack wins for those three songs by Sufjan Stevens alone. The American singer-songwriter remixed his 2010 track “Futile Devices” and also wrote two new songs specifically for the film: “Visions of Gideon” and “Mystery of Love”, the latter of which was nominated for the Best Original Song Oscar. Director Luca Guadagnino worked with film editor Walter Fasano and music supervisor Robin Urdang, all understanding that music would play a “vital role”. He wanted the music to give the film a “precise identity” that would act as a “voice” in the movie, he told Billboard. “That’s when I thought of Sufjan Stevens.” Other tracks, like the buoyant “Love My Way” by The Psychedelic Furs, captured the wistful, heady nature of hot, endless summers in Italy during the Eighties.Of course, any biopic about the rise and fall of gangsta rap collective NWA had to have a killer soundtrack – especially if its former members were involved in its production. Even so, the meticulous care with which the soundtrack for Straight Outta Compton was assembled is impressive, and provides backdrop for an origin story about some of the most influential and important records – and artists – of the Eighties and Nineties.2740 14. 500 Days of Summer (2009)This offbeat romantic comedy has developed cult status over the years and stood out at the time for its original take on the “boy meets girl” genre. Music is what first drew characters Summer (Zoe Deschanel) and Tom (Joseph Gordon Levitt) together (they start talking after Summer overhears The Smiths playing on Tom’s MP3 player). Each song mirrors the various highs and lows the characters go through, helped by director Marc Webb’s background making music videos for indie pop artists. Regina Spektor’s song “Hero” is the perfect backdrop for the scene where Tom realises his hopes of getting back with Summer are futile the track closes on the lyric “no one’s got it all”, as if to point out that not everyone gets the fairytale ending they hope for.A veritable smorgasbord for any self-respecting music nerd: Baby Driver took movie soundtracks to a whole other plane. The Fault in Our Stars actor Ansel Elgort stars as “Baby”, a skilled getaway driver who relies on a steady stream of music in order to counteract the effects of tinnitus.There are vintage cuts from The Beach Boys, Beck and Barry White, and Seventies rock gems by Queen and Golden Earring. Yet it was the slightly more unassuming song “Bellbottoms” from the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion album Orange that initially inspired the film. A then 21-year-old Edgar Wright was sitting in his bedroom, “completely broke”, when he began to visualise a car chase set to the songs on that album.George Lucas managed to amplify the already-nostalgic mood on his “summer of ‘62” film by choosing songs from the mid-to-late Fifties as the lead tracks on the American Graffiti soundtrack. Songs from Buddy Holly and Chuck Berry to The Beach Boys are all presented by legendary disc jockey Wolfman Jack.3040 11. 10 Things I Hate About YouIf Pretty in Pink captured teenage angst in the Eighties, 10 Things I Hate About You achieved it for the decade that followed. Unlike many films of the Nineties, which attempted to capitalise on the major rock stars of the day, 10 Things managed to select what is essentially a list of one-hit wonders, from Letters to Cleo and Semisonic to Save Ferris. When you watch the film today, it only serves to fuel that feeling of nostalgia and add to its ever-growing cult status.3140 10. Do the Right Thing (1989)Spike Lee’s Brooklyn-based masterpiece is set to a breathtaking jazz score conducted and composed by his father, Bill Lee. It’s also punctuated by summer jams and blissful ballads, or the urgent demands of Public Enemy’s “Fight the Power”, which is played from Radio Raheem’s boombox a number of times through the film.Until Eden, there was no film about club culture that took the scene seriously. French filmmaker Mia Hansen-Love’s character Paul (Felix de Givry) is based on the experiences of her brother Sven – a relatively popular DJ who had to look on as his peers, including Daft Punk, achieved global fame by pioneering the early EDM scene. Its soundtrack offers a comprehensive look at the house, jungle and garage music that was the lifeblood of Paris youth culture in the Nineties, but is also carefully chosen to match the situation of the film’s characters. Daft Punk’s “Veridis Quo” signals a mood-change at a celebratory dinner, while “Happy Song” by Charles Dockins conveys Paul’s euphoria as his hero Tony Humphries works the decks in a New York club.  This was one of the first films to be defined by its music Mike Nichols also helped pioneer the practice of curating pre-existing songs that would appeal to a pop radio audience. Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel’s music was the perfect fit when it came to music that would show Dustin Hoffman’s character’s intensifying feelings of isolation, particular whenever “The Sounds of Silence” was used.This was one of the first films to also be defined by its music Mike Nichols also helped pioneer the practice of curating pre-existing songs that would appeal to a pop radio audience. Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel’s music was the perfect fit when it came to music that would show Dustin Hoffman’s character’s intensifying feelings of isolation, particular whenever “The Sounds of Silence” was used.Curtis Mayfield’s third studio album was released as the soundtrack to the Blaxploitation film of the same name. It was groundbreaking for its themes of poverty and drug abuse which made the record stand out among the less socially aware music of its time. It would go on to influence everyone from TV score composers to soul singers in the decades that followed.3540 6. s of the Galaxy (2014)The soundtrack for Danny Boyle’s adaptation of Irvine Welsh’s novel was so popular it promoted a release of a second soundtrack a year later, in 1997. After two decades, it still holds up as one of the greatest and most lovingly curated collections of songs in music history. The use of “Lust for Life” in the opening scene triggered something of a career renaissance for Iggy Pop (one that many would argue didn’t do him many favours). There’s a romanticised overdose set to Lou Reed’s “Perfect Day”, and Heaven 17 soundtrack a club scene with “Temptation”. A particularly disgusting toilet scene is set to Brian Eno’s “Deep Blue Day” and French composer Georges Bizet’s “Carmen Suite No.2”.Quentin Tarantino didn’t commission a traditional film score for what is arguably his most adored film, 1994’s Pulp Fiction. Instead, he mixed American surf music and classic rock and roll, including the late Dick Dale’s “Misirlou” in the iconic opening scene. The track was suggested to Tarantino by musician Boyd Rice, via their mutual friend Allison Anders. The soundtrack had such an impact – reaching number 21 on the Billboard 200 and selling more than two million units by 1996 – that it was credited with “reinvigorating” surf rock and sparking a trend by advertisers to use it in their commercials, “to help sell everything from burritos to toothpaste”. Chuck Berry’s song “You Never Can Tell”, also known as “C’est la Vie”, also enjoyed a resurgence in popularity thanks to its use in the famous dance scene with Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) and Vincent Vega (John Travolta). Neither Cameron Crowe nor his music coordinator Danny Bramson wanted to pander to the charts for this story based on the director’s years as a teenage rock journalist. If anything, they avoided tracks that seemed like potential radio favourites, choosing lesser-known songs like “Sparks” from The Who’s album Tommy as the theme for Crowe’s alter-ego William Miller. The music is essentially a whole other character – a narrator who offers running commentary on the scenarios the others find themselves in. And there are few scenes more uplifting than the one in Almost Famous where, having retrieved guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup) from a drugs and alcohol-fuelled party, the fictional band Stillwater and their crew take up a rowdy singalong to Elton John’s “Tiny Dancer”.Prince\u0027s acting debut took place in a film that also produced one of his greatest works. The concept for the plot, about a talented but tortured frontman of a band in Minneapolis, was developed by Prince during his 1999 tour. Purple Rain was one of the 10 highest-grossing films of 1984 and shows Prince as his best and most outrageous self. Yet the songs also provided a window through the Purple One\u0027s enigmatic facade, to reveal the soul beneath.The Wu-Tang Clan’s RZA worked with director Quentin Tarantino on the collection of music that would accompany Uma Thurman’s character The Bride on her bloody quest for revenge. What is particularly brilliant is the alternation between non-diegetic sound and the silence that precedes and lasts during some of the most tense action sequences. When it comes to the most crucial battle between O-Ren Ishii and The Bride at the end of the film, they first chose the disco flamenco intro from Santa Esmeralda\u0027s Latin arrangement of “Don’t Let Me Be Misunderstood”. At the gory conclusion, where O-Ren falls, RZA and Tarantino used Meiko Kaji’s “The Flower of Carnage”. The song was first used in the 1973 martial arts film Lady Snowblood, in which Kaji starred. She sings: “I’m a woman who walks at the brink of life and death Who emptied my tears many moons ago” and then: “I’ve immersed my body in the river of vengeance.” It\u0027s as though the song was written with The Bride in mind.Before Garden State and 500 Days of Summer, the team behind the adaptation of Nick Hornby’s novel compiled 15 tracks like a mixtape. It was one its lead character would have approved of: as with many of the soundtracks on this list, High Fidelity’s success lies in a balance between old-school gems by the Velvet Underground, The Kinks and Elvis Costello to Noughties newcomers like Stereolab and Royal Trux.This may seem like sacrilege given that the first Dirty Dancing soundtrack is indisputably the more iconic of the two. And yes, the sequel (essentially a remake set in Cuba during the 1950s), starring Romola Garai and future Rogue One star Diego Luna, suffered from a plot loaded with clichés and lack of chemistry between its two lead actors. But the soundtrack – featuring the Grammy-nominated Latin fusion band Yerba Buena, Colombian rock band Aterciopelados, and the Cuban hip hop group Orishasis – is what draws me back to this guilty pleasure of a film. Dirty Dancing 2 didn’t really deserve such a soundtrack, but it adds some actual heat to a film that, asides from the superb dance routines, leaves you cold.Martin Scorsese had strict rules for the soundtrack to his film Goodfellas: each song had to have been around during the time in which the scene was set, and the tracks had to make some kind of comment on the scene or character in question “in an oblique way”. A staggering 48 songs are heard during the film, including classics by Dean Martin, Fred Astaire and The Drifters, Sid Vicious, The Who and The Rolling Stones. One of the most unforgettable moments is when Bobby Darin’s “Beyond the Sea” plays as the Wise Guys cook dinner, which was “always a big thing” in prison.When it comes to soundtracking your movie, it helps if the director is a massive music nerd. Of course, music was always going to play a huge part in a film about a boy in a band and his video game quest to win the girl of his dreams. But Edgar Wright, a former music video director, found a way to seamlessly integrate his soundtrack into Scott Pilgrim vs the World’s narrative. Beck, who wrote the music for Scott Pilgrim’s garage band Sex Bob-omb, was a perfect match for their chaotic, DIY approach, while Metric’s song “Black Sheep” was used for a performance by ex-girlfriend Envy Adams’s (Brie Larson) band The Clash at Demonhead.Drive wouldn’t have worked as well as it did without the soundtrack. Steven Soderbergh\u0027s go-to composer Cliff Martinez assembled the songs for Nicolas Winding Refn’s ambitious indie project, showing an understanding that the most effective soundtracks are often the ones that transport you into the movie without you realising. By using a set of mostly female vocalists, all of whom sing over dry electronic beats, Martinez achieved a sonic portrayal of Drive’s startling juxtaposition between beauty and violence.It’s the biggest movie soundtrack of all time and the 15th best-selling album in the US. Whitney Houston breathed new life into songs by Dolly Parton (“I Will Always Love You”) and Chaka Khan (“I’m Every Woman”). Five of the songs performed by Houston were hits: I Will Always Love You, I\u0027m Every Woman, I Have Nothing, Run to You (both Oscar-nominated), and Queen of the NightYes, it was the Fab Four\u0027s worst film, but the soundtrack is packed with some of their best songs: “I am the Walrus”, She Loves You and “Hello, Goodbye”. Where A Hard Day’s Night, Yellow Submarine and Help were undoubtedly more influential on popular culture, Magical Mystery Tour is the most fun to listen to – regardless of how much effort is required to watch.Few films offer as comprehensive a look at hip-hop stars during the heights of their creative powers – even though the movie itself was a clumsily written crime drama. Belly’s soundtrack captured the East Coast rap scene as it stepped towards a grittier sound and underwent one of the most important transitions for any genre in music history – with contributions from the likes of D’Angelo, members of the Wu-Tang Clan, Nas and Jay-Z.At the time, it felt like Richard Kelly’s dark and gloomy film starring a young Jake Gyllenhaal was one of the few to truly capture what it meant to be a confused, alienated teenager. With composer Michael Andrews, Kelly picked some the best songs from an era that dealt in existential angst via upbeat synth-pop: Echo and the Bunnymen, Duran Duran, Tears for Fears, The Pet Shop Boys and more. By choosing to close the film on Michael Andrews’ cover of Tears for Fears’ “Mad World”, Kelly underpins both the self-absorbed attitude of teenagers convinced that only the artists singing these songs truly understood them, and the nostalgia felt by their parents who were there in the moment.Midnight Cowboy – the first X-rated film to win the Oscar for Best Picture – took original material and pre-existing songs to complement the theme of a naïve cowboywannabe sex worker trying to survive in a big city, and the juxtaposition between Jon Voight’s character Joe Buck and dying con artist “Ratso” (Dustin Hoffman). Fred Neil\u0027s song “Everybody\u0027s Talkin\u0027”, which underscores the first act, won the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Vocal Performance, Male (for Harry Nilsson).Trent Reznor’s work on David Lynch’s 1997 neo-noir movie is loaded with stark electronics and instrumentals by Angelo Badalamenti. In between, you have Smashing Pumpkins, Nine Inch Nails and, of course, This Mortal Coil’s “Song to the Siren” – a track that caught Lynch’s attention and inspired him to co-write two albums for Twin Peaks chanteuse Julee Cruise.1240 29. The Last Days of Disco (1998)Whit Stillman’s 1998 indie-classic starred then-virtual unknowns Kate Beckinsale and Chloë Sevigny as friends and roommates in early-Eighties New York. Add that to a wall-to-wall disco soundtrack and you’ve got an intoxicating film, set 20 years after the genre’s heyday, with classic dancefloor anthems from Chic, Diana Ross, and Sister Sledge belted out one after the other.  In the summer of 1992, the soundtrack to a film that flopped at the box office offered the masses the gateway they needed into the Seattle grunge scene. Cameron Crowe wanted the Singles soundtrack to be “more like a simple mixtape of Seattle’s finest”, and ended up with a veritable who’s-who of every important band from that moment in music history: Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, Smashing Pumpkins, Soundgarden and Mudhoney… everyone apart from Nirvana. Regardless, almost three decades after the film’s release, the soundtrack serves as a landmark for one of the most pivotal moments in music history.Adapting literary classics to modern-day high-school scenarios was the big thing in the Nineties. Cruel Intentions came from Pierre Choderlos de Laclos’s 18th-century work, Les Liaisons Dangereuses, and starred Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe as Kathryn and Sebastian: two spoilt, bored rich kids toying with the naïve and virtuous Annette (Reese Witherspoon). John Ottman was originally enlisted to compose the score, but producers decided that wouldn’t sit well with the teenage demographic it was going for and instead plumped for a soundtrack of Placebo, Blur, Skunk Anansie, Aimee Mann and Counting Crows. This mix of credible and corny mirrors a typical experience we go through as adolescents, discovering iniduality via the music we listen to and trying to leave the theatrics behind. The cult status of both the featured music and the film itself suggests we can never let the drama go completely.Flashdance, the first collaboration between producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, is important because it actually changed how some of the most popular films of the Eighties were shot. For each song featured in the film there is a scene presented in the same way as a music video, like the use of “Maniac” as Alex (Jennifer Beals) trains for her dance audition, or the lead song of the film “What a Feeling”, which plays during the opening montage of the steel mill. The latter, written by Italian composer Giorgio Moroder, Keith Forsey and Irene Cara (who performed the track), became the singer’s first and only number one hit. It also won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, a Golden Globe, and a Grammy for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. Michael Sembello’s “Maniac”, meanwhile, went on to become one of the highest-grossing songs ever written for a film.While Half Nelson isn’t as highly regarded as Lars and the Real Girl or Drive,  it’s the one that helped Ryan Gosling break away from his status as the heartthrob from The Notebook. It also has a phenomenal soundtrack steered by Broken Social Scene, whose brilliant collection of B-sides proved indispensable for this film about a drug-addicted middle-school teacher struggling to deal with the aftermath of a breakup. In between those tracks you’ve got gritty hip hop that shows Dan\u0027s crossover into the world of his pupil, the stoic Drey (Shareeka Epps) – from New York collective Dujeous, to Rhymefest.1740 24. Lost in Translation (2003)Sofia Coppola has a history of needle drops that encapsulate certain moods that can’t be expressed through dialogue, particularly if it involves a medley of shoegaze from Air and My Bloody Valentine, and the full-throttle debauchery of Peaches on “Fuck the Pain Away”. The soundtrack was so influential that several critics suggested it had something to do with the rebirth of shoegaze in the mid-Noughties. Either way, there a few better songs to close a film than Jesus and Mary Chain’s “Just Like Honey”, that plays just after the kiss goodbye between Bob (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) and that indecipherable whisper.Former Massive Attack producer Nellee Hooper is the brainchild behind one of the greatest film soundtracks of all time. Working with composers Craig Armstrong and Marius de Vries, he beta-tested many of the tracks that ended up on the album by playing them at 5am to afterparty guests at his house in London. Others took direct inspiration from Shakespeare’s original text, with Justin Warfield of One Inch Punch and Art Alexakis of Everclear both allowed to watch early edits of scenes from the film to inspire them. Like the soundtracks for Kill Bill, Trainspotting and Marie Antoinette, it’s the vast eclecticism of the songs featured in Romeo + Juliet that make you remember each one, and the scene where each is used, for years after first seeing the film.As well as making a star of reggae singer Jimmy Cliff, both the film and soundtrack for The Harder They Come exposed mainstream audiences to the emerging Kingston recording industry, helping bring the genre to the US and beyond. Only the title track was an original recorded by Cliff for the movie the rest were singles released in Jamaica between 1967 and 1972, including Cliff’s superb “You Can Get it if You Really Want”, plus songs from seminal artists like Toots and the Maytals and Desmond Dekker.A veritable masterpiece: The Beach soundtrack is what gives this film starring a fresh-faced Leonardo DiCaprio its vitality, capturing the essence of the trance music heard during Thai beach parties during the Nineties. It was supervised by Pete Tong, who said the songs, including Moby’s “Porcelain” and Dario G’s “Voices”, are what make the film “watchable time and time again”. The way the music progresses mirrors the grit and darkness that begin to emerge out of paradise.2140 20. Pretty in Pink (1986)John Hughes virtually pioneered the formula for teen movies soundtracked by angsty British post-punk rock. Echo \u0026amp the Bunnymen, The Smiths, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark and New Order all appeared on what is essentially Hughes’s checklist of what cool kids were – or should have been – listening to in the Eighties.    Curated and co-executive produced by Kendrick Lamar, the Black Panther soundtrack brought on a select group of extraordinary talent that would understand the themes in the film, from Anderson .Paak to Earl Sweatshirt. Leading this group is Lamar himself, undoubtedly the best choice of artist for a film that explores responsibility, black power, family dynamics and loyalty. Where Jay-Z failed to step aside on the Great Gatsby soundtrack and let other artists do their thing, Lamar is more interested in highlighting the skills of his fellow artists, like South African singer Babes Wodumo, or Jorja Smith. It’s true that the Black Panther album pales in comparison to some of Lamar’s solo work, but it’s rare to see a soundtrack that so deeply considers the subject matter it has been presented with, and the responsibility of continuing the story through music.2340 18. Dazed and Confused (1993)Dazed and Confused was relatable even if you didn’t happen to spend your teenage years riding shotgun in a 1975 Chevy El Camino. This is largely due to director Richard Linklater highlighting an era of raucous butt-rock anthems and stoner jams, from Alice Cooper’s “School’s Out” to Ted Nugent’s “Stranglehold”.In a year that was saturated with serious historical and period dramas, from a remake of Jane Eyre to The Queen, Marie Antoinette stood out for its highly stylised and fun approach to a well-known figure. Director Sofia Coppola took a similar approach with the music as James Gunn did for s of the Galaxy, mixing new wave and post-punk – including The Strokes, New Order, Adam and the Ants and The Cure – with period music by Baroque composers Vivaldi and Couperin. By doing so, Coppola gave her audience something to relate to, and a soundtrack that suited Marie Antoinette’s rebellious teenage spirit. The best example of this is in the shopping scene – set to the song “I Want Candy” by Bow Wow Wow – that famously included a pair of purple Converse: one of the most defining fashion items of Nineties teen culture. It is a brilliant yet subtle alignment of modern Western consumerism and the outrageous decadence at Versailles during the 18th century.One of the most eclectic compilations to grace cinema-goers’ ears in recent years: the Call Me By Your Name soundtrack wins for those three songs by Sufjan Stevens alone. The American singer-songwriter remixed his 2010 track “Futile Devices” and also wrote two new songs specifically for the film: “Visions of Gideon” and “Mystery of Love”, the latter of which was nominated for the Best Original Song Oscar. Director Luca Guadagnino worked with film editor Walter Fasano and music supervisor Robin Urdang, all understanding that music would play a “vital role”. He wanted the music to give the film a “precise identity” that would act as a “voice” in the movie, he told Billboard. “That’s when I thought of Sufjan Stevens.” Other tracks, like the buoyant “Love My Way” by The Psychedelic Furs, captured the wistful, heady nature of hot, endless summers in Italy during the Eighties.Of course, any biopic about the rise and fall of gangsta rap collective NWA had to have a killer soundtrack – especially if its former members were involved in its production. Even so, the meticulous care with which the soundtrack for Straight Outta Compton was assembled is impressive, and provides backdrop for an origin story about some of the most influential and important records – and artists – of the Eighties and Nineties.2740 14. 500 Days of Summer (2009)This offbeat romantic comedy has developed cult status over the years and stood out at the time for its original take on the “boy meets girl” genre. Music is what first drew characters Summer (Zoe Deschanel) and Tom (Joseph Gordon Levitt) together (they start talking after Summer overhears The Smiths playing on Tom’s MP3 player). Each song mirrors the various highs and lows the characters go through, helped by director Marc Webb’s background making music videos for indie pop artists. Regina Spektor’s song “Hero” is the perfect backdrop for the scene where Tom realises his hopes of getting back with Summer are futile the track closes on the lyric “no one’s got it all”, as if to point out that not everyone gets the fairytale ending they hope for.A veritable smorgasbord for any self-respecting music nerd: Baby Driver took movie soundtracks to a whole other plane. The Fault in Our Stars actor Ansel Elgort stars as “Baby”, a skilled getaway driver who relies on a steady stream of music in order to counteract the effects of tinnitus.There are vintage cuts from The Beach Boys, Beck and Barry White, and Seventies rock gems by Queen and Golden Earring. Yet it was the slightly more unassuming song “Bellbottoms” from the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion album Orange that initially inspired the film. A then 21-year-old Edgar Wright was sitting in his bedroom, “completely broke”, when he began to visualise a car chase set to the songs on that album.George Lucas managed to amplify the already-nostalgic mood on his “summer of ‘62” film by choosing songs from the mid-to-late Fifties as the lead tracks on the American Graffiti soundtrack. Songs from Buddy Holly and Chuck Berry to The Beach Boys are all presented by legendary disc jockey Wolfman Jack.3040 11. 10 Things I Hate About YouIf Pretty in Pink captured teenage angst in the Eighties, 10 Things I Hate About You achieved it for the decade that followed. Unlike many films of the Nineties, which attempted to capitalise on the major rock stars of the day, 10 Things managed to select what is essentially a list of one-hit wonders, from Letters to Cleo and Semisonic to Save Ferris. When you watch the film today, it only serves to fuel that feeling of nostalgia and add to its ever-growing cult status.3140 10. Do the Right Thing (1989)Spike Lee’s Brooklyn-based masterpiece is set to a breathtaking jazz score conducted and composed by his father, Bill Lee. It’s also punctuated by summer jams and blissful ballads, or the urgent demands of Public Enemy’s “Fight the Power”, which is played from Radio Raheem’s boombox a number of times through the film.Until Eden, there was no film about club culture that took the scene seriously. French filmmaker Mia Hansen-Love’s character Paul (Felix de Givry) is based on the experiences of her brother Sven – a relatively popular DJ who had to look on as his peers, including Daft Punk, achieved global fame by pioneering the early EDM scene. Its soundtrack offers a comprehensive look at the house, jungle and garage music that was the lifeblood of Paris youth culture in the Nineties, but is also carefully chosen to match the situation of the film’s characters. Daft Punk’s “Veridis Quo” signals a mood-change at a celebratory dinner, while “Happy Song” by Charles Dockins conveys Paul’s euphoria as his hero Tony Humphries works the decks in a New York club.  This was one of the first films to be defined by its music Mike Nichols also helped pioneer the practice of curating pre-existing songs that would appeal to a pop radio audience. Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel’s music was the perfect fit when it came to music that would show Dustin Hoffman’s character’s intensifying feelings of isolation, particular whenever “The Sounds of Silence” was used.This was one of the first films to also be defined by its music Mike Nichols also helped pioneer the practice of curating pre-existing songs that would appeal to a pop radio audience.

Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith are the unlikely couple thrust together on a go-nowhere blind date, only for tragedy to transform them into folk heroes roaming across the USA searching for shelter. It’s a spellbinding debut. (Adam White) Guaranteed to be one of the major players in next year’s Oscars, Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite works better the less you know about it. What you should know is that it is a devilishly inventive deconstruction of class, brimming with energy, dark humour and nervous tension. (Adam White) Rising from the ashes of the aborted Universal Monsters multiverse, which was due to star Johnny Depp and Tom Cruise, this rebooted Invisible Man uses the iconic branding to tell the smaller and far more intriguing story of a woman on the run from her invisible ex. Elisabeth Moss is the domestic violence survivor convinced that her supposedly dead boyfriend has merely mastered the art of invisibility. Leigh Whannell, who directed 2018’s wonderfully inventive sci-fi thriller Upgrade, is behind the camera. (Adam White) A Quiet Place would surely have been better off as a standalone film, but the financial success of writer-director John Krasinski’s B-movie-style horror tale put paid to that. This isn’t to say there’s no more story to tell. In fact, Krasinski made no secret of the fact he had a whole universe he could one day explore, and sure enough, joining returning stars Emily Blunt, Millicent Thomas and Noah Jupe (so brilliant in Honey Boy) are new additions in the form of Cillian Murphy and Djimon Honsou. (Jacob Stolworthy) 519 No Time to DieWhile Daniel Craig’s Bond tenure has been marked by severe whiplash in terms of quality, there remains something incredibly exciting about the arrival of a new 007 movie. No Time to Die, Craig’s final outing as the super-spy, also boasts an intoxicating array of talent on and off screen, from Cary Fukunaga on directorial duties, to a script co-written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge and cast newcomers including Ana de Armas, Rami Malek and Lashana Lynch. (Adam White) Little is known about the plot for Antebellum, the feature film debut of artists and music video directors Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz. But the thriller\u0027s trailer is a visual feast, with Janelle Monáe appearing to be caught between the present day and the horrors of a 19th century plantation. From producer Jordan Peele, director of Get Out and Us, it also features Jena Malone, Gabourey Sidibe and Kiersey Clemons. (Adam White)719 The Woman in the WindowAn adaptation of the pulpy bestseller (which itself was engulfed in mystery when a New Yorker feature claimed its author, AJ Finn, had extensively lied about his personal life and history), The Woman in the Window puts Amy Adams centre stage for the first time since 2018’s Sharp Objects. She’s an agoraphobic psychologist convinced she has witnessed a murder across the street from her apartment. Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman and Brian Tyree Henry co-star. (Adam White) Watchmen star Yahya Abdul-Mateen III continues his incredible ascent with the starring role in this remake. Produced by the ubiquitous Jordan Peele, the new Candyman revives the hook-handed killer originated in 1992’s genuinely terrifying Bernard Rose film, but with a black and female director and predominantly black cast – which ought to mean the frustratingly ambiguous racial themes of the original can finally be given their due. (Adam White) The sequel to 2017’s mega successful Wonder Woman is a rare thing: a DC film worthy of excitement. The first outing saw Patty Jenkins become the highest-grossing woman director in cinema history, and she’s looking to beat her own record with a follow-up centred on the Amazon princess’s battle against a villain named Cheetah (Kristen Wiig in her superhero film debut). That Jenkins describes it as “a grand tentpole like they use to make in the 1980s” is reason alone to mark its release on your 2020 calendar. (Jacob Stolworthy) Soul is a curious new Pixar film that appears to emulate the philosophical wonder of Inside Out with the lived-in cultural exploration of Coco. Jamie Foxx is a struggling musician who finally gets his big break, only to experience a freak accident that propels him into a mysterious netherworld in which souls are imbued with talents and passions, before being implanted in newborn babies. It looks gorgeous, is potentially insane, and is co-written by Tina Fey. (Adam White) Hours after the first reviews of both Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Cats took over social media, Warner Bros dropped the trailer for Tenet, Christopher Nolan’s top secret espionage thriller. It’s fair to say plenty of sunshine was stolen – and for good reason. Tenet marks Nolan’s return to the mind-melting thrills of Inception and, while the plot remains unknown, it seems to focus on a team of heroes who must rewind time to prevent the outbreak of war. Sign us up. (Jacob Stolworthy) Tom Cruise is taking a (short) break from carrying out impossible missions in 2020. Instead, he’ll return to the cockpit for a sequel to the daddy of all Eighties films, Top Gun. There’ll surely be an element of “teach new dogs old tricks” in the Joseph Kosinski-directed film as Pete “Maverick” Mitchell mentors a new generation of US Navy fighter pilots. We’re hopeful the result will – wait for it – take our breath away. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1319 Barb and Star Go to Vista Del MarIt’s not the Bridesmaids sequel everyone begged for nearly a decade ago, but Barb and Star is its spiritual follow-up at least. Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumulo, the women behind the 2011 smash, write and star in this new comedy, playing two best friends who venture out of their small Midwestern community for the very first time. They soon get mixed up in a villainous plot to kill an entire town, while Jamie Dornan and Damon Wayans Jr also star. (Adam White) 1419 The Many Saints of NewarkWhether you like it or not, a film prequel based on The Sopranos is being released in 2020. The presence of David Chase, the HBO show’s creator, goes a long way to abate any concerns fans might have, and it’ll at least be a fine chance to explore the mobsters’s family history. The film is expected to focus on Dickie Moltisanti, the father of Christopher, whose memory loomed large over the series. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1519 Last Night in SohoEdgar Wright is adding “psychological horror” to his filmmaking repertoire with Last Night in Soho, a neon-soaked thrill ride starring quite the ensemble (Anya Taylor-Joy, Matt Smith, Diana Rigg). The intriguing plot focuses on a young girl for whom “time falls apart” after she’s somehow transported to the 1960s. It sounds like a cult hit in waiting. (Jacob Stolworthy) The feel-good West End smash is transformed into a feel-good movie, with Richard E Grant, Sarah Lancashire and Sharon Horgan leading the story of a teenage boy who overcomes insecurity by embracing drag. Newcomer Max Harwood portrays the title character. (Adam White) Regardless of whether you’re a keen follower of the Marvel Cinematic Universe or not, The Eternals should pique your interest. Sure, it may be spearheading a brand new phase of Marvel franchises – there really is no end to the studios’ box office stronghold – but it features what has to be one of the most eclectic casts ever seen in a superhero film: Angelina Jolie, Kit Harington, Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry and Salma Hayek. Colour us intrigued. (Jacob Stolworthy) Alberto E. RodriguezGetty Images for DisneyA remake of David Lynch’s Dune would ordinarily cause our eyeballs to rattle around our sockets, but not when Denis Villeneuve’s in the director’s chair. So committed to his vision is Warner Bros that they ignored the fact his breathtaking Blade Runner sequel flopped and handed him the keys to a fresh adaptation of Herbert Ross’ novel. He did direct Prisoners, Enemy and Arrival, after all. Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya head up the cast. (Jacob Stolworthy) Long in the works, Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story looks set to be a festive smash this time next year. Speculated to be closer in spirit to the original Stephen Sondheim musical than the iconic 1961 film, this new version casts Ansel Elgort as Tony and newcomer Rachel Zegler as Maria – the latter, incredibly, beat out more than 30,000 candidates for the role, after submitting an audition video via Twitter. (Adam White)An intoxicating and romantic drama about lovers on the run, Queen \u0026amp Slim marks the first feature film from Melina Matsoukas, the director responsible for music videos including Beyoncé’s “Formation”. Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith are the unlikely couple thrust together on a go-nowhere blind date, only for tragedy to transform them into folk heroes roaming across the USA searching for shelter. It’s a spellbinding debut. (Adam White) Guaranteed to be one of the major players in next year’s Oscars, Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite works better the less you know about it. What you should know is that it is a devilishly inventive deconstruction of class, brimming with energy, dark humour and nervous tension. (Adam White) Rising from the ashes of the aborted Universal Monsters multiverse, which was due to star Johnny Depp and Tom Cruise, this rebooted Invisible Man uses the iconic branding to tell the smaller and far more intriguing story of a woman on the run from her invisible ex. Elisabeth Moss is the domestic violence survivor convinced that her supposedly dead boyfriend has merely mastered the art of invisibility. Leigh Whannell, who directed 2018’s wonderfully inventive sci-fi thriller Upgrade, is behind the camera.

But the differences between the worlds either side of it can be immense.On the side nearest the sun, the planets and asteroids have relatively little amounts of organic molecules, for instance, but on the other side alost everything is made up of materials rich in carbon.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

But the question of how that came to be, and why the materials from the inner and outer parts of the solar system did not mix, has continued to perplex scientists.Scientists explain the mysterious stripes spotted on an alien moonNow scientists have proposed an answer, in a new paper published in the journal Nature Astronomy.They say the solution might lie in the very beginnings of the solar system, and our young sun, when all that surrounds us today existed as a disc around the star. The differences between the planets began even before they had been formed, scientists said.The most likely explanation for that compositional difference is that it emerged from an intrinsic structure of this disk of gas and dust, said\u0026nbspStephen\u0026nbspMojzsis, on of the authors of the paper.Such discs have been found around other distant, young stars. And so the scientists suggest that if we had one of our own, it could have created the great ide.It served as a barrier that pulled the materials into different parts of the early solar system – and which would go on to form its planets.But the barrier did let some materials through, and on Earth those would be the ones that would go on to help form life.Those materials that might go to the Earth would be those volatile, carbon-rich materials,\u0026nbspMojzsis\u0026nbspsaid. And that gives you water. It gives you organics.Previously, researchers have suggested that Jupiter was the cause of the ide. But by conducting computer simulations of what it would have done in the early solar system, the researchers found that it was not big enough to get in the way of the flow of rocky material on its own.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I haven’t heard her say anything crazy and they just hate her.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesReferencing Eammon Holmes’s recent controversial rant about Markle – in which the presenter said “I’ve never met her – but I look at her and I think ‘I don’t think I’d like you in real life’” – Stormzy argued: “Bro, she’s black, that’s who you’re talking about. ‘I just look at her and I think she’s got that arrogance.’ I’m like, nah, she’s black man. Just get the f*** out of here.”Holmes came under fire last week for his scathing attack on Markle, calling her “awful”, “woke”, “weak”, “manipulative” and “spoilt”.Created with Sketch.The 50 best albums of 2019 Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The debut solo album of the art-punk pioneer was never going to be predictable, easy-listening. No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”. Death still looms – often in the form of a black dog that follows Callahan around various tracks – but its inevitability seems more of a comfort than something to be feared: “Everybody must walk the lonesome valley,” he sings firmly. “Yeah, they must walk it by themselves.” (RO)Arriving three years after the release of her debut, Nothing’s Real, Shura’s excellent second record is camp and theatrical, pivoting between a big, poppy sensibility and a minimalist, lo-fi one – sometimes on the same track. Lead single “Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands On Me)” is a slinky shoulder roll of a song, laden with passionate blasphemy: “I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine, I know you’re thinking about kissing, too.” It’s laced, too, with piano – an instrument she’d always been “allergic to” before this record – and opulent orchestral strings. (AP)2350 28) Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date. Single “Ready to let Go” is by far the most explicit – a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending orce. He bares his soul on Social Cues, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (RO)Howard listened to Brazilian artist Jorge Ben – “where there’s literally, like, 18 different things happening in the song” – while she was making the album, and it shows. “13th Century Metal” builds like an alarm, while “Baby” is scatty and scattered, like something off The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Sometimes, there is one instrument too many, but usually the components crash together well. (AP)Written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Remind Me Tomorrow shows Van Etten dimming her spotlight on toxicity and instead casting a warm glow behind the record’s psychic overview. As well as expectations of confessional singers, she subverts folk music’s focus on bare-bones songwriting. But the daintiest composition “Stay” is her most perfectly realised yet, over music box chimes and heel-clicking percussion she coos: “You won’t let me go astray You will let me find my way.” After years of making peace with drift and uncertainty, she’s never sounded more sure of anything. (JM)Inspired by the improvisations he was creating while on tour with The xx in 2017, Sam Shepherd found himself making “some of the most obtuse and aggressive music I’ve ever made”. This newfound drive can be heard in singles such as “LesAlpx”, a mind-melting track that climbs breathlessly towards its summit with a pounding bass beat and high, whistling chirps that punctuate the tension. It’s an insight into his brilliant mind and – such is the sheer variety of the album – a way to inspire one’s own imagination. (RO)2750 24) Stormzy – Heavy is the HeadThere are three themes that run through the record: his defiance in the face of doubt the pressure of high expectations and his efforts to lift others up as his success continues to grow. He reminds himself constantly of who he is beneath the gloss that fame has brought: he’s “Rachael’s Little Brother”, “Big Michael”, a guy who likes to watch Avengers and Game of Thrones. All of his best traits are present and correct: sincerity, a smooth flow and forensic-like analysis of societal ills, laced with pathos and humour. The lasting impression is of an artist whose only way is up. (RO)A blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals. Songs such as “All Night” are so candidly carnal it feels inappropriate to listen to them in public notes of riot grrrl, pop and rock come together throughout the record to create something that is, at times, quite striking. (AP)2950 22) Solange – When I Get HomeThe decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)For her fifth studio album, Cate Le Bon went to live in a secluded cottage in the Lake District, where she sang to an empty house and took lessons in wood-carving. Yet her compositions on Reward are lush, warm and whimsical opener “Miami” is resplendent with stately horns and percussion that reminds you of childhood. There’s a fantastic sense of space, too, spun from diaphanous arrangements such as “The Light”, where she meanders delightfully from a clear, lilting call to a deep vocal rumble. It’s an album by an artist intent on readdressing her relationship with her own existence. (RO)Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (RO)Swift’s sixth album Reputation was camp and melodramatic, killing off “the old Taylor” and waging war on anyone and everyone who dared to criticise her. It was sincerity veiled as self-parody, insecurity veiled as breeziness – and all the better for that uneasy paradox. But Lover, her new, seventh album, feels like a partial resurrection of the Swift of old: moony romance and earnest earworms abound. It’s the sound of a singer excited to be earnest again. Taylor Swift is dead. Long live Taylor Swift. (AP)The record is an introspective mix of psychey soul, blues, rock and funk, which skips and strolls and swaggers through its 13 tracks – but it is not simply an exercise in nostalgia. Its influences  decades Gil Scott-Heron, Fela Kuti, Kendrick Lamar and Bobby Womack are all recalled. “I’m not going to have an alter ego, or becomes Sasha Fierce or Ziggy Stardust,” says Kiwanuka. “I can just be Michael Kiwanuka.” With an album this good, it’s hard to argue with that. (AP)On his sixth album, Kano’s powers of observation are at their peak. Home has always been at the heart of his music, so he maintains the close-quarters perspective of his 2005 debut Home Sweet Home the swaggering confidence of that record, though, is replaced by a more thoughtful gravitas. He’s an elder statesman of grime, and you can almost see his furrowed brow and shake of his head on “Trouble”, while the frenetic “Class of Deja”, starring fellow veterans D Double E and Ghetts, reminds the listener how he lit the path for future generations. (RO)3550 16) Hot Chip – A Bath Full of EcstasyLyrically, the band offer up some of their most poignant phrases to date on this – their seventh and best record. Second single “Hungry Child”, a trance-y floor-filler, contains the plaintive, “Dreaming never felt so bad Lonely never felt so wrong before” while, over the shuffling beats of “Echo”, Alexis Taylor sings of leaving your regrets behind while seeming to understand the effort required to achieve this. For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor’s idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul. (RO)3650 15) MUNA – Saves the WorldSaves the World should see MUNA joining the ranks of those who have brazenly borrowed their sound. Lead single “Number One Fan” banishes intrusive thoughts – “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die” – just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek. Elsewhere, they are downright defeatist, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex (“Stayaway”) or reflecting on a lover’s similarity to an adulterous father (“Taken”). “Hands Off”, meanwhile, toys with temptation before slamming the door shut. It is fierce and forthright. (AP)Fans have already drawn comparisons between We Are Not Your Kind and Slipknot’s seminal 2001 album Iowa. While the latter was even heavier (it would be difficult if not impossible to outdo), the sheer ambition on We Are Not Your Kind is just as staggering. If anything, the dynamic created by placing a bigger emphasis on melody allows you to consider everything without being engulfed by noise. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them – this may be one of the band’s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (RO)Each song is titled after a black woman Rapsody admires: Serena Williams, Sojourner Truth, Maya Angelou, Aaliyah, Oprah Winfrey… and for each one she explores these women’s traits, successes and strife. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as “Afeni”, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist’s duty, “as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times”. This is precisely what Rapsody has done, in the most resonant way possible. (RO)There’s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Julia Jacklin’s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum on “Pressure to Party” keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, while “Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You” nails a depth of intimacy while acknowledging relationship ennui. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an’ all: Crushing is a triumph. (HB)Philippakis’s voice is shrouded in the smoke from society’s wreckage. Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in. The debut solo album of the art-punk pioneer was never going to be predictable, easy-listening. No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”. Death still looms – often in the form of a black dog that follows Callahan around various tracks – but its inevitability seems more of a comfort than something to be feared: “Everybody must walk the lonesome valley,” he sings firmly. “Yeah, they must walk it by themselves.” (RO)Arriving three years after the release of her debut, Nothing’s Real, Shura’s excellent second record is camp and theatrical, pivoting between a big, poppy sensibility and a minimalist, lo-fi one – sometimes on the same track. Lead single “Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands On Me)” is a slinky shoulder roll of a song, laden with passionate blasphemy: “I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine, I know you’re thinking about kissing, too.” It’s laced, too, with piano – an instrument she’d always been “allergic to” before this record – and opulent orchestral strings. (AP)2350 28) Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date. Single “Ready to let Go” is by far the most explicit – a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending orce. He bares his soul on Social Cues, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (RO)Howard listened to Brazilian artist Jorge Ben – “where there’s literally, like, 18 different things happening in the song” – while she was making the album, and it shows. “13th Century Metal” builds like an alarm, while “Baby” is scatty and scattered, like something off The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Sometimes, there is one instrument too many, but usually the components crash together well. (AP)Written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Remind Me Tomorrow shows Van Etten dimming her spotlight on toxicity and instead casting a warm glow behind the record’s psychic overview. As well as expectations of confessional singers, she subverts folk music’s focus on bare-bones songwriting. But the daintiest composition “Stay” is her most perfectly realised yet, over music box chimes and heel-clicking percussion she coos: “You won’t let me go astray You will let me find my way.” After years of making peace with drift and uncertainty, she’s never sounded more sure of anything. (JM)Inspired by the improvisations he was creating while on tour with The xx in 2017, Sam Shepherd found himself making “some of the most obtuse and aggressive music I’ve ever made”. This newfound drive can be heard in singles such as “LesAlpx”, a mind-melting track that climbs breathlessly towards its summit with a pounding bass beat and high, whistling chirps that punctuate the tension. It’s an insight into his brilliant mind and – such is the sheer variety of the album – a way to inspire one’s own imagination. (RO)2750 24) Stormzy – Heavy is the HeadThere are three themes that run through the record: his defiance in the face of doubt the pressure of high expectations and his efforts to lift others up as his success continues to grow. He reminds himself constantly of who he is beneath the gloss that fame has brought: he’s “Rachael’s Little Brother”, “Big Michael”, a guy who likes to watch Avengers and Game of Thrones. All of his best traits are present and correct: sincerity, a smooth flow and forensic-like analysis of societal ills, laced with pathos and humour. The lasting impression is of an artist whose only way is up. (RO)A blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals. Songs such as “All Night” are so candidly carnal it feels inappropriate to listen to them in public notes of riot grrrl, pop and rock come together throughout the record to create something that is, at times, quite striking. (AP)2950 22) Solange – When I Get HomeThe decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)For her fifth studio album, Cate Le Bon went to live in a secluded cottage in the Lake District, where she sang to an empty house and took lessons in wood-carving. Yet her compositions on Reward are lush, warm and whimsical opener “Miami” is resplendent with stately horns and percussion that reminds you of childhood. There’s a fantastic sense of space, too, spun from diaphanous arrangements such as “The Light”, where she meanders delightfully from a clear, lilting call to a deep vocal rumble. It’s an album by an artist intent on readdressing her relationship with her own existence. (RO)Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (RO)Swift’s sixth album Reputation was camp and melodramatic, killing off “the old Taylor” and waging war on anyone and everyone who dared to criticise her. It was sincerity veiled as self-parody, insecurity veiled as breeziness – and all the better for that uneasy paradox. But Lover, her new, seventh album, feels like a partial resurrection of the Swift of old: moony romance and earnest earworms abound. It’s the sound of a singer excited to be earnest again. Taylor Swift is dead. Long live Taylor Swift. (AP)The record is an introspective mix of psychey soul, blues, rock and funk, which skips and strolls and swaggers through its 13 tracks – but it is not simply an exercise in nostalgia. Its influences  decades Gil Scott-Heron, Fela Kuti, Kendrick Lamar and Bobby Womack are all recalled. “I’m not going to have an alter ego, or becomes Sasha Fierce or Ziggy Stardust,” says Kiwanuka. “I can just be Michael Kiwanuka.” With an album this good, it’s hard to argue with that. (AP)On his sixth album, Kano’s powers of observation are at their peak. Home has always been at the heart of his music, so he maintains the close-quarters perspective of his 2005 debut Home Sweet Home the swaggering confidence of that record, though, is replaced by a more thoughtful gravitas. He’s an elder statesman of grime, and you can almost see his furrowed brow and shake of his head on “Trouble”, while the frenetic “Class of Deja”, starring fellow veterans D Double E and Ghetts, reminds the listener how he lit the path for future generations. (RO)3550 16) Hot Chip – A Bath Full of EcstasyLyrically, the band offer up some of their most poignant phrases to date on this – their seventh and best record. Second single “Hungry Child”, a trance-y floor-filler, contains the plaintive, “Dreaming never felt so bad Lonely never felt so wrong before” while, over the shuffling beats of “Echo”, Alexis Taylor sings of leaving your regrets behind while seeming to understand the effort required to achieve this. For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor’s idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul. (RO)3650 15) MUNA – Saves the WorldSaves the World should see MUNA joining the ranks of those who have brazenly borrowed their sound. Lead single “Number One Fan” banishes intrusive thoughts – “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die” – just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek. Elsewhere, they are downright defeatist, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex (“Stayaway”) or reflecting on a lover’s similarity to an adulterous father (“Taken”). “Hands Off”, meanwhile, toys with temptation before slamming the door shut. It is fierce and forthright. (AP)Fans have already drawn comparisons between We Are Not Your Kind and Slipknot’s seminal 2001 album Iowa. While the latter was even heavier (it would be difficult if not impossible to outdo), the sheer ambition on We Are Not Your Kind is just as staggering. If anything, the dynamic created by placing a bigger emphasis on melody allows you to consider everything without being engulfed by noise. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them – this may be one of the band’s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (RO)Each song is titled after a black woman Rapsody admires: Serena Williams, Sojourner Truth, Maya Angelou, Aaliyah, Oprah Winfrey… and for each one she explores these women’s traits, successes and strife. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as “Afeni”, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist’s duty, “as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times”. This is precisely what Rapsody has done, in the most resonant way possible. (RO)There’s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Julia Jacklin’s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum on “Pressure to Party” keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, while “Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You” nails a depth of intimacy while acknowledging relationship ennui. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an’ all: Crushing is a triumph. (HB)Philippakis’s voice is shrouded in the smoke from society’s wreckage. Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown.

If you look at the intrusion on their lives, if you look at the racism that Meghan Markle\u0026nbsphas experienced in the British media then I can understand why given what’s happened.”However, he later clarified his comments about the monarchy, insisting he had not called for the royal family to be abolished.He tweeted: “In response to my comments about the royal family. I didn’t say they should be abolished, I have lots of respect for the hard work they do. I simply think the question about their size and the money they receive should be one for the public.

This is critical for long-term growth. If current political and economic uncertainties ease, we could see a gradual revival in activity over the course of the year.”Official figures released on Monday showed that the UK economy shrank unexpectedly by 0.3 per cent in November. However, the downbeat message of the Stenn survey runs counter to the consensus in the City of London, which last month\u0026nbsppredicted that on average the UK economy would grow by an anaemic 1.1 per cent in 2020.There was further downbeat news on the UK economy from the retail analysts Springboard, which said there was a 2.5 per cent drop in visitors to Britain’s high streets and shopping centres in December compared with a year earlier.Diane\u0026nbspWehrle, Springboard’s marketing and insights director, said: “The reasons why this occurred are varied but reflect the caution and spending restraint of consumers which typifies low consumer confidence that has been ongoing for the last three years.”She pointed out that the timing of Black Friday and Cyber Monday brought festive trading forward, leading to a noticeable decline in footfall over the two weeks leading up to Christmas.Last week saw a string of downbeat trading updates from major retailers including Marks \u0026amp Spencer, John Lewis and Superdry. Official figures on Friday will show whether retail sales recorded a second successive monthly fall.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Iran\u0027s foreign ministry spokesman said Tehran would give a firm and serious response to the move.\u0026nbspBut the triggering of the dispute mechanism also could mark\u0026nbspa potential setback in Iran\u0027s efforts to separate Europe from the US, which has been pressuring leaders in western capitals to join in its maximum pressure campaign against the Iranian regime.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlines“It definitely takes the deal into a new phase, said\u0026nbspEllie\u0026nbspGeranmayeh, a scholar at the European Council on Foreign Relations.

But European officials argue they have little control over the private businesses that decline to do commerce with Iran for fear of triggering American reprisals.The move by the E3 had been long anticipated, especially after Iran\u0027s most recent downgrading of its commitment to the terms of the deal.

They will doubtless make big money. But the firestorm of criticism they have ignited here will become an inferno.It is a disastrous mess and may get worse. The couple’s assumption about the public continuing to fund round-the-clock security in Canada looks ­premature — and must be reviewed.Harry is worth £million, Meghan another £million.

She didn’t meet them.Even the abdication of Edward VIII over Mrs Simpson, together below, was at Government and Church level.To have documents prepared in advance does not surprise me. The Queen has said she wants this sorted out and without delay.Many have called this an abdication and in one sense it is. Harry and Meghan expect to still have a handle on royal duty but also to lead a private le.What they mean by living financially independent, I don’t know. They aren’t financially independent now — they get £.- million from the Prince Of Wales and about five per cent from the Sovereign Grant.Harry is reasonably wealthy but not necessarily in cash flow. The sums he inherited from his mother and great grandmother have been invested.Meghan has some means but to live the sort of lestyle they are used to takes a lot of money.It is conceivable Charles could cut the money he gives to Harry —he gives him any at all. Being a dad, he probably will.But there are tax implications — particularlythere are handouts.Security has also to be considered. Harry is a prince of the United Kingdom, his grandmother head of state and father heir.The atmosphere at the meeting will be, up to a point, heated. But people won’t lose their tempers.The Queen is pragmatic. She understands problems people have but Harry will be fully aware of her displeasure. To go off half-cocked as he and Meghan did is unacceptable.The question is how dare they do that. She signed up for this. So what’s changed their minds I’d love to be a fly on the wall of the events in that meeting . . . provided no one has a fly swat!Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And what a waste of their chance to play a key role in helping our Royal Family prosper after the Queen is gone.And what a waste of Harry and Meghan’s unique chance to be a living, inspirational representation of the multiracial country in which we now live. How quickly the shine has come off the golden couple.Less than two years after that wedding day, Harry and Meghan are scurrying off to an ill-defined “progressive” new le in Canada.Butthey have been unhappy with their royal roles, they have brought it on themselves. This much-loved couple have always been too thin-skinned for their own good.They have always been hysterically touchy when justied criticism came their way, such as when they lectured about climate change while reclining on private jets.The criticism was nothing personal. Hollywood stars get called out for climate hypocrisy. Do Harry and Meghan really imagine we will just tug our forelocks as they fly around the world in private jets while talking like Greta Thunberg in a tiara Harry and Meghan are never satisfied with anything less than unconditional deference. They apparently loathe royal le, yet demand to be treated like royalty.They have demonstrated an epic sense of entitlement, such as asking the taxpayer to pick up the £.million builder’s bill for doing up their home, Frogmore Cottage.Their great self-pitying delusion is that the wicked British media has it in for them. But it is not the media that caused Meghan so much excruciating embarrassment.It is largely her own dysal family and their indiscreetly flapping cakeholes, especially her dear old discarded dad Thomas Markle and her loony half-sister Samantha. Harry and Meghan’s self-pity is astounding.“Never complain, never explain,” has been the motto of the modern Royal Family. It has worked rather well.But place Harry and Meghan in front of a sympathetic camera crew, such as when ITV’s Tom Bradby trailed them on their tour of South Africa, and they can’t stop whining. Even when surrounded by victims of rape and landmines, they managed to feel sorry for themselves.“Not many people askedI’m OK,” Meghan complained in the Third World. There has not been a royal couple with such a staggering lack of self-awareness since Marie Antoinette and King Louis XVI of France. And look what happened to them.Harry and Meghan owe their mega-celebrity totally to their connection with the Royal Family. Their superstardom has nothing to do with Meghan’s acting career. Their lives of unimaginable luxury are funded in large part by the British taxpayer.The average couple spends just under £, on their wedding. Harry and Meghan were said to have blown £MILLION. Yet they do not appear to have a grateful bone between them. They seem incapable of counting their multiple blessings.Even now, after handing in their royal resignation, they give every indication that they want all the privileges of royal le with none of the obligations. They want to have their Eton mess and eat it.Harry and Meghan’s security alone currently costs around £, a year, paid for by the politan Police — which means paid for by the British taxpayer. Get the Mounties to start paying for it.And can we finally nail the great lie that Meghan has been persecuted in the UK because of her mixed race  When she first appeared, Meghan was a hurricane of fresh air. The British looked at her and it was love at first sight.This weary, ided, Brexit-battered nation was delighted to have an injection of Hollywood glamour. And millions of Brits now live in mixed-race families. There was real delight to see the Royal Family catching up with the rest of us.Among those crowds at Windsor on their wedding day I saw families of every race and creed under the sun who were ecstatic to see the Royal Family becoming less white, more inclusive, more representative.Harry and Meghan have drawn criticism because of their total lack of self-awareness. Both of them are independently rich. Harry is worth around £million after inheritances from his mother and the Queen Mum.Prince Charles gives him £million every year. Meghan made around £million from her role in long-runningTV legal drama Suits.Yet this fabulously wealthy couple have been happy to let others — the British taxpayer, Prince Charles, the Queen — pay their way in their gilded world.Six weeks, which is theof time that Harry and Meghan have just spent in Canada, is a very long time to be away from home.Unless, of course, “home” doesn’t feel like home because you feel criticised for everything you do and wear, your family – on both sides – are a nightmare and you are constantly judgedby people who have never met you and never will.I should imagine that in this case, Canada seems like a very good place to call home. So, who can blame Meghan and Harry for deciding to leave the UK behind to get away from it all, and maybe staying away from here in the long-term I have a lot of respect for the couple for ploughing their own furrow and walking their own path.Honestly, I couldn’t be happier for Harry, who has experienced so much sadness, that he has met a woman brave enough to suggest doing things a bit dferently.Although they are currently making bold statements about giving up the taxpayer-funded Sovereign Grant, they show no sign of being willing to pay for their own security, or their own flunkies, or offer the taxpayer a rebate on those reported £million nuptials.There has never been even the slightest hint of gratitude. There has never been any indication that they — this rich, pampered couple with a beautul baby boy who will never want for anything — realise how lucky they are.So Harry and Meghan are not the only ones with mixed emotions today. There is real resentment that Harry and Meghan have caused distress to our Queen and it will not be easily forgotten or forgiven.The Queen has a -year-old husband who has recently been in hospital. She has a son mired in a squalid sex scandal. And she is  years old. Who the hell do Harry and Meghan think they are This feels like an abdication with a taxpayer-funded safety net. The couple plan to “step back as senior members of the Royal Family” but show no inclination to give up the privileges and pay days that come with the job.They say they want to “work to become financially independent”. But between them they are currently worth around £million. Why not pay their own way NOW Are they really suggesting that they turn their backs on this nation while asking it to foot their bills  It looks like it. The British taxpayer will continue to stump up for their phenomenal security bills. Harry’s daddy will cough up for much .So you can’t help wondering how intelligent they really are, this TV soap actress and a man who left Eton with two A-levels— a school where my dog could get four A-levels.Do Harry and Meghan really think they have had a raw deal  Are they that stupid  There is no republican movement in this country.The Queen has reigned far too well for far too long —  years on the throne next month — for anti-monarchy sentiment to develop.The Queen has spent her entire le placing public duty above private happiness.She has been the stable, stoic centre of this nation for so long that she has single-handedly made losing our monarchy unthinkable.Yet when a spokesman for anti-monarchy pressure group Republic demanded Harry and Meghan make a clean break, I found myself nodding in agreement with every withering word.“Theyhave said that they will dip in and out of royal duties as it suits them but won’t stop taking money until they find other sources of income,” said Republic’s Graham Smith.“To suggest they’re not already financially independent is incredibly crass and belies a sense of entitlement and lack of self-awareness common among royals.”This republican is right. If Harry and Meghan want a new le hanging out with the Clooneys and striking deals with Apple, they should fund it themselves.As they say in North America, do it on your own dime. Give up the HRH titles. Stop leeching off your royal status.They will be a footnote in the story of our Royal Family, Meghan the Wallis Simpson of the st Century, Harry another Duke of Windsor who believed exile with his American orcee would make him happy.The Royal Family is not all about them.The Queen will be an impossible act to follow. But the photograph of Queen Elizabeth smiling proudly with the next three generations of future kings — Princes Charles, William and George — suggests our Royal Family will last for at least  years after Netflix has cancelled The Crown, evenone day Meghan gets to play herself.The succession is assured. Decent men will wear the crown. And Kate is great. But let history record that no royal couple was ever as adored as Harry and Meghan.It is astonishing — and unbelievably sad, perhaps even tragic — that millions of us will be happy to see the back of them.Astrological patterns repeat in families through generations, just as it is doing with Meghan and Harry.Edward VIII, who wed American orcee Wallis Simpson, put love before duty, and planted a karmic seed that is at the root of what is unfolding now. It can be likened to a virus that has been lurking in the Royal household and is now being re-activated by Harry and Meghan.So what comes next  Uranus, the planet of shock-waves, moves to confront the Sun in Aquarius on January  and forms a clash with the New Moon on the th.There is likely to be a stinging backlash as all the remaining senior family members have their roles shaken up.Meghan will create a power couple that flourishes by spring with a number of initiatives. By December , another baby announcement is likely.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We would have done the same to protect British servicemen and women. In fact, as Britain’s Defence Secretary I did exactly that, with the full support of Prime Minister David Cameron.Let’s not forget that every country has the right to self-defence.Of course, nobody wants this crisis to escalate. Indeed Iran’s retaliation has been noticeably limited so far.But the chorus for “de-escalation” carries risks too. Iran has been attacking Western shipping, including capturing a British tanker. Iran has fired missiles at Saudi oil refineries.Iran continues to wage proxy wars in Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. Through its militias, Iran continues to destabilise neighbouring Iraq.At some point, somebody had to draw the line. Qasem Soleimani was no hero or statesman. He directed terrorist attacks across the Middle East.Thousands of Syrians, Iraqis and Yemenis died as a result. Iranian dissidents, too, were brutally suppressed.The roadside bomb-making he sponsored killed many of our brave servicemen in Iraq. As Prime Minister Boris Johnson reminded us, he had the blood of our soldiers on his hands.Has Trump’s strike weakened the case for Western intervention  It is worth remembering our troops and those of the US are in Iraq at Iraq’s invitation.Since , we have helped lead an international coalition of more than  countries to support its fragile democracy and liberate that country from the terrorist death-cult of Daesh Isis.And thanks to precision strikes by the RAF and the training by the British Army of thousands of Iraqi troops, Daesh has lost the pernicious grip it once had.Defeating Daesh isn’t just a matter of helping a friend in need or of standing up for human rights. Mercully, we have stopped Yazidi women from being raped, prisoners being burnt alive, gay people being thrown off buildings and Western hostages sadistically executed.But tackling Daesh terrorism is also vital to protect our own way of le here in Western Europe.Islamist fundamentalism needs to be defeated, whether in Mosul, Raqqa, a Paris suburb or on London Bridge.So yes, let’s continue to work with our allies to persuade Iran’s revolutionaries to take a dferent path.Saudi Arabia, the other Gulf countries and even Russia all have roles to play in getting Iran back to the negotiating table.After the appalling shooting down of the Ukrainian airliner, let’s try to show the Iranian people their government needs to be more truthful and more open, that there is a better future beyond the mullahs and the republican guards.But diplomacy alone will not be enough. We have to protect our national interests too. Trump’s strike is a stark reminder that in the end, we must all stand up when those interests are threatened so directly.First, we must persuade other European navies to work with the US and our own Royal Navy in patrolling and protecting convoys through the Strait of Hormuz.This is a vital choke point for Europe’s trade and energy. The gas and oil we need this winter pass through it.It is ludicrous that some Nato allies won’t work with American ships for fear of upsetting the mullahs in Tehran.This has to be a US-led international operation.Second, we need a better nuclear agreement with Iran. It was right to try to halt their nuclear programme. But the previous deal wasn’t comprehensive — it didn’t even cover missiles — and it completely failed to constrain Iranian misbehaviour in the region. If anything, Iran used the access to new finance that deal released to step up its proxy wars in Yemen and where.A new deal should ensure full oversight of all Iran’s nuclear activities by the International Atomic Energy Agency, and only allow Iran back into the international markets when its civil nuclear programme is in complete compliance.Third, we have to step up our campaign against terrorism.Outside the EU after Brexit, we will still need to share intelligence and work together with our European partners to identy new attacks. But our closest ally in the battle to protect our values will always be the US. We may not always agree with Trump’s tactics but we shouldn’t ignore that he has finally cut through the illusion — Iran’s current regime is not our friend.Iran will certainly have learned a lesson from President Trump’s decisive action. But I hope we will do so too.Turning a blind eye to those who foster international terrorism is no longer an option for any of us.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She askedthey wanted to join her in the “mile-high club”, then attacked cabin crew who refused her more alcohol.Demi Burton tried to headbutt and kick six crew members and passengers who tried to restrain her before she was arrested when the plane landed.In court, the -year-old claimed she had been drinking because she has a fear of flying and said this behaviour is out of character, which may be true.Her defence lawyer Martin Callery said: “She is thoroughly ashamed of herself . . .  and utterly embarrassed at the way she behaved.”But that is certainly not the impression she conveyed outside court, where she gleefully flicked obscene hand gestures at photographers.No doubt she stopped smiling when she heard she had been sentenced to six months in prison. Personally, I’m not sure how effective prison is. But the problem with reckless behaviour is that you have to face the consequences.And I really hope for Demi, this is the moment she gets her le back on track. We all make mistakes. It’s what we do afterwards that defines us.It would be easy to assume that Demi is a hopeless case. But she is young enough to turn her le around, to work hard, do better and see this rock-bottom moment as a catalyst for change.And then something good will come from what is a very low moment in her le. We don’t have to look far for examples of people who have overcome lapses or mistakes before going on to succeed.Take Robert Downey Jr, who went from drug addict to one of Hollywood’s highest-paid actors. Or Elton John and Robbie Williams, both of whom have overcome major drug issues before enjoying renewed stardom, fatherhood and, more importantly, a good le.While it is not the same as a drunken mistake, anyone who has made it in business will have a good few failures under their belt — whether it is a dodgy commercial decision, plain bad luck or a company that has gone bust.It is not what happens to us in le but what we do next that counts. So I am guessing that, from her cell, Demi might be reflecting on what she might do dferently when she gets out. Andshe isn’t, she should be.Because it is the getting back on the horse that counts, evenit means resisting the urge to go back to bed to hide. No one is perfect. No one gets through le without messing up or things going wrong.Before success, you will get temporary defeat or total failure. The key to getting through it is resilience. And one of the best gts you can give a child is to encourage them not to give up.By the way, I speak here from experience. Like any businesswoman, I’ve made some mistakes and had my fair share of knocks.There are some that I have managed to turn to my advantage and others that I have had to chalk up to experience.The key thing is that I have learned from what went wrong, then moved on. That experience has allowed me to create a mini-manesto on how to fail how to respond to setbacks and failure, which I’ll share here now:Give yourself time to recover and reflect. Force yourself to take small steps to get back on the horse. Do not accept failure. See it as a step on the journey towards success.Remember that challenging and dficult moments are what help you grow bigger or better.

However . . .This week I read that not only is the gorgeous Abbey Clancy having micro-Botox injections, hyaluronic acid fillers and vitamins, she is doing it with TWENTY needles at once.Abbey, , is having something called an aquagold facial, so called because each needle is covered in -carat gold.

Which begs the question of where, then, is the best place for females  The kitchen Inspectors who visited Birmingham’s Redstone Educational Academy in November last year also found male students were given privileges and treated more favourably than their female counterparts when it came to sports, school trips and work experience.That was something disputed by the headteacher.That’s not good enough.

Perhaps this explains why his Wikipedia entry has just been doctored to delete his status as a “millionaire”. Not me, guv, protests Starmer.He is also weirdly reluctant to declare where he stands on the political spectrum. Is he a Corbynite or a Blairite or a bit of both  “I don’t have the names of former leaders tattooed on my head,” snfs the man named at birth after the first leader of the Labour Party.This knight of the realm, who played violin at fee-paying Reigate Grammar School alongside Fatboy Slim, claims a humble background as the son of a toolmaker.“I know what it’s like,” he insists, asraised in a cardboard box.Well, I went to the same school when it was a “bog-standard” state grammar. My father was a journeyman upholsterer. It didn’t give me any special insights.Starmer boasts in his new campaign video about picket-line stints alongside down- trodden Wapping printworkers — against my boss, Rupert Murdoch, a hate figure on the Left.This chameleon politician was dubbed a “Sir” on the recommendation of Gordon Brown, a title he discourteously declines to use because it invites contempt among those with a vote.His citation was for “services to law and criminal justice”, after a five-year term as DPP.At about the same time he was parachuted into Parliament as MP for rock-solid Labour Holborn and St Pancras, in London.It is here that self-respecting Labour voters should pause and reflect.Many believe these political plums were reward for the longest, costliest and perhaps most spiteful criminal persecution in history — ordered by Sir Keir Starmer.His new leadership video slyly refers to this time, apparently to boost his scourge-of-capitalism image among the “comrades” — even though politics should play no part in a DPP’s decision-making. In a travesty of justice, he rammed two dozen innocent journalists through Old Bailey trials on trumped-up conspiracy charges — a medieval catch-all which even the Crown Prosecution Service admitted was “an extremely dficult and rarely visited area of the law”.The prosecuting counsel was given a flea in his ear for “chopping and changing”, the charges against the journalists.The trials ended with acquittals all round, an admission that “no crime may have been committed” and this rebuke from the Lord Chief Justice:“What concerns me is the freedom of the Press and the desire of officials to contain information.“We must ensure the Press is protected — we can’t use criminal sanctions to undermine their position.”The defendants were all journalists on The Sun or the News of the World — then seen by the Left as fair game.The trials followed The Sun’s decision to switch its support from Gordon Brown’s floundering regime to David Cameron’s Tories.Some believe the two were linked — but surely that’s just a conspiracy theory.What is absolutely clear to those who care about the issue is Starmer’s readiness to use his power to curb Press freedom.As citizens of totalitarian regimes rapidly learn to their cost, without a free Press there is no such thing as free speech.IT’S win-win for the Sussexes and losses all round for the House of Windsor.Meghan’s first kiss-and-tell will be a bestseller, with all the gossip on Randy Andy and those secret royal scandals.Harry’s right-on charities will be milked for millions.Once our revered Queen has departed, the monarchy will dwindle to a sideshow on the US celebrity circuit.Charles is too old to compete and William is too dull, despite Kate’s best efforts.Hero Harry will emerge as victor in this grotesque civil war.

Why let reality spoil the narrative These claims made about the “racist” treatment of Meghan at the hands of the British Press are incredibly thin.The same non-examples are recycled over and over again. You have probably seen them quoteda thousand times.There is that Daily Mail piece from , when Harry and Meghan were first dating, that said she was “ straight outta Compton”.At the time, Meghan’s mother Doria Ragland lived in nearby Crenshaw, LA.Hirsch says this was an attempt to link Meghan with “racialised forms of crime”, meaning gangs.That is one hell of a reach. The piece was clearly just playing on the dference in Harry and Meghan’s social backgrounds.If Harry had been dating a white, working-class woman from Manchester’s Moss Side, I dare say the Mail would have done something similarly silly.Another favourite is that weird throwaway line Boris Johnson’s sister Rachel wrote, in a laudatory piece on Meghan, about the mixed-race American actress bringing some “rich and exotic DNA” to the pale Windsor bloodline. That is more cringey than racist.Several pieces have cited a single phrase in a Sarah Vine column for the Mail — she said she had a “niggling worry” about the royal couple’s engagement photo — as a bigoted dog whistle. That is, quite frankly, mental.Such is the lack of actual examples of the Press being racist about Meghan.The only leg this argument has left to stand on is that the sheer volume of criticism sent Meghan’s way was disproportionate.Racism is the only explanation for it. It’s an argument based purely on unveriable speculation and imputing motives. It is also b*****ks.When the couple first got together, the coverage was gushing across the board.It was only when Meghan and Harry started on their ious virtue-signalling cru-sades — such as jetting around to lecture on climate change — that people’s backs went up.That the couple had already been beefing with the Press probably didn’t help either.In , way before Meghan became a figure in our culture wars, Harry issued a remarkable statement rebuking journalists for the “racial undertones” of their pieces.That these privileged royals, kept in the lap of luxury at taxpayers’ expense, began to develop a deep-seated victim complex only heightened the resentment towards them.Last year, Meghan told ITV public le was a “struggle” and she was shocked that “not many people have askedI’m OK”. Poor princess.This picture of privilege is who the liberal Left has spent the best part of three years defending.Even supposed republicans have — after a bit of anti-royal throat-clearing — defended Harry and Meghan to the hilt and helped con- struct this absurd narrative that they are the victims of establishment racism.This says far more about the prejudices of liberal-Left commentators than it does about the tabloid Press. They routinely suggest Meghan’s supposed mistreatment in Brexit Britain is no coincidence.They think Britain is a foul place full of foul people, brainwashed by foul news- papers to hate the wonderful Duchess of Sussex and the brilliant European Union.What the liberal elite’s Meghanmania shows us is that, for all their posturing against right-wingers, monarchy and the old aristocracy, they are comfortable with the plebs being led, instructed and hectored by our betters.They would just rather it was woke people doing it, like Harry and Meghan. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridLOADEDcustomwww.thesuncustom%Fwp-admin%Fpost.phpcustomlinkangoodt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridBEFORE_OPTOUT_REQt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridFINISHEDcustomwww.thesunt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridOPTOUT_RESPONSE_OKt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\" Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

moving to Canada part-time despite the wishes of the monarch.The -year-old grandmother last night revealed in a strikingly personal statement she wanted the couple to remain full-time working Members of the Royal Family but respected their desire to live a more independent le.During the unprecedented crisis talks - which Meghan did not attend as she remains Canada with eight-month-old Archie - the Queen reportedly made it clear Harry and his we were part of the vision for a slimmed down monarchy.It was previously reported the couple had felt driven out by the Royal Family - including feeling excluded from the recent line of succession photo which saw the Queen beaming alongside her heirs Prince George, Prince William and Prince Charles.But while Her Majesty yesterday appealed to the couple to stay in the UK to work with the family - she agreed to support the pair to to create a new le as a young family.It comes as.... Harry is expected to attend a royal engagement on Thursday at Buckingham before flying to Canada to be with his we and son later this week as they transition out of the Royal Family.It comes after the pair were warned about a slimmed-down monarchy, journalist pal Tom Bradby claims.The ITV News reporter claimed: It had been made clear to them in their absence there was going to be a slimmed down monarchy and they werent really a part of it.Last nights talks saw the -year-old sit down with the Queen, Prince Charles and Prince William for a gruelling two hours at the Norfolk estate to thrash out his future.And this morning, an exhausted Prince William was pictured driving in London amid fears his relationship with Prince Harry has reached an all-time low.The dad-of-three reportedly arrived just  minutes before the summit, then left the estate separately.Despite the pair yesterday uniting to deny claims of bullying, a source overnight said the brothers still had a tense and deeply damaged relationship.My family and I are entirely supportive of Harry and Meghan’s desire to create a new le as a young family.Although we would have preferred them to remain full-time working Members of the Royal Family, we respect and understand their wish to live a more independent le as a family while remaining a valued part of my family.Harry and Meghan have made clear that they do not want to be reliant on public funds in their new lives.It has therefore been agreed that there will be a period of transition in which the Sussexes will spend time in Canada and the UK.These are complex matters for my family to resolve, and there is some more work to be done, but I have asked for final decisions to be reached in the coming days.Meanwhile, it is understood Harry had arrived at Sandringham just after am to sit down by himself with his grandmother before the pm summit.The outcome is that “what Meghan wants, Meghan gets” — the line Harry infamously uttered in a row after the Duchess was stopped from wearing an emerald tiara at her wedding in May .And while Harry is said to have been left heartbroken by the decision, Meghan had warned its not working for me.While Meghan, , was reportedly initially going to phone in from Canada, a palace spokesperson today said: In the end, the Sussexes decided that it wasnt necessary for the Duchess to join.She had fled back to North America just  hours before the couple made the bombshell announcement they no longer wanted to be royals.Now, the Queen has ordered final decisions to be made in the coming days.Kate Middleton, who has reportedly clashed with Meghan in the past, was also not at the meeting.Neither was Prince Philip, with the Queens husband seen leaving Sandringham before the summit - said to be furious over the couples decision.The four royals, the Queen, Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince Harry, are not expected to meet again anytime soon in person - with future discussions to be held on the phone.The Royal Family today continued with their duties, with Prince William hosting awards at Buckingham Palace.Meanwhile, the Duchess of Cornwall stepped out at the University of Aberdeen with Princess Anne, awarding the Princess Royal with an honorary degree.A transition period will now see aides thrash out just what the move will mean - including how the pair will become financially independent, and what,any, changes they will have to their titles.It is unclear what work the couple will do to fund their lestyle, however this week footage surfaced of Prince Harry touting his we to Disney.The Duke was filmed telling Bob Iger, the head of Disney, that Meghan was really interested in voiceover work as the pair attended the Lion King premiere alongside celebs including Beyonce and Jay Z.It has since been revealed Meghans Disney deal will see the corporation make a donation to Elephants Without Borders.The Queens statement appeared to give the couple licence to strike commercial deals as part of their Sussex brand.The pair already have a joint wealth estimated at around £million.Harry inherited nearly £million from his late mother Diana, Princess of Wales, but this will have grown with investment.He is also thought to have had an inheritance from his great grandmother the Queen Mother, so is believed to have around £million to £million.The couple have also suggested their security would continue to be paid by the taxpayer.And while Meghan and Harry have said they plan to live in Canada part-time, the Sun learned they want to eventually make Los Angeles their home.They previously signalled they wished to keep Frogmore Cottage, using it as their home when in the UK.Prime Minister Boris Johnson today weighed in on the royal drama, saying he was absolutely confident that the royal family would be able to resolve the crisis around the Duke and Duchess of Sussexs future roles.The Prime Minister told BBC Breakfast: My view on this is very straightforward: I am a massive fan -

But so far no plan has been revealed because the Elizabeth Tower, which holds the Great Bell known as Big Ben, is being restored. The issue was discussed at a meeting of the House of Commons Commission on Monday. But the cost was estimated at £, - so the idea was ditched. Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle today urged caution over any plan to toll the bell, saying: You are talking about £, a bong. Mr Johnson told the BBC this morning: Because Big Ben is being refurbished, they seem to have taken the clapper away, so we need to restore the clapper in order to bong Big Ben on Brexit night. And that is expensive, so weaposre looking at whether the public can fund it. But the PMaposs official spokesman said that there was no government account to fundraise for the effort. They confirmed that Downing St was in talks with Parliament authorities about securing a fitting tribute. Itaposs understood the bell-ringing stunt could only be facilitatedthe cash was raised by a private crowdfunder.Earlier, SNP MP Stewart McDonald said: A ‘global Britain’ that has to run a crowdfunder to ring the bells of its most famous clock tower.

Runners and riders have been jostling to make their vision heard as they prepare to face off in a contest that will define the future of the Labour Party. Who wins will be defined by Labouraposs ,-ish members - many of whom flocked into the party after  to support Jeremy Corbyn and his left-wing agenda. Long time ally Rebecca Long-Bailey is seen as the aposcontinuityapos candidate to carry Mr Corbynaposs torch. Remainers Emily Thornberry and Keir Starmer have declared their intentions while Wiganaposs Lisa Nandy, a backbencher who warned for years that Labour could lose northern heartlands over Brexit, is also in the frame. Outspoken backbencher Jess Phillips - a firm critic of Mr Corbyn - has also thrown her hat in the ring. Here are all the candidates and potential candidates so far. The new leader will be announced on Saturday  April after a three-month contest to pick the next Labour chief. Candidates had until Monday  January to gain the support of  MPs or MEPs.And they have until Friday th February to secure the backing of either % of constituency parties or % of affiliates . Those who get enough backers to make it onto the ballot paper will then face a vote by full members, union affiliates and registered supporters. Members and union affiliates will have until pm on Monday  January to sign up for a ballot. Or people can sign up for a one-off vote as a registered supporter for £. To do this they have just a -hour window to sign up for a vote in the leadership race - between pm next Tuesday and pm next Thursday. The rule is the same one that was used in , when more than , registered supporters applied in two days. Keir Starmer -   Rebecca Long-Bailey -   Lisa Nandy -   Jess Phillips -   Emily Thornberry -   OUT: Clive LewisOdds Jan  from Ladbrokes. For full profiles and how the contest works click here. Deputy leadership candidates  Angela Rayner Richard Burgon Rosena Allin Khan Dawn Butler Ian Murray OUT: Khalid Mahmood  Runners, riders and betting odds Declared they will definitely run Ladbrokes, January  KEIR STARMER,  -   Holborn  St Pancras  PROFILE: The favourite in internal polls of Labour party members - and is popular among the broader public with Tories privately admitting they’d rather he didn’t get the job. While the shadow Brexit Secretary’s Remain inclinations will no longer be a problem, being a North London man might be. He’s not a union man, but has their respect, and has an impressive CV as he was Director of Public Prosecutions before becoming an MP in . His seriousness and intellect help at the despatch box, but he could do with sometimes showing his lighter side. WHAT HEaposS SAID: He warned the party must not oversteer back to the centre. He said: The case for a radical Labour government has never been stronger”. And he called for the party to take on the narrative that Boris Johnson can aposget Brexit doneapos by the end of January.  REBECCA LONG-BAILEY,  -   Salford  Eccles  PROFILE: John McDonnell’s and other Corbyn alliesapos preferred successor for Jeremy Corbyn, the shadow chancellor has been grooming her for the top job. The shadow business secretary’s quiet demeanour belies a fiery passion for addressing social justice. Laura Pidcock’s failure to win a seat has cleared the way for her to be the candidate of the Left. She says sheaposs seriously considering running for the leadership - and will back flatmate Angela Rayner for the deputy leadershipshe runs. WHAT SHEaposS SAID: The MP confirmed her run with an unapologetic praising of Jeremy Corbynaposs policies - which she helped write. Defending Jeremy Corbyn’s legacy, she wrote in the : “Our transformative agenda is principled and popular, while triangulation and soft pedalling will only take us backwards. We didn’t lose because of our commitments to scrap universal credit, invest in public services or abolish tuition fees.” However, in comments which will be seen as an attempt to dferentiate herself from the Labour leader, she also wrote: From ex-miners in Blythe Valley to migrant cleaners in Brixton, from small businesses in Stoke-on-Trent to the self-employed in Salford, we have to unite our communities. Britain has a long history of patriotism rooted in working le, built upon unity and pride in the common interests and shared le of everyone. To win we must revive this progressive patriotism and solidarity in a form fit for modern Britain.  LISA NANDY,  -   Wigan  PROFILE: The eloquent backbencher was first elected to Parliament in  having worked for homelessness charity Centrepoint and then as senior policy adviser at The Children’s Society. She has been credited as one of the Labour MPs who “gets it” over Brexit, understanding why many Labour supporters in her Greater Manchester seat backed Leave. The half-Indian politician is a member of the Centre for Towns think tank. She quit the frontbench in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum and her attempts to try to break the Brexit deadlock won her plaudits on all sides of the Commons. Her links with powerful Union unite could help any run. Has hinted at a joint bid with David Lammy. WHAT SHEaposS SAID: She argued Labour is facing the last chance to save itself as a whole, not from warring factions, and win back older and working-class voters. Itaposs about whether that traditional coalition that has propelled us into power three times in the last  years can hold good, and whether we can speak for both Lewisham and Leigh.  JESS PHILLIPS,  -   Birmingham Yardley  PROFILE: The powerful voice is one of Labour’s strongest media performers who has the ability to speak “human” and the ability to tack between funny quips and powerful speeches. She is the chair of Labour’s women’s PLP and has been a strong supporter of all-women shortlists - perhaps suggesting she could push for them to be extended to the leadership race. But as she admitted herself on election night, the leadership race is “more than just a personality game and I know that people like me because I have a personality, and that will never just be enough.” WHAT SHEaposS SAID: “Now is not the time to play it safe. What I’ve heard so far in this debate is totally inadequate to the scale of the problem. Voters have changed, the electoral map has been transformed, communication in a social media age is dferent. We need to recognise that politics has changed in a fundamental way by electing a dferent kind of leader. More of the same will lead to more of the same result.”EMILY THORNBERRY,  -   Islington South  Finsbury  PROFILE: An impressive performer - both in front of crowds and on the media. The shadow foreign secretary is a quick thinker, belly-laugh funny and has experience of going up against Boris Johnson at the despatch box. But she quit the frontbench in  after being accused of snobbery by tweeting a picture of a house decked out in St George’s flags, with a white van parked outside. And there are concerns another leader from Islington might not be the answer Labour is looking for. WHAT SHEaposS SAID: She stood by her decision to back a second Brexit referendum, saying Jeremy Corbyn was let down and badly advised by top aides. She also called for the New Year Honours to extend to the dead and said she will promise to quit as leader before an electionthe polls and opinion show she canapost win.  Dropped out CLIVE LEWIS,  Norwich South   PROFILE: A former BBC correspondent Mr Lewis has straddled the ide in the Labour party between Corbynistas and more moderate MPs. He resigned as shadow Defence Secretary after attempts by Mr Corbyn’s office to water down the party’s support for Trident. But the Norwich South MP has also been a vocal supporter of many of the soon to be ex-Labour leader’s policies. Despite being a confident media performer, his profile has been diminished since he left the Shadow Cabinet. And his compromise position means he hasn’t endeared himself to loyalists on either side of the party’s left right ide - meaning he may struggle to pick up support. WHAT HEaposS SAID: He called for the party membership to be given more powers than they were under Corbyn, backed proportional representation and said Labouraposs indecisiveness over Brexit hurt them. In contrast with most current analysis he suggested that the party had still not gone far enough to break with the Blair and Brown era. HOW HE DROPPED OUT: Mr Lewis withdrew from the contest  minutes before the close of PLP nominations. He said: At this stage, it’s clear that I won’t get on the ballot. So, I’m standing aside in the spirit of pluralism, ersity and generosity that I’ve promoted throughout this campaign, so that those who have supported me can recast their nominations.Ruled themselves out BARRY GARDINER,  Brent North    PROFILE: The longest serving MP of the leadership hopefuls, Mr Gardiner has represented Brent North since . Mr Gardiner was a minister under Tony Blair , voted in favour of military action in Iraq in  and nominated David Miliband for leadership in . However, in recent years he has been a loyal defender of Jeremy Corbyn, often picked as the partyaposs spokesman and media defender in the Shadow Cabinet.  The -year-old former City arbitrator is the son of an Olympic footballer and a celebrated surgeon. He was brought up in Glasgow, going on to study at St Andrews. He counts climate change amongst his key concerns, speaking to the media about his potential leadership bid from an environmental conference in Abu Dhabi. In , he became the mayor of Cambridge- the youngest in the city’s  year history. He came under fire during the expenses scandal for owning a second home, despite being based near Westminster. He voluntarily paid back £,.. YVETTE COOPER,  Pontefract  Castleford  PROFILE: Yvette Cooper saw her odds slashed from   to   after she said she was considering throwing her hat into the ring. She is seen as a competent politician having chaired the Home Affairs Select Committee and with respect from MPs from the parliament. But four years ago she lost to Jeremy Corbyn . The former Cabinet minister who came second in the contest in  winning % of the vote compared to Mr Corbynaposs % said she would decide over Christmas whether to enter the race. Ms Cooper, who saw her majority in Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford slashed from , to , last week, said the party needed to move away from the politics of both Mr Corbyn and Mr Blairit was to win back the support of patriotic older voters who abandoned it for the Tories. We cannot just become a party that is concentrated in cities, with our support increasingly concentrated in erse, young, fast-moving areas while older voters in towns think we arenapost listening to them, WHAT SHEaposS SAID: She said both the left and right of the party are seen as internationalist rather than patriotic and Labour mustto its support in towns and former heartlands, not just the erse young fast-moving cities in England. However the Mirror reported she was unlikely to run after taking soundings from colleagues.  IAN LAVERY,  Wansbeck  PROFILE: A bruiser who began his career at Northumberland’s Lynemouth Colliery, Ian Lavery was thrown into politics by the s Miners’ Strike. The -year-old succeeded Arthur Scargill as National Union of Mineworkers President in  before becoming an MP in . The Jeremy Corbyn loyalist, whose region backed Leave by % to %, was one of the few Shadow Cabinet ministers to adamantly back Brexit after the  referendum. That led to clashes between the father-of-two, a football, cricket and boxing fan, and top MPs who wanted to Remain. Despite being Labour’s joint elections co-ordinator since , Mr Lavery very nearly paid a heavy personal price over Brexit. His , majority in Wansbeck was slashed to  in the general election as a ‘red wall’ of Labour heartlands turned blue.Mr Lavery was previously dogged by press coverage about £, he received from a union he ran, which by  had only  recorded members. The money included just under £, in termination payments”, when Mr Lavery was made redundant as general secretary of the NUM Northumberland Area on becoming an MP in May . Mr Lavery has always vehemently denied wrongdoing, either by himself or the union, and the Certication Office for trade unions decided not to investigate further in an October  report. WHAT HEaposS SAID: Talk of a second referendum was seen by many as a way to foist Remain upon them. Communities represented by Labour for generations felt abandoned. It is time to outline a positive vision of the future outside of the EU. Divided parties can’t win. Let’s get back to debating in a forthright but respectful way, remembering what we have in common and stop reinforcing press attacks on our own party. ANGELA RAYNER,  Ashton-under-Lyne  Long tipped for the top job, her back story of rising to the top of politics despite leaving school after getting pregnant at  is inspirational. She later trained as a care worker and eventually became a trade union representative with Unison, who would be likely to back her for the top job. The shadow education secretary has become an increasingly polished performer, but Labour insiders claim that she is still a work in progress.But sheaposs going for the deputy leadership instead. DAVID LAMMY,  Tottenham  PROFILE: The campaigner first entered Parliament in  and served in Tony Blair’s government but failed to be promoted. But he showed he can shape-sht politically after keeping out of many of the factional battles that have rocked Labour since . Instead the ardent Remainer - who also ran for the London mayoral nomination in  - devoted himself to highlighting the Windrush scandal and campaigning against Brexit. Mr Lammy, who would be Labour’s first black leader, may bridge the class ide at the heart of Labour’s woes. He grew up in Tottenham and lost a friend in Grenfell but also studied at Hard and became a barrister. But his outspoken opinions on social media - such as criticising the “white saviour” approach of Comic Relief - have prompted rows in the past.

They put “blood, sweat and tears” into the two-bed dump, bought under a council regeneration scheme. Debbie and Ste were shaken when they first stepped through the door – armed with a £, schedule of works from Liverpool City Council to bring it up to scratch. The th century terraced house had been hit by fire and had crumbling walls, broken bricks and burnt joists. But the couple worked -, did most of the renovations themselves and in  months transformed it into a cosy home for just £,. After enjoying their first Christmas in the double-fronted home in the city’s Wavertree district, the pair have been buoyed by a valuation of £,. Debbie, , says: “We never want to move because we have put so much of ourselves into this house. People thought we were nuts. “We’ve crawled on the floors, we built the floors… it’s a gamble we took and we love it. Our blood and guts have gone into it. If they’d give us next door, we’d do it again!” Recalling the first time she saw the property, Debbie says: “It was just a shell. All the joists were burnt. It was terrible. “Honestly, it was just stacks and stacks of bricks. There was nothing. My family were saying to me, ‘You’re mad’.”  Every floor had to be replaced, chimneys were removed, the sinking kitchen was underpinned, all fittings were ripped out and the windows were upgraded. Debbie and Ste, , used their savings and took a small loan to complete the work – and it was hard graft. We were there until midnight with torches. We went seven days a week, we didn’t miss a day,” Debbie says. She scoured local ads for bargains and bagged a £, kitchen for a tenth of the price and a £, bathroom suite for £,. They also picked up a slightly damaged £, front door for £.  And, slowly but surely, the place came together. Now it is a shining example of how Liverpool is breathing new le into former slums. The council unveiled its Homes For A Pound scheme in . A year later, bosses vowed that , empty houses would be brought back into use. Since then, , homes have been reoccupied – including  in the Webster Triangle, Wavertree, where the Hodges live. Seven more families are due to move in soon. A similar scheme has since been launched in Stoke-on-Trent. Last year, a Channel  documentary about the renovations in Liverpool featured Debbie and Ste.  The couple say the sense of community in the Webster Triangle is a great example of how councils candepressed areas to homely neighbourhoods. The Hodges used to rent in Anfield and had struggled to get a mortgage. Debbie suffered a serious long-term illness and Ste’s wages as a carpet cleaner were not enough to secure a home loan. Debbie says: “The council scheme was the best thing to happen to us. It brings communities together. When we moved in, there were only about three houses in the road occupied. But it’s moving on now, it’s coming to be more of a community and about half the street is filled.  “We’ve met all the neighbours and introduced ourselves. People come from everywhere, dferent areas, dferent countries. It’s a lovely community and I’m really settled here. I just love it. Once a month we clean the street and make it nice. The area is coming up, there are bars and restaurants opening further down the road… I just wouldn’t move. “I can definitely see the area getting better and we’ve never been so happy.” The couple have two daughters – Jade, , a psychologist who has her own home, and -year-old teaching assistant Jenna, who still lives with her parents and is studying for an MSC. Debbie hopes the Homes For A Pound scheme will help young Liverpudlians like Jenna get on the property ladder.

Fair enough, said Harry and Meghan, we will. Cue the eruption. The critics want to have their cake and eat it. As in any dysal situation, they dismiss anything from the Sussexes unless it falls into line with whatever they want. Harry – forced to walk through London behind his mother’s coffin as a -year-old – can’t open up on his mental health issues without being attacked as weak. Meghan can’t breathe without being vilied for showing a lack of consideration to the Queen, the Crown, the flag and the Empire. The Sussexes are not allowed to set their own boundaries. Not when “duty” demands they are there to be pushed around.Of course, race has played a part in it. That much is obvious to large sections of black and white Britain. Yes, Camilla, Diana and Sarah Ferguson were also treated badly, but not like this. Not with the sustained vitriol that Meghan has had to endure. From her son being mocked up as a chimp to criticising her for editing Vogue – even though Prince Harry edited Radio ’s Today programme and Kate edited the Huffington Post website. Social media critics claimed bi-racial Meghan was not pure enough to marry into the Firm. The inference has always been that she doesn’t belong. She has been derided as a a, intent on wrecking the Royal Family. The so-called “constitutional crisis” is Harry and Meghan fighting back.  They are young people who want to go their own way. Millions of families have them. Kids who decide they want no part of the way things have been done in the past, children of rock stars who aren’t interested in music, footballers’ kids who don’t like sport. Frankly, the Sussexes are right to put themselves and their own wellbeing first. Of course, Home Secretary Priti Patel can’t see the problem. She serves under a Prime Minister whose overt racism is well documented. This debate, however, could yet become a turning point for our media. Most of the royal commentators stamping their feet over this are white. Most of the newsrooms covering this are largely white. The real time backlash is from black Britons with a digital  who are determined to have their say.  Angry, polarised race-baiting for social media hits is not the answer. The solution is a better ethnic mix in our media to give us an understanding of how to address this issue. Royal Author Penny Junor was left stumped on CBS This Morning when she vehemently insisted race was not a factor in Meghan’s treatment. “Did you check in with any black Britons before you made that determination ” asked the presenter. Junor was left stuttering. It appeared she hadn’t. All Meghan has done is back her husband as he chooses to move out of his grandmother’s house and fend for himself.

Gathering in the Long Library of the family’s th Century Sandringham estate, the Queen, Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince Harry looked each other in the eye and agreed to find a resolution. Her Majesty had appealed for calm in the face of days of tension from her family and household staff that had threatened to boil over. Those battling against the winds of change as Harry and we Meghan plotted their move away, were beckoned to the table to carve a way forward. With the world’s eyes on a tiny corner of Norfolk, the -year-old monarch presided over one of the most extraordinary days of her seven decade reign. Chairing the meeting, across a large polished table with room for eight chairs, the Queen and her family set out their vision of how a new version of monarchy would emerge. Over the next two hours they thrashed out the framework of a deal to stop the Duke and Duchess of Sussex from permanently turning their backs on the family. But the brutal reality remained, that little more than  months after marrying in a wedding that captured the hearts of the nation, Harry and Meghan had effectively resigned from The Firm citing feelings of relentless pressure and an unsupportive network  The couple, who have patented more than  items from intellectual property to bandanas, plan a takeover on the global stage where they can earn millions with Meghan’s star power and Hollywood connections lining up to help. But with Harry wavering under renewed requests for calm from his beloved grandmother, the hope is the family will still be able to persuade the couple to change tack and plan a soft Megxit to safeguard their future and the monarchy for a generation. Sources close to the negotiations have revealed the family set six main points to be agreed on before real change could take affect.  The six key points Titles The Queen referred to the couple by their first names and not by their titles in her statement. Does this mean they will lose their titles  Finances The couple have been asked to suggest a plan to fulfil their wish to be “financially independent”. Deals to be approved by The Palace. Protection The Queen and other royals have vowed to find a “workable approach” to security issues. Canada has reportedly said it would pay.  Advisers The pair took advice from PR gurus in the US, Sir Elton John and Oprah Winfrey. Senior royals want to know exactly who works for them. Media plan Senior royals will demand to knowHarry and Meghan are planning to do a ‘tell-all’ interview – and who would host it. Where they live Any new home would have to be assessed by the UK security services and Buckingham Palace due to security concerns. What happens next  Crucially with the Queen’s blessing, Harry and Meghan will now split their time between the UK and Canada as “a period of transition” takes place, nullying the need for the immense haste which the Sussexes had been so keen to implement. Central to discussions was the way in which the couple will move towards becoming “financially independent” They revealed they would stop claiming public funds, believed to be in excess of a £million a year, but it is thought they would still claim expenses for travel and office costs Despite being worth more than £million in their own right, the couple are still yet to announce whether they will give up the £. million a year subsidy from Prince Charles from his private income. Their security bill has still to be managed, set between £, and £million, considerably moreiding their time between countries.  They were buoyed today by reports Canadian prime minister has agreed to foot the bill when the duke and duchess are residents in his country. Justin Trudeau had previously tweeted “‘You’re among friends, and always welcome here’” when news broke of the Sussexes escape to Vancouver for their extended break over Christmas and new year. The Queen’s advisors have made clear the Sussexesapos responsibilities moving forward when signing corporate deals and Harry has agreed he would never purposely seek to bring controversy to his family.  He told how neither he nor his we have plans to do a tell all interview after close associates of the couple said that any proposition would not be pretty for the monarchy. Key to any discussions moving forward will be the Queen’s private secretary Sir Edward Young, Prince Charles’s canny private secretary Clive Alderton and William’s top aide and former civil servant Simon Case. Prince Harry’s private secretary, ex-diplomat Fiona Mcilwham, is expected to complete the group. The Sussexesapos living arrangements are to be mapped out by advisors once Harry and Meghan come up with a range of options.  It is expected they will keep their Frogmore Cottage home that was refurbished with £. million of taxpayers cash just last year. After the meeting the three male principals staged a synchronised exit from the estate in separate cars, with Charles later flying from RAF Marham around  miles away to his Scottish retreat Birkhall where he always has a New Year break. As the sun set on the grounds outside the room where discussions had taken place and the satellite vans of the worlds media trundled off, the Queen was left to consider what the future would look for her family and the country she has serves with distinction after this most historic day.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA neglected seven-year-old boy was found living in a home that resembled a rubbish tip, alongside his drug addict parents. The home was found littered with heroin needles, rotting food and infestations of flies when social services and the police arrived. Leicester Crown Court heard the youngster had vanished off the local authorityaposs radar after moving schools - despite not showing up to school for six months, reports Leicestershire Live. Alexander Wolfson, prosecuting, said there was a multi-agency meeting in December , before the police attended an address in Leicester and found it to be in absolute squalor. He said: The conditions were disgusting, with rotting food and piles of rubbish everywhere. The bedrooms, lounge and bathroom were filthy. The kitchen was rancid with a couple of tins of food left open and evidence of mouse droppings. The stove was inaccessible, there was mouldy food in the fridge and it was dficult to move around. Unfortunately drugs paraphernalia was lying about items associated with taking heroin, with uncapped needles. Cigarette ash was evident and flies. Bags of rubbish were on the upstairs landing. When a drawer in the boyaposs bedroom cupboard was opened a cloud of flies flew into the air, said the prosecutor. He added: There were faeces marks across a wall. The toilet was filthy with no evidence of a toothbrush or toothpaste in the bathroom. The child didnapost appear to have a change of clothes and didnapost have pyjamas. He was not wearing underwear or socks. He did not appear to have toys fit to play with. The boy told officers he had eaten some cookies during the day, but did not appear to have had anything . The foster parents he was placed with reported that he did not want to wash, brush his teeth or have his hair washed and was terried of flies. He was always hungry and had dficulty understanding the dference between day and night. He had not been registered with a GP and needed medication for worms.  The child was placed in school and assessed as being two years behind. However, he did not appear to be malnourished or to have any other medical issues. Mr Wolfsen said the child said he had played on an XBox a lot when living with his parents. He ate bread and butter with ketchup and played with the toaster in his fatheraposs bedroom - and went to bed when he liked. When interviewed, the father said multiple bereavements had left him unable to cope, and he went into a drug-induced downward spiral. The mother accepted the house was in a poor condition saying she only lived there because she had nowhere . Both parents, who are not being named because of a court order protecting the boyaposs identity, pleaded guilty to an offence of child cruelty by neglect. Mr Wolfsen said: Heaposs been doing well in short-term foster care and will be placed into long-term foster care. He has a bright future ahead of him. Heaposs desperate to see his mum and dad and is described as being fiercely loyal to them - and asks about them. They are having supervised contact with him. The distressed mother wept in the dock during the hearing.  Judge Ebraham Mooncey said: This is a dficult sentencing exercise. When it involves an innocent child who has clearly suffered, anyoneaposs instincts would be to mete the harshest penalties on those responsible. One has to look at the facts and the circumstances. He told the parents: The prosecutor tells me youaposve had contact with your son and heaposs expressed a desire to continue contact with you and that he loves you both. Heaposs fiercely loyal to both of you. He obviously now has a bright future and the hardship heaposs suffered is potentially something that can be put behind him. Iaposm dealing with two people who werenapost, by any measure, capable of looking after a child. Iaposve been given details about what led to this awful situation arising. Both of you, historically, have drug problems and thataposs affected the way you live your lives. The court heard that one of the childaposs grandparents had been actively involved in helping to properly care for the boy at a dferent address, but when she died he ended up living where with his parents.  Other deaths in the family led to his father relapsing into former class A drug addiction. The judge said: The photographs of the house speak for themselves. Some of the rooms look like rubbish tips. Heroin needles were around, there was rotten food and flies. A police officer says, in his statement, he retched and almost threw up when he went into the house. Itaposs very fortunate the child has made a full recovery. This wasnapost evil out-and-out cruelty. The parents are themselves incapable and inadequate. There are positive measures now in their lives, in the sense of dealing with their addictions. Philip Gibbs, mitigating for the father, who is in his s, said: The defendant loves his son. Itaposs clear from the photographs he failed in his duty to care for his son.  He says prior to moving there the boy was perfectly looked after. The father, who had been clean of drugs for several years before relapsing, disagreed with some of the prosecution claims, saying the boy was given baths but had an aversion to bathing. He was taken out, he was also fed - as there was evidence of cereal boxes and take-aways. The boy had been taught how to use a kne and fork, it was claimed. He and the childaposs mother accept they struggled to maintain the house, said Mr Gibbs. The father claimed he did not seek help for fear of having his son taken away. Mr Gibbs said: He apologises to his son over and above all . They have supervised contact and the bond remains. The child loves his dad and his mum - itaposs a human tragedy. Itaposs alarming a child can disappear out of the school system for thatof time. The boy went into foster case without any real medical concerns and has thrived.

She was brilliant, always smiling, even at the end.” Debbie first became ill in February  when she woke up one morning with excruciating back pain and a chest infection. As her pain persisted, she decided to get checked out and a CT scan and biopsy revealed she had a mass on her left lung.  Doctors told Debbie and Sam the devastating news that she had terminal cancer which could only be managed by treatment. Debbie was determined to carry on with le as normal and created a Facebook page, Nurse with the big “C”urse, where she regularly posted photos and updates about her treatment and future plans. She said last year: “I didn’t want sympathy or pity, I just wanted my story to be heard, because when you are given a diagnosis like this, you can have all your close family and friends with you but still feel so isolated, scared and alone.” She spoke of the challenge of living with cancer, saying: “It’s one of the last things I think of at night and within minutes of being awake, it’s there at the forefront of my mind. “I try to distract myself thinking of all the wonderful things I am yet to experience and places I need to visit. It helps me to cope. “I need those goals to aim towards so that on the bad days, it’s my loved ones, goals and memories that get me through.” After Debbie and Sam got married they spent time in Ibiza and Rhodes, despite her illness. Her family announced her death with a post on the Facebook page.  It urged people to “hold on to everyone you love a little tighter and a little longer tonight and never take the good times for granted because le can be so cruel and snatch those precious moments away.”Sam said: “We still did Christmas dinner and everyone came round. In fact, more people came round than we expected.“We had about  to  people. It’s what she would have wanted.” Her funeral at South Leicestershire crematorium was attended by around  people where Chanel read out a poem that was written especially for the occasion.  Sam and around  family friends are taking part in a charity bike ride from Leicester to Skegness in aid of Loros Hospice, who provided care for Debbie in her final weeks. They also plan to keep the blog and Facebook page going. Asked what advice he would give to a family whose loved one had just been given a terminal cancer diagnosis, Sam said: “Everyone takes things dferently, it’s such a hard thing to deal with. “You have to try and be as positive as possible. Look into all the options you have got.

The carnage is expected to sweep across the country this evening after Ireland and Scotland took a battering, with ferries cancelled and thousands of homes and businesses left without power. The Met Office has a severe weather warning in place for the west of the UK, the island of Ireland and the north-east coast of Scotland, lasting until midnight. Met Eireann, the Irish National Meteorological Service, put out an orange wind warning for the entire country which is feared could bare the brunt of the storm whipping in from the Atlantic. Drivers are being urged to take extra care on the roads as the hazardous conditions caused a trampoline to blow on to the M motorway near to Limerick. A bin lorry was blown over on the Isle of Wight, injuring the driver. A large tree was ripped from the ground and blocked the A at Maybole in South Ayrshire. Flight SK from Copenhagen to Aberdeen had to ert to Edinburgh Airport having tried and failed to land twice in the punishing storm. Multiple flood warnings are in place with eight places in England being warned to take immediate action.The warnings currently include an area of the Tyne estuary, the River Trent at Alkborough Flats and Preston Beach on the Dorset coast. Meanwhile there are  flood alerts - meaning flooding is possible, in England. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency  has also issued  flood warnings and  flood alerts for Scotland.  Around , homes and businesses were without power on Monday afternoon in the Republic of Ireland, while power cuts were also suffered across Northern Ireland, mostly in the North East. Meteorologist Helen Roberts, from the Met Office, said road conditions could be quite nasty for commuters. Surface water on the roads from heavy rain throughout the afternoon has the potential for really nasty conditions, she said, while the AA advised drivers to take extra care due to fallen branches and debris. The Met Office warned that delays to road, rail, air and ferry transport are expected, making things particularly dangerous for high-sided vehicles on exposed routes and bridges. There could also be some short-term loss of power and other services. Great Western Railway said services between Plymouth and Penzance will run at a reduced speed until the end of the day due to strong winds.Lines have reopened at Preston following severe weather conditions on Monday morning which caused debris to fall from the station roof on to the tracks, according to Network Rail. An mph gust was recorded on South Uist in the outer Hebrides at pm on Monday, the strongest in the UK so far, while a mph gust hit Capel Curig in Wales. Several Caledonian MacBrayne ferry services were affected, with some services cancelled due to adverse weather and others disrupted, while NorthLink Ferries told passengers there may be disruption on services to Orkney and Shetland.  The blustery and wet conditions could continue to bring widespread disruption on Tuesday, as the Met Office has issued another yellow weather warning of wind covering much of England for a -hour period. A yellow rain warning of rain has also been issued for south-east England on Tuesday afternoon, which is expected to be in place until Wednesday morning. It is actually a dferent area of low pressure, although it is all sort of wrapped up in Storm Brendan, Ms Roberts said. The winds could well be as strong tomorrow, we could see -mph winds inland.  Three further severe weather warnings have been issued for Tuesday, as the misery continues, A warning for severe wind across England and Wales lasts from noon to midnight on Tuesday and  : GMT until midnight. There is a warning for ice in northern Scotland and the third warning, for heavy rain, covers south-east England from pm on Tuesday to am on Wednesday.

The trend has ided opinion online with some branding the spate as aposbullyingapos. A series of videos show drivers lurking in their cars as postmen go about delivering mail in the UK. The drivers then start playing the vintage cartoon song at full volume as they relentlessly follow the postmen on their delivery rounds. The trend, believed to have started on Tik Tok, surged in popularity last week after an old video featuring the prank re-surfaced. Postmen seen in the video have reacted dferently to the music - with some laughing off the lyrics and others appearing to take offence at the antics.In one video uploaded on Sunday, the postman becomes increasingly disgruntled as he continues to be stalked by the social media user.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA woman who suffered seven heartbreaking miscarriages is finally about to become a mum - thanks to her best friend of  years. Sophie Smith, , and her husband Jack, , had given up hope of ever becoming parents to their own children after spending six years and £, on IVF desperately trying to conceive. The couple, from Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, went through five devastating miscarriages and two ectopic pregnancies that required both of her fallopian tubes to be removed - leaving Sophie unable to have children of her own. But their despair turned to joy when Sophieaposs best friend, Emiliana Hall, stepped in and offered to carry a baby for the couple. The mum-of-two was pregnant with her son Theo, now two, at the time but was determined to give her friends ‘the greatest gt of le’.  And now, the best pals - who stuck up a friendship on their first day in secondary school - are delighted to be shopping for baby-grows together as Emiliana is six-months pregnant with Sophie and Jackaposs baby. Sophie, a fashion buyer, said: I believe it was fate that I met Em at -years-old during our first year of secondary school. “If someone had told me  years ago, that one of my best friends would go on to carry my genetic baby I would have laughed. “But all that time has been building up this moment, one I now believe was always meant to be. “We have always had a strong friendship, even after she once ordered four taxis to turn up to my house at am on a school night as a joke. “She has saved us from our immense pain and given us back our hope by offering to be our surrogate.  In , Sophie fell pregnant for the first time - two weeks ahead of Emiliana – sadly an early scan at seven weeks for Sophie revealed an ectopic pregnancy. She said: “It was pretty much what you always dream about - sharing pregnancy and motherhood at the same time as my best friend. But on the day, Em told me she was pregnant too I was experiencing stomach pains. “I was rushed to AE after a scan revealed an ectopic pregnancy - this resulted in tube removal. “It was incredibly scary and emotionally heart-breaking. “It was dficult for both of us to be on very dferent paths to parenthood, but we it never affected our friendship. It had been six years of emotional turmoil for the fashion buyer who never got to hear a heartbeat as she miscarried at six to seven weeks each time. Emiliana would always offer a shoulder to cry on and would be one of the first to find out about Sophie’s heartache. She said: “Em would always come around, even when I didn’t want to talk but she would be there to support us. “It never got any easier and I began to feel like I constantly had a lump permanently in my throat.  “It became so painful to hear someone  get pregnant and to hear that they had seen a heartbeat on a scan. “The envy and jealousy were immense and then the guilt about feeling this way would set in and the vicious circle continued. “But I would still be there as much as I could for friends pregnancies, baby showers and when babies arrived as it was always my priority to not let my infertility affect friendships. “I guessed Em was pregnant with Theo, I had been through five miscarriages, so I was familiar with the signs of somebody not wanting to tell me. “She was pretty quiet and said we need to meet up, so I knew straight away – it is bittersweet because I was happy for her but sad for me. “I became pretty depressed my mental health definitely took a nosee - I felt like I was just surviving le watching everyone  move on and have babies of their own. “ During Emiliana’s second pregnancy, the grieving couple took a career break and spent two months travelling around Australia – on their , Sophie suffered another ectopic pregnancy. She describes it as the ‘nail in the coffin’ as her second fallopian tube was removed.  Although they had never thought about surrogacy before, Emiliana offered whilst pregnant as she wanted to put an end to their pain. Emiliana, who is a hypnobirthing teacher, said: “I thought about being a surrogate for two months before proposing the idea to Sophie as it isn’t the type of thing you can say and go back on. “I wanted to make sure I was serious and that my partner James was happy for me to go ahead with it. “I think him seeing Jack in so much emotional pain over the years has made it an easy decision for him too. “We often say, ‘nine months of our lives for their whole le to change’. “I wrote a letter to Sophie and Jack, so they had it in writing and to show I really meant it.” Four-year-old Mollie and Theo, two, were read a children’s book on surrogacy so they can understand.

Gemma Copeland, , was visiting Schoenbrunn Zoo while on holiday in Vienna, Austria, with her -week-old son Jasper and partner Shane, , last Thursday. The trio were close to the orangutan enclosure when Gemma realised Jasper needed to feed. As she sat down against the glass to feed her son, a female orangutan began watching her intently and kissing and putting her hand on the glass. Shane managed to capture the emotional -minute long encounter on his phone. Mum-of-one Gemma, a nail technician from Stockport, Gtr Manchester but now living in Cheshire, said she was left in tears by the incredible display of animal compassion. She said: “I’m mad on travelling and animals and when I booked a cheap flight to Vienna I noticed that they have the oldest zoo in the world. “During our visit, I realised we nearly missed out on seeing the orangutans so we turned around and went back.  “We couldn’t see them in their enclosure so we just said ‘let’s go home’, but I realised that they had come back out when we turned away so we went to go and look. “I went to the window for a closer look and sat down by the window so my son could see the orangutan who was roughly five or six foot away – I didn’t want to frighten her so I made myself smaller so I could take a picture. “She then got up, carried a piece of cloth to the window and sat down with me. “She looked directly into my eyes then placed her hand up asto touch my son. I was in awe of this beautul creature already. “My son wanted feeding and as it was quiet I fed him whilst I sat there. “The way the orangutan reacted took my breath away she kept looking at me, then my son then back again. “She sat with me for approximately half an hour, and kept stroking the glass and lay down next to me asto support and protect me. “I was absolutely gobsmacked and got quite a crowd of people turning up to see what was going on – people were sat watching quietly and respectfully. “It was really lovely and I didn’t want to leave – it felt incredible and I was crying so much because I couldn’t take it in.”  After Gemma shared the heart-warming moment on Facebook for her friends and family to see, it went viral – racking up millions of views, likes and shares. The new mum has since discovered the orangutan, Sol, had previously given birth to a stillborn infant, making the experience even more emotional.

Some things you might get away with when it’s more open, you don’t.“Inverness were good at it last week. They sit with six players behind the ball and maybe cheat with a couple up the park and counter you well.“We need to find the answers to open teams up.”Dundee’s form going into last weekend’s clash with Caley Thistle was good with two wins and two draws in their previous four.However, consistency has consistently been the downfall for the Dark Blues this season.That four-game spell in December was their best since August and Hemmings knows it’s something the team have to improve on.He added: “We’re tired talking about it, to be honest.“We’ve had moments where we think we’re getting there and we’re away on a good run but have games like Inverness last week.“We can’t just do it for three or four games but we need seven or eight in a row to really assert ourselves.“The performances going back to the second half against Arbroath had been really good.“We’ve been positive in the way we’ve played, some good performances.“Last week was a chance to close the gap on Inverness and go level on points with them. It was disappointing in that regard.“This will be another big game because Ayr are a good team and we need to pick ourselves back up.”Tomorrow’s clash comes after tests against league leaders Dundee United, second-placed Inverness and ahead of a dficult Scottish Cup tie at home to high-flying Premiership side Motherwell.It’s a testing run for the players but Hemmings is relishing the chance to get back out and into a big match.He said: “It is good to have another big game this weekend.“We knew there were three big home games in a row with the Scottish Cup the week after.“That’s what you want – you always want to test yourself as a player.“It’s a good game to jump back into.”The last meeting with Ayr saw Dundee leave Somerset Park with an impressive - victory. That night saw plenty of tackles flying about and Hemmings expects no dferent this time around.“Whatever way they go, it’ll be a dficult game for us, we know that.“It was a tough game down there and a bit tasty as well – I expect the same this weekend.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/01/19755586-940x551.jpg ","title":"dundee 0 2 inverness dismal dee drop to fourth with ict defeat","story":"Dundee dropped to fourth in the Championship table as they fell to a - defeat to Inverness at Dens Park.First-half goals from Aaron Doran and James Keatings did the damage as John Robertson#s Caley Jags strengthened their grip on second spot.Ayr winning at Dunfermline meant the Dark Blues dropped to the fourth and final promotion play-off spot,  points behind leaders Dundee United.Dee boss James McPake stuck with the same line-up which earned a point in the Dundee derby with -year-old Fin Robertson starting in the middle of the park after a terric display at Tannadice.Inverness were the first to threaten but Nikolay Todorov could only head Miles Storey#s cross over the bar after three minutes.Caley skipper Carl Tremarco went closer on nine minutes as he got on the end of another Storey cross after a period of pressure. However, Dark Blues keeper Jack Hamilton gathered the header comfortably.Hamilton then made a smart stop from a whipped Keatings free-kick minutes later as the visitors continued to push for the opener.On  minutes Charlie Trafford forced a routine save out of Hamilton before, just a minute later, Inverness got the goal their play deserved.In acres of space down the right, full-back Shaun Rooney had the freedom of Dens Park to pick out Doran in the centre of the box and the Irish attacker duly lashed home from  yards.On  minutes, ICT were two to the good. From their own corner, Dundee compounded to lose possession and allowed the Highlanders to break.Former Dundee United man Keatings led the charge and finished the counter attack off himself, coolly slotting beyond a helpless Hamilton in the home goal.The Dark Blues huffed and puffed for the remainder of a dismal first half for them but were unable to lay a glove on Inverness as the boos rang out among the sizeable home support on the half-time whistle.Four minutes into the second period, Dundee forced Mark Ridgers into his first save of the afternoon as the ICT goalie stooped to turn Jordan Marshall#s long-range effort behind for a corner.Jordan McGhee was next to test Ridgers, firing in a dipping effort just before the hour mark, but the Caley stopper was able to gather.Moments later, Paul McGowan#s header from a deep Sean Mackie cross forced Ridgers to tip over as the Dee sought a way back into the contest.On  minutes, Kane Hemmings laid in Marshall but the left-back saw his effort from  yards deflected behind.Inverness# front four continued to look threatening but, largely, the Dee defence kept them quiet in the second .However, McPake#s men were unable to carve a way through an organised ICT defence with the rookie boss cutting a frustrated and under-pressure figure throughout.With Ayr and Dunfermline to face next, Dundee will certainly need to perform a lot betterthey are to stay in the mix for the promotion play-offs come the end of the season.Dundee XI : HamiltonKerr, Meekings , McGhee, Marshall Robertson, Dorrans, McGowan, MackieJohnson , Hemmings.Subs not used: Ferrie , Forster, Byrne, Moore and Cameron.Inverness XI : RidgersRooney, Donaldson, McHattie, TremarcoTrafford , Vincent StoreyKeatings Doran Todorov .Subs not used: Mackay , McCart, Curry and MacGregor.Referee: Don Robertson.Att: ,."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/SNS-19595223-Dundee-United-v-Dunfermline-803x564.jpg ","title":"lawrence shankland has full focus on united as they hunt title","story":"He’s a wanted man in the January transfer window but Dundee United hitman Lawrence Shankland says it would be criminal for him to take his eyes off the prize as they hunt down the Championship title.United sit  points clear at the top of the table with  games left to play and -goal talisman Shanks insists his full focus is on getting the Tangerines over the line, not the speculation linking him with a move away from Tannadice.The -year-old Scotland striker has been linked with teams both sides of the border but he says until United tell him dferently, it’s all guns blazing in their quest for silverware.“I don’t take interest in it, to be honest,” he said.“I’ve said before that until someone from Dundee United comes to speak to me about it then it’s none of my business really.“It’s all just speculation and rumours, so I won’t take any interest in it at all.“If the time comes when somebody does speak to me then I’ll deal with it then but it’s not something I’m getting too caught up with.“I’m really enjoying it here and the team’s going well, firing at the top of the league, so I don’t see why I’d be choking to get out.“We need to be looking forward now because we’ve got ourselves a good gap at the top.“It would be silly for us to ignore that because we’ve got ourselves in a good position but that’s only the case right now.“We need to kick on and keep winning games because,we keep doing that, the closer we’ll get and the less wins we’ll need.“Until that point we’ll just need to keep taking it one game at a time, batting them off and picking up three points most weeks.”Shankland will come up against his former boss at Ayr United, Ian McCall, as the Terrors head to Glasgow to take on his current side Partick Thistle tomorrow.And he admits United are wary of a team who have won three out of their last five in the league.“It’s going to be a tough game, especially down there,” he added.“Last time we were - down and had to come back after half-time. Up here it was tight at - until about the hour mark and then we got the goal.“From going in front in both games it was all about defending and seeing it out. We know what to expect from Partick, it’s going to be a hard game.“I know Ian McCall well and he always has his teams set up properly, no matter where he goes.“Fingers crossed we can get a result but we need to be wary. The squad and players they’ve got have quality but maybe just haven’t picked up until now.“They’ve turned it around since the start of the season, so it will be a tough fixture again.”Without a goal in his last two games, by his remarkably high standards, Shankland is experiencing a drought he’s keen to end. vw, px\"  He said: “Last season I did the same, scoring loads up until January then I picked up a wee injury and only scored one every two games, so it wasn’t a bad rate!“Everybody jumped on the bandwagon that I hadn’t scored but it was one in two, soI can do that for the rest of the season I’d be quite happy again.“The main thing for me is getting back on the scoresheet this week.”However, he is pleased to see others like Nicky Clark now chipping in.“It was always going to happen, it was never going to be one guy scoring the goals the full time.“We know that the boys will chip in. It just took Clarky to get his first goal and then he kicked on from there.“It’s the same for a lot of people but I don’t really care who scores, to be honest, as long as we’re picking up three points each week I’ll be quite happy.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/DNic_Taw_Teams_Podcast-7-846x564.jpg ","title":"taysides emergency departments are top performing in uk","story":"Tayside emergency department have been named the top performing AE in the UK.NHS Tayside’s emergency departments consistently exceed the % four-hour waiting goal, with the latest weekly figure showing that .% of patients were seen within this time frame despite the increased pressure on hospital staff during the festive period.A statement from the health board said: #Over the past few weeks and including the festive period public holidays, it has been, as expected, an extremely busy time for the service who saw over , patients.#Despite this increase, the teams were able to provide high-quality care to those who contacted the out-of-hours service and this was due to the hard work and commitment of staff within the service.#NHS Tayside chief executive Grant Archibald added: “I am extremely proud that NHS Tayside consistently achieves the four-hour target.#This is as a result of the dedicated staff within the emergency department and the wider multi-disciplinary teams right across the organisation and also our colleagues in the Health and Social Care Partnerships, councils and Scottish Ambulance Service.“NHS Tayside has always performed well against national unscheduled care performance standards and we are all committed to maintaining and striving to improve this performance.“This year’s winter plan details a whole system response to the additional demand.

Its dog-eared pages contain neatly-typed records, precise drawings and fascinating photographs.The log#s mystery is deepened by the fact no names are given other than the nicknames #Tanky#, #Bosun#, #Skipper# and #Pilot#. The only crew member named is pet dachshund #Major#.The log does record the Fulmar#s home port was Tighnabruaich and the owner was RG Mowat, but few details on Mr Mowat could be found.Lord Weir of Lochhead, Achahoish, contacted the newspaper to pass on information on Commander Ralph G Mowat.During the Second World War, Commander Mowat was a Royal Navy Captain, latterly in command of a cruiser. At the end of the war, he and his ship entered Copenhagen, where he took the surrender of the German troops.Clive Brown from Ardfern added some post-war detail. He revealed: #Commander Ralph G Mowat, RN , was a distinguished member of Clyde Cruising Clubbest known as being, for  years, the honorary editor of the CCC Sailing Directions . These were # and indeed remain # a #must have# for everyone who navigates their way among the many lochs and islands of Scotland#s west coast. They were colloquially known as the #Blue Book# and published at that time as a hardback. He also served as CCC Rear Commodore -.#Mr Brown also provided an extract from the book #Clyde Cruising Club, The First One Hundred Years -# which states Ralph Mowat received an RYA Award for services to yachting in  but refused to accept honorary membership of the club. In recompense, his widow Mary was elected an honorary member in , after his death.Tighnabruaich man Alan Wilson contacted Clyde sailing legend Ian Nicolson, who was fairly sure he recalled racing against the #Fulmar# in the s.Mr Nicolson said:#Old Man Mowat, as I remember him, was a typical ex Royal Navy officer. He treated me as a young upstart, which I was, but we got on well because I wrote a bit for Clyde Cruising Club publications. He lived in Clarkston on the edge of Glasgow.#Clyde Cruising Club itself cannot help with information on the Fulmar. Club secretary Jenner Rollands contacted the Advertiser and confirmed CCC sadly lost all its records when the Carrick, moored on the River Clyde, sank in . At the time, the club#s office was aboard her.Closer to home, Ardrishaig man Billy Paterson called into the Advertiser offices to say his father, Ardrishaig Primary School headmaster Gilbert Paterson, had crewed the yacht Fulmar.Mr Paterson still has mementoes from his father#s trips in the form of gts from Commander Mowat, including a paperweight from , a copper and brass barrel ashtray dated  and a brass model yacht with #Fulmar # engraved on it.Thanks to everyone who contacted the Advertiser with their memories.We now know a little more about Commander Ralph G Mowat, RN , owner of the Fulmar.Details about the crew of #Tanky#, #Bosun# and #Pilot# remain, however, sketchy, soanyone out there knows any more#"},{"url":null,"title":"my new year resolution is","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards"},{"url":null,"title":"plenty of christmas room at the inn","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowInveraray Senior Citizens committee hosted its annual Christmas lunch in the Inveraray Inn.The event, on Sunday December  for senior citizens of Inveraray, was well attended with everyone enjoying a delicious meal and musical entertainment provided by Lochgilphead#s Easy Club.During the festivities, the committee presented flowers to Diane MacDonald, who is retiring from the committee after nine years."},{"url":null,"title":"a mid argyll rugby blast from the past","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTayvallich reader Donald Carmichael handed in this black and white photograph of a Mid Argyll Rugby Club team of many decades ago.But can our readers name the players  And what background can you give us about this photograph and Mid Argyll Rugby club at the time Contact the Argyllshire Advertiser by email: editor@argyllshireadvertiser with any information."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 27 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLooking back over the last  months, no single story has dominated the headlines in these pages, but there have been important themes.There are the negative trends, of course.

Three events all within a stones throw of Mid Argyll.Jamie Miller was the only local to enter this event, starting his Scottish Tarmac Rally Championshipcampaign for the year in the rapid  Citroen CR. Paul Hunter, swapping his pacenotes for spanners, was on hand to assist Jamie throughout the season. Conditions were said to have been tricky as Knockhill has its own micro-climate, which consists purely of rain, wind, snow, ice, wind and wind. Sadly it wasn#t to be at Knockhill for the team with mechanical failure ending their day after stage two.The first closed road event to take place in England, after the approval of closed road rallying for the UK, was the first event for the famousGTi. Unfortunately for Kirsty Mochrie her licence can only be upgraded to stage events from single venue use when she turns , so it was theof the pairing of Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter to represent Mid Argyll south of the border. The pair, finding the conditions tricky in the narrow lanes after the top seed cars had been pulling mud from verges and ditches, managed to bounce the wee metro over the first loop of four stages until the gearbox had enough on the fth test.Following the cancelling of Inverness# Snowman Rally earlier in the year, this was now first round of the Scottish Rally Championshipfor Dougie Watt and Ian Parker, and it was interesting to say the least. A glance outside in the morning to see about four inches of snow lying on the roof of the MK Escort was a surprise for a start. A very wet and muddy day saw the pair make it to the finish in one piece which is more than can be said for the clutch cable that snapped about one mile into the final stage, however clinching their first class win of the season was the best start to the championship.With Kirsty #Wee Mo# Mochrie in the co-drivers seat in the rapid Corsa of Steven Hay , a fair pace was set by the pair throughout the day sitting as high as th until they unfortunately had to take a split early to save damaging the car. Back out the next stage and still setting a blistering top  pace in the Corsa, including some hang time on both the jumps.Jamie, back out in the fit C, had bad luck once again. This time an overshoot on a square right and a struggle to get the car started again after a stall sadly earned him a stage max on stage two. Still setting top  times on the day he ended nd which was a fair effort when you include a stage maximum time.Ian was out this time with Fraser #Flat oot Fraz# Smithafter winning an entry to the rally at the STRC Awards in January. Flying out the gates and onto their second lap on the first stage then pop, driveshaft burst. Towed in and sorted, both covered in CV Grease, they made it back out for a skid around and on a mission to tear up some old tarmac tyres.The Granite Stages, now held at RAF Leuchars would see Eoghan Anderson make ato the passenger seat for a hurl in the immaculate MK Escort of Martin Murray. Smiling ear to ear all day, with Bill eagerly awaiting histo the service area for the stage report, they finished th overall.Ian was out with Greg Inglisin his fluorescent Orange Lotus Exige and it was eyes on the prize for STRC points for Greg. A clean day saw Greg really getting to grips with the car on some surprisingly fast stages including a tickle of the limiter in fth saw the pair finish third overall.Back together and with the small repairs from the Speyside done it was time for the Furnace MK toto the woods. A steady run over the opening two stages, Dougie and Ian found their feet after the #off# at the Speyside sent them into service lying th. From seeing their overall position they knew they had to get back into it on the next stage, however on the road section to start stage three there was issues selecting gear and the pair decided to call it a day # damage limitation was the right call, as the input shaft was on its last legs.Jamie was back on the pace for this one, setting a th fastest stage time on the opening test. Sitting th overall heading into stage five was impressive given the competition on the day. Bad luck unfortunately, however, was to .Eoghan was again out with Martin in the MK for a blast. Sadly it was an early bath, retired after stage two but again, as always, enjoying every minute while it lasted.The Argyll rally had been known to have rough and challenging stages the previous two years. Not this time. Ian and Dougie couldn#t believe how good the stages were in comparison to previous years, an absolute joy of an event with the Escort not missing a beat all day on its #shakedown# for the big one. Valuable class points added to the scorecard too, with them ending the event nd overall. The rally had struggled with entries this year and will now run in  as a closed road rally, run by Mull Car Club.Team Mochrie were back together for this one in the Mightyagain and Innes was cutting some questionable shapes in the garage, performing his annual Mach rain dance. Taking chunks of time from his first passes of the stages would see them ring the #s neck and clinch th.Jamie#s luck had finally turned, the C singing all weekend and netting him a topper of th overall and th fastest over the final stage too.Duncan Maclean was back in the driving seat with Ian alongside, giving himself and the car a shakedown before Mull. The freshly rebuilt #blue bullet# was looking superb and managed to finish looking just as sweet. A couple of small teething problems were sorted on the day and the new main focus was to have power steering fitted before Mull # poor Dochy lost about a stone over two days with the effort needed to swing the wee pug around the #s and chicanes.In August Dougie and Ian competed on the Vetomies Rally. A national grade event run alongside the WRC Rally Finland event. Three other crews from Scotland also headed over to sample #the fastest rally in the world#. The stages were unbelievable. Fast, cresty, wide, flowing with a brilliantly smooth surface. The whole event was just surreal. The duo finished the event th overall and more importantly the fastest Scottish crew.Once the car had ed from Finland it was quickly jacked up, checked and loaded onto the trailer the same day for the journey north. Due to two DNFson the Speyside and Scottish, Dougie and Ian had to make the trip to be in with any chance of regaining their class lead in the SRC. Ending the day first in the class meant they were heading into the final round with the lead.Jamie was back out for another counting round of the STRC. Enjoying his day and pushing the wee C on in the blistering heat netted Jamie and co-driver Ian Mccullochrd overall. He must have been relaxed in the heat as in between stages he was off with the overalls and on with the baby lotion, topping up the tan.Ian was back out with Greg in the Lotus. Another fantastic drive from Greg, finishing ninth with the championship title race firmly the primary goal.The final round for the MK and an important one # a DNF here could see Dougie and Ian losing the class lead in the championship. A battle with their rival who they had been chasing all season, Paddy Munro, would come down to the last stage, as the pair were six seconds down on Paddy heading into the final test. Probably one of the duo#s best stages all year, the final push to claim the class honours came down to the finish of the last stage on the last rally of the year. One second! They had taken the class win and the championship.The first event this year for Craig Callander and son Ross would see them prepare Craig#s gravel spec Subaru Impreza at the last minute to take on their favourite event. The #Japanese Tractor# was a fair handful, a light steering alignment issue and a boost problem gave the pair some trouble although finishing th overall made up for the hassle. A fair result given Craig#s absence from tarmac for four years.Returning from the shed with his freshly painted Sunbeam was Alister Macarthur, this time with Claire Tilleyalongside. The freshly fettled #beam was looking and sounding good # crossing the finish th overall after two years out of the seat.Dochy and Ian were back out in the #blue bullet.# All was going well until they had a spin coming over a crest into a square left, losing the bumper and damaging the gear linkage. They managed to get the car back to the end of the Saturday afternoon leg to repair the gear linkage and almost stole the yellow bumper from the recce car until some legends appeared with the duo#s bumper in the back of their Land Rover. Back out onto the  mile #long one# on Saturday night and they had an issue # after a heavy landing over a crest the rear shocker bolt broke, making the car a handful to keep in a straight line. They had to finish another two stages before they could make it back to service, so a finish was all they wanted at this point # th overall and Dochys fourth finish in a row on Mull.Without doubt the driver to watch was Innes and his newly acquired co-driver Lewis Grfiths . The Mightywas spotted airborne at any chance, with the hydro can suspension screaming for a break at each service halt. It was almost all over as the nearside cv joint sheared and the car took a wild turn to the left # both Innes and Lewis thought they would end up IN the Belachroy pub. They managed to make it over the Lochs to the end of the final stage, claiming st overall.Eoghan was back out with Martin to settle the score from the DNF at the summer stages. Sadly a stage maximum time on stage two scuppered their chances of the overall result they were hoping for, however they did set some impressive times, clocking a th fastest time on the final stage.Jamie, back out for the final round of the STRC, was looking to continue his good run from the Pendragon and set a seventh fastest time on stage three in the extremely wet and tricky conditions. Trying to get his money#s worth from his entry fee Jamie, however, decided to take an extra couple of miles on the penultimate stage. Still, the C ran well all day and the conditions suited the car perfectly.Ian was back out with Greg and this time he was aiming to become the Scottish Tarmac Rally Champion for . They set off with five cars in the same class and they had to win the class to get Greg the honours. Setting the pace early they were leading throughout the event. Finishing the event first in their class and third overall meant the job was done # Greg claimed the championship win.The last event of the year saw Kirsty back in the co-drivers seat, gaining even more experience on her path to upgrading her licence. Some typical Knockhill weather was in store as Kirsty had her first taste of RWD rallying in the Mazda MX of Paul Sheard. Kirsty guided Paul around the very wet stages to claim th overall and some valuable points on the board for Paul#s Motorsport News Championship campaign.Special thanks to Alasdair MacConnell who has travelled many miles to don an orange bib and stand in the rain, wind and heat, all to show his support and play a vital part in any event.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

Scotlandrsquos train operator, Abellio, has posted losses for a third consecutive year. Prior to Christmas, I made it clear in Holyrood that delays and cancellations on the Borders Railway were unacceptable and I questioned the Scottish Governmentrsquos decision to terminate Abellio ScotRailrsquos contract early in .I believe the move will cause disruption to passengers and puts into question job security for current employees. Even Dominic Booth, Abellio UKrsquos managing director, said: lsquoScotlandrsquos railway needs stability, not the upheaval a change in the franchise would bring aboutrsquo. I completely agree, and I hope that investment in our railway isnrsquot halted as a result.More fuel to the fire came over Christmas, when it was revealed that Abellio ScotRail said it had ended the past financial year pound million in the red, owing pound million to its owner, the nationalised railway of the Netherlands. It now seems that Dutch taxpayers are subsidising our failing train services. This is on top of the Scottish Government subsidies, which make up about half of its pound billion revenues.We need a viable solution to ScotRailrsquos woes, and terminating franchises early or nationalisation is not the answer. We need better accountability and long-term planning to ensure we see the fortunes of ScotRail turn around.The Borders tourism can offer a more peaceful alternative to bustling CapitalI was not surprised to see that Edinburgh was revealed as having the fourth highest ratio of tourists to locals in the world. This is after Miami, Las Vegas and Dubai, and it sits well above th placed London. Statistics show there are nearly  tourists for every  residents in Edinburgh, and it begs the question, are we really managing the impact of tourism well Annually our Capital city is influxed with tourists for the Hogmanay celebrations and the Fringe. Whilst it great to see tourism booming in Edinburgh, we need to see more affirmative action to encourage tourists to see more of Scotland, including the Borders. We are located only an hour south of Edinburgh, yet we see very little of the footfall.We need to see incentives and drivers for visitors to explore outside of Edinburgh. Encouraging rural tourism is at the top of my list, and I believe the Scottish Government need to make it a priority to ensure that our overcrowded capital does not suffer, when rural areas have a more peaceful and less stressful visitor experience on offer."},{"url":null,"title":"polar-bear-expert-deliver-talk-galashiels","story":"THE Arctic is ground-zero for climate change, and polar bears are on the front line.Yet, therersquos still a whole lot to learn about these magnicent animals.

The existing junction in front of QMU would also be modied from a give-way ghost island T-junction to a signalised junction with greater capacity to hold turning traffic.The proposed scheme would, through the provision of an underpass beneath the A and slip roads to the northbound carriageway of the A, enable traffic movement from QMU and the new development to access the A northbound directly.Street lighting is proposed to be installed extended to include the new section of Queen Margaret Drive which would be provided under the A to the proposed roundabout junction. Street lighting would also be provided on the new slip roads.The proposals also include foot and cycle paths, two SUDS ponds, mitigation planting of native woodland to the main junction, structure tree planting, marginal planting to the proposed SUDS areas, and more ornamental planting to the areas near the QMU campus.Colin Beattie, Musselburgh MSP, said: ldquoWhile I welcome improvements to the road system which will accommodate the exciting new business developments around QMU, I am less enthusiastic about the huge expansion of housing, albeit much-needed, adjacent to QMU.ldquoThey will substantially increase the traffic on that stretch of road.

He would just happen to be at the bus station when I finished work with no bus fare.The couple, of Inglis Avenue, married a year later, when Marlene was  and Stan was .Stan worked at Cockenzie Power Station for  years and even helped with the construction of the site before it opened in .He joked: ldquoI helped build it and helped tear it down!Marlene said of their marriage: ldquoWe never thought we would have made it to this milestone. I remember my father saying: lsquoI will give you six months.rsquoldquoWe had a lot of hard times, we were young and foolish and hard up, but for some unknown reason we managed to take the kids on holiday every year and buy them their season tickets for the swimming pool. We had to save all year for them.ldquoFor the young, I would say not to marry young. Irsquom very proud that none of my children have followed in our footsteps.ldquoI would say [in marriage] it is important to always be mindful of one another and try to be toleranthellip never keep an argument going. It is too easy nowadays to walk away but you just have to keep going. I wanted to kill him some days and it was probably likewise but we have had a great le together.ldquoWe feel very lucky to have reached this age and that all of our children have got good lives, and their children are just a delight to have around.In their retirement, Marlene and Stan have travelled most of the Mediterranean and much of Europe together, and enjoy looking after their grandchildren, who all live in the county."},{"url":null,"title":"first-scots-baby-new-decade-born-port-seton-parents","story":"The little boy - whose name has still to be revealed - entered the world at .am todayat the Simpson Centre for Reproductive Health at theRoyal Infirmary of Edinburgh.Weighing in atlbs oz, he is the first child for mother Emma Allan, , and father Cameron Cunningham, , both of Castle Avenue, Post Seton.The parents said they were \"delighted\" with the new arrival.

I was alone and deep in thought. I cannot remember now exactly what the issue was, but something had happened that seemed to be unfair, and it had made me angry.It was a windy and cold day. The tide was in and the waves rolling and crashing created a kind of meditative sound. I donrsquot know how long I sat there, as time seemed to dissolve as I listened to the sea, and smelt the salt air.Later I walked by the shore, again alone, and I remember how my mood had changed.My memory of that day fades at this point: I cannot recall what happened as I ed home. But clearly the sea had done its job in calming my emotional state.Memories are not like books on a shelf which we can take out and look at, and then . Our memories are really about emotions rather than happenings. We connect to the emotions first, our brain then does a search for the events associated with the emotion. Songs, smell, sounds and places can trigger emotion which then leads to associations with actual events.So itrsquos the emotion attached to events which will mark it as signicant. Thatrsquos why we remember the unusual moments more than the everyday ones. We remember the events when our emotions were aroused, either positively or negatively.That day I was angry. The sea was pretty much on our doorstep, so it was probably an obvious place to go to be alone, away from my siblings, to rage at the injustice I felt. But it was a good choice, because the sea has a powerful ability to heal.There seems to be a sense by some that the sea is a place to go only when itrsquos sunny and warm. In fact, the gts of the sea are given all year round, and it is winter time, or a time of storm and wind, that the sea becomes a powerful place to find naturersquos healing.How lucky we are to live in a county where we have  miles of coastline, much of it close to communities and accessible. Those with a sense of adventure and physical ability to do so can find parts of the coast to themselves, even in busy times.But as I learnt all those years ago, the sea can speak to us directly. Simply sitting by it, or walking along the shore while sharing our thoughts, can be a powerful form of mental as well as physical healing.Some take this a step further by bathing in the sea on a regular basis ndash yes, even in the winter. There are real benefits to swimming in a cold sea, both in terms of mental and physical health. But I think it helpsothers do it with you, as an encouragement! The Loony Dooks which take place at North Berwick, Dunbar and where around the coast should be a weekly event, not a yearly one!But we donrsquot need to be in the sea to feel its benefits, just by it and connected to it mentally, and yes, spiritually. This is a serious point. We have an epidemic of mental health issues, and while there is no one simple explanation or solution, we need to understand the signicance of our disconnection from nature and its impact on our mental health. Spending time by the sea is a tonic for body and mind.I think we felt this last week when we headed for the rocks at North Berwick on Boxing Day. It was here that Robert Louis Stevenson played as a boy and discovered a small cave in which he imagined tales of pirates and smugglers. The island of Fidra, said to be his inspiration for Treasure Island, can be seen further along the coast.The tide was in, so it wasnrsquot possible to see the cave. But in scrambling over the rocks, discovering other things and sitting by the waves, the sea did its magic for our family and myself. The waves were crashing andyou studied how they hit the rocks you could see how the hand of the sea had carved them in certain ways.We sat and explored there ndash not noticing the nippy wind ndash for a good hour. It was an overcast afternoon and darkness fell soon. But the walk along the beach to the town for a hot chocolate was the final part of the therapy!Our coastline is a gt for us and we need to use it, and respect it, more. The beaches, coves and clfs of our county are a true treasure. Try spending more time with them, listening and experiencing the sea, walking or sitting with it.I promise you, you will feel better, and have a story to tell.Happy New Year."},{"url":null,"title":"new-mcbrave-games-event-held-musselburgh","story":"The action-packed event, called McBrave Games, promises participants a uniquely Scottish experience with events such as tug orsquo war, tossing the caber, putting the shot, the hill race, weechinrsquo the welly and a Highland fling.There will also be a Scottish twist on challenges along the km obstacle course to test participants.The event takes place on Saturday, May , at Newhailes House.Participants can take on the challenge as a solo entrant or enter as a clan of four with colleagues or friends to battle it out to become the laddie or lassie of McBrave Games.Co-founders Jo Dytch and Andrew Hastings are confident the creativity and innovation behind the event will encourage entrants to try something new in .Jo and Andrew bring with them more than  yearsrsquo combined experience in the mass participation space on large-scale events such as Race for Le, Tough Mudder and the -mile Cateran Yomp.Commenting on the inspiration behind the event, Jo said: ldquoScotland is an inspiring and magical place.

bid for a ldquotransportation hub to the east of the town was put forward last month and sparked an angry reaction from town centre traders, who fear it will put people off shopping in the centre.The council has launched a public consultation on Haddington town centre parking and transportation and this included an exhibition which showed images of people parking outwithallocated spaces in the current -space long-stay car park which is linked to Tescorsquos own short-stay customer car park.Under the heading ldquoindiscriminate parking, the images showed cars and vans parked on kerb corners and other unmarked areas of the car park which were not designated bays.It was, the council said, a way to illustrate the need for additional car parking in Haddington.Now the council has confirmed it is planning to introduce new traffic regulations which will stop people from parking outside spaces in the packed car park.A spokesperson said: ldquoA report will be presented to our cabinet meeting in January with proposals to introduce double yellow lines to the long-stay car park.This is to improve safety and reduce damage to the kerbs and road surfaces caused by indiscriminate parking.ldquoFollowing cabinet, the proposals will be subject to a statutory process before the necessary regulations could be introduced.Last October, the council introduced similar restrictions in its own staff car park at John Muir House, Haddington, which lies a short distance from the long-stay facility.That saw dozens of workers receive fines, from the team of private parking wardens employed by the council, for ignoring new yellow lines in their own car park.The long-stay car park in Haddington is on land owned by East Lothian Council and accessed through the adjoining short-stay car park attached to the neighbouring Tesco supermarket."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-council-electric-bridge-closure","story":"The Electric Bridge in Musselburgh was built to carry traffic

This is a fascinating and picturesque structure from the th century, which lies semi-hidden amongst the trees that cling onto the steep sides of the slope.Dunglass is such a beautul area, and the ancient Dunglass Collegiate Church, dating from the th century, is one of its architectural jewels. Itrsquos open to the elements now, but well preserved and a popular place for weddings.The castle that once stood nearby is long gone. A more modern house sits on the spot where a mansion once stood, and before that the castle. Being on the main route south, the castle inevitably saw action during the ious times of war with England, being burned and damaged on a number of occasions in the s.But in August , the castle was effectively blown up in a huge explosion, and a version of events emerged which placed the blame on a vengeful servant called Edward Paris.It was a time of war and religious rage. Thomas the nd Earl of Haddington was leading a Covenanting force charged with defending this important route from the south, as the Covenanting army had entered England a few days earlier. He had established his force at Dunglass Castle, an obvious strategic location, to defend the armyrsquos rear.On that fateful day, August , , he was said to be in conversation with some fellow nobles when a huge explosion erupted from the vaults, instantly demolishing the central part of the castle which became little more than a pile of debris.Thomas and many others were killed, their bodies pulled from the rubble. They had been crushed by the collapse of the walls in the explosion.History has repeatedly recorded the names of the nobles killed on that day, but there were many others, as the castle was busy and full of people. Fty-four unnamed lsquocommon servantsrsquo were killed, and more than  other people badly injured, some later dying of their injuries.Edward Paris was Thomasrsquos servant and he has been blamed for this tragedy. The th-century writer Andrew Stevenson claimed Edward had the keys to the vault in which huge amounts of gunpowder had been stored, and he had been ldquoseduced by the enemies of the covenant to commit this act. He was an Englishman and another account says he was incensed at derogatory remarks made by Thomas about his countrymen.Irsquove always thought this explanation never really had the ring of truth. It was initially deemed an accident, and the story of Edwardrsquos role emerged later, instigated by a writer called William Lithgow, a man who had certain axes to grind. In one account, Edward is said to have thrust a hot poker into the gunpowder or set fire to it. The detail of this is suspect in itself, for who survived as a witness to this act  I suspect that a dreadful accident, possibly caused by incompetence and carelessness, was turned into a deliberate act of vengeance as it made a more useful explanation.Of course, it is very possible that Edward was offended or annoyed at things said by his master, and perhaps he mentioned this at some stage, later to be used as evidence of his guilt. But in truth, most servants will have seen or heard things which will have offended them, it was a part of their job.Imagineservants had been able to write and publish the things they had overheard and seen, what dferent historical narratives we would have!Motives for wanting to interpret the cause of the explosion in this way can be guessed at. It was a time of atrocity and massacre, with religious, political and national hatreds. Who was responsible for the dangerous stockpiling of the gunpowder in such a manner  It seems just too easy to blame a disgruntled servant. Even later, when writing up this period, religious and political loyalties influenced interpretation.If Edward Paris really did venture down to the vaults of Dunglass Castle on that fateful day, with the intention of committing suicide in order to kill his master, along with dozens of others, then he must have been infected with a deep hatred, as well as a total disregard for the lives of his fellow servants and his own.The truth is we will never know what really happened. But Edward Paris is a servant whose name we know.

A marine licence is in place until the end of May, with work to be complete before then.At the same time, plans are being drawn up for a second phase of work, which would see the creation of a breakwater at the northern end of the beach.A marine licence will be needed for that piece of work, with the hope that could be in place before the end of May to allow work to simply continue from the first phase.If that is not possible, the contractor will leave the site andat a later date to construct the northern breakwater.Mrs Swan, who is also chairwoman of Dunbar Shore and Harbour Neighbourhood Group, encouraged people to head along to the public exhibition, which takes place between pm and pm.Those in attendance can speak to the consultants and East Lothian Council about the plans.Mrs Swan added: ldquoI think it is really, really important for people to come to the exhibition for two reasons.ldquoOne is to understand the thinking that has gone into the regeneration project and the other one is to become aware of the impact it might have on them during the construction weeks because it is going to be at least six weeks and it could run into months.ldquoThe nature of the breakwater is they are built of huge rocks, between three and six tonnes, and they are all coming from the quarry at Markle.

He was said to have been martyred at sea with an anchor round his neck and was therefore regarded as the patron saint of sailors. The cult of Clement spread to Scandinavia in about the th century and then to Britain.ldquoSt Clements Wells were probably named by Scandinavians living in the Tranent area.ldquoWe know they were here because of the presence of a powerful landholder of likely Scandinavian descent, Thor of Tranent, son of Swain, who is mentioned in many th-century charters. He held extensive lands in the area and granted the church of Tranent to Holyrood Abbey.Mr Hadden said: ldquoI am sure the new stone sculptures will add another piece of culture to our area when in place to the east and west sides of Wallyford alongside those we have already.ldquoThese include the mining memorial stone and coal hutches located at St Clements Housing estate just off Salters Road, the  mining stones at the Wallyford Bing, a community woodland depicting dferent mining scenes, and also the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh memorial at the west side of Wallyford.The shapes and patterns proposed relate to the themes of the wells, water, ripples, distilling, agriculture and the sense of space and open skies of the site as it is now. The overall idea is that the artwork reflects past, present and future heritages of the area.There will also be two St Clements Wells name  per entrance in stone, either hand carved or sandblasted.The idea for a stone village sign for Wallyford is also being explored in a design reflecting the ideas of crossing a river or burn by a ford.A spokesman for East Lothian Developments said: ldquoEast Lothian Developments are delighted to be working with Susheila and James to deliver ious artworks at St Clements Wells.ldquoThey have shown real enthusiasm and creativity with the ideas they have brought forward to capture something of the history of St Clements Wells and design pieces which we hope will do justice to the entrances of the development, and spark interest from all those who will pass them.ldquoWe were very grateful to the community council for their comments and input to the designs.Elaine Di Troia was appointed vice-chairman at the AGM, Sharon Jamieson secretary and Beryl Stevenson treasurer.

It was brilliant public relations for the royal family. I found myself indulging in a new respect for Her Majesty herself,not the institution.Mrs Windsor has done a pretty good job in her six-and-a-bit decades on the throne, not just representing Britain but negotiating the dismantling of the British Empire in the s and s. Say what you like about Britainrsquos colonial past, but nothing became the Empire so much as the ending of it.She had the wisdom to realise, in the s, that to make the monarchy relevant, and justy the prodigious amounts of public money spent on its upkeep, there had to be a quid pro quo.The ldquoFirm, as she calls it, had to be seen to be ldquogiving something back through intense charitable activity and the grind of diplomatic intercourse. And, of course, simply ldquobeing there for the opening of bridges and hospitals, and for moments of national tragedy, like Aberfan.But the Queen is a product of a bygone age of deference, of patronage, of noblesse oblige. She embodies the virtues of duty, hard work and responsibility that defined the post-war ruling classes.These are anachronistic qualities in the age of celebrity. We now have an alternative royalty in the form of internet stars like the Kardashians, and Beyonce. This world has long held a fatal attraction to minor members of the royal brood, who aspire to the elite lestyle while lacking the means.Such has been the rather tawdry fate of Harry and Meghan. Megxit, and the disintegration of the Sussexesrsquo public image, would make a whole season of The Crown. Their departure from ldquosenior royal le has absolutely nothing to do with duty and everything to do with worldly aice.They clearly want to remain in the public eye, their celebrity wedding guest list confirmed that. They believe they can make a lot of money as influencers and sponsors. But they have found the duties and responsibilities of being part of the royal family uncongenial.In the words of Queen ndash the pop group that is ndash they want to break free. To which the British public says: fine. Do what you gotta to do. Polls show that the British public wish the Sussexes well in their new le.However, the deal is thatthey want to escape the paparazzi and the responsibilities of royalty, they must also give up its privileges. They must give up their royal titles and stop consuming vast amounts of public money.The renovation of their grace-and-favour home, Frogmore Cottage, cost the taxpayer pound. million. Their security costs around pound, a year. They receive millions from the revenues of royal estates, via Harryrsquos dad, Prince Charles.The financial taps should be turned off. There is no need, since Harryrsquos personal fortune is estimated at poundm and Meghan is also wealthy. To most of us this seems self-evident. And yoursquod expect Labour to be calling them out most loudly.The default position of the left used to be contempt for the flummery and waste of the royal family. They consume millions of pounds of public money that could be better used for foodbanks. The monarchy is regarded, rightly, as a feudal anachronism, the apex of privilege.But some Labour MPs, especially BAME ones, like Clive Lewis, seem to regard the Sussexes as a special kind of royalty. Far from condemning the behaviour of these soon-to-be ex-royals, theyrsquove been leaping to their defence. Meghan Markle is being portrayed as a victim rather than a social parasite. A victim of a racist media and a bigoted society.In a furious piece in the New York Times,columnist Afua Hirsch blamed deeply ingrained British racism for Meghanrsquos decision to ditch the Firm. ldquoHer treatment, she wrote, ldquohas proved what many of us have always known ... in this society racism will still follow you.Social media is fizzing with indignation at the allegedly racist treatment of Meghan. Oprah Winfrey has been fanning the flames across the pond. Racism has driven poor Meghan to seek refuge in Toronto.There is actually very little evidence of racism in the media treatment of Markle. The oft-quoted headline, ldquoshe was nearly straight out of Compton, may have been silly and wrong, but it wasnrsquot racist. The social and family background of a new member of the royal family is a legitimate matter of public interest.The instant sacking of disc jockey Danny Baker after his ldquomonkey tweet shows just how intolerant of racism the UK media has become. Criticism of Harry and Meghanrsquos hypocrisy in lecturing on the environment while relying on private jets is not racist.In the Sussexesrsquo resignation epistle there is no mention of racism. They clearly donrsquot like their treatment by the press. But their court actions against the media are about phone hacking and , not race.Meghan Markle was lionised by the press when she arrived on the scene three years ago. The media was fascinated and enchanted by this woke princess who was bringing the stuffy royal family into the st century.The coverage in all newspapers was little short of adulatory. Her feminism was widely praised she adorned the front page of Vogue her wedding had the full -inside-pages treatment.Meghanrsquos arrival was seen as a signicant moment in the progress towards equality and ersity in Britain. Her departure comes as a blow to minority groups which saw her as a torch-bearer for anti-racism and anti-sexism. As a royal she had a unique  now she is just another self-obsessed celebrity.And the royalsrsquo behaviour following the Epstein scandal is a serious blow to The Firm. It is clear that the monarchy, as it stands, is no longer viable. It will have to downsize to immunise itself from scandals like this in future.Questions about the anachronistic constitutional role of the Queen can no longer be avoided.She is head of state, a formal role of course, but one that nearly became highly political during the Brexit crisis last year. There was a real possibility that the Queen might have had to decide whether or not to endorse a caretaker prime minister.This monarch should be the last to have any formal role in the constitution. The Crown should no longer be seen as above politics. The hereditary principle should play no part in our democracy.It goes without saying that therersquos no place for royalty in Scotland. The Scottish National Party needs to reassess its historical support for the Queen. Alex Salmond called her the ldquoQueen of Scots, and the  White Paper envisaged a role for the monarch in Scotland after independence. This is surely no longer tenable.If Scotland is to become independent, there should be no question of a hereditary head of state. And there is surely no place for celebrity airheads like the Sussexes."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10894159.jpg?type=article-full","title":"kirsty-strickland-race-lead-scottish-tories-matters","story":"Uncharitable souls might ask why it matters.For all the overblown rhetoric about a so-called lsquorsquoTory revivalrsquorsquo in Scotland, whoever emerges victorious is unlikely to become our next first minister.Boris Johnson now has a hefty parliamentary majority won outside of Scotland and in spite of Scotland. He therefore has no reason to woo or even pay much attention to the next Scottish Tory leader. Johnson has made clear since the General Election that he will focus on courting and retaining the \"red wall\" former Labour seats that his party won.:Scottish Secretary rules out Indyref evenSNP win Holyrood majority in The reason why the outcome of the contest matters more than we might think lies in one of the Scottish partyrsquos only policies.The limited electoral success they have enjoyed since  has been squarely down to their harnessing of the unionist vote. Their opposition to Indyref was front and centre during the General Election campaign and will be again during the Holyrood election.At the weekend, Scottish Secretary Alister Jack said that Boris Johnson would shortly be responding to Nicola Sturgeonrsquos request for a Section  order to hold Indyref. The Prime Minister is certain to refuse permission for another referendum. All eyes will then be on the First Minister to see what her next move is.While it is unlikely that we will be heading back to the polls to vote on Scottish independence this year, many think Indyref is inevitable.Whoever is chosen as Scottish Tory leader will play a key role in any future campaign.Boris Johnsonrsquos approval ratings in Scotland are woeful. Most people would struggle to pick Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard out of a line up. Any Scottish Tory leader will be central to the future No campaign, out of necessity more than anything . Afterall, all the big players in the  Better Together campaign have long since exited the political stage and everything has changed since then.David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband were experienced politicians that worked in harmony. Letrsquos say for arguments sake that their Indyref counterparts comprise of Boris Johnson, Labourrsquos Keir Starmer and the LibDemrsquos Ed Davey. Could that trio really put the bitterness over Brexit to one side and uny in a simple pro-Union message If Better Together decided to get the band back together and wheel out their  squad, they would run the risk of appearing like they have nothing new to say on the Union and nobody new to say it on their behalf.Contrast that with the Yes movement, which has grown and organised itself into a strong campaigning force since . It has a wealth of new talent and experienced operators to draw from and, in Nicola Sturgeon, one of the most well-known politicians in the UK.Last weekend saw thousands of Yes supporters descend on Glasgow for a pro-independence march. The pouring rain did nothing to dampen their enthusiasm and the sight of the crowds dancing and cheering showed an energy that campaigners for the Union could scarcely dream of.:Mark Smith: If you canrsquot beat rsquoem, join rsquoem. What I learned from my first independence marchIn choosing their next leader, Scottish Conservative members are also nominating a spokesperson for their beloved Union. Given the utter chaos of the last few years, making the case for the continuation of the UK has never been more dficult. Which is perhaps why only two wannabe-leaders have thus far put themselves forward.Jackson Carlaw is the front-runner and has served as interim leader since Ruth Davidsonrsquos surprise departure. He is an agile politician and performs well at First Ministerrsquos Questions. He is tribal on the issue of independence but takes a more collaborative approach when it matters. His handling of the vaginal mesh scandal was impressive and when he became visibly emotional while raising the plight of the affected women, he looked sincere.Michelle Ballantyne is the partyrsquos social security spokeswoman at Holyrood and entered the race to ensure that members have a proper contest and not a \"coronation\" of odds-on favourite Jackson Carlaw. She is best known for a speech she gave defending the \"fairness\" of the two-child cap for tax credits, which her critics described at the time as \"Victorian moralising\".It will be for Scottish Tory members to decide which of the candidates will lead their party.

something that ultimately comes down to politics.They write: ldquoIf a second independence referendum is to take place and be effective as a means of achieving independence it is therefore crucial that it be conducted on a proper legal footing ndash that is, that the rules it sets out providing for the organisation of a poll and regulating the conduct of the referendum campaign are legally valid and hence binding on those to whom they apply.ldquoAttempting to proceed with a referendum without such a legislative underpinning would be a non-starter, given that it would depend upon the co-operation of Scotlandrsquos  local authorities in organising the vote , and would almost certainly be boycotted by unionists.ldquoAny attempt to legislate for a referendum [at Holyrood] without a further explicit transfer of power is certain to be challenged in the courts could cause signicant dficulties within the Scottish Government, possibly including resignation of the Scottish Law Officers and might also provoke retaliatory legislation from Westminster to make clear that such legislation is not within Holyroodrsquos competence.ldquoMoreover, evensuch a Bill were to survive, a unilateral approach to authorising a second referendum might again lead to a unionist boycott and could not be certain of co-operation from the UK Government in implementing a vote for independence.The UK Government has so far refused to grant a Section  order for Indyref.Although SNP Brexit Secretary Mike Russell has hinted at a possible legal challenge to obtain a Section  order, the authors say it is ldquoextremely unlikely that such a challenge would be successful, since there is no duty to make a section  Order, still less to introduce primary legislation.The academics also say Ms Sturgeonrsquos mandate carries no legal weight.ldquoThe Scottish Governmentrsquos mandate to hold a referendum ndash though politically important ndash seems legally irrelevant.ldquoThe doctrine of the mandate plays, at best, a marginal role in UK constitutional law and practice, and in any case what constitutes a mandate is highly ambiguous: how clear does a manesto promise have to be is a majority of seats or of votes requiredand which elections are relevant ndash to the UK Parliament, which holds the legal competence to dissolve the Union, or the Scottish Parliament, from which the Scottish Governmentrsquos authority derives They also say judicial review challenges against the UKrsquos refusal - for example on grounds of irrationality or the  precedent - also ldquoseem likely to fail.Some senior SNP figures, including MP Angus Brendan MacNeil, have suggested a lsquoPlan Brsquo in the face of the UKrsquos refusal, arguing a SNP election win could trigger independence talks.However Prof McHarg and Mr McCorkindale say this is also unlikely to work, as it does not overcome ldquothe power dynamics behind the referendum dilemma, as it would still require an unwilling UK government to take part in those independence talks.Turning to what the Scottish Government might do, the pair say it is likely Ms Sturgeon has anticipated her plan for Indyref in late  would be rejected, and that refusal would become the centre-piece of the SNPrsquos campaign in the  Holyrood election.In a similar vein, they said SNP MPs could introduce a Private Memberrsquos Bill at Westminster for the transfer of referendum powers to Holyrood in order to ldquosignal action to an impatient audience and ldquoemphasise the sites of political obstruction when the Bill falls.The SNP could also use push the issue relentlessly at Prime Ministerrsquos Questions, work with the Greens at Holyrood to withhold legislative consent for Westminster legislation, and encourage pressure through street protests and by getting the backing of civic Scotland.But in the end, the most credible and effective route to independence was a political deal.They concluded: ldquoWhether there is a second referendum ndash andso, on what terms ndash is a political question that will be resolved in the political arena. There are no legal short cuts through that space.ldquoA referendum that has a clear legal basis, agreed to between governments, that is regulated by law and consistent with democratic and rule of law values is the surest - perhaps the only - way to deliver a result that is fair, decisive, and accepted as legitimate at home and abroad.Tory MSP Adam Tomkins, his partysconstitution spokesman, said: \"The SNPrsquos tactics to campaign for separation are once again shown to be utterly futile.ldquoThe law on this is very clear the constitution is a reserved issue.ldquoThe people of Scotland voted no to independence in  and that has not changed.Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie added: \"The  Edinburgh Agreement ensured that there was a legal, fair and decisive vote on independence.\"The nationalists lost, yet they have spent the subsequent years desperate to stack the decks in their favour and have another go.ldquoRather than throwing their toys out of the plan, the SNP should be working with others to deliver a federal UK and ensure that power is shared across the whole of the UK.An SNP spokesperson said: \"This is about democracy, pure and simple.\"There is an explicit and resounding democratic mandate to hold an independence referendum -greater than the mandate Boris Johnson claims to impose Brexit.\"It would be entirely undemocratic for the UK government to try and continue to block a referendum ndash that is a position which cannot, and will not, prevail.\""},{"url":null,"title":"group-bbc-one-scotland-review","story":"DREAM big or go home seems to have been the guiding force behind Group, the latest sitcom pilot for BBC Scotland.

We are bringing the story full circle.Amentotaxus argotaenia is classed as ldquonear endangered globally and is very rare in Hong Kong. Craig Williams, senior curator at the Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden in Kowloon, was worried about the prospects of any remaining wild plants, which could also be threatened by the recent arrival in Hong Kong of the day flying moth Milionia zonea, whose larvae feed on the leaves of some trees.Two years ago, he discovered that Edinburgh was home to a living specimen, which originated from Hong Kongrsquos highest peak, Tai Mo Shan.Some  rooted cuttings were propagated over  months in Edinburgh before being carefully transported to Hong Kong in an attempt to boost the population.Mr Gardner said: ldquoThis is the first time we have ever done this.

These will help to save the population in Hong Kong.ldquoWith a larger population they have a better chance of survival.Mr Williams said the Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden would celebrate the remarkable story, adding: ldquoAmentotaxus argotaenia is a protected species here and it is of immense value to us to have rooted material from the Edinburgh accession. We aim to provide interpretation alongside a few specimens in our public display areas to explain the story of their amazing journey from one tree in Edinburgh.Gunter Fisher, Kadooriersquos head of flora conservation, added: ldquoThis is a great example of a shared vision for the conservation of rare plants and shows how botanic gardens can collaborate to put their living collections to constructive and practical use in global efforts.The news comes as the Royal Botanic Garden prepares a year-long programme of events to mark its th anniversary.

Scottish democracy would be much more robustthere were an authentic left-wing party standing up for ordinary people.

Labour lost six out of seven MPs and came third behind the Tories on . per cent of the vote.What about federalism or devo max  This is such a sad debate for Labour to have ndash because itrsquos pointless and it will not save them, yet many in the party seem to think of federalism as the leboat which will carry them to safety.Before Brexit, some form of federalism may have been an option, but not now. Surely even Labour can see that  How will federalism appeal to voters who care about the EU  It will not retain their EU citizenship. It wonrsquot appeal to Yes voters, as they want independence. Federalism wonrsquot appeal to Remain voters as they want back in the EU.Federalism is an escape tunnel with an armed guard waiting at the end of it.Nor will the mechanics of federalism work. In a federal UK all voices would need to be equal ndash thatrsquos the point. However, England has a population of  million, Scotland . million.Unless federalism involves England being balkanised into a series of regions ndash Yorkshire, Cornwall, the Midlands ndash with roughly equivalent populations, it will be entirely undemocratic and unfair. Why would England agree to that  No-onersquos even asked the English.So, should Labour adopt a neutral position on independence  Drop opposition to it, but donrsquot campaign as a party for it ndash allow members a free vote on independence. It sounds nice, but we need only remember the partyrsquos position on Brexit at the election.Trying to play both sides may sound super-smart and slippery, but the electorate doesnrsquot buy it.What about going full ultra-unionist  Well, Labour tried that in  and that was the start of its terminal decline. Former Deputy Leader Alex Rowley, also constitution spokesman, tweeted that too many Labour apparatchiks still feel Better Together and ldquostanding alongside the Tories is the best way forward. If a voter wants unionism, theyrsquove got the Conservatives.Whatrsquos left  The remaining option is to back independence. Every other path is closed off. Could it work  Could the party reconfigure itself, setting out a leftwing case for independence ndash taking the nationalism out of the Yes movement  Might that bring back progressives who left Labour for the SNP  Therersquos plenty of such voters out there who arenrsquot natural SNP supporters.Some Labour figures see the writing on the wall.

Singing and acting combined  No, thank you anyway.So I had no impetus to go and see Cats the film. I have, full disclosure, seen Cats on the stage and it was tolerable because the characters sang and danced and barely talked so it wasnt a musical of the traditional, \"Im inappropriately bursting in to song instead of finishing this sentence,\" iety.The only thing that drew me to Cats the movie was the promise of two hours of atrocious film making.Im a member of a Bad Movie Club and we thrive on this stuff.

Off we went, actors in fur CGI creeping and crawling through the streets of London, their digitally enhanced ears twitching as they moved through the Jellicle Songs for Jellicle Cats.Nothing grating so far.This, in fact, was a delight. Even the dancing cockroaches had a certain charm. Yes, at points seeing Judi Dench with a lionesque ring of long fur framing her face felt a little fever-dreamish but she pulled it off with a certain twinkling gravitas.What are the complaints  Viewers twisted their knickers over scale - in some parts the cats are as big as cutlery in other parts they fill window frames.Two women in my screening couldnt move past the fact that Jennyanydots unzips her own skin to reveal a new outfit underneath. Others have been upset that Old Deuteronomy wears a fur coat... on top of her own coat of fur.Yet more whiny babies emphasised distress that the cats had fingers. Yes, it certainly would lt the whole film to make the singing, dancing, talking cats more realistic.Bizarrely, no one seemed bothered by Bombalurinas high heels or Taylor Swts horric faux-British accent.

There was also signicant anti-Trident support.He highlights the anti-Tory placards and chantsand wonders why  I have to wonder why he wonders, since the reality is that it is they who are in power in Westminster and have the ability to deny Scotland the right to hold another referendum following the signicant change being brought about by Brexit. Remember that we were told in  that the only way to stay in the EU was to vote no.Mr Smith apparently felt so bad during the brief few yards when the march passed the handful of counter-demonstrators that he wished he wasnrsquot there. My experience during this very brief stage of the march was one of humour.The conclusion of the article ndash aside from his comical and ironic wrestle with the wet Saltire near the end of the march ndash that the same people doing the same thing will achieve nothing ignores the fact that these marches are part of a series of events that have been, and will be, held all over Scotland in order to ensure that the public profile of the issue of Scottish independence is maintained. Some, but not by any means all, who attended in Glasgow will have taken part in a similar march in their local area. It also ignores the fact that no change has ever been achieved by those people who are looking for change sitting back and doing nothing.Allistair Matheson, Selkirk.LIKE Mark Smith I too was at the independence march in Glasgow on Saturday and like him it was my first such march, so I was interested to read of his experiences.Throughout the march I recognised Mr Smiths accounts of what he saw and heard, so I must have been near him throughout the march, though our interpretations dfered not signicantly but subtly, but that is a moot point depending on onersquos perspective.I therefore would like to put my slant on what he saw and heard and give one or two additions. I met people from all over the UK, not just from Aberdeen. I was surprised that as a journalist he didnrsquot speak to more people. There were people from Wales who were very noticeable as they were speaking Welsh, a contingent of \"From England for Yes\" waving the St Georges Cross, and people from Inverness and Orkney.I agree on the age dferential but was inclined not to put a political slant on it as Mr Smith did I take a more pragmatic view. As a pensioner myself who has led a busy working le it is unlikely that in my middle age I would have had the time to devote myself to marching at a weekend. That is normally done by students and older people who have the time to do these sort of things. I do not think one can take anything other than that from the age distribution. The march was lined by a lot of middle-aged people who had come out of shops and offices.I also was disturbed by the sight of an alternative group cordoned off by the police and supervisors and thought this might spell trouble. On two points I disagree with Mr Smith. There were certainly a lot of Union Flags being waved, as the photo accompanying the article showed, but in fact I estimated about  people waving them. Mr Smith mentioned one lady shouting \"Scotland\". So that was one person out of thousands that he seems to have hyped into an outrage against democracy. Indeed, the vitriol came the other way. Everyone around me waved and smiled to the Unionists and as far as I can tell this continued till I was well out of sight of them.On most other points I agree with Mr Smith that it wasnrsquot a rowdy, noisy march and I too was surprised about the anti-Tory chants and would have preferredthey had kept to the topic of the march.I enjoyed the march thoroughly and met some really great people and yes, they did have similar views to me. but isnrsquot that what the march was about Ronnie Scott, Croy, Inverness-shire.IT was good to see Mark Smith dip his toe in the chilly waters of an All Under One Bannerindependence march. Im sure he was as drookit as the rest of us last weekend. I read his comments and agreed with some, but would have to take issue with others.Anti-Tory sloganising in some parts of the march, yes this was true and although the general advice was that there should be no coarse or negative language, that was there among us. The march was called to protest about the Johnson Government and there were banners that I would not have supported, but it is a public event and we generally dont have the banner police sorting us out.Where he seemed rather po-faced was in the failure to describe the joyous atmosphere that attends such events. And despite his comments, many families are happy to bring their children, knowing that they will have fun and be part of a great democratic carnival.His comments about the marchers being the same , people turning up and offering each other mutual support are not accurate. The first Glasgow AUOB march I attended a couple of years ago had about , people and we were pretty pleased to have that number. In my section of the march we had two new folk who joined us and two or three promised who didnt come because of the rain. AUOB has also made the wise decision to go to venues where demonstrations dont happen much and areas where people voted no. This allows local people to see the strength of feeling for independence which is never reflected in the media, with the exception of The Herald and the National.There is a huge buzz within the independence movement which never finds itself reflected in the popular press or television with the above exceptions.People are meeting and talking about a new currency and a new type of economy without the domination of casino banking. There are meetings about how we work on a new green economy which is driven by environmental and societal benefits, not greed. Many new ideas about taxation and tackling poverty are being talked about in village halls and town centres ndash not the \"narrow nationalism\" and \"separatism\" promoted by the popular press.Mr Smith is to be commended for his venture into this great popular democratic movement and I hope he will think about coming again.Maggie Chetty, Glasgow G.CREDIT to Mark Smith, first, for venturing forth on a foul January day apparently with his heid bereft of any protection. It seems that as the march progressed it was not only the weather but the language of some that deteriorated to unacceptable levels. \"Maggie, Maggie hellip deid\" or \" Tories, Tories hellip out\" hardly enhanced proceedings. Surely any gathering should realise there are ious shades of political persuasion present. Tolerance and respect to others must be a basic principle.The absurdity of such chants coupled with obscene shouts by zealots obsessed by the \"cause\" counteracts any public sympathy. Perhaps Mr Smiths closing sentiments on becoming unwillingly wrapped in a sodden flag illustrates the dangers of dissuading a potential supporter.Allan C Steele, Gfnock.SITTING at a window seat in a pub in Glasgow city centre, three of us attempted to count the marchers at the independence march. After the first group arrived outside the pub led by  motorcycle bikers at .pm, up to the police vans following them at the tail end of the march at . ndash a total of  hour  minutes ndash they all passed our vantage point. Because of the irregular shape of the group the density of the ranks of marchers fluctuated like a concertina and it was dficult to gauge precise numbers at times there was as few as  per minute, and up to  per minute passing our stationary position. The pace of the marchers was determined by police, traffic lights and photo shoots which meant it moved slowly at about   .mph and stopped frequently, causing it to congest.There were several small groups of supporters lined along the route which would help swell the numbers overall. Even taking this into account the most congested parts of the march meant no more than , could have taken part at its height. Claims of , to , are wildly inaccurate, this would have meant approximately , marchers per minute passing a fixed point continuously for  minutes. This did not happen. Given the sedentary pace and loose formation of the marchers a figure of , would be a generous estimate.These marches are fast losing their signicance and now only represent a vocerous minority of Scots.Allan Thompson, Bearsden.THE nationalistsrsquo pointless marching season has begun again. The motley crowd of about ,waved banners many of which were liberally sprinkled with the \"f\" word, and worse, the \"c\" word. Decent people donrsquot use these words and certainly donrsquot expect to see them printed on large banners whilst shopping on a wet Saturday afternoon.Decency has deserted these desperate nationalists. They are not going to be allowed another referendum and they know it. By all means let them state their case and marchthey must, though itrsquos a terrible waste of time and police manpower.If they really want to encourage others to their hopeless cause, then perhaps they should clean up their act, quit the filthy language and stop dressing up like extras from Brigadoon.

Volunteering can help you to find friends, connect with your community, learn new skills, and even advance your career!”I Bike volunteer Hanne Bruhn said: “What has surprised me is the real kick I get when the children achieve a skill for le, there is nothing better than when a child realises they can cycle and proudly proclaims “I get wind in my hair when I go fast!” They feel they have achieved something by themselves and there’s a real pride in that.”To find out more about the I Bike project and how you could get involved, email volunteers-scotland@sustrans.org.uk.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Dont ignore your debt andneeds be support is available from the Citizens Advice Bureau\"  Beating your New Year debt hangoverviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Top price at #, from Moir Livestock\"  Top trade at Thainstone sale viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"mackie s launches world s first haggis neeps and tatties crisps","story":"Haggis, neeps and tatties will be available in potato crisp form this month thanks to Mackies Crisps.Due to hit the shelves from early January, Mackie’s Crisps has taken inspiration from the Bard himself, Robert Burns, and is bringing consumers a snack-based taste of Scotland’s favourite traditional dish in the run-up to Burns Night.A limited run of , g bags will be available with a comforting, light peppery flavour and Taylor-clan tartan packaging.Using entirely natural flavourings and high oleic sunflower oil, the crisps are suitable for both vegans and vegetarians.James Taylor, from the Perthshire-based family business, is delighted with the flavour and hopes it resonates with the Scottish public.He said: “While we do push the boat out with exotic flavours, we do also like to look closer to home at some of the fantastic dishes from our heritage. Quite simply, there are none more iconic than our own national dish.“We’re fiercely proud of our Scottish roots and so narrowed down to a number of options for a limited run. When it came to the taste tests, haggis, neeps and tatties emerged as the runaway favourite.”James is the fourth generation to work at the Taylor farm – and is Commercial Director at Mackie’s at Taypack, which produces Mackie’s Crisps. He helps to run the family-owned business with his father, Managing Director George Taylor.The crisps brand and Mackie’s at Taypack as a business were launched in  as the result of a joint-venture between potato farmers the Taylor family and Aberdeenshire’s Mackie’s of Scotland, which is renowned for its ice cream and chocolate.Its thick-cut and gently cooked potato crisps use the best ieties of crisping potatoes, grown on the farm, reflective of its “plough to pack” ethos.Subsequently, Mackie’s Crisps has become famous for its haggis and cracked black pepper iety, as well as launching the world’s first pigs in blankets flavour.Research on its new flavour started in earnest in  during a new product development push, after establishing Burns Night as an opening to deliver a new patriotic flavour combination.Meticulous sampling sessions helped it to master the flavour of haggis, neeps and tatties, building on its popular haggis-based flavours.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Top price at #, from Moir Livestock\"  Top trade at Thainstone saleviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Members of Inverurie  District Mens Shed accept the donation from Barratt Homes\"  Funding boost for Inverurie Men’s Shed viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"The Mackie’s Crisps team were further convinced of launching the flavour when a student, Aileen McColm, joined the Perthshire business in  to shadow quality control manager Jamie McKell.

James added: “It’s been many years in the making, so we’ll be keeping in contact with our end customers and trade clients throughout to see what the appetite is like for our new flavour.“Who knows, we may even be able to expand the run to make it a permanent addition to our range.

But despite the growing impact of this crisis, there has been little meaningful action from the Scottish Government.“One strand of attracting talented doctors to the region will be ensuring that our medical schools are better linked to our communities. A medical school located within the Highlands and Islands has the potential to attract larger numbers of doctors to study here and then, when they’re qualied, to encourage them to stay and work in our region.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

HP TY |  | Registered in England  Wales."},{"url":null,"title":"snp austerity simply cannot continue richard leonard","story":"The Scottish Government must ditch the blame games and provide fair funding for councils, writes Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard.Scottish local government is close to my heart. In the days before devolution, it was often the last line of defence against attacks on local communities waged by Tory governments. But it was also an arena for innovation and local initiative. Some ideas pioneered at council level found their way on to the national stage in housing and transport, in equalities, education and even economic development. And they still do.So I agree with Alison Evison, the president of our councils’ umbrella body Cosla, when she said this week that we are talking of “the sphere of government closest to Scotland’s citizens”.And of course, her comments about local government’s importance come not in the abstract, but as context to a stern real-world warning. Ahead of the Scottish Government’s budget, she noted that “whichever way you want to dress it up, the reality is that in recent budgets the Scottish Government has chosen to overlook the essential services that communities rely on day in, day out”.: SNP plans mean ‘more austerity than under the Tories’, says IFS: Brexit means Scotland now ‘likely’ to vote for independence, says Labour MPIt’s not just her view – or mine. Fteen months ago, the Accounts Commission concluded that “funding for local government from the Scottish Government decreased at a faster rate, . per cent, than the Scottish Government revenue budget at . per cent”. In other words, for all their attempts to blame the Tories – who it is true have decimated local government in England – for the failed experiment of austerity, SNP ministers in Edinburgh have quadrupled the cuts that were handed down to them.Passing the buckBut how could any Scottish government get away with this  From schools to home care, from libraries to bin collections – with the possible exception of the NHS, this is where most of Scotland’s people interact with government and the public sector. Councils and councillors are also citizens’ first port of call when things go wrong – from the heating in rented flats to elderly relatives left in the lurch without a care plan. Surely it would be politically toxic to take the axe to council budgets in exactly the way the SNP has done Unfortunately, ministers have cynically deployed the very fact that local government is closer to Scotland’s citizens in order to shirk responsibility. So when I challenged Nicola Sturgeon over failing care services in South Lanarkshire at First Minister’s Questions last week, she was happy to pass the buck to the SNP-controlled council. And by proxy, she passed the buck to ordinary citizens, who will feel a closer affinity to councils and the services they provide than they do to national governments. While many people consider there to be a direct link between the council tax levied on their homes and the services which they receive, council tax accounted for only £. billion of local government revenue in -. Non-domestic rates accounted for £. billion, but the majority – £. billion – came from the General Revenue Fund allocated by the Scottish Government.And there have been consequences as a result of the SNP Government’s approach.Rising demand for servicesIn , Scotland’s councils held assets valued at £. billion. But rather than a reassurance, we should take this as a warning. These possessions range from single-occupancy flats, to pension fund investments, to architectural gems held in trust for the public they were built to serve. They are each attached to signicant costs or debts. And as councils struggle with rising demand for services such as home care, alongside falling budgets, the cost demand of servicing these assets and the potential sale revenues will make it more and more alluring for councils to be tempted to dispose of them.It is often cultural services which suffer first:  public libraries closed their doors altogether in Scotland in  alone. Many others have seen their hours cut. We are now reaching the point, however, that even statutory services like home care find themselves truly at breaking point. In the past three years,  of Scotland’s  councils have been forced to draw down from their reserves. As a result, councils now hold £ million less in reserves than they did just a year ago.Central Government ministers have set targets and commitments for local government, which could be an effective means of improving services. But without giving councils the financial resources they need to meet these, it becomes simply an effective means of shting the blame for austerity.Devolution of powerSo ahead of the Scottish budget on March , Scottish Labour is calling on the SNP Government to ditch the easy blame games and take some responsibility. Just because there is greater local accountability for local government services, it doesn’t mean central Government can abdicate responsibility for a deliberate choice to underfund them.But we won’t stop there. Over a decade after the SNP promised to abolish the council tax, local government increasingly finds itself under central control: including over the setting of council tax. That’s why I want the principle of subsidiarity – the devolution of power as close as possible to the grass roots – to form part of Scottish Labour’s offer on constitutional reform. A particular challenge is now facing us. With the onset of Brexit, the powers which currently lie with the European Union will be repatriated. The question is where to. They cannot be concentrated in Westminster and Whitehall. They must be devolved. But the strengthening of local government must be part of that.Local government, unfashionable a cause as it may be, will be the bedrock of a more democratic future for Scotland.

While it is widely accepted that modernisation of air traffic control infrastructure is needed across the region, Ms Wishart says Hial’s own consultants have acknowledged that the ‘remote tower’ model was the most ‘costly’ and ‘risky’ of the options available.The Liberal Democrat MSP has now lodged a motion in parliament that will see a debate on the issue take place later this month.“It now appears clear that Hial’s management is intent on pressing ahead with their plans to centralise air traffic control services.#This is deeply worrying given the serious questions that still hang over these proposals and the level of concern amongst ATC staff.“Hial has been intent on pursuing this option from the outset, despite its own consultants identying the ‘remote tower’ model as the most costly and risky option. Since then, there has been a desperate attempt to get the evidence to fit the desired outcome.“That is simply not acceptable, particularly given the leline nature of these air services. No-one disputes the need to modernise and invest in the current infrastructure. However, this must be balanced with the safety of passengers, reliability of services and the benefits of sustaining high-skilled jobs in our island communities.“To date, the Scottish government has been happy to wave through Hial’s proposals with little evidence of robust scrutiny. I hope this debate will force the Transport Minister to think again and begin asking serious questions about these latest centralisation plans.”Highlands and Islands MSP Jamie Halcro Johnston has added his voice to calls for a debate in Parliament on HIAL’s plans to centralise air traffic control in the region.Mr Halcro Johnston, an Orkney resident and regular user of Hial services, said: “I share the concern of many people over Hial’s plans to centralise air traffic control services in Inverness.“There is real concern amongst Hial employees that they don’t feel that they have been properly consulted, particularly amongst those living in the islands. Hial should reflect on the feedback they are receiving and review their options before they commit to the approach they are advocating.“I am yet to be convinced that these proposals from Hial aren’t more about saving money than providing a better service. Given how important our vital leline air-links are, that would focusing on the wrong priority from Hial. “I would welcome the opportunity to see the issue debated at Holyrood and, with Hial entirely owned by the Scottish government, to hear the Minister’s justication for Hial’s plans.# It is understood that Hial is planning to update staff and stakeholders on the air traffic controllers issue later this week. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"energy saving campaign focuses on electric heating ","story":"This year the campaign will attempt to reach two groups of people: those who use electric heating and those who have homes that are hard to heat.As part of a national campaign the bureau will hold two community events.

Two other swimmers making their yearly pilgrimage were Arthur Chatfield from Scotland and Alan Traynor from Donegal.Several families also participated and among them were, the Eddie and Scott Gilmore, Simon and Chole Murphy, Darren and Curtis Donnell, Alister and Laurie Neeson, Anthony and Paul O’Rawe, Brian Lemon and Son Brian, Robert, Matthew, Sarah and Joy Bowman, Andrew and William Knox and David and Naomi Morrow. With the favourable weather it was a great day for the number of new first-time swimmers and in particular the young people taking part along with the usual stalwarts.With everyone back on terra firma and changed they made their way to the Bridge Inn to get fed and watered prior to the social festivities taking place. Chairman, Billy McIlroy, said it was “very pleasing” to see so many swimmers including young people on the events th year.Mementoes and certicates were presented by Mrs Sharon Smyth and Mrs Ann Ryan to the swimmers who had taken part on the day with all the swimmers being warmly applauded.After the presentations the Chairman again paid tribute to those who sponsored the swimmers this year as they have done for many years in the past. Last year the swim raised the magnicent sum of pound and this year again has got off to a brilliant start with pound being lted on the day thanks to the generous sponsorship from the general public. The social festivities got off to a good start with Bert Kernohan carrying out the duties of compere and the music being supplied by Two Star Country. The Choir Challenge followed with the ladies out to regain their crown which they had lost last year. They went first conducted by Dana Kernohan setting a very high standard for the judge Billy McIlroy. The men followed and put on a wonderful performance under the leadership of Bert Kernohan.In judging Billy said he had to apply the “Var” as used in football and on this the better harmonising by the ladies gave them the win by the slimmest of margins which was received with rapturous applause.Next year will be the th anniversary of the event which will be a Major Milestone in its history.The Chairman thanked everyone who in any way assisted in helping to make the event the success that it was.The swim took place under the watchful eye of Larne Branch St Johns Ambulance, East Antrim R.N.L.I., Kayakers Jim Mulvenna, Marion O’Dornan and her sister Claire Corr.

However, Connor was also part of Belfast Celtic’s first league winning side of the - season.His highly decorated career would see him win virtually every trophy in Irish football, including a further league title with Glentoran and the inaugural Gold Cup in .The Belfast Celtic Society received the artefact from an anonymous donor, who found it in a pub in County Down.Speaking about the find, the society’s Chairman, Pádraig Coyle, said: “It means a huge amount to us.“The donor, when they did a bit of research and saw who this man was, they got in touch with the Society and askedwe would be interested in having them in the museum and of course we were delighted and very pleased that they are there. “It’s just another bit in the jigsaw of the story that is Belfast Celtic.”Signed by Belfast Celtic Secretary Robert Barr, the deal saw Connor receive a £ signing-on fee and  shillings per week. Mr Coyle said the fairly lucrative contract offers an insight into how well the club treated its players.“He was paid a fair wage then, and it’s interesting when you look at the document and see that when they were injured they still got paid provided they showed a doctor’s certicate,” he said,“It’s another reflection of how Belfast Celtic tried to look after its players in those days. Bear in mind that there wasn’t social security back then, there weren’t employers insurance arrangements, so it would’ve meant a lot to the guy thathe was hurt that his employers would look after him. I’m not surethat was common practice, but that’s how he was treated by Belfast Celtic.”Connor was seen as a particularly tough player, who would walk from Downpatrick to Belfast for training sessions, but for all his physical prowess and skill he was, given the time, relatively uneducated and simply signed his contract with an ‘X’.“It’s absolutely no reflection on him that maybe he wasn’t able to read or write, but how many people back then would’ve had access to education in the way that we do so now,” Mr Coyle explained.“What became the  Plus Act, the Education Act, wasn’t introduced until , so for many people having a basic education just wasn’t as easy,you lived in a rural area it was much more dficult.“I hadn’t seen a contract signed with an ‘X’ before I saw his contract. Of course, this was  years ago.”While the contract offers a fascinating insight into Belfast Celtic as a club, Mr Coyle said it contributes to the wider history of the city, particularly around St James’ and the Park Centre site where Celtic Park once sat.“It all helps to tell the story of that part of the city because at the time Jimmy Connor was playing for them they were the star attraction in that part of the area. People’s lives revolved around seeing Belfast Celtic midweek and on a Saturday. “The man who would’ve signed Jimmy Connor, his name is at the top of the contract, Robert Barr – he was a school teacher and he gave that up to become full-time secretary of Belfast Celtic Football Club. He worked for them until his death. There is a story there too. You’ll know St James’ and there’s a roadthat leads to Willowbank’s playing pitch and my surmising of it is that he lived in a house back in the day when there wouldn’t have been that road there, but he lived in a house, from what I’ve been told, that led into the Belfast Celtic ground. The story goes that he went out his back door in the morning, down that back garden and out a gate straight into Celtic Park.He added: “He would’ve been the guy who did all the administration for people like Jimmy Connor, who maybe couldn’t read or write, but he looked after them and made sure they were treated properly.”During his career Jimmy Connor was picked as an Irish international, receiving  caps during a -year spell when he played alongside other stars such as Mickey Hamill and Patrick O’Connell who, during a his managerial career, would save Catalan giants FC Barcelona from certain collapse.Sadly, Jimmy Connor’s le was cut short when he died in the Spanish Flu pandemic of , aged just .It is not knownJimmy Connor is survived by any family members, but Mr Coyle encouraged anyone with any information about him or Belfast Celtic to help keep the history alive by getting in touch.“Those of us associated with the Society are just volunteers who love the story and we’re happy in any way to help promote the story,” he enthused.“If people have anything they want to let us see or talk about then we’re more than willing.Anything at all to keep the story of the incredible football club going.”Jimmy Connor’s contract will go on display at the Belfast Celtic Society museum in the Park Centre."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"nicole starts new year at home","story":"NEWTOWNABBEY woman Nicole Adams has finally been allowed tohome after six weeks in hospital.We’ve been following the journey of cystic fibrosis suferrer Nicolewho last year won her battle for access to le-changing drugs.But Nicole was admitted to hospital at the end of November where her condition deteriorated after she caught a flu.Despite her sickness, she was still keen to start the drugs Symkevi and Orkambi after the Department of Health agreed a deal with US pharmaceutical company Vertex to make them available in the north.Unexpectedly, Nicole’s body reacted badly to Symkevi and she was taken into intensive care on December  as she fought for her le.Brave Nicole battled through and has now been given a more powerful drug – Trikafta – as she continues on the road to recovery.This week, Nicole completed a remarkable turnaround as she ed home with one month’s supply of the new drug.“I have one month’s worth of Trikafta in my grasp and it is so surreal,” explained Nicole.“What it has done for me so far is amazing. I am still weak but you can imagine what it is going to do for me when I fully recover.“I want to thank so many people, including my amazing CF team at Belfast City Hospital who pushed behind the scenes without me knowing, and the amazing staff on Level  South Transplant Ward who have become my second family.

As British citizens living in the United Kingdom, we have a complex and multi-layered identity which in many areas is wider than simply Ulster-Scots. We remain unconvinced that the cultural traditions and identity of the Orange family will be meaningfully promoted or safeguarded by these proposal.#Earlier Conradh na Gaeilge had branded the proposals an #historic advancement# for the Irish language but ones which fell #far short# of previous government commitments by the Irish and British governments.The deal includes a number of provisions for the language including the appointment of a Irish Language Commissioner.Dr Niall Comer, President of Conradh na Gaeilge, said that deal was #undoubtedly historic#, however, the organisation highlighted the absence of an Irish Language Act as promised in the  St Andrew#s Agreement. #This legislation is undoubtedly an historic advancement for our community, and for those who wish to use the language, by providing historic official status, legal protection and an Irish language Commissioner for the first time in the history of the state,# Dr Comer said.#This has only come about as the result of a tireless, inspirational and bottom up campaign which has transformed how people here now view the language and ultimately how the state will interact with our community and shared language moving forward.#Ciarán Mac Giolla Bhéin of Conradh na Gaeilge added: #This protection comes in the form of an Irish language Bill being pasted into the GFA, independent from the other language legislation, as new, separate parts of that agreement. If passed, we will hold any new power-sharing executive fully to account on the full implementation of these proposals and will tirelessly test and expose the weaknesses and glaring omissions in the coming days, weeks and months. #There are some huge question marks here. These proposals fall far short of the commitments made in the  St Andrew’s Agreement, which promised an Irish language Act based on the Welsh legislation and does not contain provisions that are made for language in Wales or in the south, as was explicitly committed to by both Governments. #The complete omission of visibility and signage is hugely frustrating and will undoubtedly be a source of tension and will expose major fault-lines on contested cases of signage in the coming period. However, the possibility of the delivery of signage through language standards will be rigorously and immediately tested by our community. #The role and remit of the commissioner being left to the sign-off of OFMDFM leaves us at the whim of a veto being used against core components of the legislation and drafting and delivery of services. The use of any veto to limit, obstruct or frustrate delivery of services and rights would undoubtedly erode trust and could be potentially catastrophic for any incoming Executive.#We welcome the adoption of recommendations included in our consultation document for the centuries long overdue repeal of the final remaining  Penal Law, that will now facilitate the use of Irish in Courts the new central translations hub the right to use Irish in the Assembly, where it was previously sneered at and belittled, which includes a provision for simultaneous translation. Finally, the commitment to an Irish language Strategy has the potential to transform our community in the coming years. #We will now work diligently towards testing the glaring gaps in the legislation that prevent us from playing a fair and equal role in our society. Legal advice is being sought on several of the provisions, including the ‘official status’ provision. The devil is not only in the detail of the legislation, but in the implementation of that legislation.#"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"o theanga leipreachain go dti acht ghaeilge","story":"I , caitheadh amach as mo chéad chruinniú den Chomhairle i mBéal Feirste mé as Gaeilge a labhairt.Nó “teanga leipreacháin” mar bhaist Sammy Wilson uirthi.Mhuscail mé inniu agus Acht Ghaeilge ar an táirseach againn.Moill ró-fhada ach d’éirigh linn mar phobal Gaeilge ó Thuaidh tabhairt ar na húdaráis an tAcht a bhí geallta ó  a ghéillstin.Tá na heilimintí tábhachtacha atá de dhíth in aon Acht ansin:Stádas oigiúil.Coimisinéir Teanga.Caighdeáin seachas scéimeanna.Agus ar ndóighe tá ríméad ar leith orm go bhfuil aistriúchán comhuaineach le bheith curtha ar fáil sa Tionól féin agus comhaltaí ag caint Gaeilge.

They must be born and reared in a safe environment with their mother, and sold from their place of birth.Third party sellers such as pet shops and commercial dealers would not be able to sell young animals unless they have bred them themselves.The ban is also designed to deter smugglers who often abuse the pet travel scheme to bring animals into the UK to be sold for profit, often from the Republic or from mainland UK.The motion passed with unanimous support in the chamber."},{"url":null,"title":"gay couples can register to marry in northern ireland from today","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

SarahJanuary , The controversy underlines the conservative-versus-progressive battle lines within the Catholic Church following Benedict’s  decision to retire, and his successor Pope Francis’ more reform-minded papacy.Benedict’s intervention in the book, entitled From The Depths Of Our Hearts, had the appearance of being an attempt to interfere with Pope Francis’ ministry. Francis has said he will publish a document in the coming weeks that is expected to touch on whether married men could be ordained priests in the Amazon, to deal with a priest shortage there.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Pope Francis is the more reform-minded of the two pontfs Benedict’s reaffirmation of the “necessity” of priestly celibacy in the book gave the impression that the former pope was trying to influence the thinking of the current one.His intervention was also surprising, given he had vowed to live “hidden from the world” when he retired in , specically to avoid any suggestion that he still wielded papal authority.Catholic Twitter accounts, amplying the rt between right and left, were buzzing about the implications of Benedict’s intervention.Francis’ supporters claimed Benedict had been manipulated by members of his right-wing entourage into writing something that amounted to a direct attack on Francis.

As he wrote in the book, Benedict said he had begun writing “some reflections on the priesthood” before Cardinal Sarah even proposed the book in September, but had put it aside because of his waning strength.Benedict wrote in a letter dated September  that he had finished the book after Sarah proposed a text on the priesthood and celibacy. The third letter from Benedict, dated November , reads: “From my side, the text can be published in the form you have foreseen.”In a tweet, Cardinal Sarah said: “I solemnly affirm that Benedict XVI knew that our project would take the form of a book. I can say that we exchanged many drafts to make corrections.”The letters make clear Benedict had written a text prior to Francis’ Amazon synod, in which a majority of bishops backed ordaining married men as priests. After the synod concluded, Francis announced he would write his own reflections on its outcome."},{"url":null,"title":"508415","story":"The British and Irish governments have pledged to fund a number of key Derry projects as part of the “transformative” New Decade, New Approach deal. The -page document was published by Secretary of State for NI Julian Smith and Taacutenaiste Simon Coveney late on January , exactly three years on from the collapse of Stormont. All parties agreed to re-enter the Assembly the following day. It details how the Executive will benefit from increased funding for capital infrastructure investment as a result of the UK Government’s “infrastructure revolution”. Derry and the North West receives special mention throughout the document although the exact funding package has not been revealed. googletag.cmd.push Infrastructure funding will enable the Executive to invest in a range of potential capital projects, the document outlines, such as the A A roads Capital and resource funding for the Medical School in Derry, subject to the Northern Ireland Executive’s approval of the project. Commenting on the news, Ulster University said: “We welcome the commitments within the deal to the development and expansion of our Magee campus and the establishment of the graduate entry medical school. “These commitments will bring enhancements for student opportunity, health  patient care.” Foundation Dean of the proposed Medical School, Louise Dubras added: “Campaigning stops setting up starts. googletag.cmd.push “I’m so looking forward to establishing the team to deliver Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgeryand selecting the first cohort of students. Advance notice to all my medical education colleagues out there, Derry is great place to live and work, and Ulster University will be recruiting.” The Government will make funding available for a range of projects aimed at supporting community and reconciliation initiatives to remove barriers, bring the people of Northern Ireland together and build a safer, more secure society in Northern Ireland. This “could include” areas such as additional funding to support mental health over three years, funding for tackling paramilitarism, to support a new Executive in tackling deprivation and improving opportunity. Once again Derry was explicitly mentioned in terms of funding to support the “Derry addiction centre”. It’s understood that is in reference to greater investment for Northland’s Addiction Centre. Infrastructure  Concurrently, the Irish government has pledged to work with the Northern Ireland Executive and the UK Government to achieve greater connectivity on this island – by road, rail and air. “We believe this is an immediate opportunity to move forward quickly together to deliver on plans to complete key infrastructure projects including the A and the Ulster Canal connection from Clones to Upper Lough Erne. “The Government will deliver on its funding commitments to those projects, including a total of pound million up to  for the A. “The Irish Government also intends to take forward a review of the potential for Government support to renewed viable air routes from Cork to Belfast and Dublin to Derry, working with the UK Government and Northern Ireland Executive to deliver improved connections as a priority.” The Government has also recognised that the North West region is in particular need of strategic investment, and that there is a clear argument for further enhancing cross-border cooperation and connections, to the benefit of all. The Irish Government welcomed the UK Government’s announcement to invest up to poundm in Derry and the North West through the Derry and Strabane City Deal and the Inclusive Future Fund. It is committed to exploring opportunities for investment that will further support opportunities to bring greater economic prosperity and social benefits to the wider region. “In this context, the Irish Government welcomes the development of plans for ambitious new higher education provision in Derry,” the document reads. “This investment can support more access to third-level education for young people on a cross-border basis, enable further cooperation between third-level institutions in the North West including in research and innovation, and underpin broader economic development and opportunities in the region. “The Government is willing in principle to contribute to capital investment to support expanded provision at Ulster University Magee Campus, alongside the commitment made as part of this agreement by the UK Government. “We look forward to early discussion at the North South Ministerial Council on taking forward this coordinated investment in order to deliver this vital project for the North West region,” it adds.  Foyle River Gardens As part of the North West Strategic Growth Partnership the Irish government is “ready to continue discussions” on key projects for employment and sustainable development in the region, including the Foyle River Gardens – described as Northern Ireland’s Eden project, after the popular visitor attraction in Cornwall, England. The Government will also maintain the enhanced level of funding for the Reconciliation Fund at €. million per year in support of projects in Northern Ireland and border areas, with a focus on the most hard-to-reach and marginalised communities in terms of economic and social deprivation. “Ireland has consistently prioritised the continuation of EU PEACE funding including through ongoing engagement at EU level. We will continue work with our EU partners and the UK Government and Northern Ireland Executive to ensure that the PEACE PLUS programme, building on and continuing the work of both PEACE and INTERREG, will be delivered through the Special EU Programmes Body in support of reconciliation and harnessing the opportunities of our peace for all,” it concludes.

The -page document was published by Secretary of State for NI Julian Smith and Taacutenaiste Simon Coveney late on January , exactly three years on from the collapse of Stormont. All parties agreed to re-enter the Assembly the following day. It details how the Executive will benefit from increased funding for capital infrastructure investment as a result of the UK Government’s “infrastructure revolution”. Derry and the North West receives special mention throughout the document although the exact funding package has not been revealed. googletag.cmd.push Infrastructure funding will enable the Executive to invest in a range of potential capital projects, the document outlines, such as the A A roads Capital and resource funding for the Medical School in Derry, subject to the Northern Ireland Executive’s approval of the project. Commenting on the news, Ulster University said: “We welcome the commitments within the deal to the development and expansion of our Magee campus and the establishment of the graduate entry medical school. “These commitments will bring enhancements for student opportunity, health  patient care.” Foundation Dean of the proposed Medical School, Louise Dubras added: “Campaigning stops setting up starts. googletag.cmd.push “I’m so looking forward to establishing the team to deliver Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgeryand selecting the first cohort of students. Advance notice to all my medical education colleagues out there, Derry is great place to live and work, and Ulster University will be recruiting.” The Government will make funding available for a range of projects aimed at supporting community and reconciliation initiatives to remove barriers, bring the people of Northern Ireland together and build a safer, more secure society in Northern Ireland. This “could include” areas such as additional funding to support mental health over three years, funding for tackling paramilitarism, to support a new Executive in tackling deprivation and improving opportunity. Once again Derry was explicitly mentioned in terms of funding to support the “Derry addiction centre”. It’s understood that is in reference to greater investment for Northland’s Addiction Centre. Infrastructure  Concurrently, the Irish government has pledged to work with the Northern Ireland Executive and the UK Government to achieve greater connectivity on this island – by road, rail and air. “We believe this is an immediate opportunity to move forward quickly together to deliver on plans to complete key infrastructure projects including the A and the Ulster Canal connection from Clones to Upper Lough Erne. “The Government will deliver on its funding commitments to those projects, including a total of pound million up to  for the A. “The Irish Government also intends to take forward a review of the potential for Government support to renewed viable air routes from Cork to Belfast and Dublin to Derry, working with the UK Government and Northern Ireland Executive to deliver improved connections as a priority.” The Government has also recognised that the North West region is in particular need of strategic investment, and that there is a clear argument for further enhancing cross-border cooperation and connections, to the benefit of all. The Irish Government welcomed the UK Government’s announcement to invest up to poundm in Derry and the North West through the Derry and Strabane City Deal and the Inclusive Future Fund. It is committed to exploring opportunities for investment that will further support opportunities to bring greater economic prosperity and social benefits to the wider region. “In this context, the Irish Government welcomes the development of plans for ambitious new higher education provision in Derry,” the document reads. “This investment can support more access to third-level education for young people on a cross-border basis, enable further cooperation between third-level institutions in the North West including in research and innovation, and underpin broader economic development and opportunities in the region. “The Government is willing in principle to contribute to capital investment to support expanded provision at Ulster University Magee Campus, alongside the commitment made as part of this agreement by the UK Government. “We look forward to early discussion at the North South Ministerial Council on taking forward this coordinated investment in order to deliver this vital project for the North West region,” it adds.  Foyle River Gardens As part of the North West Strategic Growth Partnership the Irish government is “ready to continue discussions” on key projects for employment and sustainable development in the region, including the Foyle River Gardens – described as Northern Ireland’s Eden project, after the popular visitor attraction in Cornwall, England. The Government will also maintain the enhanced level of funding for the Reconciliation Fund at €. million per year in support of projects in Northern Ireland and border areas, with a focus on the most hard-to-reach and marginalised communities in terms of economic and social deprivation. “Ireland has consistently prioritised the continuation of EU PEACE funding including through ongoing engagement at EU level. We will continue work with our EU partners and the UK Government and Northern Ireland Executive to ensure that the PEACE PLUS programme, building on and continuing the work of both PEACE and INTERREG, will be delivered through the Special EU Programmes Body in support of reconciliation and harnessing the opportunities of our peace for all,” it concludes.

Gordon Lyonsand Declan Kearneywill serve as junior ministers.Alliance leader Naomi Long accepted the position of justice minister.Members of the executiveThe other members of the executive are: Minister for the economy: Diane Dodds , Minister for education: Peter Weir , Minister for agriculture, environment and rural affairs: Edwin Poots , Minister for communities: Deirdre Hargey , Minister for finance: Conor Murphy , Minister for health: Robin Swann , Minister for infrastructure: Nichola Mallon .DferencesAddressing the assembly, Mrs Foster said the politicians have many dferences.Michelles narrative of the past  years could not be more dferent to mine, she said.Im not sure we will ever agree on much about the past, but we can agree there was too much suffering, and that we cannot allow society to drt backwards and allow ision to grow.Commitment to powerMichelle ONeill said it was her sincere wish that  brings real change.I see no contradiction in declaring and delivering on our firm commitment to power sharing with unionism in the Stormont Assembly while also initiating a mature and inclusive debate about new political arrangements which examine Irelands future beyond Brexit.Similarly, there is no contradiction in unionism working the existing constitutional arrangements while taking its rightful place in the conversation about what a new Ireland would look like.”‘Wonderful compromise’Visiting Belfast on Monday, Boris Johnson hailed the wonderful compromise that has seen theof devolution to Northern Ireland, after meeting Stormonts newly-appointed leaders in Belfast.The prime minister said Stormont was open for business again in the wake of the restoration of power-sharing following three years of political deadlock.Mr Johnson praised politicians from all sides in Northern Ireland, saying they had put aside their dferences, stepped up to the plate and showed leadership.I just want to say how grateful I am to all the parties, to everybody here in Northern Ireland, for the way they have compromised the way they have worked together to get Stormont up and running once again, he said.Its shown a willingness to trust each other and to set aside dferences and I think its absolutely commendable and wonderful to see.Never mind the hand of history on my shoulder... I see the hand of the future beckoning us all forward.And I hope that with goodwill and compromise and hard work on all sides it will be a very bright future indeed.The British government made a number of financial promises to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line.Major investmentNorthern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith promised major investment to tackle problems in Northern Irelands struggling public services, but declined to confirm the sums involved until devolution was restored.Ministers at Stormont are now keen to nail down precise figures.There are reports the government could announce a poundbn package, but a Downing Street source has described this figure as just speculation.And Mr Johnson himself did not answer when asked by journalists about the poundbn figure.Additionally, the Irish government made financial pledges within the agreement to honour commitments to part-fund some north south projects, such as the A dual carriageway and a redevelopment of the Ulster canal system.‘Critical reforms’Speaking ahead of the discussions, Mr Johnson said they will focus on how the executive intended to take forward critical reforms to public services.This is an historic time for the people of Northern Ireland, he said.After three years, Stormont is open for business again with an executive who can now move forward with improving peoples lives and delivering for all communities in Northern Ireland.The previous DUP Sinn Fein-led coalition government collapsed in acrimony in January .The cause was a row about a botched green energy scheme, a dispute that later widened to include more traditional wrangles on issues like the Irish language and the legacy of the Troubles.Mr Johnson said in his news conference that there could be no repetition of the scandal.It is vital that public spending in Northern Ireland is properly invigilated and there is no repetition of that kind of thing, he said.The prime minister added that the new agreement contained provision for proper responsibility for the use of public funds. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Gordon Lyonsand Declan Kearneywill serve as junior ministers.Alliance leader Naomi Long accepted the position of justice minister.Members of the executiveThe other members of the executive are: Minister for the economy: Diane Dodds , Minister for education: Peter Weir , Minister for agriculture, environment and rural affairs: Edwin Poots , Minister for communities: Deirdre Hargey , Minister for finance: Conor Murphy , Minister for health: Robin Swann , Minister for infrastructure: Nichola Mallon .DferencesAddressing the assembly, Mrs Foster said the politicians have many dferences.Michelles narrative of the past  years could not be more dferent to mine, she said.Im not sure we will ever agree on much about the past, but we can agree there was too much suffering, and that we cannot allow society to drt backwards and allow ision to grow.Commitment to powerMichelle ONeill said it was her sincere wish that  brings real change.I see no contradiction in declaring and delivering on our firm commitment to power sharing with unionism in the Stormont Assembly while also initiating a mature and inclusive debate about new political arrangements which examine Irelands future beyond Brexit.Similarly, there is no contradiction in unionism working the existing constitutional arrangements while taking its rightful place in the conversation about what a new Ireland would look like.”‘Wonderful compromise’Visiting Belfast on Monday, Boris Johnson hailed the wonderful compromise that has seen theof devolution to Northern Ireland, after meeting Stormonts newly-appointed leaders in Belfast.The prime minister said Stormont was open for business again in the wake of the restoration of power-sharing following three years of political deadlock.Mr Johnson praised politicians from all sides in Northern Ireland, saying they had put aside their dferences, stepped up to the plate and showed leadership.I just want to say how grateful I am to all the parties, to everybody here in Northern Ireland, for the way they have compromised the way they have worked together to get Stormont up and running once again, he said.Its shown a willingness to trust each other and to set aside dferences and I think its absolutely commendable and wonderful to see.Never mind the hand of history on my shoulder... I see the hand of the future beckoning us all forward.And I hope that with goodwill and compromise and hard work on all sides it will be a very bright future indeed.The British government made a number of financial promises to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line.Major investmentNorthern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith promised major investment to tackle problems in Northern Irelands struggling public services, but declined to confirm the sums involved until devolution was restored.Ministers at Stormont are now keen to nail down precise figures.There are reports the government could announce a poundbn package, but a Downing Street source has described this figure as just speculation.And Mr Johnson himself did not answer when asked by journalists about the poundbn figure.Additionally, the Irish government made financial pledges within the agreement to honour commitments to part-fund some north south projects, such as the A dual carriageway and a redevelopment of the Ulster canal system.‘Critical reforms’Speaking ahead of the discussions, Mr Johnson said they will focus on how the executive intended to take forward critical reforms to public services.This is an historic time for the people of Northern Ireland, he said.After three years, Stormont is open for business again with an executive who can now move forward with improving peoples lives and delivering for all communities in Northern Ireland.The previous DUP Sinn Fein-led coalition government collapsed in acrimony in January .The cause was a row about a botched green energy scheme, a dispute that later widened to include more traditional wrangles on issues like the Irish language and the legacy of the Troubles.Mr Johnson said in his news conference that there could be no repetition of the scandal.It is vital that public spending in Northern Ireland is properly invigilated and there is no repetition of that kind of thing, he said.The prime minister added that the new agreement contained provision for proper responsibility for the use of public funds. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mallon admitted he consulted Parkhouse about the move before agreeing to move to Derry City. “He was here last season and the Derry fans will know all about him so he spoke quite highly of the league and said he had a great time here,” he explained.“When he came back he had put himself into a much better position than he was in before and that’s something that I want to do myself. He came here, he did really well and he’s held in high regard since he’s gone back and that’s something I’ll be look to doing myself.”Mallon, who can play in a number of positions, can usually be found on the left wing but has also been known to drop into full back comfortably. He spent part of  on loan in Australia’s A-League with the Central Coast Mariners making several first team appearances. The Belfast man has also represented both Northern Ireland and the Republic at international youth levels, and most recently he has featured for Stephen Kenny’s Irish U side. Mallon has not played in the League of Ireland before, but he certainly knows all about it. “I know a lot about the league,” he said. “Being in the international squad you get lads who are still in Ireland all the way through from when I went away with Ireland when I was  all the way through to . The lads were still at home playing football for their local teams or for a team in the League of Ireland.”Mallon joins Walter Figueira, Conor Clford and Connor McCormack as the new faces at the Brandywell this season, and with the new campaign just over a month away from kicking off, the newest addition to the City squad can’t wait to get going. “It’s a massive opportunity and I just want to take my chance and work hard to get in the team,” he stated. “Even though I’m coming over I know that nothing’s promised so I need to get myself in the team so hopefully I can get myself in the team, stay in the team and do well for the team and hopefully we can get some success this season.” googletag.cmd.push High hopesCity boss Declan Devine is confident that he has unearthed another Sheffield United gem, and expects Mallon to enjoy himself at Derry City as much as Parkhouse did in .“He’s a talented boy and someone I’ve known for a long time,” he explained. “It’s very similar to the Parkhouse situation last year in that it’s a Sheffield United player, a very technical player, a player with flair with a fantastic left foot who can play in midfield or the left wing and can also slot in at left back. He’s a player who gives us versatility, a player who saw the benefits of what David Parkhouse did here last year and he’s a guy who wants to prove himself at the highest level. “I’m delighted to welcome Stephen to the club because he’s going to be a great addition for us going foraard. He’s an exceptional talent andhe has the same impact that the Sheffield United player had last year then we will be in a very good place.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mallon admitted he consulted Parkhouse about the move before agreeing to move to Derry City. “He was here last season and the Derry fans will know all about him so he spoke quite highly of the league and said he had a great time here,” he explained.“When he came back he had put himself into a much better position than he was in before and that’s something that I want to do myself. He came here, he did really well and he’s held in high regard since he’s gone back and that’s something I’ll be look to doing myself.”Mallon, who can play in a number of positions, can usually be found on the left wing but has also been known to drop into full back comfortably. He spent part of  on loan in Australia’s A-League with the Central Coast Mariners making several first team appearances. The Belfast man has also represented both Northern Ireland and the Republic at international youth levels, and most recently he has featured for Stephen Kenny’s Irish U side. Mallon has not played in the League of Ireland before, but he certainly knows all about it. “I know a lot about the league,” he said. “Being in the international squad you get lads who are still in Ireland all the way through from when I went away with Ireland when I was  all the way through to . The lads were still at home playing football for their local teams or for a team in the League of Ireland.”Mallon joins Walter Figueira, Conor Clford and Connor McCormack as the new faces at the Brandywell this season, and with the new campaign just over a month away from kicking off, the newest addition to the City squad can’t wait to get going. “It’s a massive opportunity and I just want to take my chance and work hard to get in the team,” he stated. “Even though I’m coming over I know that nothing’s promised so I need to get myself in the team so hopefully I can get myself in the team, stay in the team and do well for the team and hopefully we can get some success this season.” googletag.cmd.push High hopesCity boss Declan Devine is confident that he has unearthed another Sheffield United gem, and expects Mallon to enjoy himself at Derry City as much as Parkhouse did in .“He’s a talented boy and someone I’ve known for a long time,” he explained. “It’s very similar to the Parkhouse situation last year in that it’s a Sheffield United player, a very technical player, a player with flair with a fantastic left foot who can play in midfield or the left wing and can also slot in at left back. He’s a player who gives us versatility, a player who saw the benefits of what David Parkhouse did here last year and he’s a guy who wants to prove himself at the highest level. “I’m delighted to welcome Stephen to the club because he’s going to be a great addition for us going foraard. He’s an exceptional talent andhe has the same impact that the Sheffield United player had last year then we will be in a very good place.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The  year-old and co-driver Brian Hoy will face in the European Rally Championship this season. “Its nice to get it and we are going in the right direction,” beamed an enthusiastic Devine, in an interview with the County Derry Post. Last year, , was somewhat of a break after the WRC but he was asked by Hyundaihe would be interested in taking part in Rally Hungary. “They put together a deal for me to do that along with Motorsport Ireland. They said theyd give me a chance, it went well and we finished third,” Devine recalls. googletag.cmd.push Devine, who was recently crowned Irish International Driver of the Year, was full of praise for Hyundai, Motorsport Ireland and to John Coyne for making it all happen. After winning the Billy Coleman Young Driver of the Year in , Callum debuted in the Junior WRC with some notable performances, none more than his debut in the snow of Rally Sweden where he finished sixth. Casting his mind back to the experiences of that season and all its thrills and spills, it was something he always felt he would back to. In Rally Portugal, he was comfortable in second place before a steering fault forced him to retire with three stages to go. When the championship was complete he lay in fourth place overall,  points behind third placed Jean-Baptiste Franceschi. googletag.cmd.push “I remember going to Corsica. Wed be writing notes for the stage, then watching a DVD to check your notes. “Youd be in bed late and up early in the morning, it would be demanding on the body but look...It was a bit of a shock to the system. “It was a good unseen learning year for us. It is a lot more demanding than anybody every thinks until you are in it.” Devine name checked the likes of Craig Breen and Chris Meeke as some of those who were an ear to listen to, giving him the support. Round one of this years European circuit takes place on the Azores, off the coast of Portugal in late March. For now, his preparation is about keeping the body ticking over, getting out for a run to hone his fitness. “Come mid-February, we will do some testing in the car to figure out the set-up and what we have to work with. “The Azores is going to be the most dficult one , it is a really specialist event. There are a lot of gravelly roads, it will be demanding but I am looking forward to it. We are looking to get around it , to get some points and get off to a good enough start.” What would Devine see as a success from this season  “Realistically,” he began. “There is an U category in the championship. It is a junior category for R cars. We would be trying to mix it with the guys, to try and race for honours in that. “I will leave the rest to figure itself out. Usuallyyou are quick enough in the Us, you are never that far away from the main category. “We know we have the pace for tarmac, it is just the gravel. It is about getting used to it and getting up to speed again.” In the Azores, he will be up against drivers who have raced on the circuit three or four times, experience that is priceless at this level. Last season, Hungary was the only round that was new to the championship and on a level playing field Devine achieved a podium finish. He believes in himself, but hurdling around corners on roads you have never navigated before requires confidence. Devine is also grounded and realistic. “We are not saying it is going to be an easy challenge but you have to take the opportunity when it is there and get stuck in.” The  ERC calendar is as follows: Round : Azores Rallye , - MarchRound : Rally Islas Canarias , - MayRound : Rally Liepāja , - MayRound : th Rally Poland , - JuneRound : Rally di Roma Capitale , - JulyRound : Barum Czech Rally Zliacuten , - AugustRound : Cyprus Rally , - OctoberRound : Rally Hungary , - November Callum and Brian’s  season will be supported by FYTH, Curran Gate, The Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy and Hyundai Customer Racing.

Walking into work one day she collapsed. She had become incapable of processing the traumas that people living in some of most deprived areas of Europe were enduring on a daily basis.She found herself coming back to her original training as an artist and started a journey towards her own healing by going to church.Bronagh says she asked herself a lot of questions as she attended Protestant and Catholic services in Belfast and beyond.She says: ldquoWhatinstead of listening to the continuous repeated stories of Protestant vs Catholic in Belfast, an inidual had first-hand experience of visiting every church in the city for a service, simply looking and listening when going to each one ldquoWhat would they see and hear  As a non-church goer starting out on this journey, how would you feel ten years later  What is going on in churches in contemporary Belfast  How might this open-minded curiosity inform the continuous shting conversation about the city that I call home Belfast: City of Light costs pound and is available online at lulu.

I am guided by the principles of the Good Friday Agreement.Baroness Ritchie also recalled the words of the very early th century Irish political thinker, AE Russell, who said: ldquoThe strength of Irish culture lies, I believe, in plurality rather than unormity.The view that national culture is a guarantor of homogeneous identity is no longer tenable. A living culture follows a multiplicity of voices. Authentic culture is not a matter of ourselves alone. Baroness Ritchie said that running alongside the Good Friday Agreement, Russellrsquos words are the embodiment of her political philosophy mdash partnership, working together, respect for political and ethnic dference and unity in ersity.She then focused on the Queenrsquos speech, issuing a reminder that it dealt with a plethora of issues, with Brexit, the environment, National Health Service, climate change and devolved Institutions chief among them.ldquoOf these, Brexit has been one of the greatest political catalysts in Britain and Ireland, said Baroness Ritchie.ldquoIt has consumed all aspects of our lives in Northern Ireland since the referendum of June  where the people voted to remain in the EU. It has impacted on identity, sovereignty and nationality.ldquoLike the majority in Northern Ireland I want to remain in the EU and realise that due to the Governmentrsquos majority in this parliament we will leave the one institution that has provided so much political, social and economic stability on the island of lreland.Baroness Ritchie argued that EU membership had diluted territorial and mind borders and contributed much to reconciliation and developing the economy and infrastructure, urging the British government to look at how this can be achieved in any new working arrangements.ldquoBrexit has undermined the principles of the Good Friday Agreement in relation to reconciliation and building a shared society, the maiden speech continued.ldquoIt has deepened political isions at a time when our political institutions were collapsed. Being a concept that is essentially about the economy it has become a major constitutional issue in Northern Ireland.ldquoMoreover, the EU Withdrawal Bill, which will give effect to Brexit, will have direct consequences for trade between Britain and Ireland and between Northern Ireland and Britain. It will also reduce parliamentary accountability and lessen protections for workersrsquo rights.Baroness Ritchie said people do not want borders either in Ireland or in the Irish Sea. She insisted they want to build reconciliation, intra community political progress, economic and social regeneration and social justice,the very factors she explained that were enhanced by EU membership and which could be damaged when the UK leaves.She continued: ldquoWe need the closest possible links with the EU. We need favourable trading terms with the EU and as a cautionary warning to the government, there canrsquot be zero trade details with the EU and then do our own thing. Borders and bureaucracy need to be lessened and a comprehensive trade agreement with the EU is required.ldquoThere is a need for access to the biggest market in Britain which takes half of our agricultural food sales from Northern Ireland which is equivalent of pound.bn. Coming from an area where there are two fishing ports, the fishing industry is looking for the current unhindered and unfettered access to itrsquos main market in Britain to continue. I support that concept too.On the wider political issue, Baroness Ritchie said devolved institutions need to be up and running in Northern Ireland, expressing hope that the current Stormont talks process will bear fruit for the local population.ldquoThat is what the population is yearning for and what I hope can be achieved to help achieve a healing process and a period of moderation.Turning to the weeks and months ahead, Baroness Ritchie said she hopes that during her time in the House of Lords mdash along with other Lords and Baronesses mdash she wants to work towards building reconciliation, fairness, equality and a shared society in Northern Ireland, explaining that this requires a plan to ldquoend ision and bring down the physical and mental walls of ision.She declared: ldquoI would hope that we can work across this House to achieve that process of moderation and peaceful politics in Northern Ireland a comprehensive trade deal with the EU to assist our economy and a plan to end austerity and poverty and ensure proper financial mitigations are in place to deal with the punitive rigours of welfare reform.ldquoClimate change needs to be tackled, just look at the floods in Britain and the intensity of the heat in Australia which has resulted in the bush fires, and whilst reference is made to tackling it in the Queenrsquos Speech, this issue needs international efforts. I believe continued membership of the EU is required to address and offset manrsquos inhumanity to our precious planet.Baroness Ritchie concluded her speech by highlighting how much she is looking forward to working with colleagues across the House on a range of policy issues over the coming months and years..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th January 2020 Meeting.jpg","title":"Meeting called to address Saintfield sewage issues  ","story":"THE current ban on new development in Saintfield will be discussed at the end of the month when local politicians meet with senior officials from NI Water.The temporary ban was imposed by the organisation in July  after it confirmed that it was not permitting new connections to the townrsquos sewer system.With Saintfieldrsquos sewage treatment plant approaching the end of its capacity, NI Water is in the process of completing a comprehensive drainage area planning model for the town, with the exercise also focusing on the treatment plant which continues to comply with all stringent environmental discharge standards.The detailed study was ordered in the wake of a number of sewage spills at the Old Grand Jury Road in the town during periods of heavy rain.NI Water engineers have installed special valves along sections of the sewer network at this part of the town in a bid to prevent future spills but have confirmed that no additional work is planned until the drainage area study has been completed. This means that the temporary ban is set to remain in place.At Monday nightrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, politicians discussed the detail of a letter from NI Water which detailed that the organisation has identied a requirement in the region of around pound.bn to maintain safe, clean drinking water and address main issues with sewer networks between  and .The news comes after NI Water revealed recently that during this period, an additional poundm investment will be required across the council area.While politicians are concerned about the poor waste water infrastructure in ious parts of the district, the need for investment in Saintfield is viewed as a key priority by many concerned atthe current moratorium on new-build schemes.The lack of investment in the districtrsquos sewerage infrastructure is being blamed on years of underinvestment in the system and the failure to upgrade networks of pipes installed decades ago which are struggling to cope with demand.Rowallane councillors Terry Andrews and Billy Walker say the situation in Saintfield needs to be addressed as a matter or urgency.Cllr Andrews described the detail of the NI Water letter as ldquoparticularly worrying and said the scale of the investment is unlikely to be made available by the government.ldquoThe current housing ban and the need to upgrade Saintfieldrsquos sewerage network is impacting on a signicant number of people and has ramications for the construction industry and buildersrsquo suppliers, he added.Cllr Walker said there were ldquoserious issues in Saintfield with the moratorium on new-build having an impact. He said the sewerage network needs an upgrade and this must be carried out as soon as possible.ldquoIn the past, raw sewage has been back flowing into peoplersquos toilets and spewing out from underneath manhole covers into gardens. Such a situation is intolerable. The current system cannot cope.Cllr Walker said the problem was not with the townrsquos sewage treatment plant but the pipes which supply it, explaining that suggested level of investment required to tackle the problem is in the region of poundm.He added: ldquoPeoplersquos lives in Saintfield are being made a misery. In the first instance, the poundm needed for the town must be found. If we donrsquot get satisfaction from NI Water at the end of the month and the Assembly is not sitting, we need to go directly to a direct rule minister.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke said NI Water was making it clear that it did not have the budget to carry out the required work and blamed austerity measures on cuts to public services.ldquoI hope the Assembly will be up and running and we have a local minister in place and that there will be the required cash injection. The ban on new development does have an impact, particularly on the construction industry. The reduction on the block grant also isnrsquot helping.Independent councillor Jarlath Tinnelly said no big decisions were ever taken locally, but ldquokicked down the road forever and a day because political parties are afraid to make them.He added: ldquoThere is a day of reckoning coming for all public services and I remember reading years ago that the introduction of water charges would sort out the infrastructure problem.ldquoI am certainly not advocating that course, but the point is that these big decisions are pushed further along for someone  to deal with.

Lidl says it has been looking for an alternative town centre site for over decade without success until the Shanslieve Drive site became available, with the planned mountain rescue team centre providing the volunteers with a permanent base.Lidl said a large number of reports have been submitted with the planning application which confirm that the proposal will have no ldquoadverse effects on the environment or amenity of local residents.In addition, the supermarket giant says its development plan will regenerate a brownfield site with ldquomodern, attractive buildings and has signicant economic benefits.Objectors to the new store proposal claim that there are ldquoserious errors in the transport assessment submitted in conjunction with the application, inaccurate land ownership information, unachievable visibility spays and out-of-season traffic surveys.In addition, it will be argued today that in determining the planning application and making a recommendation to councillors, the local authority has done so without a thorough assessment having been undertaken and without being furnished with all the necessary information required to support a robust decision that the ldquoproposal to build on any particular site is acceptable, in principle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th January 2020 Plea.jpg","title":"Plea for opt in organ donation discussions  ","story":"LOCAL politicians are to examine how they can promote the importance of organ donation.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is working with the South Eastern and Southern health trusts on the issue, with many councillors keen to see plans for an opt out system.This means that people would agree to donate their organs with those who do not wish to do this signing a register.

The sides were still locked after extra-time and at the end of five penalties apiece when James McClean drilled Olympic - ahead.It was then left to Walsh to break the deadlock when he kept out Ruairi Fitzpatrickrsquos well-struck spot kick to seal victory before he was mobbed by his delighted team-mates.Rathfriland certainly looked the part early doors as they sprayed the ball to both flanks where Fitzpatrick and Thomas Lockhart took full advantage.Fitzpatrick, in particular, ran at Dalton Tate at every opportunity, but Rathfriland failed to take advantage of his wing trickery.The first real shot in anger came in the th minute when Olympicrsquos Anton McGrattan tested Parr, but the big custodian saved with ease.Five minutes later at the other end Dalton Tate produced a telling tackle on the edge of the six yard box to deny Fitzpatrick a certain goal.However, from the resulting corner, Stephen Hughes bundled the ball over the line when Lockhartrsquos delivery caused mayhem.Rathfriland continued to play the ball methodically through the middle where Andy Kilmartin and Hughes were dominant and with  minutes gone they teamed up with Fitzpatrick to carve out another opening for Harry Campbell, but he shot straight at Walsh.Ruairi Cunningham then created an opening for Fitzpatrick, but he was way off target as was Lockhart in the th minute. A minute later at the opposite end Jason Noade got on the end of a McGrattan corner, but headed over.It looked asRathfriland were going to take their - lead into the break as the game entered the th minute and good value they were for their lead.However, with  minutes gone Stefan Mason exploded into le. The rangy striker took on two Rathfriland defenders after picking up a long ball out of defence.He headed down the left flank and looked destined for the by-line, but stopped in his tracks, checked back, turned his markers and curled a lsquoworldyrsquo into the top corner of the net, giving Parr no chance.Two minutes later it was - Olympic and again Mason was involved. When his attempted cross was blocked, McGrattan headed the ball into Nathan Jonesrsquo path.Nothing looked on when Jones got the ball centrally, just inside the box, but he managed to get the ball from under his feet and beat Parr all ends up with a stunning finish and turn the game on its head.The second half was every bit as competitive, but Olympic seemed to have the measure of Rathfriland and were playing well within themselves until Peter Telford was given the freedom of the box and allowed to head in a Lockhart free kick to make it - in the rd minute.Jason Noade then headed a Jones free kick at lsquokeeper Parr and with  minutes played the busy McGrattan fired over after a nice build-up.Another searing run and cross from Fitzpatrick begged to be put away, but Rathfriland lacked a fox in the box and the chance was gone.Chances continued to be created at either end and with the respective lsquokeepers earning their corn with brilliant saves.However, the game was in the nd minute when Walsh came to Olympicrsquos rescue when he somehow kept out an effort from Marty Havern when the former Glenavon striker seemed certain to win the game for Rathfriland. Two periods of extra-time came and went before the dreaded penalty shoot-out took centre stage.Jones, Stevie and Jason Noade, McGrattan, Tate and James McClean netted for Olympic with Kilmartin, Johnny Roy, Nigel Prentice, Ruari Cunningham and Daryll Evans replying for Rathfriland before Walsh saved the day when he beat away Fitzpatrickrsquos penalty.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Dalton Tate, Paul Dickson, Jason Noade, Anton McGrattan, Nathan Jones, Stevie Noade, Chris McNamara, Stefan Mason, Conor Reid, Ryan Molloy.

The industrial action involves all NHS staff, not just nurses.ldquoThere is mounting concern that NHS staff are being used as a political football to pressurise the politicians to get agreement on restoring the Assembly. It appears that we are being used as a pawn in a wider political game, but the health and care of patients should be above that.The RCN is planning more industrial action today and again this Friday, with Unison confirming that its members will not be working any overtime on Friday.ldquoOur members are the lowest paid of all in the UK, said Mr McConnell.ldquoEvery time our members take part in industrial action they are losing money. But they feel very strongly about this issue and are prepared to sacrice a dayrsquos pay to make their point. It is important to remember that the ongoing strike is not just about pay parity, it is also about safe staffing levels.Mr McConnell said NHS workers have watched staff leave ious aspects of the service and not be replaced which has left the provision of health and social services at ldquocrisis point with all services affected.He said staff have tended to keep their heads down to deliver services, explaining that they are now saying ldquoenough is enough.The Unison officials said while their members continue to go the extra mile for patients, this is impacting on their physical, emotional and psychological health.Mrs Ritchie added: ldquoStaff family lives are being affected and they have simply had enough, especially as they are being paid thousands of pounds less a year than their counterparts across the water.Mr McConnell added: ldquoThe bottom line is that the goodwill of staff has come to an end. A stroke of a pen can end this dispute and will send a clear message to NHS workers that they are valued and, signicantly, equal to their colleagues across the NHS.ldquoThe pay parity and safe staffing level issues must be addressed now..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/9411974.jpg","title":"line up of calves win over judges at calf fair","story":"Breed judges from throughout the UK and Ireland were unanimous in their praise for the Pedigree Calf Fair and Beef NI Expo, held at the Balmoral Showgrounds in Belfast on SaturdaySpeaking after the one-day show, which featured three show rings and  native and continental beef breeds, event organiser and Chairman, David Connolly said: ldquoItrsquos been another fantastic event, and we certainly exceeded our strap-line lsquoBigger and Betterrsquo.ldquoThe  show has surpassed last yearrsquos inaugural event, attracting hundreds of spectators and more than  trade exhibits.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is events like this in the very heart of Penarth which demonstrate how lucky we are to have such a ying and vibrant collection of businesses, which are so accessible.It was great to witness how the streets opened up to more traditional businesses of selling hand-crafted Christmas gts and roasted chestnuts, adding to the selection of businesses we already have on offer.Many of you will be aware of Small Business Saturday, which this year falls on December . The campaign aims to encourage people to ldquoshop local and to support small businesses in their communities.For me, one of the highlights of living in Penarth is access to a vibrant High Street. The street, and town as a whole, provides such a iety there really isnrsquot any need to go anywhere .I regularly make use of shops on the High Street, particularly the greengrocers and butchers, while my we, Michelle, makes use of others. Shopping locally you are almost always guaranteed to receive a first-class service with a smile, and it is that welcome, as well as the quality of the product or service, that keeps customers coming back ndash these are the reasons I always make thattrip.Thatrsquos why Irsquove got behind our local shops for this yearrsquos Small Business Saturday. In the run up to Small Business Saturday I have been visiting businesses across the constituency to talk to local business owners about them, their staff, what they enjoy about running their own business and the challenges that they face.On Friday December  I will be visiting businesses across Penarth. If you would like me to visit your business then please get in touch with my office on    or by emailing vaughan.gething@assembly.wales.Irsquod like to take this opportunity to thank the town council, as well as all its partners in organising the lights switch-on this year. Thanks should also go to the local businesses who supported and Irsquod like to encourage residents to visit their local business to support Small Business Saturday. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

While policy decisions have yet to be made, heat pumps are the indicated preference.ldquoOver % of oil heated homes in Great Britain fall into EPC bands D to G ndash meaning they are poorly insulated and so unsuited for heat pumps without costly insulation work.ldquoFinancial support to help the poorest families switch heating systems would most likely be made available but many households will be expected to fund the work themselves.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Even local churches will see a hike in rates with some payments rising by almost %.Meanwhile at least one bank will have their rates reduced by more than % and will pay £k per year less.Many shops in Market Street have had their rates slashed substantially, some by as much as %. A kiosk in High Street Mall will have its annual rates reduced by half.There doesn’t appear to be any change to the rates at the Meadows Shopping Centre while Rushmere Shopping Centre will see a rise of almost %.At least one outlet in Magowan Buildings will have a rates rise of almost % though others will see no change. ASDA will benefit from a drop in rates from £,, to £, - a drop of £k. Tesco Extra in Craigavon will see a % drop in its bill from £,, to £,, - a decrease of £kBucking the trend in the hospitality sector is the Seagoe Hotel which sees no change to its rateable value.The Omniplex Cinema in Craigavon will see the rates rise by almost % from £k to £k.Portadown Fire Station will also see a rates hike of almost % but Cascades Leisure Centre next door, which is due to close, will see a % drop in rates.Portadown Health Centre will see a drop of almost % in rates in April down from £, to £, - a drop of £,.Mr Farrell said: “I think this is a step in the right direction but I have concerns about the rise in rates in the hospitality sector.”He added that there needed to be a ‘radical reform’ of the ‘flawed rates system’ and called for online retailers to contribute to the rates system.In total draft valuations for all , businesses in the Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council area have been published online.Known as Reval – this process will result in a new non-domestic Valuation List being used to calculate business rate bills from April . The Department of Finance said: “This process is about restoring fairness in the rating system by redistributing basically the same rating burden using more up-to-date values. A revaluation is not about collecting more money from businesses, but it is about ensuring that everyone pays their fair share.” Business rates are charged on most non-domestic premises including shops, offices, warehouses, factories, hotels and pubs as well as utilities such as gas, water, electricity and wind farms.The results show a modest growth in the total value in the Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council area of .% compared to the current Valuation List which is based on  values. Sue Gray, Permanent Secretary at Department of Finance said: “The revaluation means that from April, ratepayers will contribute to the funding of essential public services such as health, education and infrastructure as well as a wide range of council services relative to their  rental value, instead of  values as at present.“The growth in the total value of the Valuation List does not translate into a corresponding overall increase in rate bills. I will be seeking to ensure that the regional business rate poundage that we set is lowered to reflect the overall growth in the Valuation List. I will also be encouraging councils to do the same in respect of district rate poundages reflecting the fact that revaluation is not about raising more revenue overall from rates.”If rate poundages are adjusted downwards by both central government and district councilsthis would mean up to % of business ratepayers would either see a reduction or little or no change in their rate bill.Encouraging business ratepayers to view the draft schedule of values, Sue added: “I’m delighted that for the first time we are making the draft valuation list available on our Spatial NI . This will provide ratepayers with greater detail including a breakdown of how their value has been calculated as well as seeing the same information for similar properties in their local area and indeed for all similar properties across Northern Ireland. This approach makes the rating system much more transparent – which is absolutely the right thing to do.“I would encourage business ratepayers to go online and view the new draft values for their properties ahead of rate bills issuing in April.”Preliminary outcomes of the revaluation include:a modest growth in the total value in Northern Ireland of .% many high street shops and some shopping centres will see a decrease in rateable value, with some as much as %many of the edge of town retail parks will remain constant some of the largest food stores show a decrease in rateable value of between % and %the office sector shows an overall increase in rateable value of % andthe pub trade will see considerable iation in values with notable decreases in some pubs and signicant increases in some pubs in busy urban areas.As well as being able to view their new valuation online at a time that suits them, business owners can come along and talk to the Reval team at events across Northern Ireland to find out more about what their new valuation means for them. View the draft schedule of values at www.finance-ni.gov.uk reval--niIf ratepayers are unable to access the required information online they can contact LPS on Tel:   . LPS is encouraging ratepayers with queries about their new valuation to contact them. \"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful linksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/258/172/true/1578587871343.jpg--.jpg?1578587871000\\","title":"suspicious package at omagh s royal mail delivery office false alarm ","story":"The Royal Mail delivery office on Omaghs High Street was evacuated for a time on Wednesday morning following the discovery of a suspicious package.

Diverging substantiallywill bring in the requirement for inspections at the border for customs. “That hasn’t been agreed formally. That is quite a lot for UK and NI operators to deal with – haulage and freight movers, to get to grips with that. There are major operational challenges.“Northern Ireland also leave the customs union with GB, but there will be a customs border will between GB and NI to continue to essentially allow freight and good to travel.”Since Boris Johnson’s deal was floated, it’s understood the shipping industry is now drawing up plans for EU border checks in Britain for trade bound for Northern Ireland.According to the BBC, freight could be erted through ports with space for inspections at areas such as Liverpool and Stranraer.Richard says checks are likely to be carried out at the ports. The issue  He says backlogs, queues and congestion. “ to queueing back on to ferries and ships, which may miss or mess up timetables,” he says. He says while “many wouldn’t welcome new formalities”, a lot of cargo – such as dry bulk, fuel, aggregates and containerised products –  will find it reasonably easy to deal with. The main concern is around ‘roll on, roll off’, where the containers or lorries are driven on board a ship.“Those modes are where it could be the most problematic, as it’s based on a fluid process,” he says.“I think there is a definite concern from ports and shipping industries that businesses may be impacted negatively, and may reassess business operations.“I wouldn’t say it’s a doomsday scenario but it’s a real challenge for the sector to overcome. Politicians will have to make sure that with any kind of arrangements, there will be a good solution. This is a new proposal, so we are unsure what the details will be.”Brexit aside, Richard says the industry as a whole is that while the largely commercial and independent ports aren’t in need of ‘hand outs’ from the public sector, areas such as connectivity, roads and planning are key to their success.“It’s about making sure the planning system works, and is swt, and responsive,” he said. “They can be agile, for example, building a new shed, terminal or quay, or new developments in the water.“Where there are environmental sensitivities it can sometimes slow down the planning regimes so we are keen to see them not slow down. We welcome environmental policies but we want a scheme that will work and doesn’t have unintended consequences.“Shipping, although not perfect, is one of the most clean and efficient methods of transport. It’s a balance between environmental protection, but enabling ports and regions to grow.“If there are schemes, ports can find there are investors willing to come in, but they do rely on government – local or national – to finance road and rail connectivity.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/year1.jpg","title":"yearbook a look back at ","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business It was another year shaped by political turmoil and the loss of some giants of industry, but it was also a period which saw great opportunity and growth.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/234234343334.jpg","title":"stormont deal business back new assembly","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith and Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Pic Kelvin Boyes Northern Ireland’s business community has given its support for a deal which has seen the Assembly up-and-running after a three year stasis. The Northern Ireland Assembly couldon Fridaypolitical parties back a deal tabled by the UK and Irish Governments. DUP leader Arlene Foster has indicated that her party will back the deal, while Sinn Fein said its leadership will meet to discuss it on Friday. The UUP has said they will consider the deal, but are willing to attend the Assemblyit sits. In a joint statement urging politicians to accept the ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal, NI Chamber president John Healy, vice president Ian Henry, and chief executive Ann McGregor, said: “After three years of paralysis, we now have a workable deal that will allow an Executive to start addressing the problems within our health service and education system. They will also be able to take action to grow our economy and support the community and voluntary sector. “We therefore encourage the five main political parties to progress it urgently. Business, health and education cannot wait any longer - failure is not an option. “Now is the time for our politicians to show mature leadership and help navigate a path to the future by accepting this deal.” Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney published the New Decade, New Approach deal on Thursday evening and urged parties to back it andto Stormont on Friday. Reacting to the news, Trade NI – the alliance of Retail NI, Manufacturing NI and Hospitality Ulster – said: “We welcome the draft deal published by the British and Irish Governments in the final round of talks to restore devolution. We strongly encourage all the main parties of Northern Ireland to sign the deal today and get the Assembly back up and running.” “As our three organisations represent the majority of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland, we are cautiously hopeful that the deal and aof the Assembly will see the development of policies and legislation at devolved level and the kick start that our economy desperately needs. The clear prioritisation of the Northern Ireland economy highlights the many challenges that businesses have faced over the past three years and our message to the parties is that we support you in your endeavours to secure this deal.” “While this is a good start, improvements are still needed to drive the economy forward and support the growth of business across Northern Ireland. As stated in our Vision  document, Northern Ireland’s potential is signicant but reform and growth is needed to create the modern economy we are capable of and deserve.” FSB NI policy chair, Tina McKenzie, said: “Businesses will welcome the agreement published last night as a step forward towards restoring devolved government, something for which FSB has been calling since the collapse of the institutions three years ago. “The draft agreement contains some positive commitments to bolster the local economy, on issues like skills, infrastructure and Brexit. However, theof devolution is by no means a panacea it just means that at long last we have elected representatives in place to tackle a very dficult task. “The next Executive must move quickly to deliver on the myriad issues which have been left unaddressed for far too long. While the health service will be high on the agenda, we must not lose sight of the need to bolster our SME economy, which is the absolute bedrock on which the first-class public services to which we all aspire are built. “Ministers must move swtly to support our economy at one of the most turbulent times for many decades, starting by lowering the rates burden on small businesses, whilst also moving forward rapidly with key infrastructure projects which have stalled and ensuring that our schools, colleges, and universities are providing students with the skills they need for the jobs of the future. “In order to begin to address these issues, the parties must put pragmatism first and get back round the Executive table.” Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster, said: “We encourage all parties to seize this opportunity and sign up to the deal published late last night to get the Assembly and Executive back as quickly as possible.” “This is the best chance to bring the devolved government back to le. Our message to the party leaders is clear, we support you in your endeavours and encourage you to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line today. Redmond McFadden, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce said: “The Londonderry Chamber as well as other representatives of business, education, health, trade unions and civic organisations, held a meeting with the five main political parties at Stormont last night. “At that meeting we pressed the urgent need for the parties to agree the draft deal which was published by the British and Irish Governments. Three years without Ministers making local decisions has had an enormous impact on our economy and wider society. A lack of effective and meaningful representation here is curtailing investment in our region, stling job creation and driving our young people away. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, said: “Belfast Chamber welcomes progress towards the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and encourages the local political parties to reach agreement. For the last three years, our members have seen how an absence of decision making has stunted growth and stled investment. The proposed priorities for the Executive contain some issues which Belfast Chamber has been supportive of for some time. “Other policies which could boost our economy are noticeably missing but we look forward to joining with our colleagues across the business community to ensure that the new Executive pursues an agenda that grows jobs and boosts our economy.” Northern Ireland Local Government Association chief executive, Derek McCallan said: “I am very pleased that the British and Irish governments have tabled a draft deal on restoring the NI Executive. I hope that an agreement can be reached quickly to get the Stormont institutions back up and running immediately. For three years, our eleven local councils have been the only ing form of democratically elected government in Northern Ireland. Local government has been a vital democratic anchor during this period and ensured the provision of crucial public services for local citizens. “It’s time to bridge the democratic deficit and unlock the potential of local government in Northern Ireland by investing in our local councils. An Executive commitment to a devolution bill and greater financial powers and resources will drive a transformation in Northern Ireland’s democratic governance and help create a more sustainable democracy, environment and economy for Northern Ireland.” Kirsty McManus, national director, IoD NI, said: “The ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal is to be welcomed, filled with ambition that,fulfilled, can deliver real improvements for the people and businesses of Northern Ireland. “We would therefore urge all parties to get behind the deal to enable the speedy restoration of the Executive. “Commitments from the British and Irish governments for some crucial pieces of infrastructure such as the York Street Interchange, upgrades to the A and A road and Northern Ireland’s wastewater network are particularly pleasing. “The expansion of university provision at the Magee campus in Derry meanwhile will go some way to rebalancing the regional economy. “Plans for multi-year budgets and increased civic engagement will also improve overall governance. “From a business perspective however, we would have liked to have seen more around a new skills agenda, which urgently require focus alongside a renewed look at the Apprenticeship Levy which is not included in this deal. “On behalf of our members, we will also monitor closely commitments to bring forward legislation that will allow unfettered access to the Great Britain market for local business following Brexit.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_Abacus-Grand-Central-1--1-.jpg","title":"belfastforlife expo bringing together ni diaspora","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by Ulster Business A new event will bring together the Northern Ireland diaspora and business community in a bid to promote and develop the region.
