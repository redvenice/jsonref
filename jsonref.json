Without it, the Commonwealth wouldn\u0027t even exist.The institution is not there to glorify the colonial era but to provide a modern fellowship of mainly Anglophone nations committed to peace, democracy and mutual prosperity.Just 15 member states, including Jamaica, retain the British monarch as head of state. If Jamaica wishes to become a republic, it would hardly be a seismic event.Equally if it wants to turn away from the Commonwealth and cosy up even more to China, it is fully entitled to do so.(Though why, having shunned the UK, it would want to embrace a contemporary imperial power which is itself accused of modern slavery is somewhat mystifying.)In any event, Jamaica does not speak for the Commonwealth, which encompasses 54 countries, a quarter of the world\u0027s land mass and a third of its people.Most members still firmly believe it is a powerful force for good. Indeed two, Mozambique and Rwanda, chose to join despite never have been British colonies.It\u0027s true that Britain benefitted from slavery. But we didn\u0027t invent it, neither were we by any means the only participants. And when it came to abolishing that hideous trade, we were at the forefront.In the two centuries since abolition, this nation has worked harder than any other to promote and fight for freedom. Boris Johnson\u0027s steadfast support for Ukraine is very much in that proud tradition.The past is a foreign country. We can study it and learn from it – but we can\u0027t change it. Our history made us what we are.  North Sea name gameThe Mail welcomes the Prime Minister\u0027s decision to take a 20 per cent Government stake in the new nuclear power plant to be built at Sizewell, Suffolk.But as it will not come on stream until the late 2030s, more immediate measures are needed to ensure this country\u0027s energy supply. One important plank of the strategy must be the exploitation of new fossil fuel fields in the North Sea, helping to plug the looming gap.So why has the regulator changed its name from the Oil and Gas Authority, to the North Sea Transition Authority?There may be a time in the distant future when we no longer need fossil fuels. Until then, the watchdog should be working to secure and expand our domestic supplies – not treating them as some sort of outdated embarrassment."},{"url":null,"title":"And thats Jaden Smith tweets dad smacks Chris Rock face","story":"Share this articleWill Smith, Chris Rock involved in Oscars confrontation | AP News"},{"url":null,"title":"Roman Abramovich gave Putin handwritten note Zelensky","story":"Share this articleUkraine war: Roman Abramovich skirts sanctions and radar in role as the go-between | News | The Times"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7a49c975a692d839be2101356388c08e7bcafac/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=ec95b6422c8134460dbfc91232c594d0","title":"oscars 2022 news winners nominations latest","story":"• Coda wins best picture at dramatic Oscars ceremony – full story• The full list of winners• The best looks on the red carpet – in picturesSmith was then calmed down by Denzel Washington and Tyler Perry.

(See 9.11am.) That is not surprising even the White House has disowned the comment, “clarifying” what Biden meant. Zahawi said it was “up to the Russian people” to decide who their president should be. Like Starmer (see 9.30am), Zahawi also said he did not approve of hitting people. Asked how he would explain the Will Smith incident if he were a teacher, Zahawi said: “I would say, don’t do it.”The issue of who will be the first minister has become deeply politicised even though the first and deputy first minister are equal in the power-sharing scenario.  The DUP and the UUP have refused to commit to taking the deputy FM role, underlining the political capital they see in the position. Steve Barclay, the Cabinet Office minister, said: Starmer says that should be a matter for the sporting authorities. He says he looked at the Sport England guidelines. He thought they were quite careful. Q: But, in your book, is Lia Thomas, the US swimmer, a woman? Starmer says, under the law, if you have gone through a process, you can choose your gender. That has been the case for a decade now. He says he thinks the law needs reform. Q: So a woman can have a penis? Starmer does not answer directly. He says: Starmer says insulting a family member arouses strong emotions. But hitting someone is wrong, he says. He says Smith’s response was wrong. And it did not appear to be spontaneous, he says. Starmer also said he was “struck by the fact that it didn’t appear to me to be completely spontaneous” with Smith appearing to walk up to the stage “quite calmly and then hit someone”.Starmer says he is asked this a lot in interviews. He says he does not think it is helpful to be specific about red lines.Starmer says he has been to Jamaica many times. He has done work their as a laywer. The connection between the two countries is very deep. But it changes. He says William and Kate are right to say time changes thinks. He says he does not want to undermine the Commonwealth. “I love the Commonwealth,” he says. But it needs to change. Q: How odd was it for them to do a drive-past in a 1950’s open Land Rover? Starmer says, having said he does not want to criticise, he does not see how that fitted with the rest of their trip. He says William was right to say there should be a discussion about the future. Q: Should he have gone further? Starmer says William may well do in the future. He would like to know more about his thinking. Referrring to reports that William is planning a new approach to criticism of the royal family, Starmer says that sounds like a “big change”.Starmer thanks the caller for her generorisity. (She is a host through the Homes for Ukrainians scheme.) He says he has heard many stories like this. People are waiting for no good reason. “This DIY way of doing it isn’t good enough,” he says. He offers to put the caller in touch with her MP, so they can put some pressure on the system.Starmer says Labour wants a windfall tax on oil and gas companies. That would be a tax on profits they did not expect to make. He says he thinks they have said they have “more money than they know what to do with”. That is what should be taxed, he says. He says that could save people £600. He says he understands the argument about not discouraging investment. But the windfall tax would be on money the energy companies never expected to have, he says.Starmer says this is “shocking on so many levels”. The pre-recorded video shown to workers was shocking. And then bosses went to parliament and said they knew they were breaking the law. They were showing “contempt”, he says. He says P\u0026ampO Ferries should not be allowed to pay people below the minimum wage. He says Labour flagged this up as a problem two years ago. He says Karl Turner, the Labour MP for Hull, has been banging on about this for years. But the government has done nothing. He says the government has now said it will close the loophole allowing P\u0026ampO Ferries to do what it did. Labour will support that. But Starmer says the government should do more to stop DP World being allowed to carry on running freeports. And he says he wants to know why, when it was warned the night before what was about to happen, the government did not do more.The presenter, Nick Ferrari, starts by asking about Ukraine. Starmer says President Biden’s comment at the weekend about not wanting Vladimir Putin to remain in power was “not helpful”. What is happening in the war is “thoroughly depressing”, he says. He says that the government should have gone further, faster on sanctions. And their policy on refugees has been “completely wrong”, he says. But he says he has wanted to show that that the UK is united in its support for Ukraine. Q: Would you host a refugee family? Starmer does not answer directly, but he says as leader of the opposition there are practical problems. But he says he has been impressed by the generosity of the British people. He says his children are quite young. But they talk about this a lot. They want to play their part, he says.And here is Butler’s own statement about her treatement.

File photograph: PAThe highly transmissible BA.2 variant of Covid-19 accounts for almost 95 per cent of virus infections in Ireland, latest figures show.The spread of BA.2 infections to the near exclusion of other variants has coincided with the rise in cases in the latest wave of the pandemic, data provided by the Department of Health show.Almost 700 patients with the virus have been admitted to hospital since Friday as the pandemic continues to heap pressure on the health service. On Sunday, 221 patients with the disease had been admitted within the past 24 hours, on top of 235 recorded on Saturday and a pandemic record of 235 on Friday.The total number of coronavirus patients in hospital has exceeded the 1,500 mark for the first time since late January 2021, reaching 1,569 on Sunday morning.However, the number of patients requiring admission to intensive care continues to remain stable at 52, up one on the previous day.BA.2 accounted for just 4 per cent of cases in the third week of January, when most Covid-19 restrictions were lifted by the Government. By the end of February, when the remaining restrictions were removed, it accounted for 76 per cent of cases.Since then, its dominance has become even more pronounced in mid-March it accounted for 90.6 per cent of cases and on March 20th, the most recent day for which data is available, 94 per cent. The department’s figures are estimates, culled from the results of PCR tests. BA.2 cases test positive for three gene targets whereas other Omicron sub-lineages – the originally dominant BA.1, BA.1.1 and BA.3 – test negative for one of the targets.As a result, a PCR test with a positive S gene target along with two other positive targets is “highly likely” to be infected with BA.2, according to the department.Genomic sequencing is required to confirm the presence of BA.2 but this is carried out in less than 5 per cent of cases and takes several weeks.The number of Delta variant cases that were sequenced fell from 73 in the first week of 2022 to one in the third week of February and none the following week. British authorities last week suggested a “recombinant” strain of Covid-19 involving a mix of BA.1 and BA.2 is growing 10 per cent faster from BA.2. Two recombinants that mix Delta and BA.1 are also being monitored one, first identified in Cyprus and France, has been given the nickname “Deltacron”.‘Working closely’Meanwhile, the Department of Health responded to a report suggesting that Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly and Chief medical officer Tony Holohan are at odds over a successor body to the National Public Health Emergency Team with a statement saying that the pair are “working closely and collaboratively” on setting up a new Covid advisory group. The Sunday Independent reported that Mr Donnelly disagreed with proposals advanced by Dr Holohan for the new body and he wants a different kind of group to the one the chief medical officer has suggested.The department said the aim of the new group will be to advise the Government on new variants and on the use of new and existing ways of fighting the virus. “Our understanding and experience of this virus has greatly expanded and it is important that this is reflected in the composition of the new Covid advisory group,” it said. The group will include members with “expertise in the key specialities of public health, virology, infectious diseases, microbiology, science and epidemiological disease modelling”, it added.Mr Donnelly is expected to bring a memo to Cabinet on the new group “in the near future”.A Government source suggested the group will have about a dozen members but other than whoever is serving in the roles of chief medical officer and deputy chief medical officer, its membership is not finalised.

Photograph: PA Proposals that would see non-Irish people forced to get an electronic visa waiver before crossing the border are not yet finalised as far as the Government is conerned, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said.Speaking following talks with Northern secretary Brandon Lewis in Dublin on Wednesday, Mr Coveney said the proposals were still in the legislative process in the UK and that Ireland would continue making representations on the issue.“I think it is important to say that this is not legislation that is finalised yet, there was a vote in the House of Commons last night but my understanding is this is likely to go back to the Lords and back to the Commons again,” he said.“What we have looked for here is an exemption for any non-Irish or British nationals who are resident in Ireland to be able to cross without having to get an ETA (Electronic Travel Authorisation), but as I say, that’s an ongoing conversation and as far as we’re concerned, that legislative process hasn’t concluded yet.”MPs at Westminster on Tuesday night voted to reinstate the requirement of a US-style visa waiver for non-Irish EU citizens crossing the Border as part of the proposed regime. The British government challenged an amendment introduced in the House of Lords, which would have exempted Northern Ireland from the legislation. Mr Coveney – who met Mr Lewis under the auspices of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference at Farmleigh House in Dublin – said on Tuesday night following the Commons’ vote that the Irish position had been “ignored”.He said that since the peace process was agreed, the relationship between North and South “has been based on uninterrupted travel opportunities and movement of people and we think that’s worth protecting”. “Northern Ireland, and the island of Ireland in terms of the relationships between North and South, is a very unusual construct and series of relationships and treaties and agreements,” he said, adding that it was “not for the first time we’ll be asking for special treatment to try to protect that relationship”. Mr Lewis said the decision to move ahead with the ETA legislation had nothing to do with reported concerns in the British government about whether Ukrainian refugees could cross into the UK. The plan had been in development for years and was “completely separate” to the Ukraine crisis, he said. The measure could affect as many as 645,000 non-Irish nationals living in the Republic - almost 13 per cent of the population, which will increase again with the arrival of Ukrainians fleeing the invasion by Russia. Sinn Féin reactionSpeaking in the Dáil, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said the proposal would create “a disgraceful situation” which undermined the Belfast Agreement and Common Travel Area. “It creates significant restrictions on freedom of movement across our island,” she said. Ms McDonald said she found it “wholly unacceptable” for a Polish person who lived and worked in Lifford, Co Donegal, would need papers to travel to Strabane, Co Tyrone, and that this was the reality “or so many people living in our Border region”. She urged the Taoiseach to intervene with British prime minister Boris Johnson and “to call this out”. Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath said the Government stood “foursquare behind the Common Travel Area and the open Border in all respects. We do not in any way support or endorse the decision that was taken in the House of Commons. We have serious concerns about the proposal for an electronic travel authorisation system. “We do not believe it is either practical or fair to seek to distinguish between EU citizens from another member state versus Irish citizens for example going over and across the Border.”The SDLP’s Lilian Seenoi-Barr, the only elected councillor in the North from a minority ethnic background, said Westminster’s Nationalities and Borders Bill will lead to more “racial profiling” and stigmatizing of minorities. “It is a racist bill,” she said. “It will strengthen the invisible hard border that already exists for non-Irish and non British citizens.”Ms Seenoi-Barr, a former asylum seeker from Kenya, added: “People like myself, who are black and brown, will be suspect communities. We will be asked to prove that we have the right to be on this island. How else can you tell if someone is Irish or British?” SDLP South Belfast MP Claire Hanna said the proposed legislation would be “hugely disruptive” for non-Irish or UK citizens living on the island, while damaging the North’s tourism industry. “This is a terrible piece of legislation overall, with a horrible approach to refugee and asylum issues,” she said, adding that it went “against the spirit” of the Common Travel Area. Troubles’ amnestyRegarding Westminster’s proposed amnesty for Troubles-era legacy crimes, mooted last year in the face of a backlash from victims groups and others, Mr Lewis said the move had not proceeded because the government wanted to consult with parties and civil society bodies in Northern Ireland. “We want to bring something forward that helps people of Northern Ireland get to the truth and get information,” he said, adding that he would not put a timeframe on that. Mr Coveney said the issue could not be forgotten “because the current status quo in terms of getting the truth and securing prosecutions and so on isn’t as it should be for many families and victims groups”. He said the Irish Government’s position was that the strictures of the Stormont House agreement on legacy cases was the agreed position. However, he added: “We also have accepted that if some want to move in a different direction, we’ll listen to those arguments and see if we can agree in places to move forward. We’re still very open to that engagement and partnership.”On comparisons drawn by British prime minister Boris Johnson between the Brexit vote and the Ukranian resistance to Russia’s invasion, Mr Coveney said Mr Johnson had clarified them and that his spokespeople had recognised “that’s not a good comparison to have in the same sentence”.A joint communique issued by the ministers after the meeting said they had discussed the development of the British-Irish relationship in the coming years, including “potential synergies” between the UK’s levelling up plan and Ireland’s National Development Plan. It noted “with regret” the developments at Stormont since it last met in December and reiterated commitments from both governments to the functioning of the political institutions established by the Belfast Agreement.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"british and irish relationship should be based on equal respect says starmer","story":"Labour leader Keir Starmer speaks to the Labour Party Irish Society Annual St Patrick’s Day reception at the London Irish Centre. Photograph: Stefan RousseauPA WireBritish Labour party leader Keir Starmer has called for a relationship between Britain and Ireland based on equal respect that acknowledges both governments’ roles as co-guarantors of the Belfast Agreement rather than simply consultees.He said the relationship had been dominated by Brexit in recent years but it had a rich and long history that was bigger than the current dispute over the Northern Ireland protocol.“And I felt they were some of the most uplifting years in my working life because there was so much progress going on, so much change going on. You could feel it, you could see it, you could sense it when you were there. And that has given me a really strong sense of the importance of that partnership.“The relationship requires respect, equal respect and understanding of what it means to be a country and to have that status, that friendship, that relationship and that respect.”Mr Starmer was speaking at the Labour Party Irish Society’s St Patrick’s Day reception at the London Irish Centre in Camden, which is in his constituency of of Holborn and St Pancras. Other speakers included Trade Union Congress (TUC) general secretary Frances O’Grady, Labour MP Conor McGinn, who chairs Westminster All-Party Parliamentary Group on the Irish in Britain and Adrian O’Neill, Ireland’s ambassador to Britain.Mr O’Neill said that this year’s St Patrick’s Day events in London had been conceived as a celebratory return to personal contact after two years of the coronavirus pandemic but they had been overshadowed by the war in Ukraine.“To some extent, we have to kind of dial it down a little bit or at least recognise that while we are enjoying this opportunity to meet in person and celebrate all the things that we really cherish, our democracy, our human rights, our independence, sovereignty, all of those core values that they are absolutely now being trampled on in Ukraine,” he said.“In Ireland, we’re working very, very closely with the UK, with the US with like-minded partners in the Security Council of the UN, within the EU, the Human Rights Council in Geneva, the International Criminal Court, using all the mechanisms at our disposal to isolate and increase pressure on Putin and his regime.”"},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics a disappointing patrick s day for the taoiseach covid s resurgence","story":"Hugh catches up with Pat Leahy, fresh from his trip to Washington for Micheál Martin’s ill-fated St Patrick’s Day visit.

Photograph:  Christopher FurlongGettyThe mayors of Manchester and Liverpool will seek a post-Brexit “resetting” of ties with Ireland as they begin a two-day trip to Dublin on Monday.The visit by Labour mayors Andy Burnham and Steve Rotheram comes at a time of poor relations between Ireland and Britain amid the ongoing EU-UK dispute over the Northern Ireland protocol.Speaking to The  ahead of the trip, they sought to draw a distinction between their cities in the northwest of England – which have strong social and economic connections to Ireland – and the UK government led by Conservative prime minister Boris Johnson.Mr Burnham said: “When people in Westminster speak, they don’t always speak for us. I can imagine how in Ireland some people might think that they do, or they might think, ‘What’s happened to the northwest, has it changed?’“Obviously, we’re coming over to say that we haven’t changed. We don’t want to see some of the nonsense in national politics disrupt our relationship with Ireland.”The pair are to meet President Michael D Higgins and, virtually, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar among other engagements, before they spend a third day in Belfast.They will be joined by 15 businesses and former Ireland and Manchester United footballer Denis Irwin, who will act as ambassador during the visit.Central Statistics Office figures show that Ireland’s imports from Britain fell by 13 per cent in 2021 – the first year of new checks on British goods post-Brexit – compared to 2020.‘Most important trading partner’Mr Burnham said that before the pandemic, Ireland was “up there with Germany” as Manchester’s “most important trading partner” in the EU. He said he wants to keep that tradition going, and pointed to new opportunities in the tech sector. Mr Rotheram highlighted the “green industrial revolution” and offshore wind power as an area of potential collaboration.There will also be a meeting with the mayors of Dublin and Belfast to sign a memorandum on co-operation in harnessing green energy from the Irish Sea.Both politicians are directly elected mayors whose visit to Ireland comes ahead of a Citizens’ Assembly that will soon be debating the merits of bringing in a directly elected mayor for Dublin.There are already plans for Limerick to have a directly elected mayor after the people there voted in favour of the idea in 2019.Mr Burnham said having directly elected mayors in Manchester and Liverpool had given both cities a “louder voice” than they previously had in a “very London-centric country”.He has powers in the areas of transport and housing but wants more control over both areas. According to Mr Burnham the UK was late to having directly elected mayors, but that Ireland is “probably an outlier” in not having such roles.Mr Rotheram said he would like more flexibility over how money provided by central government could be spent in the Liverpool region.Having a directly elected mayor, he added, allows a city to “get a bigger bang for our buck” as they can be more “responsive” and “nimble” than what “a national monolith, a great big machine, can do on our behalf”."},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and

has grown to be considered among the most quintessential of pub food.But although the devilishly simple combination of bread, cheese and onion has helped the ploughman’s lunch survive the generations, it is now, finally, being forced to adapt in the modern world.And so it is that the traditional dish has been given a rebranding to make it more befitting of a gender-neutral age, at a pub in the Dartmoor village of Belstone, Devon, much to the bemusement of some social media users.The Tors pub now offers what it has described on its menu as the “ploughperson’s” lunch, for a mere £12.50.It still contains all the ingredients associated with the conventional ploughman’s lunch – cheese, ham, pickled onions, chutney and sourdough bread – suggesting nothing was thought to be wrong with the original dish itself.Instead, it appears that a name that can be traced back as far as 1837 – when John Gibson Lockhart referred to “a lunch for a ploughman” in Memoirs of the Life of Sir Walter Scott – has been identified as a pitfall that could lead to the dish being cancelled, prompting it to be changed forthwith.A picture of the pub’s menu, complete with the new name of the dish, was posted on social media by Charlotte Deakins, 36, who tweeted: Her picture quickly went viral as members of the public shared her despair that one of Britain’s best-loved meals appeared to be falling victim to cancel culture.Ms Deakins even posted a link to the menu on the pub’s website, in case anyone did not believe that the picture was genuine.On Sunday night, she told The : “Quite frankly, my reaction is that it is pandering and dangerous, unless the pub owners have done it in a tongue-in-cheek manner and I hope they have.“The tweet has gained some traction and people are absolutely sick of the nonsense and having to pussyfoot around because of a small minority who are eternally offended.”The backlash soon appeared to be spreading to the online reviews of the pub, where a one-star review was posted on Sunday by one inidual.Dicky Harrison, the landlord of The Tors pub, said on Sunday that he had been startled to see how much attention the renamed dish had received.He told The : “The menu item was just meant as a bit of tongue in cheek. We live in a farming community with amazing women and men farming the land. It’s just a bit of fun and a nod to the amazing ladies who work the land here. I didn’t think it would cause offence, but in reality, women plough too!”The ploughman’s lunch joins an ever-growing list of dishes and products that have been forced to change their names after criticism.Last June, Waitrose announced it was relabelling its own-brand Kaffir lime leaves following complaints from customers that it was racist.The word “kaffir”, which is also a slur used to describe black African people in South Africa, was removed from the ingredient’s packaging and replaced with “makrut”.Similarly, Marks \u0026amp Spencer was forced to change the name of the canned version of the pornstar martini cocktail, after feminist campaigners complained it was “normalising porn”. It is now sold as the Passion Star Martini.The retailer had to make another rebrand earlier this year after it was deemed that Midget Gems, its popular variety of sweets, might offend people with dwarfism.Marks \u0026amp Spencer changed the name of the fruit gums to Mini Gems, following a campaign launched by Dr Erin Pritchard of Liverpool Hope University, who has achondroplasia, a form of short-limbed dwarfism.Dr Pritchard said in a newspaper interview at the time: “I’m grateful that M\u0026ampS has been willing to listen to the concerns of people with dwarfism and has gone ahead with the rebranding.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Boris Johnson \u0026#39helping more\u0026#39 than Emmanuel Macron, says Volodymyr ZelenskyPolitics latest news: Zahawi warns Putin will face a ‘reckoning’ over UkraineSocial media has a negative impact on girls earlier than boys, Oxbridge study findsChildren should learn about the benefits of empire, says Nadhim ZahawiUkraine morning briefing: Five developments as Volodymyr Zelensky says neutrality should be put to voters in a referendumMonday morning news briefing: Joe Biden\u0026#39s \u0026#39gift\u0026#39 to Vladimir PutinMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"david cameron reveals mother has dementia calls government fund","story":"David Cameron has called on the Government to help fund a “statin for the brain” after revealing his mother has dementia.The former Prime Minister, who has been president of Alzheimer’s Research UK since 2017, said pharmaceutical companies are not going to be able to “crack it on their own”.He also suggested ministers should apply the lessons learnt from the success of the vaccine task force, led by Kate Bingham, when tackling dementia.He made the comments following the diagnosis of his 87-year-old mother, Mary Cameron.“What I try to get in people’s minds is the idea that we need a statin for the brain,” he told the Sunday Times.“That humble little pill that many of us take once a day is a treatment that has had a massive effect on the incidence of heart disease because it stops the build-up of cholesterol.“That’s what we want: a drug that can help prevent the onset of Alzheimer’s and the other diseases that cause dementia.”He said that governments, universities and research institutions need to all come together to tackle the condition, which he predicts will be the leading cause of death “after Covid fades”.In the wide-ranging interview, which also touched on the Greensill scandal last spring, where Mr Cameron exploited private contacts with former government colleagues on behalf of the financier Lex Greenhill, he said his mother is a “great believer in getting on, with a stiff upper lip”.“She is doing OK. I took her to the pub the other day. But you know, not only is it a terrible disease in its later stages, but of course in the early stages it’s immensely frustrating when you can’t remember things and you worry about being forgetful.“It’s a cause of stress and depression as well as being a terrible thing in itself. So seeing it first-hand, it teaches you a lot about the very human side.”He said she is being well supported by his brother, Alexander Cameron QC, and two sisters, Tania Rachel Cameron and Clare Louise Cameron who live nearby.Their mother Mary Cameron had served as a magistrate in Newbury for more than 30 years and in 2017 won an award for campaigning against the closure of a children\u0027s centre hit by cuts David Cameron had brought in.As prime minister, Mr Cameron promised to double dementia research funding. In fact it nearly quadrupled, from £27 million in 2009-10 to £98 million in 2015-16.Boris Johnson in his 2019 election manifesto, pledged to double funding again to £160 million, in what he called a “dementia moonshot”.However, latest figures show the annual budget for the next five years is £75 million and it must be shared with research for other neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s and motor neurone disease.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Zahawi warns Putin will face a ‘reckoning’ over UkraineRussia-Ukraine latest news: Boris Johnson \u0026#39helping more\u0026#39 than Emmanuel Macron, says Volodymyr ZelenskySocial media has a negative impact on girls earlier than boys, Oxbridge study findsChildren should learn about the benefits of empire, says Nadhim ZahawiUkraine morning briefing: Five developments as Volodymyr Zelensky says neutrality should be put to voters in a referendumMonday morning news briefing: Joe Biden\u0026#39s \u0026#39gift\u0026#39 to Vladimir PutinMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"globalisation has run sorry course must find new model","story":"For globalisation – the treaties, processes and structures that have made the world more complex, inter-connected and inter-reliant – is the product of political choices. Those choices, such as the regulation and deregulation of labour markets, the regulation and taxation of capital, and the terms on which countries traded with one another, determined not only that globalisation proceeded apace, but the nature of change it brought.For a while, all seemed fine. We imported cheap clothes and manufactured goods. Our borrowing costs and inflation were kept down by government policies and savers in Asia. House prices rose and plenty felt better off for it.Even now our leaders are reluctant to see the truth. They cling to long-disproved liberal assumptions – that our values are universal, that the rest of the world wants to become like us, that interconnectedness makes war impossible, that the liberalisation of trade inevitably leads to open societies and democratic politics – and hope that events might still swing their way.The longer this foolhardy hope goes on, the more painful the inevitable change will be, and the more our rivals and enemies will conspire to inflict new blows upon us. Russia, so long as it is led by Putin or his allies, cannot expect a return to normal diplomatic or economic relations. And like it or not, Western countries will soon be forced to decouple, perhaps to varying extents, from China.But if this phase of globalisation is over, what comes next? To answer we first need to be honest with ourselves. We do not, as we often tell ourselves we do, live in a liberal, rules-based order. Since the Cold War we have lived in an American-led order, in which US military and financial might has allowed Washington to dominate the world. American hegemony is preferable to anything that might replace it, but we should not delude ourselves that global institutions and structures are in any way fair. They are backed by force, and the rules are bent to protect American interests.That US-led order has not been destroyed, but it is challenged. America lost its wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Through naivety and neglect, it invited China into the global trading system and watched as Beijing broke all the rules, dumped cheap products on the West, pilfered economic and military secrets, and caused deindustrialisation and social decay across the Rust Belt. American political instability, repeated elsewhere in the West, is directly linked to the economic and social anxiety fuelled in part by globalisation.The rivals and enemies who challenge us do not seek to export their ideology, overthrow our system of government, or destroy our culture. But as China becomes more powerful, its global interests are growing and with them its security and military interests grow too. As Western relative power declines, the likes of Russia, Iran and North Korea will become more assertive.The new model, then, needs to resist and restrict our rivals and enemies. It requires recognition that economic might matters, and so the pursuit of growth is not optional. It requires us to prioritise national resilience over the notional efficiency of stretched supply chains. It requires economic nationalism, strategic planning and the maintenance of domestic production and core capabilities.It also demands closer cooperation across the West, and with allies who stand with us. We need new institutions and fora to secure such cooperation, and coordinated policies on defence and security, access to commodities like energy, and vital tech capabilities, from the manufacture of chips to expertise in sectors like artificial intelligence and telecommunications. We need to be prepared for the end of the open, global internet and a challenge to the dollar as the world’s reserve currency.We will need to accept the reality of spheres of influence and, engage in a contest for support, power, trade and access to natural resources in non-aligned countries. We will need to accept we cannot help liberals and democrats in every country, and sometimes ally ourselves with countries that are neither liberal nor democratic. We will need to spend more on defence and security policy and use our combined aid budgets to rival China’s belt and road initiative. At home, we will need to do more to heal the social and economic ides our enemies like to exploit.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Zahawi warns Putin will face a ‘reckoning’ over UkraineRussia-Ukraine latest news: Boris Johnson \u0026#39helping more\u0026#39 than Emmanuel Macron, says Volodymyr ZelenskySocial media has a negative impact on girls earlier than boys, Oxbridge study findsChildren should learn about the benefits of empire, says Nadhim ZahawiUkraine morning briefing: Five developments as Volodymyr Zelensky says neutrality should be put to voters in a referendumMonday morning news briefing: Joe Biden\u0026#39s \u0026#39gift\u0026#39 to Vladimir PutinMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"progressive america slowly dying","story":"America is on the move. A rapid demographic change is underway, reshaping the nation’s economic, political and cultural contours. For as long as anyone can remember, America’s big business clusters were in the northeast, the midwest and California. New York, Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles were the kinds of places where enterprising young Americans would go to make their way in the world.Not anymore. In just twelve months between July 2020 and July 2021, these four cities lost over 700,000 people. A very different phenomenon is playing out in conservative states, especially in the south. Almost 80 per cent of the population growth in 2021 happened in a mere ten counties. Five of the fastest growing counties were in Texas and two in Florida. The fastest of all was Maricopa county in Arizona, which is rapidly filling up with large numbers of Californian emigres.What do the growth states have in common? They favour freedom. From snow-capped Utah to swampy Florida, geography and climate are not the decisive factor state politics is. As free states thrive, radical progressives drive businesses away from their traditional hubs. Last year, Elon Musk moved Tesla\u0027s corporate HQ from California to Texas. Thousands of lower-profile businesses have made the same move. Whereas California has managed to combine European level taxation with third world level public service, free states like Texas, Tennessee and Florida do not have a state income tax at all. While in New York and Silicon Valley, permits are needed to do almost anything, states like Arizona and Utah have imposed radical red tape reduction plans.Contemporary America remains bitterly ided between these two tribes. Conservative America drives pick-up trucks, prefers its taxes low and its government small. Here the Oath of Allegiance is pledged daily, and American exceptionalism accepted as self-evident. Progressive America, on the other hand, drives a Prius rather than a pick-up and is far more likely to worry about climate change. This tribe has a fundamentally different conception of what America is, was and ought to be, and prefers to focus on intersectional identity above any kind of exceptionalism.Opinion formers in Britain, citing Biden’s win over Trump, often assume that America is moving inexorably towards a more progressive future. Yet a rather different picture is emerging.States aren’t just depopulating due to an exodus of enterprising people. Progressive America is literally dying deaths in Democrat cities and states have started to exceed births. Though birth rates have fallen across the board in the past decade, it has been most pronounced in places where folk have gone woke, perhaps losing interest in raising a family in the process. Women in conservative America on average marry significantly younger than they do in progressive states.As Chicagoans and Californians flood into Texas, Arizona and Tennessee in search of a better life, many conservatives fear that they will bring their progressive voting habits with them. A more optimistic scenario is that as the most entrepreneurial abandon progressive controlled areas in favour of free ones, they will merely reinforce the intensely inidualistic mindset that already exists there.What is certain is that two models of American identity are engaged in a fierce battle at a federal level. Because the US system allows interstate competition, here in Mississippi we are leading a campaign to abolish the state income tax. We  have written a new law on universal occupational licensing to make it easier for outsiders to come and work here.What if this kind of localism were normal in Britain? What sort of innovation could be unleashed? You would not have to kill time hoping for Boris Johnson to fix things any more than we are waiting on Joe Biden.Douglas Carswell is the President \u0026amp CEO of the Mississippi Center for Public Policy.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Boris Johnson \u0026#39helping more\u0026#39 than Emmanuel Macron, says Volodymyr ZelenskyPolitics latest news: Zahawi warns Putin will face a ‘reckoning’ over UkraineSocial media has a negative impact on girls earlier than boys, Oxbridge study findsChildren should learn about the benefits of empire, says Nadhim ZahawiUkraine morning briefing: Five developments as Volodymyr Zelensky says neutrality should be put to voters in a referendumMonday morning news briefing: Joe Biden\u0026#39s \u0026#39gift\u0026#39 to Vladimir PutinMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sas commander accepted argentinas surrender falklands","story":"It was a foul evening, dark and bitterly cold, when Lieutenant Colonel Michael Rose first heard rumour a helicopter had gone down in the South Atlantic off the Falkland Islands.The then 42-year-old was aboard HMS Fearless, the command ship directing the British war in the Falklands, with Rose the commanding officer for all SAS operations. Despite the lack of information, Rose instinctively knew his men were on board. “I knew in my heart of hearts it was ours,” he recalls.About an hour later, Rose was stopped in a passageway on the ship by Julian Thompson, the commanding officer of 3 Commando Brigade, who broke the news that the Sea King helicopter that had gone down while transporting troops and equipment between two Navy ships was carrying members of two separate SAS squadrons.Ultimately, more than 20 troops were killed in the crash on May 19, 1982 – the worst single loss of life in the history of the elite regiment since its formation during the Second World War. The men either died on impact or drowned in the freezing ocean. Just nine survived.“He later said it was the only time he had seen me fall silent,” Rose recalls. “One’s heart just stops.”Back in Britain, an operation clicked into gear to send a military representative to tell all the families of the killed troops at precisely the same time, to prevent word leaking out first. The final widow was tracked down to a supermarket in Newcastle, where the awful news was delivered.The following evening, Rose gathered the survivors from both SAS squadrons below deck on HMS Intrepid to make the hardest speech of his life. Even more so given the rattle of anti-aircraft fire and explosions as the Argentinians launched aerial attacks on the British fleet.Six weeks after the invasion had started, the Falklands War was at a critical juncture, and Rose told his troops now was not the time to grieve.“The SAS was already deployed,” he says, “and we had been there since three weeks before the main landings and were scattered all over the place. You can’t stop at that point. The war just went on.”Rose has never previously given a newspaper interview about his role during the Falklands, and as Britain prepares to mark the 40th anniversary of the conflict, he insists he is only doing so because he is not bound by the normal code of silence the SAS usually applies to its operations. He says after the loss of the Sea King helicopter in 1982, the Ministry of Defence took the decision to break with established protocols and “tell the world what the SAS had been achieving to justify that terrible loss”.He is giving the interview ahead of a new documentary into the Falklands campaign which airs on Channel 4 tonight and features Rose alongside other senior commanders. In reflecting on the campaign in the documentary he is especially critical over the decision-making which led to the Argentine bombing of the Navy ships Sir Tristram and Sir Galahad (the deadliest day of the war). Rose describes the subsequent board of inquiry into the tragedy as a complete whitewash and claims the defence that the ships were deployed because of the need to open up a southern flank are untrue. He is also critical of some of the decision-making at Northwood headquarters which directed operations from the UK. We very nearly lost the war because of some extraordinary bad decisions that were taken by Northwood with regards to the land battle, he says.At 82 years old, Sir Michael Rose, who retired from the military in 1997 as a General, still looks every inch the Special Forces soldier. He sits ramrod straight, despite having recently broken a rib falling off a ladder, and regularly thumps the table in front of him for emphasis. We meet in a pub close to his home in Herefordshire – SAS country, where the regiment trains and where he still bumps into old comrades on country yomps who greet him with “Hello, boss”. “They are a very active bunch,” he reports of his fellow SAS retirees.His command of the elite unit gave him a ringside seat to the key geopolitical moments of the 1980s and 1990s. Rose was in a command room two doors down from the Iranian Embassy in London in 1980 when the SAS stormed the building, in front of the world’s media, to kill the gunmen who had taken 26 people hostage.His position also afforded him unique access to then prime minister Margaret Thatcher. Rose recalls her visiting Northern Ireland in August 1979, just a few months after she became PM, following the Warrenpoint ambush (the deadliest attack on British troops during the Troubles).A month or so after the success of the Iranian Embassy siege, Thatcher flew by helicopter to visit SAS barracks in Herefordshire, and he engineered an hour-long private meeting. Afterwards, his wife, Angela, and two young children were invited by the prime minister for tea at 10 Downing Street.The history of the SAS in the Falklands is not without controversy. Infamously, the regiment was involved in the botched Operation Mikado, a failed attempt to attack an Argentinian air base. Rose agrees it was “an utter disaster”, but insists he played no part in the operation as it was run separately from his chain of command.Similarly, an early assault on South Georgia involving the SAS failed due to appalling weather conditions, which resulted in the loss of two helicopters.But, as Rose is quick to point out, SAS troops were also involved in pivotal moments of the conflict. Most famous is the combined assault on Pebble Island, a daring raid that destroyed around a dozen Argentine aircraft.For Rose, the most important role the SAS provided was the “critical intelligence on which land battle was based”. One of his commandos, he says, spent 28 days hiding out on Mount Kent in wind, rain and snow, with just one resupply, to wire back constant updates of the enemy position.Key to their success were state-of-the-art portable satellite communication systems that Rose had personally borrowed from a contact in the US Special Forces. At the time, the only British Army satellite communication system was so large, it required a Land Rover to carry it.Aside from commanding and equipping his men, Rose also personally played a unique role in the conflict – by being the man to negotiate the Argentine surrender.He established a line of communications with the enemy through a captured Argentine air commodore, and secured an agreement to meet the military governor of the island, Mario Menendez, in Port Stanley.After a tense four hours of late-night negotiations with the governor, who Rose recalls as immaculately dressed in white gloves and an utterly “useless inidual”, the surrender was agreed. The following morning, he hoisted a Union flag borrowed from one of his SAS Squadrons as the first to fly over Port Stanley.“Punching the air is for football matches,” he says of the victory. “At the end of a war like that, you just feel very tired and relieved.”Certainly, the Falklands was not to be his last conflict. Later, he commanded UN forces during the war in Bosnia. And, in a bleak retelling of history, he notes the same tactics employed by the former Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic during the siege of Sarajevo as are now being used by Vladimir Putin in Ukraine. “They are shelling cities almost as a fall-back position, but it is not going to win them the war,” he says.Putin, he believes, is “completely deranged”, but warns against Nato provocation by installing a no-fly zone or troops in Ukraine: “He needs to be very carefully handled.”In preparation of the 40th anniversary of the Falklands, Rose started unpacking some of the old boxes in his home. Among the various mementos was a box of tape recordings of the peace negotiations which had been taken from his satellite phone. He dug out an old tape recorder and listened to them all. “At one point, I can hear myself saying: ‘He’s agreed to surrender everything. The war is over,’” he says. “When I heard that again, the hairs came up on the back of my neck.”Even 40 years on, Rose is still coming to terms with its legacy.

Iniduals are feeling guilty about “non-green” actions and are eager to share their efforts on social media.“This suggests we may see even more positive progress in the future.“Collectively, there is still much work to be done, but it’s encouraging to see that as a nation, we want to do more.”One in eight UK adults (12 per cent) also admitted they have exaggerated their eco-friendly actions to others, while a further 23 per cent are tempted to do the same.The issue of green virtue-signalling is not one limited to the household as it is increasingly informing Government policy.Earlier this month, Steve Hilton, the former director of strategy for David Cameron, said: “Politicians from all parties have indulged in an orgy of green virtue-signalling, implementing self-harming, counterproductive policies such as Boris Johnson\u0027s ban on fracking for shale gas, with no serious thought given to the long-term consequences.”Sir Christopher Hohn, one of Britain’s top hedge fund chiefs has also criticised “greenwashing” bank directors with lenders encouraged to back more North Sea oil and gas.He said: “Any bank making a net zero promise whilst actively lobbying against necessary climate regulation, such as mandatory disclosure of borrowers’ emissions and climate action plans, is greenwashing.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Boris Johnson \u0026#39helping more\u0026#39 than Emmanuel Macron, says Volodymyr ZelenskyPolitics latest news: Zahawi warns Putin will face a ‘reckoning’ over UkraineSocial media has a negative impact on girls earlier than boys, Oxbridge study findsChildren should learn about the benefits of empire, says Nadhim ZahawiUkraine morning briefing: Five developments as Volodymyr Zelensky says neutrality should be put to voters in a referendumMonday morning news briefing: Joe Biden\u0026#39s \u0026#39gift\u0026#39 to Vladimir PutinMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"public sector living fantasy land","story":"Our politicians must tame the vast appetite of the public sector to consume ever more of the national output – while delivering less to the taxpayer.

These included 17,400 people aged 10 to 21 who were tracked over a period of time.The study further found that teenagers who had a lower-than-average life satisfaction also tended to have higher social media use one year later.Sarah-Jayne Blakemore, professor of psychology at the University of Cambridge, said adolescence is a period of transition, both in terms of biology - things like hormones and the brain - but also psychologically.She added: We change a huge amount in terms of our cognitive abilities and our social cognition, our social awareness, and our emotion processing during adolescence.The social world (also) changes a huge amount in adolescence. We go from little primary schools to big secondary schools, we have a huge number of new people we have to interact with, peers take on heightened importance in adolescence, and young people have to work out where they are in the complex and changing social hierarchy.This is a really vulnerable period of life already, and social media comes in and kind of amplifies that.Prof Blakemore said social media is complex and can be a force for good, such as helping young people maintain social contact during the Covid pandemic.On the other hand, there are also negative aspects of social media, where the content of social media can be negative, she said.Whether it\u0027s pornography, or things like graphic images of war that you can\u0027t get away from as soon as you turn on your phone at the moment.There\u0027s also things like sleep. It\u0027s not just about what people are doing with social media, but also when.Young people\u0027s lives are so full during the day of school, and then after-school activities, that the one time they have to communicate with their friends, to check out their social media, is often in the evening quite late at night.We know that sleep is so crucial for wellbeing and mood and cognitive development in adolescence. So depriving adolescents of sleep because of their social media use is going to be a negative thing.Asked if there is a message for parents, Prof Blakemore said there is a need to educate young people about what they are inevitably going to see on their phones via social media.She added: Whether it\u0027s things like social exclusion, not being invited to a party from someone in their class, or images that could upset them, or social pressure, (we need to be) educating them really as young as possible about what they might be exposed to on social media and how they should handle that.Dr Amy Orben, from the University of Cambridge, who led the study, said: The link between social media use and mental wellbeing is clearly very complex.Changes within our bodies, such as brain development and puberty, and in our social circumstances appear to make us vulnerable at particular times of our lives.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Boris Johnson \u0026#39helping more\u0026#39 than Emmanuel Macron, says Volodymyr ZelenskyPolitics latest news: Zahawi warns Putin will face a ‘reckoning’ over UkraineChildren should learn about the benefits of empire, says Nadhim ZahawiUkraine morning briefing: Five developments as Volodymyr Zelensky says neutrality should be put to voters in a referendumMonday morning news briefing: Joe Biden\u0026#39s \u0026#39gift\u0026#39 to Vladimir PutinVladimir Putin\u0026#39s fate is out of our handsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"vladimir putins fate hands","story":"The gaffe raises the question of what the West really wants. If you believe, as our leaders have suggested, that Putin has declared war on democracy itself, that Ukraine is only the beginning and someday Vlad will direct his orc armies towards us, it is logical to conclude that peace is only a long-term prospect with Putin gone. Hence Biden accidentally articulated where much of the West’s imagination is already headed, from defence to offence.Yet the very same day Biden said this, Liz Truss told this newspaper that Britain was willing to lift sanctions on Russia if Moscow agrees to a “full ceasefire and withdrawal”. This implies a future with Putin not just in power but back in business. Antony Blinken has also said US sanctions are “not designed to be permanent”.This is a very different approach, much closer to what’s actually happening behind closed doors. Ukraine and Russia are talking. A key demand has already been conceded: Ukraine will not be joining Nato. Far harder to swallow will be secession of Donbas or a land corridor to Crimea, but Western diplomats know that so long as their nations won’t intervene directly, Russia is happy to go on shelling, and this bloodshed will only be resolved with a political compromise.It’s always best to limit the terms of a conflict, in this case to reduce the risk of a nuclear exchange – but also on the universal basis that the narrower the terms of a negotiation, the easier it is to strike a peace deal. The modern tendency to demand that dictators go to jail is unhelpful. It hands them a propaganda coup (“see, Nato is the aggressor!”) and it makes it less likely the bad guy will back down. If Putin believes that even a perception of defeat might topple him, perhaps put him in court, he’s more likely to throw the kitchen sink at victory. Any talk of regime change makes it that much harder to reach an agreement in the short term – and a ceasefire would grant Nato breathing space to redefine its red lines and beef up its borders.So, let’s be honest: the Kremlin’s insistence that Putin’s future will be “a choice of the people of the Russian Federation” is sort of right. He might claim a win eventually, but the loss of life and treasure might also turn out to be so great that he is quietly invited to retire or fall out of a window. The matter is probably out of our hands.Last week I attended the National Conservative conference in Brussels. I have never seen so many men under 30 with moustaches. Ukraine was the only talking point: among delegations, there was unanimity that Putin is wicked but disagreement over what to do.The Poles are ready for World War Three their PM blamed the crisis on “liberalism”. The Hungarians, who seem to curse every other word, are more cautious because their economy is integrated with Russia’s. The Romanians fear it’ll be their country on the frontline, and the Americans, who worry they’ll be doing all the fighting, were irritated at the lack of debate.The Israelis are reluctant to poke the Russian bear in case it responds in kind with the Arabs. I met a boy who was a jet pilot in the Israeli Air Force no doubt he could kill me 12 different ways with a dessert spoon. War remains an abstraction for most of us in the West, a fantasy, though I have agreed to do my bit and registered my interest in hosting a refugee. I give it a week before he requests asylum from my cooking.I felt very English. My conservatism is like that of a mole in his hole, and the passion of the Continent leaves me nonplussed. In the last session, a Greek MP declared that Europe ruled much of the world for several centuries and he didn’t understand why we were ashamed of it. The answer might lie in the massive portrait above his head of Leopold II, apparently unnoticed by anyone else at the conference, under whose rule Belgium slaughtered millions of Congolese.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Boris Johnson \u0026#39helping more\u0026#39 than Emmanuel Macron, says Volodymyr ZelenskyPolitics latest news: Zahawi warns Putin will face a ‘reckoning’ over UkraineSocial media has a negative impact on girls earlier than boys, Oxbridge study findsChildren should learn about the benefits of empire, says Nadhim ZahawiUkraine morning briefing: Five developments as Volodymyr Zelensky says neutrality should be put to voters in a referendumMonday morning news briefing: Joe Biden\u0026#39s \u0026#39gift\u0026#39 to Vladimir PutinMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"end free covid tests means","story":"End of free Covid tests means £, a year tax on caring for care home relativesThe Government has been criticised for slapping families with relatives living in care homes with a massive bill after free Covid tests end from Friday, April The Government has been accused of slapping families with a tax on caring Image: Getty Images iStockphotoByAletha AduPolitical Correspondent:,  Mar |commentsFamilies visiting relatives in care homes face paying up to £, a year on Covid tests, as the Government was blasted for putting a “tax on caring”. Universal free lateral flow tests will end on Friday. People aged  and over will still be able to get them, alongside those with compromised immune systems –they have symptoms.That would mean a family of four visiting someone once a week would fork out almost £ a week, or £, per year. Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey, who was a carer for his mum and now cares for his son, slammed the Tories’ “reckless” move.  He said: “With rates of Covid rising and many concerned they may pass this virus to their vulnerable loved ones, the Government’s decision to scrap free Covid tests is reckless. “Not only will this put people at risk, it will also hit families in the pocket just as taxes are being hiked and energy bills are skyrocketing. “The end to free testing is a tax on those who visit loved ones in care homes – it is a tax on caring. “Instead of helping families that are struggling to get by, Boris Johnson is scrapping free testing in a short-sighted move that will increase the cost of day-to-day le for millions of people.The Chancellor must execute a U-turn on his behalf.” The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening.

It comes after NHS Confederation called for clarity on whether medics will have to continue to get regular tests – and foot the bill themselves Danny Altmann, professor of immunology at Imperial College London, said forcing them to pay would be “a disaster”.  He said: “Imagine working with very vulnerable patients, it would be devastating to imagine you might infect them with something that might kill them.And the onus is on you to keep paying for testing. How can that be OK ” Around .million people are likely to have had Covid in the week to March , the Office for National Statistics said.

However, I now have to take time off work for my recovery. Everyone who knows me knows that I am a workaholic and I love what I do - but unless I listen to medical advice and recover well, I will not be able to give my best.I would like to thank Parliament, the Labour Party, local members and my team for their support throughout.The Brent Central MP paid tribute to NHS staff, saying she had seen first-hand how the NHS is under enormous pressure when receiving treatment at the Royal London Hospital. She added: The Royal London seemed full, people were waiting on chairs in AE for beds, the staff were exhausted in the NHS and many were suffering from PTSD. Covid- has taken a lot out of them.So many people have missed appointments , results are delayed and operations postponed. If we are to show our appreciation for the amazing NHS workers and rebuild our health service then we need to properly invest in the NHS, both structurally and in the very people who keep it ing.Labour leader Keir Starmer tweeted: Dawn, your bravery, strength and determination shine through.I am sorry you’re going through this, but know that I, and the whole Party, are behind you.

Katherine Fletcher was accused of an insult on struggling families after Rishi Sunakaposs mini-Budget last week failed to offer the poorest help for the looming cost-of-living crisis despite soaring energy bills and food prices.The Chancellor refused to reinstate the £ uplt to Universal Credit and, despite inflation set to average % this year, uprated benefits by a measly %, meaning low-income families will in fact be hit hardest.The Resolution Foundation, an independent think tank, calculated a staggering .m people, including , children, will be left facing absolute poverty this year as a result.But South Ribble MP Ms Fletcher sought to duck responsibility for the governmentaposs decisions when she appeared on BBC Politics North West.She attacked the Foundation, whose executive chairman is former Tory MP David Willetts, for not being fair or neutral, before outrageously suggesting people were sitting on benefits.  Weaposve got the same number of people unemployed at the moment as weaposve got same number of job vacancies, she said. The best way to help anyone out of relative or absolute poverty is to help them get a job. Told that even people in work were facing levels of poverty not seen in decades, Ms Fletcher replied no, no, and went on: You get any job, you get a better job, you get a career. She said the government was backing a plan for jobs, before adding: I went to see the job centre at Leyland the other day. Theyaposve got more vacancies than weaposve got job seekers. So thereaposs huge effort to put that in. People sitting on benefits - thataposs not helping them. Labouraposs Shadow Employment Minister Alison McGovern said Mr Sunak has failed to support the worst-hit families, adding: “For a Tory MP to suggest people are sitting around on benefits shows we’re being governed by the same old Tories. While working families are striving to make ends meet in the face of callous Conservative decisions that are making their lives harder, we have a Tory MP doing nothing more than insult them. This tired Tory Government is out of touch, out of ideas, and hopefully soon out of office. The Resolution Foundation found that a typical working-age household will see their real income fall % next year - a loss of £,, the Resolution Foundation think tank said.Absolute poverty - rather than relative poverty - is crucial because it is the measure Boris Johnson chooses to use.The Foundation warned the Tory Chancelloraposs £bn in cuts to National Insurance and fuel duty will also mostly benefit people in work.  Even with a p cut in income tax from , seven out of eight workers will still be paying more tax overall by , the expertsapos analysis found. “The scale and distribution of the cost of living squeeze, coupled with the lack of support for low-income families, means that a further . million people are set to fall into absolute poverty next year, including , children – the first time Britain has seen such a rise outside of recessions, the think tank said.It came as Mr Sunak was branded “Mr Tax” by shadow work and pensions secretary Jonathan Ashworth, as the Labour frontbencher warned pensioners have been “cutting back on hot meals” and “forgoing hot showers” as they cannot afford the cost.The Chancellor is reported to be considering proposals for a second council tax rebate to help ease the impact of soaring fuel bills, according to the Sunday Times, as even backbench Tories are piling the pressure on Mr Sunak to act. His package of support, which was announced before the mini-Budget, includes a £ up-front rebate on energy bills from October, which will be clawed back next year, plus a £ council tax rebate for homes in bands A to D from next month.Mr Ashworth told Sophy Ridge On Sunday on Sky News: “ Rishi Sunak absolutely had more room for manoeuvre in this spring statement and mini budget, but rather than acting in the interests of the British people, he was playing games.“He was acting in his own interest because he thinks by offering an income tax cut in two years that’ll help him politically with Conservative MPsthere’s a leadership contest or that’ll fit the Tory election grid.  “I don’t believe that putting . million people into poverty because you’re imposing a very severe real-terms cut to Universal Credit, you’re imposing the biggest cut to the pension in  years, is fair.” Mr Ashworth said Mr Sunak should have imposed a “windfall tax” on the profits of oil and gas companies to generate funds to help struggling families and pensioners with energy bills. He said: “He chose not to do that. “Instead, he’s imposed these very punishing tax rises, these very severe real-terms cuts to the pension and support like universal credit, and he’s expecting people to be grateful because two years down the road he’s saying there’s going to be an income tax cut even though that income tax cut nowhere near offsets the  tax rises that he has imposed on the British people, £, extra per householdyou do a rough and ready calculation. “He is a tax-rising Chancellor, he is Mr Tax and it’s the British people who are paying the price.”Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi hinted more help was on the way, when he said it would be irresponsible to say “job done” by Mr Sunak over the cost-of-living crisis.He told the same programme: “I think he will continue to keep an eye on this, it’s only right. “It’s irresponsible for me to say ‘job done’ because energy prices are volatile, inflation remains high, so it would be absolutely irresponsible to say ‘job done’.

Several videos have been posted on the social media site of people injecting henna or black ink into their faces in an attempt to emulate the Duchess of Sussex.Several of the home jobs have left the young women in need of medical help as they triggered allergic reactions, with some facing permanent scarring on their faces. By using needles which may have not been sterilised they run the risk of catching the likes of HIV.The Mail Online reported Laura Kay, a London-based make-up artist, saying: “I wouldn’t advise that you get tattoo freckles done. “People who do tattoos at home without a licence are known as scratchers, and that’s not legal. “Tattoo artists must have a licence, and DIY tattoos pose a real risk of HIV or hepatitis.” Removal of the bodged “freckles” can end up costing people hundreds of pounds. Make-up specialist Sian Dellar, added most of those applying fake freckles were aged  to . She added: “There was a time when people wanted to hide their freckles, but now people really want them and it was Meghan Markle who sparked the demand.

Gruinard Island was reduced to ashes after the fire took hold on Saturday night. People were astonished to witness the flames and smoke billowing into the atmosphere after the blaze took over the island in Wester Ross, Scotland.They took to social media to tell of the devastation which was seen from the Hebridean isles the Daily Record reports.One person saw the wrote: Gruinard Island ablaze, reports of seeing fire from Lewis. Another poster added: Very sad seeing Gruinard Island in flames but even sadder hearing the haunting screeching of the oyster catchers and geese.  The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said they were not aware of the wildfire until Sunday morning. And crews did not respond because there are no inhabitants on the island. The island in Wester Ross, known to many as aposAnthrax Islandapos, was contaminated during World War  after it became a testing site for biological weapons. Sheep were exposed to deadly bombs packed with anthrax on the island, which killed the livestock within days.  When inhaled, anthrax spores can damage the lungs and is often fatal. Direct contact with anthrax can also cause raised boil-like lesions on the skin. Gruinard was a no-go zone until it was declared safe by the UK Government in  following a major clean-up operation in . The British Army tested anthrax on the Island off the Scottish coast during World War II.  It led to spores of the infectious disease still being considered deadly decades later. Anthrax symptoms include fever, chills, and extreme fatigue, but the bodyaposs own defences can trigger deadly sepsis. The test was one of several Cold War incidents where animals were cruelly exposed to potentially genocidal weapons.

For many the crisis isnapost just about paying a few extra quid on council tax or energy costs, it will be wearing an extra jumper to avoid putting the heating on, on cutting back on your weekly shop.Joanne Lao, from Newport, has even made the decision to stop buying her nine-year-oldaposs son favourite cherry bakewells after they doubled in price, WalesOnline reports.She said: The ones we usually have from Asda are like p - we went in this week and they were £. for the same box.  Weaposve had to stop buying them now - itaposs just too much money. In recent months UK residents have seen rising costs from National Insurance, council tax, fuel prices and supermarket, with gas and electricity bills expected to increase in the coming month.And despite announcing a host of measures to tackle the cost of living on Wednesday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak hasnapost inspired many that he will be able to fix the problem.The people of Duffryn in Newport are ones who will be penny pinching even more now after previously admitting they would need to borrow money just to afford their heating bills. Single mum Joanne, , is one of many with a university degree, a reasonably well paid job and her own home who are nevertheless worried about creeping costs. She said I own my home but they own the heating, so I canapost flex to a dferent provider. Weaposre on a fixed rate, we canapost move to a better rate. I think in todayaposs climate there probably isnapost a better one anyway.  My electric has gone up probably about £ a month, incrementally. Iaposve noticed every couple of months I get a new letter saying my direct debit has increased. Food costs as well - my average food has gone from about £ a week to about £, and thereaposs only three of us in the house. Because Iaposm a single parent that works, Iaposm over the threshold for any help so Iaposve still got to pay for my childrenaposs school meals and things like that. But obviously Iaposm still on one wage and Iaposve got to pay my mortgage and everything. I feel Iaposm in a bit of a bad place with that. I think Iaposm kind of in the worst position. Sometimes I think Iaposd probably be better off not working at all, because Iaposd probably get help. Itaposs dficult. I am worried about it. Iaposve got nobody  to rely on for income - itaposs literally all on me. It makes me extra stressed in work, becauseanything happens to my job, thereaposs no backup. I have a good job, work full time, I went to university and got a masters. But it feels like itaposs still not enough. If Iaposm on a fair wage, over £-, a year, and Iaposm struggling to look after two children, I dread to think how people with a lower income can do that.  Iaposm not sure what can be done. Some sort of cap, maybe. It feels like itaposs spiralling out of control, everything. How supermarkets can get away with increasing everything so signicantly, is unbelievable really. Keith Bennett lives in Sandpiper Way in Duffryn with his partner. The -year-old says his costs have spiralled in recent months and are set to go up even more in April. I was paying £ a week for electric - thataposs gone up to £, he said. It was £ a year and theyaposve estimated it will be £, in April. My gas has gone up from £ to £. Then youaposve water on top of that.  My benefits wonapost cover it. Iaposve just got to try and work it out. My houses arenapost warm anyway, they lose the heat very quickly. They were built in . My thermometer is about  degrees in the winter - itaposs like a freeze box. Thereaposs the council tax rebate but youaposve got to go online and fill in [answer] questions. One of my friends stated he was on one benefit, and he couldnapost get it. Itaposs frightening - I canapost afford to eat sometimes. My children put £ onto my heating and say aposthere you go, have a bit more heatapos. Or theyaposll come around and cook me dinner and say things like aposweaposll get the meat dad, you just get the vegetablesapos. Thataposs what itaposs like. My family helps me a lot. My daughter is a nurse and sheaposs struggling. Her husband is too, and theyaposve got their own house and do as much overtime as they can. Keith said this weekaposs announcement by the chancellor would make little dference to older people and those struggling with their energy bills. He said: Itaposs not going to make no dference for the pensioners. Sure you can put the threshold up, but the income tax changes arenapost until . It might help the richer but on the lower end of the scale it wonapost help. Nan Cath Williams, , works in Asda but only does  hours per week due to health issues, meaning she has been struggling with finances recently.  I canapost work many hours because of my health. It is a struggle, she said. Itaposs been ongoing for a while. The heating is terrible - I put the heating on at  oaposclock in the morning for three or four hours. Thataposs all I can afford. Before I used to put it on in the morning for two or three hoursit was cold, and then in the evening. The electric has doubled. The heating, we had new systems one or two years ago. That made it soar. Before that, it was in with the rent. Itaposs all separate now. Shoppingaposs got to suffer. The prices in Asda have gone up, and itaposs not by  or p, you know - itaposs  or p. I buy unbranded things just to keep going. Iaposve got two boys, theyaposre grown up but they eat like horses. I havenapost got savings, I canapost save. Everything goes on the house. If you want to do DIY, youaposve got to save for a month just to get a tin of paint. Itaposs not always been like that. I am coping, but itaposs a struggle.  We need more help. We had the winter payment for the payment, but we put that in and itaposs gone already. Poll [council] tax, water, rent - itaposs all going up. I am on universal credit, butI do any overtime they just take it off me. So I either work all the hours and get none, or the other way around. Theyaposre supposed to be giving us money for council tax, but then theyaposre putting it up. The amount theyaposre giving us isnapost enough to go through the year. I am worried. Iaposve got a smart meter, and itaposs in my face all the time. I feel like hiding it. If I put on the kettle, I only put one cup of water in. I wonapost be able to retire until Iaposm . While ex-railway worker Dave Clark is also another pensioner worried about the increasing cost of living. The -year-old said: Iaposve just paid £ for three monthsapos electric, for the same amount that cost me £ before. Theyaposre saying itaposs going up again in a weekaposs time to about £ a year. Does it worry me  It does and it doesnapost -you havenapost got it you canapost pay them. When you get older, itaposs not nice to go into the debt. They could help with the VAT or something, I think. Iaposm on my own and Iaposve noticed costs going up, and thataposs not by a penny or two like it always does. A packet of frozen chips is going up by  or p. Itaposs terrible.

Eligibility criteria apply.aposWe had loads of jobs but not enough people to fill themapos  Screenprinting business Paul Bristow Associates is just one of the employers who’ve worked with Jobcentre Plus to fill vacancies. The family-run firm, based in Wrexham, produces textiles including T-shirts and printed bags – and they’ve been keen to attract younger people to roles. “One of the issues we have is the perception of manufacturing as being something we used to do in the Victorian age but no longer,” says director Ben Bristow. “Of course that’s not the case – but it made it hard to attract young people. Working with Jobcentre Plus gave us the ability to get more young people into the business and provide them with a good grounding in print and textiles.  “Our staff collaborated really well with the team at Jobcentre Plus, who gave excellent support and deserve high praise indeed.” HR manager Lee Dixon, , agrees: “The people who work there have done a fantastic job. It’s not been easy through Covid and the fact they’ve managed to help people into work is great. “It’s also massively helpful to us as an employer, given there are loads of jobs but not enough people to fill them. Through working with the team at Jobcentre Plus we’ve built up a great rapport. They’ve been first-class. “Our recruits have been a massive help in bringing in valuable skills to our business,” says Lee. “We’ve had them working in packing, admin, sewing and sales. Another guy has got a position in sustainability after he joined us from university. We’ve also had people with additional learning needs and disabilities.”aposMy team made me feel very welcome and supported meapos  “When I left college in January  I didn’t finish my A levels because I wanted a change, but then obviously the pandemic happened. I didn’t particularly know what I wanted to do, but I knew I would be good in a computer-based job because it’s something that I’ve gravitated towards. “Then I saw JD Sports was advertising opportunities and I thought I’d go for it because it was an administration role in a big company. It was actually the first that I applied for and everything went through really quickly – and I got the job. “My team at JD were great from day one. They made me feel very welcome and supported me. Day to day I’d look after anything from HR queries and issuing contracts to payroll and pension questions. It gave me pretty much a whole picture of what it’s like to work in HR and I’ve been doing it ever since. “I’d always had an interest in HR, but after working for six months I realised it was what I wanted to do. “There was the option to stay on and I’m now doing an apprenticeship with JD and CIPD Level  in HR support. It was another perfect step for me and I’ve now been there for a year and I’m really enjoying it. Starting work was quite tough, but I’ve got so much support from my team. It’s a lot more friendly than I expected it to be.“Now I’m learning about dferent parts of HR, building on what I was doing before. I was struggling to find any job with noexperience, but now I’ll just keep going.” Peter Cowgill, executive chairman of JD Sports, on how the company has forged links with Jobcentre Plus. “We are proud to have worked with Jobcentre Plus to provide much-needed employment and learning and development opportunities at a time when competition for job positions has been at an all-time high. Social inequality has only been exacerbated during the pandemic, so it has never been more vital to give young people a chance to succeed. “Our relationship with the DWP now covers all three nations across the UK and gives our stores, head office and distribution centres access to new talent pipelines and initiatives, which not only facilitates our future recruitment needs, but also allows us to support candidates facing social barriers, an area we are hugely passionate about.” “When I was developing my start-up in the renewable energy sector, working with Jobcentre Plus allowed me to recruit new graduates. “We’re part of the Edinburgh Business School incubator, where we get office space, mentoring and support. Since the graduates joined, we’ve moved to the stage of building a prototype.“If it wasn’t for the scheme, recruitment would have been years away –and having a few more minds to work on the concept has given us a competitive edge.“The candidates knew when they joined that they wouldn’t just be working on their own tasks and would be learning something every single day. If you’re looking for experience, it’s a great way to get it.” aposIt’s important to personalise our serviceapos  “Our service helps employers and our customers meet each other face to face, which is crucial. Employer advisers speak to both employers and the Work Coaches, who’ll send customers over who are ready for work. “We can also help employers st through CVs and hold training events to get people work-ready and match them up with the role they’ve got available. “I’ve been working closely with Lee at Paul Bristow Associates, who came along to events at the jobcentre where groups of young people could come and speak to him about what roles they had available. “A lot of employers weren’t aware of all the great services we offer, but the feedback we’ve been getting has all been really positive.

They say Rishi Sunakaposs Spring Statement, with its p cut on fuel duty and National Insurance threshold increase, does not go far enough and the reality on the ground is stark.For people living in Oldham, Greater Manchester, where the number claiming Universal Credit has almost doubled in two years, day-to-day le is a struggle, reports the MEN. A trip to the town centre found a carer regularly surviving on one jacket potato a day, a pensioner whose food shop have soared from £ to £ and a mum who feels like a failure as she struggles to pay for school trips.Brits now face the biggest fall in income on record as inflation looks set to hit as much as %. In Oldham, a town with the second worst level of child poverty in the country, Julie Nuttall sits down clutching a polystyrene box. “This is our daily food,” she says, pointing down at her jacket potato. We might have a sandwich later, but this is our main meal.”It’s a hot March morning and the smell of baked potatoes fills the air. For Julie and her nephew Shaun, this food truck is a leline. It means they can afford to eat a proper meal today.“We’ve been walking aroundOldhamtrying to get the cheapest food we can,” the -year-old says. “We’re having child portions.”Like thousands of other families across Greater Manchester, Julie is facing the greatest uphill battle as the cost of living crisis cripples the country. A full-time carer for her disabled nephew, it’s a worry that keeps her up at night.“We do a lot of camping, we use an outside BBQ,” Julie, who lives in Hollins, said . “We’re going to have to make food on the BBQ just to cut back.“We’ve been given our bill for the next  months which has trebled in size. Weaposve switched the heating off now sowe get cold, we layer up. I know we have to pay and move on. But we have to cut back on usage and cut showers down. We have a disabled shower room which is going to make it dficult.  Weaposve had to cut back and prices are going back so we have to compensate somehow. Do you eat or heat  Thataposs the scenario. This time last year we were free. We could go into the community and come round here and not have to worry about what we had to eat. You go to bed and worry about what it will be like tomorrow. Barbara Szwandt stands outside a cafe with her daughter Janet. When asked about the cost of living crisis, a concerned look falls across her face.  The -year-old receives a pension but the money goes on rent and bills. Her financial situation once became so bleak, she was forced to beg people for warm clothes. Iaposve been struggling to get a coat and clothes,” she says. “Iaposve been going round askingpeople have clothes to spare. I donapost like begging and sometimes itaposs hard to do that. I had to get a coat instead of shopping. I have to ask my daughtershe has any shoes to spare.Barbara, who lives in Oldham, says she can only afford basic food including bread, milk and potatoes. Her total food shop used to come to around £. Now, she claims it costs around £. Itaposs hard when you get £ a fortnight on pension, then you have to pay rent,” she continues. It doesnapost go nowhere. Thereaposs nowhere for anyone to speak to anyone and see what help is available. Iaposve lost contact with younger age groups I have to rely on my daughter to do things for me. I canapost do a proper shop. “What I used to get cost me about £, now itaposs costing £. Itaposs basically just bread, milk and potatoes.”  Mum-of-four Janet Szwandt gently rocks her three-year-old in his pram. The -year-old cares for four children, including her autistic son TG. Money is so tight at the moment she can’t afford to pay for school trips – something that makes her feel like a “bad mum”. Itaposs horrible you feel like an emotional train wreck,” she says. “You get up and you donapost knowyouaposre going to have enough to survive the next week. Weaposve had to cut back on every day stuff like going to play centres. You canapost do anything because everything has gone up.  “Weaposve had to cut back on the monthly shop because we canapost afford to do it and it costs us a fortune. You have to budget what you need to spend to survive. Itaposs gone from £ a month to £. My daughter wants to go on school trips and I canapost afford to pay it. We canapost get the bus, we have to walk. Itaposs so silly we have to live like this. Itaposs even affecting the kids because they canapost understand why they canapost have essential things. They canapost have them because itaposs so dear. They canapost have pocket money. It just makes you feel bad as a mum because you canapost afford to give them what they want. You canapost make them happy. With UK inflation soaring to .% - its fastest rise in  years - millions of households will be worrying about their own finances. The  cost of living crisis is hitting energy prices, fuel and the cost of food, with the governmentaposs only solution so far to offer all households a £ loan to help pay off their energy bills - which must be paid back eventually. Chancellor Rishi Sunakaposs Spring Statement saw him announce a cut in fuel duty, although this will cost the Treasury billions without putting cash back in familiesapos pockets.

Janet has also been forced to rely on food banks recently. I used food banks now and again and came off it because I was able to survive on monthly shops,” she added. “But Iaposve noticed the money I had left over, we donapost have anymore. We have nothing to fall back on anymore. Having a child with disability needs is so hard. Sometimes we put the heating on in one room and all sit in there. Even pensioners are struggling because I see how much my mum struggles as much as me. My son has never been out to a play centre and he’s autistic- I just can’t afford to do it. Terrance Ball, from Chadderton, claims Universal Credit due to being disabled. After paying his bills, he says he’s “lucky”he has £ leftover.Itaposs hard, itaposs very hard,” the -year-old says. “Iaposm having to rob Peter to pay Paul. Iaposm having to borrow money off friends. “Iaposm struggling Iaposm in financial dficulty I cannot afford and Iaposm a vulnerable adult. Iaposm having to cut back like on the essentials. Iaposm diabetic and insulin dependent. I canapost afford the food I need. I have to borrow off my friend. Itaposs really hard. Sometimes me and my we sit on the settee and we both cry.” Oldham currently has the highest proportion of the -plus population on Universal Credit in Greater Manchester, according to new figures. There are currently , people claiming the benefit in Oldham Town North, or %. Across Greater Manchester, , people were on Universal Credit in February – .% of people aged  and over across the area. The number has increased from , in February . The government donapost give a damn about us. Itaposs not fair. Iaposm not happy Iaposm content. But I would rather be happy, Terrance continued. We feel like weaposre just existing. We canapost go on a night out we canapost afford a holiday - not even for a few days. Weaposre having to look after ourselves and we have a little girl we need to look after. It feels like weaposre living in the s. I have PTSD and a lot of underlying illnesses I have to eat and I have to get my medication and itaposs hard to get them. After Iaposve paid my bills, Iaposm luckyIaposve got £ left over.  Michael Brown, also from Oldham, says he is “just about” coping with the dramatic price increases – although it is something that causes him stress. He said he’s noticed a rise in his fortnightly shop. My electric has gone up £ a month and my central heating works out at £,” he says. Iaposm just about coping with it. I call myself a stress head anyway, so I do worry about it. Itaposs going to get worse and worse. I used to spend £ on a fortnight worth of shopping in Iceland. “The last few times itaposs been £ for the exact same stuff. Itaposs p here and p there but it all adds up.  Mark Webster takes a break on a bench while the sun beats down on Oldham town centre. While he says his family is stable financially, he has found himself having to work overtime to keep it that way. “Itaposs a worry for me. A couple of weeks ago I got an email from my energy supplier. My bills are increasing by £, altogether, additional to what Iaposm paying. Itaposs incredulous,” the -year-old says. I knew it was coming, but I didnapost think it would be that large. I donapost think I can challenge it. Iaposm working overtime to pay for things. Luckily my we works as well, weaposre not as bad off as other people are. The only thing I can hope is that Labour get in next time. Weaposre frugal anyway, but I think what I am doing is working more to pay for things and having to work extra days to afford it. Iaposve got three children and one is going to university this year so we have that extra cost coming up. I worry about the cost of things over the next couple of years. I worry about how dficult itaposs going to be for them buying houses and I donapost know how theyaposre going to save up for a deposit. Thataposs why I encourage them to go to university and get a decent job.

Syndicate PALS Marion Wood, , and Michael Williams, , from Northampton, were left speechless after matching five main numbers and a bonus ball on the National Lottery earlier this month.As NHS worker Marion read out the pairs numbers, Michael was in the kitchen checking the digits and even gave out a squeak when he realised how many theyaposd matched.Marion works at Northampton General Hospital and Michael is a retired construction worker - both will take home £, each.  Speaking about the le-changing draw, which left both in stunned silence and needing a cup of tea, Marion said: “I was on annual leave, it was the Tuesday after the Saturday draw which we won on. Michael and I always check our tickets for the last draw just before the next one. He was on his computer in the kitchen, I was in the lounge. “I started to shout out the numbers on my ticket and he shouted yes, then yes, then another yes and then his voice changed - in fact he squeaked! There was another yes and the final yes was followed by a ‘Can you come here please ’”  When Marion wandered into the kitchen and looked at the numbers on Michaelaposs screen she originally thought the amount theyaposd won was £,. She added: “I looked, looked again, Michael was going through the numbers one by one, and he kept on saying it’s a million, it’s a milli - and I said ‘I don’t know what a million in numbers looks like !’ Due to it being late on a Tuesday evening the pair had to excitedly wait until the following day to ring The National Lottery and make their claim.  “I’m a big tea drinker, so we had a cup of tea and sat in stunned silence as we absorbed what had just happened, Marion said. I didn’t tell a soul at first, I just carried on as normal holding onto the lucky ticket wherever I went. I kept the ticket in my diary, which I keep in my purse, until the lady from Camelot visited to check it and confirmed that Michael and I actually were big winners. “Even now it still hasn’t completely sunk in, but seeing our names on the big cheque has definitely made it feel more real.” Asked how they will celebrate she said, “I’m still unsure about what sort of celebration we’ll have but I am getting a taste for champagne having sipped a bit since the win. “Working through Covid in the NHS has been tough. The amount of work has increased and, unfortunately, I have lost many family and friends. However, work has kept me going, I love my job and I won’t be leaving even after this amazing win.”  When quizzed on what the pair will spend their winnings on Marion admitted she wants to carry on as normal for a bit, adding: I’m from an army family and routine is important to me so I think I’ll just let my head get around it first. I might treat myself to some jewellery, it will be nice to have something special to remember how I felt when I won.” While Michael, a father of three who retired last year, revealed heaposs going to spend his money on a his first car since  and some rugby memorabilia. He added: Finally, I’ll also treat my family, they’ve been good to me and it will be lovely to do something nice for them.” Marion, originally from Caerphilly, Wales, bought the winning ticket on Saturday, March  from her local Morrisons using number of friends and family memberaposs birthdays.

The state of the room, she claimed, was so bad she didnapost feel she could even take her shoes off during the stay. She said: The carpet was full of this white chunky powder stuff and all over the cabinets and when I touched it with my hairbrush it crumbled offIt was wipeable so obviously it hadnapost been cleaned. There was hot chocolate all over the stairwell down the wall in the hallway. That was there when we got there and still there when I was checking out so that proved it wasnapost cleaned.

The pair then checked out first thing on Boxing Day to head back on the pm coach to Birmingham. Katie said: I came back with bed bug bites, who gets bites in December  There were six in a little cluster on my left hip, where your bottom of your back starts. I can assure you I didnapost go with them. They appeared on the coach on the way back. She continued: I just wanted to try going away without the kids for the first time, my youngest is  now. I thought, aposno cooking, no stressapos. Wow it was the worst mistake of my le. Itaposs traumatised me I donapost think Iaposll go away again. I know you get those fussy guests but this was bad. It just ruined the whole Christmas. It was just horrendous. The way theyaposve tried to resolve the matter was even worse.

And today will be extra special for Kate as it is Motheraposs Day and no doubt her little ones have some lovely surprises for her when she arrives home. Itaposs also a day when Kate will honour her mum Carole Middleton, and the whole family will also remember Prince Williamaposs late mother Princess Diana. Even though she did not get to meet her grandchildren, William has spoken in the past of how he talks to his children about their granny.And last Motheraposs Day, the youngsters all created cards for Diana - with Princess Charlotteaposs containing a particularly poignant message. Her message was on a fuchsia coloured card with a hand-drawn multi-coloured heart. And in it, she made sure to mention how much her dad William misses his mum. Charlotte wrote: Dear Granny Diana, I am thinking of you on motheraposs day. I love you very much. Papa is missing you. Lots of love Charlotte xxxxxxxxx.

Meanwhile, older brother George used joined-up writing on bright green card to say: Dear granny Diana, Happy happy Motheraposs Day. I love you very much and think of you always, sending lots of love from George xxxxx.And Louis, who was just two at the time, also used green card for his Motheraposs Day card which featured a colourful heart surrounded by several animals - all of which had been stuck on to the card.The cards were posted on the official Twitter account for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge where four images were uploaded, with a heartfelt message. It revealed: Each year on Mother’s Day, George, Charlotte and Louis make cards remembering their Granny, Diana, for William. Whatever your circumstances, we are thinking of you this Mother’s Day. In the  documentary Diana, Our Mother: Her Le and Legacy, William spoke openly saying he is committed to making sure his children know all about their late grandmother. He said wants his kids to “know who she was and that she existed” and told how he “constantly” talks to his children “about Granny Diana” at bedtime so that they know “there are two grandmothers in their lives”. The future king said: “We’ve got more photos up around the house now of her and we talk about her a bit.” He added: “It’s hard because obviously Catherine didn’t know her so she cannot really provide that level of detail, so I regularly put George and Charlotte to bed, talk about her and just try to remind them that there are two grandmothers, there were two grandmothers in their lives. “So it’s important that they know who she was and that she existed.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Mothers DayKate Middleton, Duchess of CambridgePrincess CharlottePrincess DianaPrince WilliamRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Although the vast majority of schools in England already pass this threshold, around % are open for fewer than  hours per week. Ministers say they want to abolish discrepancies in school opening hours, which are currently decided by headteachers, by . The Government said the change, which starts next September, will ensure children have access to a range of subjects and catch-up support.The new .-hour week is equivalent to an .am to .pm day from Monday to Friday.

Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter He told Sky News: “The average school day is -and-a-half hours. Some schools, thousands of schools are  minutes lower than that – so we want schools to be, sort of, am to .pm. “I’d like them all to do it by the end of this year, but I know some will have logistical problems. Which is why we’ve said by next year.” The minister told the BBC the Government would set out its plans for schools in England in the coming week, with a focus on strong multi-academy trusts.He added The evidence is clear that a family of schools that is really tightly managed, really well supported - especially through Covid - has delivered better educational outcomes for children. So strong - and I underline strong - multi-academy trusts is the infrastructure we need to complete and deliver. However, unions claim the change to school hours will make little impact on students and could even have a negative effect. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: We are unconvinced by the benefits of introducing a minimum expectation on theof the school week of . hours.Adding time on to the school week may sound straightforward, but there are many issues which need to be considered in inidual schools, and we would encourage the government not to rush any changes. Paul Whiteman, of the headteachersapos union the NAHT, said: We hope that during the year before these proposals are implemented, there can be a review of the evidence supporting this plan. Simply adding five or  minutes to a day is unlikely to bring much,any, benefit. The government says it will be guided by evidence - they need to meet that undertaking.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON EducationSchools\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Lexie Forsyth from Inverness is like any other toddler and loves to play with her friends, but seven months ago she began developing a mystery illness. The condition has caused her brain to swell, which has left her unable to talk, walk, or to feed herself, the Daily Record Daily Record reports.Her parents Emilia Blanaru and Mark Forsyth, who have separated, have even described the devastating illness as rendering their daughter a new born baby again.Nonetheless, tough Lexie has fought back against the condition, following months of therapy and a staggering  days in hospital. She has astounded medics and is now able to make the -minute walk to nursery – ­something her parents feared might never happen. Doctors are unable to say whether she will make a full recovery and she still uses a wheelchair for long distances. But Emilia said: “Like a baby, she had to learn everything from the beginning again. We had to lt her up, she couldn’t walk, or sit, or feed herself.We had to put her in nappies again. “But she never gave up. We just take it little by little each day.” Lexie, who lives with her mum and brother Daniel, two, in Inverness, has been crowned Brave Child of the Year at a Highland Heroes awards ceremony. Her proud gran, Alison Canavan, nominated her after watching Lexie fight every obstacle with her infectious smile.  Emilia said: “She is a happy girl and she is always smiling.” The family’s ordeal began when Lexie fell ill last summer, and started vomiting and having seizures. Doctors initially put her ­symptoms down to a viral infection but her ­condition worsened and she fell into a coma for seven days. After two months, they confirmed Lexie had been hit by a rare ­inflammation of the brain called acute disseminated encephalomyelitis .

But it wasnapost the only colourful outfit the -year-old wore during the week, with her wardrobe including lots of bright, bold hues - including yellow, blue, green and orange.Following the tour, a stylist has claimed that Kateaposs colourful outfits might have been a nod to the Queenaposs own wardrobe ethos and praised her for the touching tribute.  Speaking to Femail, Hannah Eichler said: Whether itaposs orange for optimism, blue for confidence, red for love or yellow for warmth, Kate has followed the Queenaposs cue by using colour to invoke powerful feelings of energy amongst herself and her subjects - a key tool when visiting new countries and engaging with those around her. Bright colours have long been favoured by the Royal family but no one has championed the look more so than the Queen herself.As a lover of colour herself, the Duchess has paid homage to the Queen during her tour this week, and while these colourful looks will no doubt get the royal nod of approval, they also make a statement about Kateaposs emotions, too.The Queen is known for having a wardrobe boasting all the colours of the rainbow and is thought to dress to invoke powerful feelings and energy. However, there is one big dference between the way the monarch and the Duchess of Cambridge dress in bright colours. Her Majesty will often pair a matching colourful accessory with her outfits - this is most commonly a hat.  She is also known to have an umbrella to match all of her colourful coats for wet weather, should she need one.But Hannah thinks that by forgoing colourful hats, Kate seems more modern and relaxed - do you agree  Let us know in the comments below.Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm.

Rachael Hearns, a PhD student at Manchester politan University, says she was made to feel really uncomfortable after the member of staff made comments about her body.The -year-old has alleged the person pestered her about her mask before reenacting a Nazi-style march and making remarks about her body type while she worked at the uni in October last year, she told the Manchester Evening News.After immediately reporting the incident to the universityaposs HR department she was told they would be in touch, with policy stating a manger will arrange a formal meeting without reasonable delay.  However, the student was forced to send a follow up email and wasnapost given an official meeting until more than a month later on November , where she was allegedly told there was no CCTV of the incident and it was unlikely she could proceed with a complaint. She said: He introduced himself and I assumed he was probably staff but that wasnapost confirmed until I googled him afterwards. I was getting a general sense of what he needed. During that conversation he physically stopped me and askedI would take off my mask which I didnapost want to and am not allowed to. I politely said no I would rather not. At the time it was university policy...I also donapost have a problem with it. I told him that and it went into this whole conversation about whether I had considered standing up to that or arguing that and I said no because it hadn’t really bothered me.  He said he could tell I was athletic and he could tell that I was a runner. When he first said it I thought it might have been linked to the condition he was coming to talk about. But when I said no I used to be a swimmer he said aposoh yeah I can tell.apos Itaposs not the worst but it was just uncomfortable. As the conversation came to a close he went back to the whole covid conversation and continued to press that. I made it very clear that I wasnapost interested in continuing the conversation.  Then he did this Nazi-style march. He looked down, hunched his shoulders and did a little marching movement. Rachael, who moved from the US to Manchester in  and was working at the uni part-time, claims during the meeting she was told that due to university policy all other CCTV in the area had been wiped. She added: They told me I should prepare for the likely event I wouldnapost be able to move forward with my complaint because there wasnapost sufficient evidence to identy the inidual.  The HR adviser didnapost respond to my email. Instead, in a final meeting he expressed learning about a -day CCTV policy they were unaware of. I was told the CCTV gets wiped after  days. That is very publicly available on the university website and something everyone  seemed to know about. I would expect HR to know about this. By this point it was well over the  day time limit. He expressed his sympathies and regret for not knowing about this policy but he didnapost really show any emotion. He didnapost seem bothered. He told me that the department would use my case as a learning opportunity and that an inquiry into the state of the CCTV camera in the [clinic] would take place. The -year-old was told by the universityaposs HR advisor the member of staff the complaint was levelled against wouldnapost be made aware, which she described as pretty sh***y. Nobody even asked himhe was in [the uni] that day, she said.  I donapost knowthere is an established written record of this because an accusation was never formally brought forward. If it happens again and god forbid it’s worse I have no confidence it’s going to go any other way. That was my primary concern: it’s not about getting anyone in trouble or fired. I do think Iaposve exhausted everything. My bosses are all in complete support so I feel support internally. They are angry and frustrated as well. Policies and procedures are not being followed and I’m glad the only thing that happened was an annoyance for the day. Would this have been taken more seriouslythis was a more serious offence  Why can’t I get some security  I hate the fact heaposs going to get away with it, but I also hate the fact that I donapost feel safe. A Manchester politan University spokesman said: We are sorry that Miss Hearn feels that the investigation process has not been handled correctly. We continue to speak with Miss Hearn about her concerns and we will ensure that she can feel safe and supported when at the University.

Devastated Lucy Hesford-Buckingham lost husband Simon, , on February . Simon had been diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis four years ago and was admitted to intensive care just three weeks after their special day with multiple organ failure.Lucy described Simon as the most giving and caring person Iaposve ever met, WalesOnline reports. The couple met when Lucy was  and Simon . They had remained together ever since. Simonaposs condition deteriorated after a change in medication last year and he spent time in and out of hospital in the last months of his le. The pair were due to marry in December  but postponed the wedding due to Simonaposs illness. I think we always knew it would have an impact on his le, but we didnapost know it would take his le, said Lucy.  Simonaposs liver stopped working due to his condition which in turn had an impact on the rest of his organs. Lucy said that at first it appeared as though his condition was improving. She said: In the coma they brought him off everything to try and wake him up naturally. And he did start to wake up. I was sitting there and he wasnapost able to talk because he had a pipe in his mouth but he was able to shake his head and, you know, we were having quite coherent conversations. But then it all just deteriorated within the space of two days. I have to say they were amazing. All the nurses and the consultants were absolutely amazing to him I canapost fault them. They all came to the funeral as well which was lovely.Until October Simon was coping with his condition well. He was absolutely fine, Lucy said. He was perfect. We were going to the gym all the time. He was the fit one out of the two of us. But then they tried dferent medication - added some more in to seeit would give a good influence - and it all went downhill. The pair, who lived in Crynant, Dulais Valley, married on January  in Craig-y-Nos Castle in what Lucy described as the perfect day. She said that although Simon was ill on the day, it was important for him that they married. It was so nice, it was amazing, said Lucy. Simon was ill on the day and he was kind of resting and to be fair his best man was looking after him all day. But he was there for all the most important bits, he was there for the majority of the time. He was so chuffed that we did it. And I think he would have tried to get well for the first time to have it because he was just so adamant that we were going to get married.  I think part of you will always think aposthey mustaposve known they were going to pass awayapos, so part of me thinks he knew and thataposs why he wanted to get married but you never know do you. She said: When everyone puts their relationship on social media they try to portray it as perfect, but I never felt like I needed to do that because I knew what we had was perfect. So many people came up to me and said that we were more than a couple, we were perfect for each other. Simon was the most giving person you would ever meet. He was so caring. Everyone gravitated towards him because he was so calm. He was a therapist and he had this craft where he could sit there with you, rearrange your thoughts, and get you a better view on le in minutes. It was immaculate the way he would do it.  Lucy said the pair were inseparable and had only spent the evening before the wedding apart in the last six months of his le. She said: I donapost know what Iaposm doing. Itaposs been a month and still day to day I couldnapost tell you what Iaposve done. I think I am going through trauma just as much now as I was then. The way my brain is coping with it is to zone out. Obviously because I was in hospital with him the flashbacks I am having are horric. As soon as it happens I feel like I zone out for what feels like ages.  If someone had said to me when I was put on this world, aposdo you want nine years of perfection with a soul mate or  years of a mundane relationship with someone who fits the billapos I would have picked Simon every time. Right now Iaposm trying to focus on the positive part of it but I know that is going to come crashing down. There is a degree of numbness at the moment. Lucy said they used to enjoy creating YouTube videos and content together and that it is doing nothing together that she will miss the most. We just loved being together. I could go through all the memories of all the things were did together, but the things I think of is just sitting in the house watching TV. I donapost feel like heaposs gone. I know his body is not here but I still feel him around me all the time. Lucy has now started a charity in memory of Simon who had recently completed a degree that would allow him to be a counsellor. She said that Simon was passionate about providing young people who are autistic and neuroergent with accessible therapy, something he struggled to find. Simon worked alongside the Kimel foundation and had undertaken a course with them and they were later going to take him on as a counsellor. Lucy said: Simon just wanted to help people. He said aposwhen I graduate I donapost want to work for money, I feel like Iaposve taken money for something I could do for freeapos. He just wanted to help and would give anything to help someone.Lucy and Simonaposs family would gratefully receive donations in his memory to the Kimel Foundation who will be part of the charity in memory of Simon.

In recent years weaposve seen dferent cake trends emerge, including wheels of cheese being stacked on top of one another and doughnut walls.For one woman, her dream cake combined cake and doughnuts and she thought sheaposd purchased just this after splashing over to have it made. However, what arrived on the day wasnapost exactly what sheaposd been hoping for. Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here.Instead of three tiers of doughnuts, topped with a big cake, the bride was given a plate of doughnuts with a small cake in the middle.This cake fail was shared by a TikTok user named @just.a.sara who also shared that the delivery was an hour and a half late. Fellow TikTok users were horried by the clip, with one person replying: Grocery store doughnuts and a one-layer cake, nailed it.Someone  said: Couldnapost even spring for Krispy Kreme smh. A third wrote: A stack of tortillas surrounded by some bagels would have made me happier. I would have been livid.After the first video went viral, garnering over . million views, Sara later posted a follow-up explaining what happened at her wedding. She told viewers: You know something has to go wrong at every wedding and my wedding had three things. One my dress got botched two weeks before my wedding, two my husbandaposs ring showed up the morning of our wedding and three my cake and this is the story of my cake. Okay so there were several red flags before this but Iaposm gonna skip to the week of the wedding when I have this feeling that something is wrong, so I text her like aposHey Iaposm so excited to have the cake at the wedding on Saturdayapos and she text back saying aposgreatapos. Sara said she then checked whether there was anything  the baker needed from her and she said there wasnapost. However, when everyone arrived for the reception, the cake still hadnapost turned up. Eventually, the woman ran in with the cake - then the three-tier stand it was meant to be on broke. Luckily, the venue had a platter and my maid of honour and sister went out and set up this little cake thing which is like all we had. It was a mess, she shared. Sara recalls how she made eye contact with the baker and realised in the moment she had to aposlet it goapos to not let it ruin the day, but she was disappointed theyaposd spent so much money for what they received. Thankfully, they managed to get a full refund after the wedding, so allaposs well that ends well.Do you have a story to share  We want to hearall about it.

However, despite measuring the handle herself, Gemma didnapost give the listing details a thorough read. When it arrived, it was massive. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Having apparently not learned her lesson, Gemma then went on order a replacement doormat, once again failing to read the small print. The product that arrived was just the bristle centre, which is said to be scarcely large enough to fit beath her -year-old partner Antaposs feet.And last week Gemma ordered what she believed to be a large white fluffy rug for her -year-old daughter. However, she was once again left chuckling away after unwrapping the flannel-sized order.Gemma said: All my friends and family think Iaposm an idiot for doing it so many times. The thing is, I measured the door handle exactly before going online so I thought I was buying the perfect replacement. When it arrived it was massive but I was determined to use it. My partner put it on for me and put it on wonky so the cupboard was super irritating. Next we ordered a doormat, not realising that the part we ordered was just the central bit, not it as a whole. It was very problematic for my partner as he has massive feet and I made him wipe them on the tiny matt whenever he came in. She continued: Then it all happened once again when my daughter wanted to buy a rug with her Christmas money and sent me over the Amazon link.Turns out neither of us read the listing properly and thought the one we were buying was what was photographed. We were a bit worried when a very small parcel arrived, and when we opened it, it was like a flannel. However, despite all her purchases arriving in all the wrong sizes, Gemma decided to make use of them anyway, and she says they still managed to do the trick. Gemma said: Iaposve kept them all eventhey are all on the small side. Iaposve learned to love them all as they have character. I’ve paid for it so Iaposm using it, evenI suffer.She has since shared pics of three order clangers to Facebook, in a humorous post that has clocked up  likes and counting.In the caption, Gemma wrote: I have a terrible habit of ordering things online without checking their size. Well, my offspring just ordered herself a rug and looks like she has the same affliction. Gemmaaposs followers have been left in stitches at her all-too-relatable mix-ups, with one person admitting, I do stuff like this all the time. I canapost measure to save my le.

The girlfriend was taken by the pretty cat she spotted in a number of the photos and asked what the family had called it. But she didnapost much like the answer. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.Taking to Reddit, the conflicted cat lover wrote: She remarked what a pretty cat it was and asked what her name was. I said it was funny because her name was also Clementine.She immediately got p***ed and asked me what the f**k was wrong with me. I was surprised by this and she started going in on me about how I tricked her into naming our daughter after a dead cat. We argued until she told me to take her home. The whole ride home we didn’t speak. When we got home she went into our room with the baby and hasn’t come out since.The poster - who goes by the username u ihgfgvf - went on to clary that heaposd named his daughter Clementine because he likes the name, not because he deliberately wanted to name her after a long-dead cat.Despite this clarication, many Reddit users feel he should have really given his girlfriend a heads up about the signicance of the name before they decided on Clementine. One person wrote: A lot of people donapost like naming their kids after a dead pet and given how long you had the cat I wouldnapost buy that you simply forgot the connection. You should have told her that you had a cat with the name and then let her decide how she felt about it with all the information. Another said: Instead of being honest about the name and the feelings behind it from the beginning, you purposely hid the fact youaposd had a cat of that name. You wouldnapost have felt it necessary to hide unless you had known it would be an issue, so I would argue itaposs very manipulative to omit that information until after your daughter had already been born and named.Do you have a baby name-related story to share  We pay for stories.

Her millions of followers believe she had paranormal abilities including telepathy and could communicate with aliensBaba VangaByGraeme Murray:,  Mar |commentsA blind mystic who foresaw the Russian war in Ukraine predicted Putin would become aposLord of the Worldapos Baba Vanga apossawapos may natural disasters and warned about conflicts before they happened. She died in the mid s aged , but the Eastern European hinted at what we could expect in the future and became known as aposNostradamus of the Balkansapos.It has now been suggested she predicted Vladimir Putin and Russia will dominate the world. In a meeting with writer Valentin Sidorov, Vanga in , BirminghamLive reported she said: “All will thaw, asice, only one remain untouched - Vladimir’s glory, glory of Russia.Too much it is brought in a victim. Nobody can stop Russia. All will be removed by her from the way and not only will be kept, but also becomes the lord of the world. ” Before her death, Vanga predicted glorious future for Russia once more, the Daily Post reported.According to the clairvoyant, Russia will be the world’s only superpower. She also made a chilling prophecy about the use of nuclear weapons and World War . Blinded after being picked up by a freak tornado as a child, Baba Vanga - born Vangelia Gushterova - believed she had the ability to foresee the future. She reportedly made hundreds of predictions in her -year career. She shot to prominence after accurately predicting the sinking of the Kursk in . Her millions of followers believe she had paranormal abilities including telepathy and being able to communicate with aliens.  Her numerous predictions about world events and the state of humanity have become infamous, including claims she predicted the rise of ISIS and the fall of the Twin Towers.The Irish Mirror also told of her chilling predictions today and how some of them have come true.Specialists have since calculated that  per cent of her prophecies had happened - slightly less than the  per cent claimed by her followers. These are some of her other previous predictions: The Kursk nuclear submarine disaster In  the blind prophetess predicted that in August of , “Kursk will be covered with water and the whole world will weep over it.” Kursk was a Russian sub that Sank in the Barents Sea on August , , killing all aboard.  In  Baba Vanga said: “Horror, horror! The American brethren will fall after being attacked by the steel birds. The wolves will be howling in a bush, and innocent blood will be gushing.” On September , , planes hijacked by Islamic extremists hit the World Trade Center in New York, killing thousands of people. Europe will cease to exist According to Baba Vanga, the continent will cease to exist by , and all that would remain will be empty spaces and wasteland, nearly devoid of any form of le. Clearly not exactly right, but the UK did vote to leave the EU on June , , creating a lot of turmoil. She is reported to have said that chemical weapons would be used by extremists against Europe . Barack Obama will be the last president of the US Baba Vanga had predicted that the th US president would be an African American, but she had also added that he would be the last one. She claimed he would leave office at a time when the country would be in economic ruins, and there would be a huge ide between the northern and southern states – as was the case during the American Civil War.Baba also appeared to predict that the th president of the United States - who we now know to be Donald Trump - would be faced with a crisis which would “bring the country down”.Her chilling prediction states: “Everyone will put their hopes in him to end it, but the opposite will happen he will bring the country down and conflicts between north and south states will escalate.” Some speculate the references to “north and south” could mean North and South Korea. World War III Baba’s predictions have been revisited after another mystic, who apparently foretold Donald Trump’s presidency, claims to know the exact date World War  will start. Self-proclaimed ‘messenger of God’ Horacio Villegas believes nuclear war will break out on the th anniversary of the visitation of Our Lady of Fatima. The clairvoyant claims to have envisioned Trump would win the US election as far back as . He reportedly predicted the billionaire businessman would become the “illuminati king” who will “bring the world into WW ”. The  Boxing Day Tsunami “Cold regions will become warm ... and volcanoes will awaken. “A huge wave will cover a big coast covered with people and towns, and everything will disappear beneath the water. Everything will melt, just like ice.” China rises According to the prophetess, China will become a world power in . She’s probably out a few years here as China is already an economic and military powerhouse. We’ve also apparently got a change in the Earth’s orbit to look forward to some time before . A golden age A new energy source will be created and global hunger will start to be eradicated between  and . A manned spacecraft to Venus will be launched. From  to  the polar ice caps will melt, causing ocean levels to rise. Cloning of organs Baba Vanga’s predicted that body organs will be cloned by , and that would be the easiest method of treatment. Red and green Between  and  a classless, Communist society will thrive hand in hand with newly-restored nature. Mars attacks! A LOT happens from  to , including a Mars colony becoming a nuclear power and demanding independence from the earth, the establishment of an underwater city and the discovery of something “terrible” during the search for alien le. Some time between  and  we’ll crack time travel. Meanwhile, French guerrillas fight the Muslim authorities in France. The “secrets of the moon” will be unveiled.

And the the Tesla Bot - first unveiled by Musk’s company in August  - could be in production as soon as next year he claims.Optimus, described by Musk as as the “most important development”, will start out in le as a worker droid but its possibilities mean one day brain s may be able to be downloaded into it, once the technology is available.Musk, , told BusinessInsider : “Optimus is a general purpose, sort of worker-droid. The initial role must be in work that is repetitive, boring, or dangerous. Basically, work that people donapost want to do. Would you download your personality onto a robot  Have your say in the comment section “Optimus will be helpful with respect to dropping growth rates. Butthese things continue, then what happens  Humanity dies out. Is that what we want  “We could download the things that we believe make ourselves so unique. Now, of course,youaposre not in that body anymore, that is definitely going to be a dference, but as far as preserving our memories, our personality, I think we could do that. “Weaposve already amplied our human brains massively with computers. It could be an interesting ratio to roughly calculate the amount of compute that is digital, ided by the amount of compute that is biological.”  He added he was excited by the technology, but that there was some “trepidation” with the robots. Musk added: “With respect to AI and robotics, of course, I see things with some trepidation. “Because I certainly donapost want to have anything that could potentially be harmful to humanity. But humanoid robots are happening. Look at Boston Dynamics. They do better demonstrations every year. “The rate of advancement of AI is very rapid.”  Standing at about ft in tall and weighing  pounds, the Tesla Bot will be able to pick up essentials from shops as well as help fix cars with a spanner. Speaking last year at its unveiling, Musk said the robot could have a big impact across the world. The tycoon said: “Tesla is arguably the world’s biggest robotics company, our cars are basically semi-sentient robots on wheels. It kind of makes sense to put that technology on a humanoid form. We think weaposll probably have a prototype sometime early next year. Itaposs intended to be friendly, of course, navigate through a world built for humans, and eliminate boring, repetitive, dangerous tasks.

It’s value before the recent slump due to the war and sanctions was around £. million. Luiza, a student, is the daughter of cleaner-turned-multimillionaire Svetlana Krivonogikh, , now part-owner of a major Russian bank, one of the countryaposs wealthiest women with an estimated £ million financial and property fortune. She has not commented on claims that her daughter was fathered by the Kremlin president, and nor has Luiza, also known as Elizaveta, although the teenager told Russian GQ that she “probably” looks “similar” to a young Putin.The suspicion that she was Putin’s secret daughter from an extra-marital affair was first aired by an independent media outlet in Russia which was later blocked by the authorities. The , square feet apartment in the sumptuous gated Fontanka  block is one of St Petersburg’s most sought after addresses in the city’s “Golden Triangle”. It is described as a “club house” with an array of “elite apartments” with construction by German company Engel  Voelkers, with “high-end” designer finishes and furnishings by Roberto Molon in an elegant and light art deco style”. Plumbing and kitchen appliances are from leading German and Italian manufacturers”.  In the prestigious development “everything is thought out to create maximum comfort, convenience and a fabulous atmosphere of beauty, comfort and coziness. “It has its own wellness centre with a swimming pool, and luxury service.” It offers “palace luxury in the spirit of modernity from Italian designers”. Reports say that Oleg Yemelyanov - linked to jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny - analysed hacked Yandex Food records which became publicly available.  These showed an unknown apartment linked to Krivonogikh at Fontanka embankment number , he said. “Wow, Putin’s [ex-]mistress Svetlana Krivonogikh has a flat with total area of nearly  square metres on the River Fontanka embankment,” said Yemelyanov. “Thanks for the tip to Luiza Vladimirovna [Rozova] who has been ordering food to that address.” The propertyaposs value has sunk to £. million in the past month. Luiza has closed her Instagram after she was hit by a wave of extreme trolling over Russia’s war in Ukraine.One comment said: “Are U sitting in the bunker   Like a rat ” Luiza - who had , subscribers - stopped publicly posting six months ago, triggering the suspicion that Putin had gagged her, but her account remained open. Now a message says in Russian: “User not found.”  One post on the -year-old’s Instagram alleged she was the “daughter of a murderer, war criminal, psychopath and drug addict”. Many posts included the Ukrainian blue-and-yellow flag and one carried the message: “The Russian nation must rise against this dictator. You donapost want to have anything to do with him.” But commenters also staunchly defended her, with one saying: “Donapost judge her...is not her fault.” Another wrote: “She cannot do anything for having a crazy father”. One more said: “Come on guys, she is just a person. She is not guilty.”  But a commenter called Martina hit back: “Yes, she is guilty of passive complicity. It is the same as most of the Germans in the Nazi period.” Another posted: “Call him -he loves you ... maybe you can convince him not to kill.” One complained: Stop writing [that] sheaposs an innocent. “She is the daughter of that devil! “She could at least show that she does not agree with what her father is doing, somehow influence him. “Putin doesnapost give a s*** for ordinary people, but maybe his daughters still mean something to him. “She stays quiet because she knowsshe says one bad word to Daddy, she will be cut off from big money, apartments and expensive things.  “Unfortunately, there are important things - and more important things. “Apparently, purses and villas are more important to her than human le.” Putin has two daughters by his ex-we Lyudmila, the former Kremlin first lady. Likewise, neither of them - Dr Maria Vorontsova, , a geneticist, and Katerina Tikhonova, , a high-kicking ‘rock’n’roll’ dancer-turned-mathematician, have commented on the war. There are reports that Putin has hidden some family members in a chalet in neutral Switzerland - while another version is that they are in a five-star hi-tech nuclear bunker in Siberia. There is speculation he has up to four children with Olympic Gold-medal winning rhythmic gymnast Alina Kabaeva, , now high-earning a media mogul in Moscow who is rarely seen in public. This would make the Kremlin strongman a father of seven. Luiza has had a higher online public profile, and was hit by a backlash over Ukraine.

Karis Wilson was told her knee- black dress with lace trim over a long-sleeve white turtleneck reminded a female teacher of “lingerie” and made a male student teacher feel awkward, when she wore it to school.The -year-old was sent home and the encounter was so damaging she did notto school until her graduation at the end of the year.Her father Christopher Wilson initially complained about the incident on aFacebooklive video that went viral, with more than , views. He told the Daily Star : She wasnapost wearing it in a sexual manner. She wasnapost wearing it for attention. She normally wears track pants and a hoody. She had a snowboarding accident a month or two ago and couldnapost be active for a while. She had started going to the gym and feeling better about herself. Then one day she decided to wear a dress and feel good about herself, this is how they reacted. “She had lost more than a week of school and then she said ‘dad, I don’t know what to wear to school’. “She elaborated a little bit and said, ‘DadI wear just my track pants and hoodie,I wear something comfortable, am I conforming  “aposIf I wear something I feel pretty in, am I trying to rub it in their face ’”  Karis, a student at NorKam Secondary School in British Columbia, Canada, has now put the incident behind her and started her university education. Her dad told CBC News at the time:was told that it could possibly make the male student teacher feel awkward and it could makefeel awkward since it reminded her of a lingerie outfit. Itaposs actually a very modest outfit when you actually look at it... I think the initial comments were based on the fact that it had lace.” It was said in  that dad Christopher was told the teacher was a little bit old school after complaining to the principal.He said a teacher pulled Karis out of her class and escorted her to the principalaposs office on Tuesday. He claimed the principal later told him that she agreed the outfit was not inappropriate. Karisapos classmates staged a walkout the following day to show their support for her. At the time he added: There was a female who was singled out because what sheaposs wearing could make someone in a position of power over her feel uncomfortable. And the more you think of it, the more you say it, the more you understand that this is absurd.He initially complained about the incident in a live Facebook video that went viral, with more than , views.And now, speaking to the Daily Star in , Christopher said his daughter was confident thatshe could go back in time and change anything, she would do the same thing again.

It would abandon its drive to join NATO and vow not to develop nuclear weapons, on the basis that Russia would withdraw troops and give Kyiv security guarantees.No peace deal would be possible without a ceasefire and withdrawal of troops, he said, though he ruled out trying to recapture all Russian-held territory by force, saying it would lead to a third world war.The aim, he said, was to reach a “compromise” over the eastern Donbas region, held by Russian-backed forces since . However, Zelenskiy said Ukraine refused to discuss certain other Russian demands, such as the demilitarisation of the country.Zelenskiy hosted a video call - which the Kremlin preemptively warned Russian media not to report - to deliver his message directly to Russian journalists on the eve of a new round of peace talks in Turkey. The president has previously spoken in Russian in speeches aimed at a Russian audience. The proposed meeting midway was on condition that the changes were put to a referendum and third parties promised to protect Ukraine, he said. “Security guarantees and neutrality, the non-nuclear status of our state — we’re ready to do that. “That’s the most important point… they started the war because of it,” Zelensky said. Russia’s media censor ordered the four reporters not to publish the interview and vowed to investigate them — even though it had already blocked a site that one of them edits and shut down a TV station formerly run by another. Zelensky said Ukraine’s main goal was to end the war as quickly as possible and make Russia’s forces withdraw to their positions before Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion on February .Ukraine was prepared to consider giving the Russian language protected minority status, he said.it received analogous guarantees from Moscow on Ukrainian. However, he claimed Putin had done “irreparable damage” to the Russian language in Ukraine through brutal assaults on mainly Russian-speaking cities such as Mariupol. “These Russian-speaking cities are the ones that have been wiped from the face of the earth. And these families,” Zelensky said.  He said  per cent of the buildings in Mariupol, which previously had a population of ,, had been destroyed, “but they were at least multistorey, so you can imagine what was there”. Smaller towns, on the other hand, had been completely destroyed. “I don’t know who  the Russian army ever treated like this,” the president said, adding that the destruction was worse than during Moscow’s two campaigns in Chechnya in the s and s. Zelenskiy later said in his nightly video address that he would insist on the territorial integrity of Ukraine in any talks. He said he was “. per cent sure” the Russian president had thought Ukraine would be waiting for the invasion with “flowers and smiles” — going so far as to send troops with parade dress for a victory celebration in Kyiv apparently planned for the third or fourth day of the war. But Zelensky said Ukraine was prepared to hold separate discussions on the Crimean peninsula, which Russia annexed in , and the eastern Donbas border region, where more than , people have died in a slow-burning separatist conflict involving Russian proxies that broke out soon afterwards. “I understand it’s not possible to make Russia completely leave the territory — that’ll lead to world war three,” Zelensky said. “That’s why I’m saying this is a compromise. Go back to where this all started and then we’ll try to solve the dficult Donbas issue.” Delegations from Ukraine and Russia are set to meet on Monday in Ankara for three days of talks aimed at ending Putin’s month-long invasion. But Zelensky played down comments by Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish president, that Ukraine and Russia were close to a deal on four points. He said peace could only be achieved through a meeting with Putin. “So we meet, we make a deal, and that’s enough — we sign a deal, stamp it, or sign it in blood. That’s enough to start the troop withdrawal process. “The troops must be withdrawn, everyone signs the guarantees, and that’s it,” Zelensky said. In exchange for giving up its desire to join NATO — an aspiration reflected in Ukraine’s constitution — Kyiv wants the new agreements to be more like NATOaposs Article  in requiring the country’s protectors to come to its aidit is attacked. Zelensky said he wanted to put the decision to a referendum, which he said would take “several months”, before embarking on constitutional changes that would require at least a year of work. “The guarantors won’t sign anythingwe have troops [on our territory]. “That’s why I think we could finish the war quickly. It’s just Putin and his entourage who are dragging it out,” Zelensky said. “Who’s going to talk about anythingtroops are still there  Who’s going to sign anything  Nothing will happen, it’s impossible.” He added that Ukraine refused to discuss two other Russian demands at the talks: “denazication” and “demilitarisation”. These were “completely incomprehensible things”, he said. Ukraine and its western backers fear Russia may be using the talks as a smokescreen while it regroups its forces for a new offensive and builds up new battle groups near the border.

From Knapdale, they headed up the west coast, sailing to Lewis and Harris before arriving at their final destination, Iona.Covering almost , miles in the series, they visit places of worship, from pagan stones to an early Christian cave and a contemporary mosque and Sikh temple. The journey tests the pilgrims not just spiritually, but physically too.TV celeb and comedian Scarlett Moffatt, , said: #At school, I spent a lot of time just reading books and on my own and so that’s how I got into faith really. It just felt calming. There’s almost a stigma attached to sort of being religious.#Whenever I would tell my friends, they’d laugh and I’d be like, #why is that funny # I believe in God, there has to be something that started all this.#I would describe myself as Christian, but not a strict Christian. I don’t go to church, but I definitely believe and religion to me is security.#She added: #In my head somebody on a pilgrimage is in a loin cloth and they have really long hair#and they look a bit dehydrated like they need a good moisturiser mask.#I’m doing the pilgrimage as I want to know what my religion is. I want to be able to answer that question with confidence.#TV personality and interior designer Laurence Lewellyn-Bowen describes himself as a #non-conforming pagan#. The -year-old explained: #I think pilgrimage is about clearing out your mental closet by physical exertion and by spiritual conversation with yourself or,you believe it, then conversation with your God.#I know I come across as all sort of flouncy and floppy and rather cavalier, but I am capable of existing in the real world.#However, I don’t think I’ve walked so far not wearing Cuban heels.#Pilgrimage: The Road to the Scottish Isles will be screened on BBC Two and iPlayer in the spring with three one-hour-long episodes, and is a CTVC production."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week march 11 2022","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Who am I  What am I  Where am I  How am I  – questions of identity and some of the questions I was left asking when I left a recent meeting.That meeting was part of a world-wide movement – a movement that calls the peoples of the world to pray.Similar questions of identity were raised when I was asked to write ‘a piece’ for this newspaper.

victory over the Aberdour seconds across in Fe.Taking advantage of the wind at Silversands, Kilmory pushed ahead with two well-taken quickfire goals from Alex Cunningham on  and  minutes to take an interval lead.There was no more scoring in the second half with both teams struggling a bit on the  sticky pitch.With Inveraray seniors# Mowi National Division match against Skye called off due to heavy rain # after the Aray lads had reached Fort William # Inveraray juniors had the option of a strong bench for their Mowi South Division Two match versus newly-formed Strachur-Dunoon.The match was reversed from the Winterton to Dunoon Stadium with the more experienced Inveraray side running out - winners.Experience aside, the Inveraray side still contained five players under  and one -year-old.A competitive and hard-fought game started at a good pace with Strachur-Dunoon showing good hitting and a willingness to chase down balls.Inveraray struggled for cohesion and had to wait until the th minute to find the breakthrough, Allan MacDonald scoring with a shot from distance.This settled the visitors and in the nd minute after some hard work by Ryan Pugh, the ball broke to Ewan Donnan, who struck from the angle to find the net.No sooner had the dust settled than Inveraray found themselves three ahead when Craig Taylor found space to put the ball past Dunoon keeper Nathan Ross.The second half was a closely-fought affair with both teams playing good, clean shinty.Inveraray had to step up a few gears to keep Strachur-Dunoon at bay, bringing on Colin Campbell, John MacKenzie and Allan Cameron to ensure composure throughout the team.Good second-half performances from all the Inveraray youngsters ensured the game was safe before Inveraray#s Allan Cameron finished the scoring in the th minute.This was the first competitive match for Strachur-Dunoon, and with a number of players missing # others having not met before the game # they showed plenty of determination, which bodes well for the future.Kyles Athletic#s away tie with Kilmallie in the Mowi Premiership was a Saturday morning postponement.The Kilmallie squad had already planned to attend the funeral of club chieftain Hugh #Shep# MacIntyre ahead of the game as the club paid their respects to one of their stalwarts.In Mowi South Division One, Kyles Athletic juniors drew -

They work well in a sunny or partially shaded area in fertile well-drained soil.Climbing jasmine can be highly scented, with ieties that flower in summer and winter. All produce pretty flowers and are fairly easy to grow against walls or up trellis.There are some fun options for kids to plant such as sunflowers, snapdragons and the four o#clock flower.If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o#clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock # so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.You will need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot. Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types # bush and cordon. Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall, supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom.

Much of the chamber music that Mozart composed was music for friends to perform and this trio is just one of these.Originally composed for clarinet, viola and piano, the viola part can be performed on cello as Harriet ably demonstrated. Very typically Mozart # easy to listen to and thoroughly enjoyable.On to the Craftsbury Trio, written by the American Gwyneth Walker. This trio has four movements, each depicting the small town of Craftsbury, Vermont.Up Country Toccata, The Lark in the Morning, You Can Buy It at the General Store, to the final movement Craftsbury Common depicting the green with a white picket fence.The movements are as descriptive as their titles and show many dferent skills on all instruments # fluttering sounds, jazz harmonies, numerous glissandos, syncopation, decorations and finishing with gentle rhythmic tapping.There is even a hint of Rhapsody in Blue in the third movement. If you only listen to one piece again this is the one and should be seen live,possible, and not just listened to.Rachmaninov’s Prelude in B minor for solo piano was Claire’s choice for the programme.This prelude, The Bell was Rachmaninov’s own favourite and was the one that he would often perform. The audience was delighted to be introduced to it by Claire.Brahms composed four chamber works which featured the clarinet later in le after a period when he wasn’t writing anything at all.This was the third trio of the evening and was again very dferent in style allowing Jenner , Harrietand Claireto demonstrate their considerable skills as a trio to a very appreciative audience.An arrangement of Consolation No. by Liszt for Trio Ecossaise was their encore.This was the second visit by Trio, and it is only a matter of time before they are welcomed back.There are two MAAA concerts planned for April # The Willow Trioand the Ugly Bug Ragtime Three.

community.“CrossFit is dferent to any of the other big commercial chains or gyms that are currently available in our local area.“The unit at Station Yard is specically suitable for the requirements of a CrossFit gym, which requires a concrete floor and high ceilings for some of the exercises that we carry out.  The unit has a roller door suitable for adequate ventilation.“CrossFit is a carbon

At present local residents have to travel via some sort of transport be it bus, car or bike to reach one of the closest fitness facilities.“With the current trend for local leisure and tourism within the town I feel that Innerleithen and the surrounding area would greatly benefit from its very own fitness facility.”The application has the support of the industrial unit’s landlord Keith Webb, who adds: “I have had several enquiries regarding this space, including other people also wanting to start a gym. However my preference is to rent this unit to an Innerleithen resident who will be focused on creating a vital facility for the local community.“I’m aware you have concerns about the limited number of industrial units available in Innerleithen, however you will know I am in the process of building three additional units for industrial use..remove“In my personal opinion the creation of a gym will be an asset to Innerleithen, providing a valuable facility in the community that people currently have to travel for.“I have owned these units for four years and in my opinion don’t believe there is any other suitable property within Innerleithen that would be of use as a fitness facility.”"},{"url":null,"title":"bid-new-holiday-park-coldstream-longer-operating-hours","story":"IT could be holiday time almost all year longa planning bid from a Berwickshire caravan park owner is rubber-stamped.Planning approval was granted by Scottish Borders Council to applicant Chris Gregg for the Coldstream Holiday Park at Kelso Road in December  and the facility opened in the spring of last year.The go-ahead for the caravan and camping park incorporated the change of use of agricultural land and for vehicle access roads, parking and car charging points.But one of the conditions of approval was that occupation of the caravans was “restricted to genuine holidaymakers only staying a maximum of six months in total within any consecutive period of  days commencing on January .”The council’s view was that a permanent residential site at the location “would conflict with established planning policy for this rural area”.That has put the caravan site at a disadvantage compared to other holiday parks in the Borders which are allowed to operate for longer periods, according to Mr Gregg.The new application requests that the maximum period is extended to  months of the year.The reasoning behind requesting the iation is to allow Mr Gregg’s holiday park to operate on a ‘level playing field’ with other similar facilities in the Scottish Borders area, and also to encourage as many holidaymakers as possible to visit Coldstream and the surrounding areas throughout the year.A report submitted with the application, from Melrose-based MFA architects, says: “In reality, the overwhelming majority of holidaymakers will choose to holiday for much less than  months of the year.“However, the fundamental point is that,a holiday maker is buying a caravan, they will naturally wish as much choice as possible on holiday periods and time-scales throughout the year, rather than have holiday periods and time- scales imposed upon them by a planning permission condition.“Chris Gregg is rightly concerned that anyone considering purchasing a holiday caravan in the Scottish Borders will actively consider a holiday site that has no holiday time periods or restrictions over a holiday site that does..remove“Mr Gregg is aware of very recent planning permissions at Lilliardsedge caravan site in Jedburgh and the Riverside caravan site in Hawick.”"},{"url":null,"title":"unconfirmed-reports-serious-injury-kelso-races","story":"UPDATE: JOCKEY Conner McCann required medical attention following a fall at the second flight in the mf handicap hurdle at Kelso this afternoon.He was riding Diamond State.McCann was attended to by medical staff on the course.The air ambulance arrived shortly after pm.It is now understood that Conner left the race ground in a vehicle ambulance and not the air ambulance.Racing has now resumed.More to follow:"},{"url":null,"title":"jockey-regains-consciousness-asks-whether-horse-ok","story":"A TEENAGE jockey’s first words after regaining consciousness following an horric fall at Kelso races on Saturday  were to enquire for the welfare of his horse.Conner McCannfell at the second jump while riding Diamond State and was treated on the track.The teenager who has gained four wins from just  rides over jumps, had only just ed to action the previous day at Musselburgh having been out injured since January.An air ambulance was called and arrived shortly after pm.

Also standing by was the steamer Brora, which was bund for Belfast.The conditions were so bad from the point of view of visibility that the leboat had to receive bearings from the Brora and other ships by means of the Aldis signal lamps while ships’ searchlights assisted them in getting into position. For a time the ships could only see each other on the radar screen.Coxswain Duncan Newlands, who knows this dreaded part of the estuary like the back of his hand, edged his leboat in astern of the coaster and proceeded to begin operations, but at .am came this dramatic message over the leboat’s radio: ‘Arrived alongside casualty at .hours got rope aboard and commenced towing at . hours.‘Rope now parted.

Baby young cod are not caught in prawn creels. The scientists at the Rural Affairs Committee meeting on March  said that there was zero evidence for creels to be included in the ban, and that the previous evidence cited on the Scottish Government website had now been removed.Our MSP represented to the creel fishermen in Campbeltown that she would:.    Seek a relaxation of the ban to enable the creel fishermen to continue to work as per the scientic evidence advice..    Seek compensation for the creel fishermen for almost three months loss of income.However, in the event she VOTED.    To keep the ban in place.    Against compensation.This is absolutely duplicitous.

We believe we must take positive action now to tackle these and other challenges by helping schools to work more effectively together.#By making these changes, we believe we will protect our schools, enhance the education of our pupils and build a stronger team of educators.#But this view is challenged by parent councils across the region – and they also question the process.The council is consulting on a #proposal in principle#, and this worries parent councils representing schools in Mid Argyll and Kintyre.In a joint statement, they said: #Parents and communities need to be clear that the proposal in principle does not carry any technical detail. This will only be worked out once the decision has been made to progress the model – all subject to change.#Not only can [the education authority] give us no evidence of this model working but it has not provided us with any risk assessments or proof that this will do no harm.#To make valid feedback, we have to hear both sides of the story.#The statement added that when the plan was first presented to the council#s community services committee in June , it was already clear that parents opposed school clusters.#It is extraordinary that the education authority has now spent time and money using a marketing company to #sell# the same model to parents rather than thinking it worthwhile to engage parents with possible alternative models for discussion,# the statement continued.Suggestions have recently been made that the issue should be make-or-break for candidates in May#s council elections.Islay community councillor Calum Murray, a former teacher, said: #My feeling is to nip this in the bud, that with the elections coming up very soon in May, we should ensure that not one councillor is re-elected that would support this measure.#"},{"url":null,"title":"pupils u13s in football action","story":"Campbeltown Pupils stravelled to Clydebank to play BSC Glasgowon Sunday March , looking to follow-up on their draw with Busby the previous week.After a promising start, the Pupils found themselves - down at half-time, through a combination of poor defending, and also some good play from the BSC attackers.The young Campbeltown team rallied in the second half, and with a much better all-round performance, capped off with goals from Ryan Johnston and Ben Cunningham.Finnart #s The young Pupils# second away game in a row saw them travel on Sunday to play league leaders Finnart.The first  minutes saw the Pupils put in one of their best performances of the season, competing in every position, and they were rewarded midway through the half with a brilliant -yard strike from Ryan Johnston that found the top corner.The pace and strength of the league leaders# attackers started to cause problems, however, and two quick-fire goals gave Finnart the lead.The crucial goal came with the last kick of the half, with slack defending from the Pupils allowing Finnart to go into the break - ahead.The second half was a very even affair.

I had slowly started to think that it was a once-in-a-letime opportunity until fortune smiled upon me one more time.About two weeks ago, I had a busy day at work. To recharge my batteries, I decided to go on a quick walk with the camera.Short-eared owl. Image: Zan BlaszczykAs soon as I left the house, the weather changed its course and the sky was shortly covered by nimbus clouds. Normally I wouldhome and grab my raincoat, but I did not want to waste time.When I arrived at the local reserve, the first rain droplets fell on the ground and the place became deserted. I took a wander and soon spotted a familiar flight pattern above the marshes. Upon checking through my camera, I confirmed it was a short-eared owl.The bird was flying low and patrolling the ground for voles. It even managed to catch one but it was tricky to get a good-quality photo due to the distance between us. The bird flew past me on a couple of occasions but the weather was getting worse with every minute so I headed back home. The word about the owl must have spread, as when I ed two days later, I met other fellow photographers looking for the stunning bird.I ed to the same spot as previously and sat on a rock and waited patiently. Shortly afterwards, a graceful owl with a wingspan of around cm appeared on the horizon. Without changing my position, I started following the bird with the camera. Imagine my surprise when the owl flew over me and looked straight at the camera! I silently shouted to myself: “Wow!”As soon as the owl flew behind me, I slowly turned back and spotted the second bird. Both owls were flying towards each other and, as they met halfway, they started their ‘sky dance’.The male began to rise in the sky whilst performing a combination of dynamic wing beats and gliding down, then rising again. He also made several squeaky calls accompanied by dynamic wing claps at high speeds! After repeating the whole sequence a few times, he started falling from the sky. The female joined in and they started going at each other: the birds were e-bombing one another and attacking with their talons. That aerial display lasted for about  minutes until the birds separated. What a scene it was!Courtship behaviour is spectacular for this species: often, two birds will lock their talons and, whilst holding onto each other, they will start tumbling nearly to the ground before letting go.I encourage everyone who has a chance to observe this behaviour, as this is a ‘must’ in the birding world. It is worth remembering, though, that this species is sensitive to disturbance and their numbers are considered declining during the past two decades. It is crucial not to approach the owls or their nesting site. For your observation, I would recommend choosing one spot and remaining there. This way, you have a chance to show them that you are no threat to them and hopefully the owls will get used to your presence. I prefer this technique rather than hiding as, considering owls’ excellent eyesight, it is almost impossible to stay unnoticed. By waiting at the same position, we can also eliminate another factor, which is chasing off their prey: as we walk, the ground shakes under our feet and small mammals, such as mice or voles which the owls feed on, will disappear. Short-eared owls like marshy and boggy places, so it is important not to walk over the rich habitat but use paths.www.zanslenswww.facebook zanslenswww zans_lensIf you have owls living in your backyard or would like me to photograph and feature wildle from your area, please get in touch!"},{"url":null,"title":"brunton-musselburgh-children-star-bugsy-malone","story":"Youth acting group Drama Mill auditioned  children for the show, and now has a cast of  children from North Berwick, Aberlady, Gullane, Cockenzie and Haddington, aged from eight to .Linda Kearsley Ross, Drama Mill director, said that the performance – the group’s first foray into musical theatre – was “ambitious” but that the children had loved taking on the roles of s New York gangsters.County children to star in Bugsy MaloneShe added: “Bugsy Malone was our first choice of play.“Drama facilitators Claudia Overton and Stephanie Wynne and I have all taken part in productions when we were at school and have fond memories of performing this play.“It’s ambitious to do it with such a young castbut our fabulous talented group have risen to the task.“This is the first time we have performed at The Brunton and we are so excited to give our youngsters the opportunity to perform on a professional stage.”The cast will perform the famous musical numbers accompanied by a live nine-piece band, whose members are all volunteering their time and talent.Drama faclitator Stephanie Wynne coaches the young Bugsy Malone castAnd the production will emulate the original  film, starring Jodie Foster, by using splurge guns and foam pies.Linda said: “There is something really fun about playing gangsters and molls, and using splurge to take people down rather than bullets.“Some people criticised that the ending is really abrupt, i.e. that they all become friends and sing a song, but I don’t think children question the ending – they believe bad people can become good people and that, as the words say, ‘ you give a little love then it all comes back to you’.”Tickets can be bought via    or thebrunton en-GB shows bugsy%malone events -

And after half a century she has finally decided to tell it herself, to reclaim it from all the other versions that have been told over the years.It’s a story that she has wanted to tell for her kids, to explain to them what their mother had gone through. But maybe it is also an attempt to reclaim her origin story for herself“Very much so,” Bunyan admits. “The story of the wagon journey has been told by quite a few people. But I never felt it was quite right. It was so romanticised. Because it is a romantic story, and I can’t get away from that. And I didn’t want to completely burst that bubble.“But maybe a bit,” she says, smiling.February  and Vashti Bunyan is sitting in her beautul home in Edinburgh, where she has lived in with her partner Al Campbell for the last  years. Campbell is off making us some tea and Bunyan is talking to me about Wayward, the new book she has written, the music she has made and the le she has led. She is  and yet remains a delicate beauty, sharp bone structure under silver hair.But hers is a story that is about durability not fragility.It begins in the s and the first flush of pop. Bunyan, born in , the youngest of three, fell hard for pop music. She even dreamed of pop stardom.“Oh, it was all I wanted. That kind of music and to be able to sing it. I wanted it from really quite early on, probably , , whenever the TV shows started happening – Oh Boy and Six Five Special – I wanted to be a pop singer. It was everything to me.”Bunyan even made a go of it. She signed up with Andrew Loog Oldham, the manager of the Rolling Stones. Jagger and Richards even wrote her first single, Some Things Just Stick In Your Mind, relegating her own song to the B side, much to her displeasure.But soon she realised that Loog Oldham saw her as a replacement for Marianne Faithfull and that was not how she saw herself at all. Not that it mattered. Soon the phone stopped ringing and her pop career was over before it started.Looking back, she says, she lacked the ability to put herself forward. “I just thought I wasn’t up to it, which was probably true.”Le became a struggle. She was prescribed antidepressants. Her mum had a stroke. Her father said that her dog Blue had to go. She took the dog and left home herself. She and Blue joined Robert Lewis in the summer of  and the idea of the journey in a horse and cart was hatched.Was it a romantic idea to begin with  “It’s hard to remember, looking back, whether I thought it was a romantic idea or something I had to do because I didn’t have any other choice at the time.“No money, mother ill, father desperate. I had no other means of support, really.”Bunyan had been told throughout her teens and into her twenties to be a secretary or a nurse. “And I didn’t want to do any of those. So, it was asit was the only choice I could make was to live outside of all of that.”Were you running away “Yes.”From what  “Disapproval. I think because most of my family had conformed and most of my friends had conformed and the fact that I hadn’t made me an outsider and made me feel like an outsider. And so why try to be like everyone   Because I wasn’t.”There were darker currents too. “With the music not getting anywhere I did go into a terrible nosee. I’ve tried not to call it what it definitely was, which was post-traumatic stress syndrome. But I would not have had any kind of thought of then. Or depression, or any of those words that are so common now. I would not have applied that to myself. But clearly, that was what was going on. I couldn’t get up in the morning.“Of course, my father threw me out but, also, I needed to keep my dog. I haven’t really said it in the book, but he did in many ways save my le. When I came close to that terrible, terrible despair my dog did keep me going.”Shortly after her mother died and grief was also thrown into the mix.But by then she had started on her journey with Lewis, drawn by one horsepower . They had chosen their course and they stuck to it. This is the key to the story.“I didn’t feel it at the time, but, yes, when I look back, I was very determined. I think I came across as a wispy, weedy person. But I wasn’t. I carried on through it and I was very determined that I would live the way I wanted to.”The goal had been to reach a commune set up by Donovan on Skye. But when they arrived after more than a year’s travelling there was no room for them. But by then it didn’t matter.“By the time we got there we had changed so much. It didn’t worry me at all because we had become so much stronger during the journey, so much more aware of what we were and what our abilities were and what our … vision was I suppose. And it was a shared vision, and we did carry on and we found that vision on Berneray.”But Berneray was unwelcoming, and Bunyan discovered she was pregnant and in the end they didn’t stay.\"I think we might have carried n a bit longer had I not been six months’ pregnant by the time we left there and I was getting worried at the idea of a helicopter taking me to Inverness.\"In many ways the book is an account of kindness. The kindness of strangers willing to help a young couple out as they travelled.” I think some people really enjoyed what we were doing and celebrated and helped us.”Shortly after moving to Berneray, Bunyan ed to London for a short time and recorded an album with Joe Boyd. Just Another Diamond Day, a collection of songs she had written on the journey. She was unhappy with the experience and the album Just Another Diamond Day released in  did nothing. As a result, she couldn’t listen to it for decades. Couldn’t listen to any music, actually.“I didn’t sing to my kids. Any music there was, they brought into the house. It was something that I didn’t want anything to do with it.”There were more wanderings after Berneray. The couple travelled to Ireland before coming back and settling in Stirlingshire where Bunyan, as well as raising three children, started a new le restoring and selling old furniture. That part of her le sounds like pure Bargain Hunt, I tell her.“It really was. It was so exciting to find something in a barn – an old dresser that had a tractor engine on it – to take it away, clean it up and sell it. Most of it went to America.”The point of all this is that Bunyan made things work for her. She found her own way, structured her le the way she wanted it to be and raised her kids in that structure.“Which they, in a lot of ways, had to dismantle and make their own idea of it. It was quite hard being a hippy kid in Kinbuck.”Were you making their clothes  “Yes. I think the worst one was the crisps. I made crisps in some deep fat and put them in an envelope to take to school. They will never forgive me for that.”Lewis and her eventually split up. Le changes. She eventually moved to Edinburgh to be with Campbell  years ago. He reintroduced her to music, “for which I will always be grateful.”How does she look back on the younger version of herself, I wonder  Which one, she asks “The one who was dreaming of pop stardom  And that’s what I wanted. I definitely wanted that le. And when I didn’t get it, I blamed myself.“And that’s what took me off into that other person who rejected everything that had gone before and started to try to make a dferent kind of le. I’m really proud of her. I’m proud of both of them. Well, I’m not so proud of the one who gave up. But I’m quite proud of the one who carried on, because I did. I carried on right the way through until Robert left and that kind of le ended.”Just Another Diamond Day was rereleased in  and suddenly Bunyan’s music began to get the attention it deserved. She has made another two albums in the years since, Lookaftering and Heartleap, both framing her featherlight voice and supple song writing. Both a reminder that strength is not necessarily about rigidity.You could say the same about her le. Vashti Bunyan has had to bend over the years, but she has never broken.Wayward by Vashti Bunyan is published by White Rabbit on Thursday, £."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-never-fair-society-tied-westminster","story":"I hope Ms Stewart visited Oak Park while in Chicago. It’s a suburb to the west, with broad tree-lined streets and gorgeous houses, many of them designed by Frank Lloyd Wright early in his career as an architect. On the way to beautul Oak Park, the L metro line passes through appalling slums, illustrating the stark inequality generated by the American model of capitalism.I prefer the models adopted by some of our European neighbours, especially in the north. Tax rates are higher on those who can afford to pay, those who have been lucky in le state intervention to tackle poverty and the problems that come with it is greater. The outcome is a more equal and, from most analyses, a happier society.Scotland has a choice. We can carry on as we are, with an acceptance that the poor and disadvantaged will always be with us or we can get serious about building a fairer and more equal society, with as many as possible benefiting from the wealth of our nation.

This rate however has a cap of only applying up to £,. Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor, has now introduced the same rate but it will apply up to £, . The SNP has been keen since the Chancellor’s announcement to say that it also has a p starter rate but has kept quiet on the top limit for it. Those in Scotland currently earning between £, and £, pay % – a substantial dference.When the new rate is implemented in , what will the SNP do  Stick to its guns of taxing those in this bracket this higher rate and risk employees seeking work in England, or give Scottish teachers, junior doctors, office staff and others in this bracket the same level of taxation  Scotland already struggles to get staff for our education, NHS and business sectors without discouraging talented people and businesses looking to invest in Scotland.Time will no doubt tell.Jane Lax, Aberlour.SCOTTISH MPS LONG BEEN EUNUCHSWHEN Peter Russellwrites of “the pygmies of Holyrood or the Scottish eunuchs of Westminster”, and in particular the latter, does he include his own party – Anas Sarwar, Jackie Baillie et al – or only the SNP  Is Douglas Ross excluded from this opinion  Or Ian Murray More seriously, does he have in mind some earlier time, lost in the mists of history, when Scottish MPs were influential, were not eunuchs, at Westminster  Currently, MPs from Scottish constituencies are nine per cent of Westminster MPs. In  that same representation was almost %. Does Mr Russell consider the dference between being influential and the fate of the eunuch to be represented by those two numbers Of course, in  Scottish MPs were influential – Gordon Brown, Robin Cook, George Robertson, John Reid et alHowever, was this not a reflection of internal Labour politics rather than anything to do with, until devolution, Westminster being the \"only game in town for Scottish politicians\"  Is it not then true to say that with their often-irrelevant level of representation, particularly when Scotland has voted for another party, that Scottish MPs have always been eunuchs, other than via successful politicking within their own party Earlier on he claims thatthe Scottish electorate voted for SNP MSPs “to do things well, or even competently … the SNP would be much less successful at the polls”. At the last Holyrood election constituency vote , the SNP won nearly % of the vote. This is more than Conservative and Labour combined, so what does that say of them  Mr Russell and those of his opinion would be better served trying to understand the electorate, rather than slandering them.Alsasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.* PETER A Russell’s letter was a derogatory analysis of devolution and one I totally disagree with.He suggested that voters voting for an SNP MSP do not expect them to be competent constituency representatives – but many SNP MSPs work very long and hard in their constituents interest. Increased majorities speak for themselves in my constituency the SNP MSP received the largest vote for any candidate ever in the Falkirk West constituencyand was re-elected for a fourth time.It may come as a surprise to Mr Russell, but in our parliament we have many well-educated and professional MSPs who have the interest and welfare of their constituents at the forefront of their reasons to give up their careers and work in the interest of making a dference.Catriona C Clark, Banknock.THE VOTERS NEED TO GET ANGRYDESPITE Richard Allisons accurate description of Scotlands demise under the SNP and Greensthe most recent poll I can findforecasts the SNP vote share to rise from  per cent in the  council elections to a % forecast in May. So no bloody nose there, it would seem. Mind you, the same pollster forecast a % SNP vote share in March , so perhaps theres hope.But are people really angry enough to get off their settees and vote them out  In eachthe last six elections since  no more than . million out of m No voters in  have voted for the pro-UK parties.If even k of the missing k get out and vote for pro-UK candidates that could have a disastrous effect on the SNP vote in an election where the STV voting system effectively awards seats by vote share, not the vote-splitting \"winner takes all\" in a General Election.The problem in Scotland, however, is the vast majority of our .m registered voters are still oblivious to what is going on, wouldnt know a defunct Ferguson ferryit docked in their back garden, and the opposition parties continually fail to breach this wall of apathy with any compelling, positive, convincing message.Allan Sutherland, Stonehaven.WHO WILL COME TO THEIR SENSES NEIL Mackay’s article on the current state of the SNPwas, in my view, spot on.However, what is very concerning is that since the referendum in  the SNP has on a number of occasions tried to convince the Scottish electorate that the majority has wanted to cancel our union with the rest of the UK.Even when the SNP was riding high around  per cent of us were concerned about the realities of the situation now that Mr Mackay has highlighted the mess that it is in will the other % now come to their senses, or simply dream on  W MacIntyre, East Kilbride.LETS HAVE AN OPEN ABORTION DEBATEIRENE Munropresents a refreshingly balanced narrative on abortion. We would all wish to avoid the crass politicisation of the abortion debate in the United States, whereby the subject has become something of a political football, with harsh and ungracious rhetoric on both sides. That said, the fact remains that serious debate about the ethics of abortion remains all but off limits in Scottish politics.This is unfortunate, in that it sometimes seems aslegitimate concerns about the rights and welfare of unborn children are shut down and ignored. It would be heartening indeedour MSPs, regardless of their own views, felt able to cultivate an environment whereby those with deeply-held concerns about abortion, as well as for the welfare of mothers, were heard.Michael Veitch, Parliamentary Officer, CARE for Scotland, Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-time-snp-admit-covid-restrictions-mistakes","story":"In early March  I watched an interview with Dr Michael Osterholm, world-renowned US epidemiologist and Director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policyat the University of Minnesota. He worked with SARS, MERS and Ebola, and gave an insightful overview of what he thought would happen with Covid-, stating it would be a global pandemic lasting months with a high mortality rate.He explained it was an airborne virus transmitted through aerosols in indoor environments and could be spread by asymptomatic people. Those at greatest threat would have co-morbidities, especially over-s, obese and the elderly. Children were rarely affected, normal hand hygiene was sufficient, but trying to stop the virus was like “trying to stop the wind”.All proved to be true, and he also took time to explain what he didn’t know, and was still learning. That is why I trust in his opinions.But pertinently he stated cloth and surgical masks were no use against a virus, but N respirators were .Meanwhile our governments told us Covid spread through symptomatic people, from droplets via coughs and sneezes, kept us indoors, whilst grasping at anything that could be a mitigation. And that’s when face coverings came to prominence, and taken up enthusiastically by the media who suppressed any alternate view.But what of “following the science”  I remember Professor Jason Leitch changing his stance on face coverings when they were becoming mandatory, announcing they “may” give protection, but no actual evidence.In October  the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policypublished a two-part report on all the major face coverings studies and concluded: “Its time to get realabout masks… We are well past the emergency phase of this pandemic, and it should be well known by now that wearing cloth face coverings or surgical masks, universal or otherwise, has a very minor role to play in preventing person-to-person transmission. It is time to stop overselling their efficacy and unrealistic expectations about their ability to end the pandemic.”A few weeks ago I saw another interview with Dr Osterholm who stated cloth and face masks were nothing but “fashion statements”, and vaccination and ventilation were the most effective mitigations. If the Scottish Government has any evidence to refute this it should share it with all of us, and send it through to Cidrap.Throughout this pandemic we have had the most restrictions of any part of the UK, but the overall impact of Covid- remains similar. Therefore something must be wrong. It is time to review the measures taken, revise and promote those that work, and be honest enough to admit mistakes. How  how can we trust our Government  The longer this goes on I do not believe it is “following the science”.Mark Innes, Elgin.ARE BANKS REALLY BEHIND US WHEN my father retired from the oil construction sector, he bought a small shop. He transferred all cash to the local bank, and obtained bags of certain coins and notes to give sensible change to his customers, wholesalers and the like. I wonder how shopkeepers now operate in towns and villages which have no banking facilities Recently I met a -plus lady who lives on her own with few nearby friends and a son who resides by the English Channel. The local Post Office where she uplts her pension had informed her that this service was being withdrawn and she must inform them to which bank she wished to transfer this operation. Fortunately this town still has several nearby banks . What would she have doneshe had not had a local bank There are constant advertisements on television telling us that the banks are \"here for you\" or \"right behind you\". Should they not add \"somewhere\" to those adverts Now we read that banks having a low amount of business during the pandemic may be closed . Is banking now an uncaring business and no longer a professional service Can local authorities not bring pressure to bear on banks  They and their staff must use banks all the time.Bryce Drummond, Kilmarnock.WHY SLAVERY REALLY ENDEDWITH all this current brouhaha on slaves and witches Letters, March  can your readers note that one of my ancestors was an early Christian who, for his faithwas thrown to the lions in Rome for the amusement of the plebeians. Can I therefore join the chorus here and demand that the Colosseum is immediately demolished and thrown in the Tiber and the Italian Government comes up with some much-needed reparations to path my way to heaven On a more serious note, can I repeat here what you printed once before on your Letters Pages, that slavery only stopped in the UK when it was realised by the Establishment that paying slave wages was far more lucrative than owning a slave. You didn’t need to buy him or feed, clothe and house him when you have no work for him or spend even more money replacing him when you’ve worked him to death. Throw into the mix the colossal sum by way of taxpayer-funded compensation and you have the proverbial \"no brainer\".DH Telford, Fairlie.CHEAP AT HALF THE PRICETHERE have been a number of letters recently recalling the price of goods in years gone by .

With more than a decade of experience creating scents for other cult brands, the Edinburgh-based firm has doubled sales for three consecutive years with annual revenues now approaching £,.Founded by Fe-born master perfumer Euan McCall, who was later joined by partner Chloe Mullen, the business began trading in  as Jorum Laboratories after Mr McCall was asked to create some scented products to compliment the beverages of a large multinational drinks company.“I grabbed that opportunity with both hands and decided from that point onwards that this needed to be taken advantage of, and the business snowballed from there,” he said.With family interests in the extraction of aromatic oils, Mr McCall was exposed to the industry at a very young age and “fell in love and down the rabbit hole with it”. Rather than going the standard university route, he studied under a iety of professionals in a journey that took him to locations such as Barcelona, Paris and Dubai to absorb dferent cultural styles.: Scottish circular fashion specialist seals luxury technology tie-up“You can go to university and study chemical engineering but I went through a more traditional route where I studied with master perfumers and trained specically in perfumery rather than chemistry to ensure I would become a perfumer at the end of it,” he said.“A lot of people study chemistry and chemical engineering and then go to work for a fragrance company, but they might not end up being perfumers, they might be scientists in some other part of the RD chain.”Ms Mullen joined Jorum in  from another fragrance company and focuses on sales and marketing while Mr McCall oversees formulation and manufacturing. The two have a near-equal stake in the business, with the balance tipped slightly in favour of Mr McCall at %, and no external investors.They have nearly  formulation clients, most of whom are based internationally and can’t be named because of non-disclosure agreements. They also undertake work on behalf of other luxury retailers, such as big-name whisky groups, who want candles or other scented products to sell alongside their main brands.: Scottish lingerie maker LoveRose seeks to capture Dragons financial heartThe pair re-launched as Jorum Studio in  with six of their own-brand fragrances, selling direct to consumers and via distributors supplying independent speciality beauty stores in ious international markets.The own-brand range has now expanded to  perfumes, led by the most popular Trimerous and Nectary scents, with three more to launch in the coming month or two. Thereafter Jorum plans to introduce its own line of scented candles and body products.The company also continues with its BB services: “We did initially think it would have to be a case of one or the other,” Mr McCall said, “butanything both sides have accelerated.”Progress has not, however, come without signicant dficulties.“We entered international wholesaling the week before the pandemic struck us proper, so our first major retailer had just received our products as we all went into lockdown,” Mr McCall said.“We had spent a lot of time and energy speaking to a whole host of other stores which initially we had lined up to sell to, and then they got a little bit of cold feet which was understandable because they were having to close all their stores, so [developing the wholesale business] took a little bit longer than we had hoped or expected.”: Edinburgh sour beer brewery creating jobs to support growthPrices for glass, paper and natural raw materials also increased, though the biggest issue in the early part of the pandemic was securing ethanol alcohol. With nearly all supplies going into hand sanitisers, prices rose by as much as %, and even at that ethanol was at times simply unavailable.As dficult as that was, Mr McCall said Brexit continues to be a “nightmare”. Sales of Jorum’s own scents have fallen from % of direct sales revenue to almost zero as European buyers are faced with the uncertainty of import taxes on their purchases.Fortunately, the lipstick effect has driven demand where, with the US and Australia now accounting for the majority of direct sales. Europe continues to account for about half of wholesale revenues.Jorum is now looking to open additional stores to add to its current boutique in Edinburgh’s St Stephen Street. Though online growth was strong throughout lockdown, Mc McCall believes the future for perfume – which people prefer to try before they buy – depends on physical retailing.“The who’s who of the beauty and retail industry are all focusing on perfume as a ‘golden item’ within their stores,” he said. “John Lewis is doubling down and investing heavily in perfume, and Harrod’s are opening stand-alone beauty stores because they know the category is experiencing dynamic growth.“We are taking the temperature from these bigger operators. The outlook in that sense is very positive, we just have to be in a position to roll that out.”"},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-cab-network-meets-eye","story":"I recently started working for Citizens Advice Scotland , joining a team that provides support to the network of  Citizens Advice Bureauxacross the country.I have to admit I was blown away by the erse services provided by CABs and now I know more about those services, I thought it might be interesting to write about what I’ve learned. Having said that a letime ago I volunteered in a CAB in my hometown, Huddersfield – but things have changed and moved on since then.A lot of people think CABs are part of the Government or the Council. But no, each CAB is an independent local charity that is volunteer-led and responds to meet the needs of local communities. Our CABs each deliver their service with committed staff and volunteers who work tirelessly to support people.Local CABs are integral to their local communities. Inequality magnies existing poverty and reduces le chances for people, and CABs play a vital role in building community wealth, in terms of both finances and well-being. But over and above the basic day-to-day advice you get from your local CAB, the network also delivers additional services that are less well known. For example, we run projects aimed at specic groups of people, such as veterans or those serving in our armed forces, people claiming Universal Credit for the first time, people affected by gambling and EU Citizens living in Scotland.CAS is the collective support body of this network, delivering a range of support services to the  CABs. We have a whole team here who constantly update our advice to make sure it is rigorous and correct. This central advice resource is used by all of our CABs, and also on our public advice website: www.citizensadvice.org.uk scotland.CAS also uses the information we gain through providing advice to inform policymakers about the impact of public policies – and so influence positive changes. For example, the new Adult Disability Payment has been heavily influenced by us highlighting the problems of the system it replaces. We also make people aware of their rights, and of actions they can take for themselves to exercise them.The final thing I wasn’t aware of was the sheer scale of work being done. Every month the Scottish CAB network helps around , people directly, with another , people checking our online advice. Last year we unlocked a total of £ million for our clients, through things like social security payments, with-held wages and debt reductions. This work is le-changing and has never been more needed. Not all CAB work has financial impact, but all types of support have beneficial outcomes. Because the next few months and years to come are going to be tough. Especially for low-income households but actually for all of us to a greater or lesser degree. So I thought it would be good to remind people that the Citizens Advice network is here to help. Not just with the basic advice but with all these additional services too. It’s a privilege to be part of such a great charity. For more than  years the CAB network have been helping people who need our free, confidential and non-judgemental support. If that includes you, we’re here.

After Easter — from April  — we will stop recommending that people who don’t have symptoms, should test for COVID.“This change will apply across the population — including in most workplaces and in early years centres, schools, universities and colleges.“Then, at the end of April, routine testing will end — even for people who have symptoms.“At that time, physical test sites will close — although some mobile testing units and capacity will be retained for possible future use. Contact tracing will also end.“Free testing will not generally be available to the wider population.

These included , people aged  to  who were tracked over a period of time.The study further found that teenagers who had a lower-than-average le satisfaction also tended to have higher social media use one year later.Sarah-Jayne Blakemore, professor of psychology at the University of Cambridge, said adolescence is a “period of transition, both in terms of biology – things like hormones and the brain – but also psychologically.”She added: “We change a huge amount in terms of our cognitive abilities and our social cognition, our social awareness, and our emotion processing during adolescence.“The social worldchanges a huge amount in adolescence. We go from little primary schools to big secondary schools, we have a huge number of new people we have to interact with, peers take on heightened importance in adolescence, and young people have to work out where they are in the complex and changing social hierarchy.“This is a really vulnerable period of le already, and social media comes in and kind of amplies that.”Prof Blakemore said social media “is complex” and can be a force for good, such as helping young people maintain social contact during the Covid pandemic.“On the other hand, there are also negative aspects of social media, where the content of social media can be negative,” she said.“Whether it’s pornography, or things like graphic images of war that you can’t get away from as soon as you turn on your phone at the moment.“There’s also things like sleep. It’s not just about what people are doing with social media, but also when.“Young people’s lives are so full during the day of school, and then after-school activities, that the one time they have to communicate with their friends, to check out their social media, is often in the evening quite late at night.“We know that sleep is so crucial for wellbeing and mood and cognitive development in adolescence. So depriving adolescents of sleep because of their social media use is going to be a negative thing.”Askedthere is a message for parents, Prof Blakemore said there is a need to educate young people “about what they are inevitably going to see on their phones via social media”.She added: “Whether it’s things like social exclusion, not being invited to a party from someone in their class, or images that could upset them, or social pressure,educating them really as young as possible about what they might be exposed to on social media and how they should handle that.”Dr Amy Orben, from the University of Cambridge, who led the study, said: “The link between social media use and mental wellbeing is clearly very complex.“Changes within our bodies, such as brain development and puberty, and in our social circumstances appear to make us vulnerable at particular times of our lives.”"},{"url":null,"title":"uae-energy-chief-doubles-opec-alliance-russia  \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

The Real Madrid forward went into the Austria clash with doubts over his fitness and criticism from Spanish media ringing in his ears. Bale responded with a brilliant brace that leaves Wales one win away from their first World Cup for  years. The Wales captain then went on the warpath, hitting back at a Spanish newspaper column which had described him as a “parasite” and saying he wants to use his profile to “change the way we publicly talk and criticise people”. Bale could probably do with a quiet night, and may get one ahead of histo Madrid by starting on the bench.💯 incoming#TogetherStronger pic jVSzoBB— Wales 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿March , Goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey will join an exclusive club by becoming the third Welshman to win  caps. Only record caps holder Chris Gunterand Balehave played more games for the Wales men’s team than Hennessey, who made his debut in May . Hennessey has spent most of the last  years as Wales’ number one and was a pillar of the side which reached the semi-finals of Euro . He has lost his place to Danny Ward over the last year or so, but injury to the Leicester goalkeeper sees Hennessey reach the three-figure landmark during this Wales camp.Boss Robert Page is planning to make changes after the physical and mental energy spent against Austria. Bale, Aaron Ramsey, Daniel James and Joe Allen could be candidates for breathers, with Page saying he has to be mindful of club situations. Dylan Levitt may be a midfield option and Cardf’s Rubin Colwill is hoping to play at his club ground with his three previous appearances all coming away from home. Exciting winger Brennan Johnson is a probable starter given outstanding form which has brought him  goals in Nottingham Forest’s Championship play-off push. vw,vw,px, px\"Tottenham defender Joe Rodon has become a pivotal player for Wales despite a lack of action for his club Joe Rodon has started as many games for Wales as Tottenham this term – five each – but there the similarities end. Whereas Rodon has struggled for game-time under three dferent Spurs managers – Jose Mourinho, Nuno Espirito Santo and Antonio Conte – he is one of the first names on the Wales team sheet. Rodon made light of having less than three hours of first-team football since November’s international break to produce another eye-catching Wales display against Austria.

The identity of a person could undoubtedly be forged by the place of their birth and the community of that place, particularly at a time in the past when populations were less mobile.The traits of a person’s parents manest in their physical appearance their spirit, likes and dislikes, and sometimes even interests or inclinations might appear hereditary – not just from mother and father but perhaps from an ancestor remembered only by name and special characteristic, like poesy or craft skill..The failure by clan chiefs and other landed gentry to recognise this customary right held by the people since time immemorial underpins the Clearances, while demands for its recognition echo through much of the collective action undertaken against this violence, trauma, and dispossession. as far back in history as I can.The world and society these people lived in was so dferent to ours today, making context crucial to understanding the words being used and the philosophy from which they derive.Aside from the multitude which are in still in use today, there are published proverb collections as well as countless sound recordings, many digitized and made easily accessible by Tobar an Dualchais.By their nature proverbs cut across boundaries of class and gender, their survival relying upon oral transmission, on being commonly known in a community and thus reflecting its values.

The Trust has announced that funding applications for delivery partners have opened for . One of those ‘outside the box’ ideas was the creation of the Northern Ireland Hospitality School, which allowed three local hoteliers to come together under the umbrella of a not-for-profit organisation to create courses and programmes for the Ballymena hospitality sector.The Northern Ireland Hospitality School, as a delivery partner, was launched last year in conjunction with Northern Regional College . The Trust, over the next three years, has committed almost pound,, offering students a chance to expand their skills and gain guaranteed employment with one of three local hotels – the Tullyglass House Hotel, the Adair Arms and the Galgorm Golf Resort and Spa. Since its launch, a total of  students have completed the Level  Professional Bartending course and have gone on to secure full-time employment. Joel Johnston, a former student of the Northern Ireland Hospitality School, who now works at Gillies Grill as part of the Galgorm Golf Resort and Spa in Ballymena, has been reflecting on his experience.“I’m really glad that the Northern Ireland Hospitality School was able to become a delivery partner with The Gallaher Trust,” Joel said. “Completing the Level  Professional Bartending course has made such a positive impact on my le I was able to develop my skills and now I’m working in a field that I’m truly passionate about.“I have always wanted to work within the hospitality industry and when I saw that a Hospitality School had been launched in Ballymena, I couldn’t wait to apply. “The Professional Bartending course has given me a great launchpad into my career. Working within hospitality can be tough, but the course has equipped me with all the skills necessary to thrive.“I am an employee at Gillies Grill and I’m really enjoying it. The Hospitality School has made such a dference to my le and I’m not sureI would be in this position without it. Any eligible organisation that requires funding and support should definitely apply to become a delivery partner with The Gallaher Trust. Their support helps to get projects off the ground which can make a big impact on the people of Ballymena – just like the Hospitality School.”Elsewhere, Ian Paisley MP, Chairman of The Gallaher Trust says he’s delighted with the success of the Hospitality School thus far and is speaking out to encourage other eligible organisations to apply for funding.“On behalf of The Gallaher Trust, we are so proud that the Hospitality School is achieving its purpose of developing skills and creating jobs for adults within the Ballymena community,” Ian commented.“Our mission at the Trust is to work alongside delivery partners that are aiming to make a real dference in peoples’ lives by creating jobs, developing skills and helping disadvantaged adults.“Delivery partner applications are now open and to be eligible, you must be a charity, a not-for-profit based organisation or a social enterprise, that can make an impact on the greater Ballymena area.“I would strongly urge any organisation that is eligible, to apply for funding today. We have seen from the likes of the Hospitality School, that it could make a massive dference to your project and ultimately the people of Ballymena, which is our clear purpose.”For more information about becoming a delivery partner, visit the Contact Us section of The Gallaher Trust’s website: https:thegallahertrust.org contact-us .

Announcing the bounce back support scheme, Mr Poots said: “Many businesses and sectors were adversely affected by the Covid- pandemic, and our agricultural shows were not immune to these effects, with all shows cancelled in  and only a few being able to take place in . This resulted in shows losing the opportunity to raise vital funds that would help prepare for the  season. “Shows play a vital role in showcasing our excellent agri-food produce and supporting our rural communities, as well as boosting our economy and the additional tourism opportunities. These shows are predominately run by many volunteers who give of their free time and I would like to extend my thanks to them for all of their hard work. “Pre-pandemic agricultural shows attracted more than , visitors.

The Fund can provide a non-repayable grant of up to pound,, in a  month period, to remove barriers to employment.

He said he had never givendogs that particular bone before and decided to buy them.Air-tight packaged dog bones are often marketed as a ‘natural’ treat aimed at helping aid plaque and gum problems in dogs. However, most contain a long list of disclaimers warning buyers of potential side effects and harm they can cause.“Before I left for work on Tuesday, I give all three dogs a bone and thought nothing of it,” said Sam. Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “Then that evening I took the dogs out lampingand I noticed Luther wouldn’t leave my side and wasn’t getting involved like my other dogs. Next thing I turned around to seehe was OK and Luther just collapsed.”Sam rushed Luther to an out-of-hours emergency vet.“I had to wait in the car because they still had some Covid restrictions. Next thing one of the vets came out to me and showed me a full syringe of blood they had taken from Luther’s belly. That’s when I was told I better come in and say my goodbyes.”Sam said the vet report stated a fragment from a knuckle bone had pierced Luther’s stomach and tore through the lining of the abdomen, which caused fatal internal bleeding. Sam has stressed he believes Luther’s death was “needless” and “preventable” and blames retailers who sell the product. “Luther was a perfectly healthy dog, all my dogs are fit with no health conditions,” he said.Days after Luther’s passing, Sam filed a complaint with Tesco, hoping the product would be recalled. In an email, Tesco responded saying they were “unable to accept liability for what happened to Luther” due to disclaimers on the packaging, which ranged from advising customers to supervise their pets’ eating, to ensuring the bone is chewed “over multiple sittings” alongside a warning of internal injury.“All I keep thinking about is why did I buy the stupid things, I spent £ to lose the best dog I ever had,” Sam said. In response to a request for comment for this article, Tesco said they were “sorry to hear” about Sam’s ordeal but again advised a request should be sent to Favour, the brand that manufactures the dog treats instead.Contact MarketingLtd, who operate Favour dog treats and act as the distributor, not the manufacturer, said the company was “very sad to hear about this incident.

A total of , people were interviewed between November  and December , using quotas to ensure those completing the survey were representative of the population. A Belfast City Councilbriefing paper for members of the authority’s Strategic Policy and Resources Committee reads: “On the whole, the results for  are positive. “In , satisfaction with council and le in Belfast dipped, a trend replicated across the rest of the UK.“This year, our results have improved on  and are now generally on a par, and in some places better than the  results. “For most of the council indicators we have reversed the downward trend in satisfaction and approval ratings, whereas this has continued in English council areas.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s

with Belfast and local area remains lower than in  , though still higher when compared to other local authorities.“Some data has fallen, such as views on whether all people can lead healthy lives or live le to the full, whether they feel listened to and whether they feel safe in the city centre at night. “This data will be used to inform improvement activities of council and the Belfast Agenda.”Looking at the results of the survey, % of respondents were satisfied with Belfast as a place to live, while % felt the city was a good place to visit, and % said Belfast residents are friendly, caring and compassionate.Some % of those surveyed said Belfast has good infrastructure, while % felt the city centre was vibrant, attractive and with lots going on.In terms of the more negative responses, % said they would not agree that Belfast is an environmentally-friendly city, and % disagreed with the statement that everyone in Belfast experiences good health and wellbeing.Worryingly, just over half of those surveyedsaid they felt safe in the city centre after dark.Back in October last year, Sinn Fein councillor Christina Black requested the council to begin work on a new strategy of city centre safety for women.“We all know the city centre has changed during, and emerging out of, lockdown, and with that perceptions of safety. “The experience of safety for women has to some degree altered, but it is very dficult to get an accurate benchmark,” she said during a meeting of BCC’s People and Communities Committee.”And she added: “Some incidents are not being picked up because of non-reporting, and that can be due to a lack of clarity about who to report an incident to, or whether it will be deemed serious enough, orit will actually be listened to.“But issues of street public harassment are happening, so what can we be doing to change attitudes and enhance city safety  “This request is not about criminalising or demonising, it is about exploring additional avenues for women to report issues that have concerned them.”Related topicsBelfast City CouncilSinn FéinMore On Belfast City CouncilBelfast City Council to host ‘Day of

Their mothers.And mum was the word across social media as some of the faces took time to say thanks, share a special moment and send well wishes to mums across Northern Ireland.Among them was Lord Mayor of Belfast, Kate Nicholl, who had a special message for her own mother.The Alliance councillor and her mother Helen fled Zimbabwe for a new le in Northern Ireland, and she was one of those to show her thanks for the sacrices made in starting a new le in a new country.“Sending love to all mums and those who mother — but especially to those missing their mummies today. Endlessly grateful to my own who has sacriced so much for me,” she said.Former First Minister and DUP leader Arlene Foster never misses a Mother’s Day message and, true to form, she treated her mum Georgina Kelly to a day out.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “So pleased could take mum out for lunch today on Mothering Sunday,” she said, posting a photo.And the politician who could well become the second female First Minister in Northern Ireland was celebrating her own motherhood.Sinn Fein leader Michelle O’Neill was happy to show off a tempting treat she had received of elaborately decorated cakes and buns“It would be rude not to eat them all! Happy Mother’s Day,” she said. It is, after all, a day to enjoy.Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie had been trawling through his old photo albums to select a favourite photo of his own mum.“I love this picture of my mum — she looks like she is having the best time. Happy Mother’s Day to all the mothers out there. #ConstanceEverlynBeattie,” he wrote.She may have had to work a sht on her BBC Radio Ulster show, but presenter Kerry McLean still had time for a message, thanking her daughter for a handmade gt.“A gt from my  year old. I was so touched and told her I loved it and how special it was, to which she replied, ‘Yeah, we were told we all had to make them. Everyone’s was the same’.”As always, it’s the effort and the thought that counts.Her BBC colleague, presenter and weather forecaster Barra Best, went further, posting several photos of himself out and about with his mum accompanied by the message: “Happy Mother’s Day to all the mothers out there, especially mine. Have a great day ladies!”Last week Aodhan Connolly, head of the NI Retail Consortium, was thanking his parents, tongue-in-cheek style, after winning the St Patrick’s Day Irish Beard of the Year. But he had a special message for his mother on Sunday that will resonate with many sons across Northern Ireland:“Happy Mothers’ Day to this absolute wee legend and candle lighter in chief!” he wrote. “Still the glue that holds our family together and some woman for one woman. I’m thinking of those who don’t have their mums today. Take care of yourselves today and you’ll be in our prayers.Regular columnist and political commentator Alex Kane also had a poignant message to accompany a photo, showing mothers can come in all forms.“Mother’s Day: and the wonderful Adelaide, who rescued this terried, silent, desperate-to-be-loved child from an orphanage for no other reason than she thought she could help him. She did. She never gave up. What and who I am today is entirely her handiwork. My Mum. Her boy.”Mothers mean so much to their children, and it seems especially so in Ireland.There was another poignant message from the editor of The News Letter, Ben Lowry, whose mother died a few weeks ago.“Mum once said that I always remembered Mother’s Day,” he said. “I take consolation from that, given that I had more than the odd shortcoming as a son over the decades.“This is the first such Mothering Sunday without her. To those who still have one, savour the miracle of a mum!”Related topicsArlene FosterMichelle O#NeillDoug BeattieMore On Arlene Foster PremiumSuzanne BreenOpinionWith five weeks to go until Northern Ireland election, Sinn Fein remain in pole position PremiumLucidTalk boss defends election polling as a sign of Northern Ireland becoming ‘a normal society’DUP veteran who quit after ousting of Arlene Foster ‘delighted’ to run for party in Assembly election PremiumMartin McGuinness: ‘History will judge him kinder than Gerry Adams.

Pic: Jonathan McCambridge PA WireMarch   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThe results are in from our Spring  NI ‘Tracker’ poll, and we see that Sinn Fein are still comfortably in the lead as Northern Ireland’s largest party on a projected % vote share - up a % point from our Winter poll in January.Sinn Fein have now been the lead party in all polls for some time, and so they must be really hoping that they can achieve top spot in the May  election.The DUP are up two points in second place on %, and are seven points behind Sinn Fein.The other two unionist parties have dropped a bit, with the UUP on % - down a point since our January poll, and the TUV on % . Even so, this % score is still three times more than the TUV achieved in the last NI Assembly election in .So the trend is good for the DUP with perhaps some of their regular voters who moved to the TUV ing to the fold as the Assembly election approaches.However they still have a big gap to make upthey are to catch Sinn Fein, and there’s not much time left.The SDLP are at least consistent in the polls, coming in this time at % - no change from our Winter poll in January.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up  Read MoreLucidTalk opinion poll: Sinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill nudges closer to top Stormont post as DUP lags behindThe SDLP has been showing around the %-% vote-share mark for a long time, with no real up or down movement either way. Alliance are at %, up  points, perhaps benefiting from the UUP’s small drop.About this UUP drop, it’s noteworthy that Doug Beattie’s personal ‘leader rating’ in this poll was down  points from his January poll score, which is a hefty drop.Perhaps the Twitter posts controversy has been a factor here, and interestinglythis seems to have had more of a negative impact with female voters than males.Boris Johnson had the biggest increase in our ‘leader ratings’ - up  points from his January poll-score. This reflects the national UK-wide polls with the PM benefiting from a ‘Ukraine war bounce’. However, he still remains Northern Ireland’s lowest rated political leader at minus !Now the science of opinion polling applies to modelling and forecasting NI-wide public opinion, ie projecting vote-shares – that’s what polls do, and they usually do this pretty accurately.Read MoreSuzanne Breen:OpinionWith five weeks to go until Northern Ireland election, Sinn Fein remain in pole positionJon Tonge:OpinionAlliance on course to be third biggest party in the NI ExecutiveBut, of course, what people really want to knowis how all these vote-shares would translate into seats at the Assembly election.As the political commentators will tell you, vote-shares don’t always translate neatly into NI Assembly seats.Indeed, it’s perfectly possible for the TUV to get a %-% NI-Wide vote-share in this election, and for Jim Allister to still be the only TUV MLA – although, with that NI vote-share, they would have to be a bit unlucky for that to happen. It’s all down to where, and in what constituencies, the votes come from.So for our last pre-NI Assembly election pollwe will be running  separate NI constituency polls with the named candidates and parties for each constituency, presented to each poll respondent.Basically the poll-participants will be presented with actual ballot they will see in each of their respective constituencies on election day. Then, like we do with all our polls, we will combine all this data into NI-wide political-party vote-share projections.This approach brings in some of the reality of the election, as there’s always a brand and loyalty factor with some named candidates. We used this approach in our very last pre- UK general election poll, and we believe it was one of the factors that allowed us to forecast that election to within %. We will seeit works as well again – we hope it does!Bill White is managing director of Belfast polling and market research company LucidTalkRelated topicsNorthern Ireland AssemblySinn FéinUlster Unionist PartyAlliance PartyTraditional Unionist VoiceSDLPLucidTalk pollMore On Northern Ireland AssemblySDLP’s Colum Eastwood leaves opposition ‘on the table’ depending on negotiations following Stormont Assembly Election PremiumSam McBrideOpinionWhy we all may be paying more for electricity thanks to Stormont failures and a little-known monopoly company PremiumLindy McDowellOpinionHow do you say ‘farcical waste of money’ in Irish and or Ulster Scots  PremiumAlex KaneOpinionUnionism remains as ided in  as it was in , now it might be too late to do things dferentlyStormont department criticised for building Derry park-and-ride which breaches planning rulesMost ReadFormer Northern Ireland Tory on upskirting and indecent child images charges‘Suits him’: Van Morrison applauded for weight loss winDodgy east Belfast botox beautician must pay back £kSam McBrideOpinionDUP’s future looks increasingly grim… now party must hope damage it has done to the union is not irreparableTesco manager pleads guilty to £, fraudTop Videos\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming eb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdc-b---bfa_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming eb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdc-b---bfa_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayWill Smith appears to hit Chris Rock on Oscars stage after gag about we Jada\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming bd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_adf-c-ea-c-bdd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming bd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_adf-c-ea-c-bdd_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlaySir Kenneth Branagh makes red carpetat star-studded Oscar ceremonyPlayAnalysis: Sinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill nudges closer to top Stormont postLatest Northern Ireland Assembly elections Unionists more worried about NI Protocol than living costs, reveals LucidTalk pollJon TongeOpinionAlliance on course to be third biggest party in the NI ExecutiveSuzanne BreenOpinionWith five weeks to go until Northern Ireland election, Sinn Fein remain in pole positionLucidTalk opinion poll: Sinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill nudges closer to top Stormont post as DUP lags behindLucidTalk boss defends election polling as a sign of Northern Ireland becoming ‘a normal society’LatestIrish League takeaways: Linfield prove winning late is simply Devine, Crusaders on Cup charge and Ballymena aren#t singing the bluesWhy Northern Ireland has much to owe Ashfield High School for their continued production of international quality playersJamie-Lee O’Donnell took Christmas jobs to pay bills after Derry GirlsLicence to roam: How a campervan adventure to the Sahara turned into a booming staycation businessWarning dissidents are ‘regrouping’ as terror threat is lowered,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This is simply not fair on local families.Mr McGrath said a pattern was emerging whereby motorists in Newcastle sped along the Shimna Road from Donard Park and made their way up the Castlewellan Road.He urged police to get to grips with the issue to ensure people who live locally are no longer subjected to such behaviour.Cllr Devlin said the ldquoselfish actions of some drivers were not fair on residents, insisting that she and Mr McGrath will support those affected by the issue any way they can.ldquoWe shall be requesting a speed assessment of the area and asking police to consider monitoring any adverse behaviour, she confirmed.ldquoWe would appeal to local familiesthey do witness any reckless behaviour on the roads that could endanger lives to report it to police so they can gather all the necessary data..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch Camera Club competition in memory of Charlie  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH Camera Club members welcomed Vitorrio Silvestri, from CPA Camera Club, last Thursday night to judge the entries which had been submitted for the annual Charlie Rutledge Memorial competition.Charlie was a much loved and respected founding member of Ballynahinch Camera Club and his great passion was mono photography.After Charlie passed away in  it was decided to hold a competition each year in his memory and what other genre of photographs could such a competition attract but black and white Vitorrio gave a critique on each image and, in some cases, demonstrated how they could be improved.

The Ballynahinch scheme represents excellent value for money and should have been prioritised during the past two years.Mr Hazzard said more than poundbn of capital resources has been spent by the roads minister and her department during the letime of the current Assembly.ldquoIt is hugely disappointing that a small, yet strategically important scheme, such as the Ballynahinch bypass has been left on the shelf. In light of the economic impact of Covid- and the ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the commencement of this scheme would have been a welcome step towards improving both our local economy and the wellbeing of the local community, said the MP.Mr Hazzard added: ldquoWe can only hope now that when the Executive is restored after Mayrsquos election, that the local community can have a minister in place who recognises the value of the Ballynahinch bypass and finally begins construction.Mr Casement said the bypass could help kick-start the economic regeneration of the town and provide the wider South Down tourism economy with a signicant boost. He said it was vital a start date for construction work is confirmed as soon as possible.A key member of Ballynahinchrsquos Regeneration Committee for many years alongside the late Vincent Fullam, Mr Casement has never given up the battle to secure a bypass, which was first mooted in the late s.ldquoThe bypass is included in a list of strategic projects and is effectively ready to proceed. There should be no more delays. The scheme should have been delivered years ago, he declared.ldquoWhile the primary focus of the bypass is on easing traffic congestion, there are many other benefits, including reduced town centre pollution.Mr Casement added: ldquoThe new road scheme will also dissuade drivers from using built-up housing areas and rural roads as unofficial bypasses and, most importantly, help kick-start the economic regeneration of Ballynahinch town centre. We need to see work starting on the scheme now.A Department for Infrastructure spokesman said it was committed to delivering the bypass as part of a plan to aid economic recovery and community transformation, while addressing regional imbalance.He said that ldquofar from being left on the shelf, the scheme was being actively progressed much further by Ms Mallon than any other minister, with development work now substantively complete and statutory approvals finalised in July last year.ldquoThe next stage would involve commencing the procurement of a contractor but progression to procurement and construction is dependent upon the level of funding made available to the Department in future budgets, he explained.ldquoThe Departmentrsquos bid for the - budget included funds to deliver this scheme, however, the absence of an Executive means there is no agreed budget which means that delivery timescales remain uncertain.The spokesman added: ldquoThis is a priority for our Minister who remains frustrated that once again the absence of an Executive is negatively affecting both the people of Northern Ireland and our infrastructure..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Carryduff landowner helps the environment with trees  ","story":"CARRYDUFF landowner Rosanna Ballentine and her son Iain have received  trees to plant on their farm to help them enhance bioersity and create a habitat for wildle.The trees have been supplied from a partnership between Trees on the Land ndash a charity and not-for-profit project from the Green Economy Foundation ndash and SuperValu and Centra, part of the Musgrave Group.The project is part of a sustainability initiative from the retail brands which recently announced they will plant , trees across Northern Ireland over ten years.Mrs Ballentine welcomed the initiative and the assistance of SuperValu and Centra staff, along with central colleagues from Musgrave NI, who pulled on their wellies and visited the farm to help plant a mix of hawthorn, oak, birch, rowan and hazel trees.She said: ldquoWe are planting a new native hedgerow and a line of trees along the edge of an existing woodland to ide it from an adjoining agricultural grassland.

crowned Bobby Dalzell Cup champions after defeating local rivals Ardglass in the deciding penalty shoot-out at Meadowvale last Thursday.A goal on the stroke of half-time from Ardglass midfielder Stephen Deegan was cancelled out on  minutes by the close range effort of Celtic striker Jordan McCoubrey.The teams refused to be split in extra-time and following the shoot-out mdash which went well into the sudden death stages mdash Blaine Connolly converted the all-important spot kick to gt his Hoopsrsquo side the victory.A large crowd turned out in Drumaness for the St Patrickrsquos Day showpiece between the current first and second-placed sides in the Newcastle Leaguersquos Premier Division.Adding to the pressure of the occasion was the alternating weather conditions, with the teams contesting the final in periods of sunshine as well as wind and rain.Nevertheless, Celtic kicked off the affair with the blustery conditions heavily in favour of their opponents.It didnrsquot take long for the tone of the match to be set as Ardglass defender Caolain OrsquoShea launched a very physical tackle on Hoops striker Jay Gibney.Ardglass enjoyed early momentum with experienced defender Neil Teggart seeing his wind-assisted free kick from his own half trouble Celtic custodian Nathan Curran less than ten minutes in.Celtic remained calm and soon strung their passes together through clever one touch football with eventual man of the match winner Conor Doherty in the thick of these sequences.However, Ardglass remained a threat and came close when Teggart clipped a cross into the danger area, although striker Michael Magee glanced his header wide.Stand-in Celtic captain Shaun Megahey attempted to play a through ball to team-mate Gibney, but on this occasion the Ardglass defence timed the offside trap perfectly.Celtic did come close when Barry Treacyrsquos corner kick was fumbled by Ardglass lsquokeeper, Mark Armstrong, although Hoops defender Paul Brady couldnrsquot dispatch the ball quickly enough before the danger was cleared.OrsquoShea continued his earlier eagerness and picked up a yellow card for a mistimed tackle before his team-mate, Magee, was unfairly clattered at the other end of the pitch, although Teggartrsquos effort flew past the wrong side of the post.Teggart continued to be a problem from set pieces as his free-kick delivery whisked past the head of striker Magee and out of bounds.Moments later, Mageersquos misfortune continued when he was shown a yellow card for expressing his disagreement with referee, Barry Mullan.After initially allowing the match to flow freely, referee Mullan clamped down on his decisions with less than ten minutes to the end of the opening half.Celtic defender Gary Carberry was the latest to enter the book for a late challenge on Ardglass marksman Magee.Despite this hiccup, Celticrsquos Carberry kept himself in contention for the man of the match accolade after he proved pivotal in stopping potential goalscoring chances from the Ardglass opposition on numerous occasions.As the half-time whistle approached, Celtic arms were raised as they appealed for the red card to be shown to Ardglassrsquos OrsquoShea, who may have considered himself lucky to escape an early bath after he was second to the ball.Ardglass launched another attack and it looked asMagee would have a free route to goal. However, Celtic veteran Brady recovered valiantly to prove he still has plenty of miles left in his tank.With the last attack of the half, Ardglass were awarded a corner and they took full advantage of their opportunity. Midfielder, Stephen Deegan, climbed high above the rest to head his effort beyond the outstretched hand of Celtic lsquokeeper Curran to open the scoring.As the second half kicked off it was evident that both sides would refrain from going for broke. A lot of the following ten minutes contained attacks, although both sides lacked a killer instinct and the match was heavily contested in the middle of the pitch.This is where Conor Doherty earned his post-match award for his performance, as he often won the midfield battle.Goal-scorer Deegan picked up a yellow as the weather took yet another turn for the worse.Celtic joint-managers Jason Galbraith and Matthew McKenna made the first of their substitutions as the clock struck the hour mark with Sean McMahon entering the fray in place of Conaill Kerr.Ardglass opted to put  men behind the ball in order to frustrate the opposition and waited patiently for their opportunity to counter-attack.Ardglass made changes of their own in the form of Jordan Finnegan before Celtic made a second substitute with the talented Sean Ferris making his way onto the pitch.Ferris made an immediate impact, adding another string to Celticrsquos bow by spreading inviting passes into his forward line.With just  minutes left of the , these Celtic substitutions came to fruition after the ball found its way to McMahon, who lofted an inviting ball into the Ardglass box which was steered home by the boot of striker McCoubrey.Celtic continued to mix things up as Corey McCartan made his way onto the pitch and gave a good account of himself with his tireless work rate.Despite this period of succession for the Hoops, the remaining minutes of the  played out finely balanced.Ardglass never let their headsand should be commended for their effort as they cancelled out any further attack whilst continuously seeking the crucial next goal.As tempers flared, the final whistle sounded and both teams prepared for extra-time.The highlights of the first half of extra-time came in the form of Celticrsquos Treacy picking up a yellow card before team-mate Ferris crashed his left-footed effort off the crossbar.During the next interval, both of Ardglassrsquo Magee and Celticrsquos Ferris threatened but they couldnrsquot do enough to get the ball over the line and it would be penalties that would decide the final outcome.Amongst the numerous penalties which took place, both Celtic and Ardglass players were ordered to retake their spot kicks.Firstly, Celtic striker McCoubrey saw his effort denied by Armstrong before referee Mullan blew his whistle after adjudging the Ardglass custodian to be off his line as the penalty was taken.McCoubrey fired in the retake and it wouldnrsquot be long before Ardglass substitute Finnegan would go through a similar course of events after he missed his initial penalty but converted at the second time of asking.Eventually, as the penalties progressed well into sudden death, Celticrsquos Blaine Connolly remained calm and converted the deciding spot kick to send the Hoopsrsquo support into delirium as his side were crowned champions.Following the conclusion, man of the match Conor Doherty gave his thoughts on his sidersquos victory.ldquoI thought we were the better team in the first half but then they snuck a goal before half-time, he said.ldquoBut, even with the wind we started to press on, it was a long  minutes.ldquoIt was a hard hitting game but Irsquom just glad we got on the winning side of it.He added: ldquoAll the penalties were top class, it was a really good shootout.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey , B Connolly, P Brady, G Carberry, C

After a briefto live in the south of England, Pat eventually settled in New Zealand where he spent the rest of his le.Patrsquos landscape photography is stunning and his portraits of local people are without parallel mdash they reveal a strong sense of place, identity and the character of the people.Particularly important is that most of the people have been identied.The photographs were mostly taken in the s and s, but since then the world has changed in many ways. Some of the landscapes may look the same, but buildings have gone, farming le is radically dferent and the fishing industry decimated.Cecil Newman grew up in Belfast, but from a young age enjoyed hiking and youth hostelling. He studied engineering at Queenrsquos University and joined the Royal Engineers during World War II.Whilst working in Berlin after the war to help with the processes of reconstruction, Cecil took some striking photographs of the devastated city. Some of these images were later given to the Berlin City Museum.After the war Cecil ed to work as surveyor for Belfast City Council and later as a planner in the Northern Ireland Civil Service. Amongst the many high-profile projects with which he was involved were the first Newry Area Plan and the Mourne Study. Both these publications included his photographs.During the s he concentrated particularly on aerial photographs. He was a leading member of the Ulster Society for the Preservation of the Countryside and Mournes Advisory Council, often giving talks illustrated with his photographs and slides. After his death the Ulster Society for the Preservation of the Countryside erected a memorial in his honour at Trassey car park in the Mournes.Photographs taken by him which are now in the Down County Museum collection reflect both his work and passion for the Mournes. An outstanding feature of Cecilrsquos photographs is that they were accompanied by date and Ordnance Survey map grid reference mdash what curator could ask for more The importance of these two photographic collections is that they complement each other, in covering the same geographical area, but taken for dferent purposes and at dferent times.The number of images represented is smaller than the DJ McNeill archive so it was possible for the museumrsquos curatorial staff to catalogue them all and the Museum Photographer to digitise them.What remains to be done is adding the images and full information to the Museumrsquos database and more to the website. There are always more jobs to be carried out on the collection.However, using the images effectively, and in the way the Hudson and Newman families, and indeed all other donors, wished, requires wide knowledge of all the collections by experienced and qualied professional staff working with them on a daily basis.The photographic archive is recognised as one of the most important in Ireland and contains a wide range of images, including daguerrotypes, glass negative plates, lantern slides, black and white and colour film, transparencies as well as digital images.Understanding of all the processes involved in their making is essential to how they are cared for and used.Lesley Simpson is secretary of the Friends of Down County Museum and former Keeper of Collections at the museum..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Success at Downpatrick  ","story":"PRIOR to Sundayrsquos Randox Ulster National Handicap Chase meeting at Downpatrick Racecourse, manager Richard Lyttle stated that he was looking forward to welcoming racegoers back to the track for the first time in three years.They certainly turned up with car parks filled to capacity, packed enclosures and long tailbacks on the Ballydugan Road prior to the first race.The Randox Ulster National has been the local tracks major race of the year now for many years and the maximum  runners faced the starter for the three mile four furlong race that sees prize money paid right down to the first six past the post.A bit like the big Aintree race, there was plenty of fallers with two coming down at the very first fence and Envoi Pierji then unseating Donegal jockey Conor Orr, who had ridden Screaming Colours to success for Bill Durkan in the Midlands National at Uttoxeter the previous day.Later in the race there was more fallers at the regulation fence.With two fences to be taken the race involved four runners with the  winner Amaulino travelling like the winner under David McGrath.But this combination then faded, eventually finishing fourth for Co Armagh trainer Keith Watson.The eventual winner in the famous J P McManus Silks proved to be Spades Are Trumps, ridden by Cheltenham winning jockey Mark McDonagh, a lb claimer.Finishing second was Agent Born, ridden by Darragh OrsquoKeefe with Peaches and Cream third.Co Meath trainer Gavin Cromwell, who also had success at Cheltenham, saddled the winner and also the third past the post.

They were used as a commercial rabbit warren when John De Courcy arrived and built Dundrum Castle in .The lucrative trade in rabbit pelts continued for centuries afterwards. Rabbits are still common today, although the population was decimated by the myxomatosis disease in the s.The s was also when the National Trust began managing the habitat on behalf of its owners, the Hill family mdash commonly known as the Marquises of Downshire.The Hill family came to the area in the late th century but had lived in Ireland since the late s, when a young army officer named Moyses Hill, originally from Devon, was posted to Carrickfergus garrison in  to command forces sent by Elizabeth I to subdue the rebellious OrsquoNeill clan and colonise Ireland.Moyses ended up staying in Ireland and marrying the sister of a local clan chief. In , he was granted land at Cromlyn, an area which later took his surname and became known as Hillsborough. His descendants then acquired Murlough in  and began using Murlough Farm as their summer residence.They built Murlough House in , which still stands today at the end of Keel Point mdash at the northern end of the beach. While built to have a spectacular sea view, stormy weather kept breaking the windows, so trees were planted around the house in , and the woodland remains to this day.In , the th Marquis of Downshire, Arthur Hill, sold the surrounding land to the National Trust and then sold the house in . The area became Irelandrsquos first nature reserve in  and remains the most extensive dune heath in Ireland .But prior to being sold to the National Trust, Murlough House and the dunes were a hotbed of military activity ndash particularly during WWII. The house was a base for the US Armyrsquos st Armoured Division and the th Tank Destroyer Battalion.They built several firing ranges in the dunes, including, allegedly, a mortar range. Spare bombers and fighters were also hidden there as Murlough Farm had its own landing strip, called lsquo Satellite Landing Groundrsquo .Murlough beach itself was dotted with anti-aircraft and anti-invasion posts mdash whose rotting remnants are still visible today. They were dug-in when a full-scale German invasion was a threat in the early s.They were part of a counter-invasion strategy that centred on slowing or stopping the enemy at certain locations until other forces could be mustered and deployed. This involved constructing a so-called lsquocoastal crustrsquo along beaches and inland lsquostop-linesrsquo along rivers, canals and high ground.With Northern Ireland being prime invasion territory, a coastal crust was set up from Magilligan in the north-west to Newcastle in the south-east, alongside an inland stop-line along the route of the River Bann. Anti-aircraft landing posts, like those at Murlough, were important in preventing aircraft or boats from landing, but another type of defence was the centrepiece of this strategy: pillboxes.When events at Dunkirk in  sparked invasion panic, the Directorate of Fortications and Works at the War Office was created to construct defensive systems around the UKrsquos beaches. The Royal Engineers and civilian contractors erected over , pillboxes by in a matter of days ndash including on eight of Northern Irelandrsquos beaches.Such structures can still be seen at Magilligan, Portrush and Portstewart. County Down also has intact examples in Bangor, Donaghadee and on the Strangford shore between Comber and Newtownards. Beaches at Minerstown and Tyrella also had multiple pillboxes, as did Murlough. They were spaced to have interlocking arcs of fire, so invaders had little unchallenged space in which to land.One of these pillboxes is still visible in Newcastle, on the beach just below the outdoor swimming pool. The remnants of the other are still visible at the northern end of Murlough, next to the inlet that feeds Dundrum Bay. Yet all that is left are large slabs of reinforced concrete as this pillbox was supposedly destroyed in the early days of the Troubles to prevent it being used to attack the nearby Ballykinlar Army Camp.But these remains are now also under attack from erosion. They are gradually being absorbed by the sea. With this stretch of coastline losing five to ten metres of coastline a year, the remnants of the pillbox, originally built at an elevated height in the dunes, is even starting to be submerged at high tide.What was once a reflection of an indominable spirit is now an unassuming pile of rubble used only as a seat for resting walkers ndash most of whom are unaware of its history. Soon, it will be completely forgotten and the only reminder of this stretch of coastlinersquos rich military history will be the occasional washed-up ordnance.Ben Acheson spent seven years deployed to Afghanistan, including stints as Director of NATOrsquos political team and as Political Adviser to the EU Special Representative.

But with even Australia, for example, having considered jettisoning this link over the decades, it is hardly surprisingcountries that once experienced slavery and codied, racially segregated rule do so too.The Duke of Cambridge realises that local populations will not take lectures on their future status from British leaders, least of all a young royal. Yet this tour, as royal tours typically do, showed that there is still a deep affection for that same monarchy in much of the world.Longer term, it is the future of the Commonwealth of Nations that matters more than the retention of the Queenas head of state in places that might sever that arrangement regardless. The association is a reflection of the huge soft power that the UK has — its cultural reach, and the links to countries around the globe.Even states that have bruising memories of empire usually recognise the upsides of the former British presence, in terms of aspects of government such as parliamentary democracy and civil administration.It was sad to learn recently of a poll that showed,anything, a diminishing appetite in the Republic of Ireland to join the Commonwealth.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Such dedication is a hallmark of the Northern Ireland football captain’s career and has led her to making history with her squad as they head to the Women’s Euro  finals. But ahead of Mother’s Day she also has an inspiring, important message for the next generation of female sporting stars - being both mother and top athlete is possible.Marissa said: “It’s so important for women in sport to know thatthey want to have kids it can happen. That women do believe it is possible to have kids and have a career in sport.”   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

On our team we have Sarah McFadden, and she has a wee girl Harper, . She came back and played an international match three months after she gave birth. “It’s raising the awareness and telling the stories that it is possible so we can inspire the next generation of women in sport.”Growing up in west Belfast in a time when an international women’s football side wasn’t even in existence, never mind a possibility, it’s little wonder the passionate player has become a role model for women in sport and for the next generation of female athletes.“I do take pride in inspiring the next generation of girls coming up,” said Marissa.“Football has given me so much in my journey, I love to show young girls that it’s a great sport to be in. But not just football but any sport – the le lessons you learn – you can’t put a price on it. “Football’s my passion and I just want to let young girls know that football is great for your mental and physical health. I don’t know where I would be without it.”However, despite great strides being made in sport the statistics show there is still work to do. A signicant gap between men and women taking part in sport still exists, with women less likely to have taken part in sport at least once within the last year, %, than men, %. Unfortunately, according to Sport NI figures this gap gets wider on our sidelines with women representing just .% of the overall sports coaching workforce in Northern Ireland and this dropping to just % for those who coach our World, Olympic or Paralympic medallists.To help close this gap Sport NI recently launched their Women In Sport Panel that sees women from dferent sporting backgrounds offering their expertise on how to overcome barriers and create more opportunities for women and girls at all levels of sport.Marissa believes that listening to women and funding in sport are key factors in closing the gap.“It’s so important to listen to women from all levels of sport to be able to improve experiences and see what we can do better. This  also gives visibility to women who are in sport, coaching, leadership, and governance levels. That is so very important for females to see these real-le scenarios and see that it’s possible to achieve these roles.”Marissa points to Angela Platt, Irish Football AssociationDirector of Women’s Football and Women In Sport Panel member, as an inspiring example.“It is very powerful to have a female in the director’s role and to have that role created for the first time, especially as football is still very male dominated,” she said.The Cltonville player coach, who is mum to Quinn, , seems to have found the enviable balance between family le and her job on the pitch. She’s quick to credit her supportive partner Paula and the recent funding from the IFA, sponsors, and the Department for Communitiesfor helping make that work – le balance happen.“In January we got fully funded to train professionally. So those who were working fulltime got put on secondment and are training up at Newforgefulltime,” she explained.It means that Marissa’s job as the IFA’s Girls’ Participation Officer has been put on hold until September, after the World Cup qualiers next month and the Euros in July. “That has been a massive gamechanger for me.”Not only is it allowing Marissa, and the rest of the women’s international team to concentrate on their game, but for the captain she’s getting precious time with her little boy.“I’m able to drop him off and pick him up at creche. We get home, make dinner and have normal family le. Whereas before we got the investment to go fulltime you were working in your day job and were out most evenings. My partner was doing an awful lot whereas now it’s nice to have that family time. “I’m fortunate to have a supportive partner there who understands what it means to play at this level. Obviously, we go away a lot so that can be tough. “But at the same time, I know that I do it for the love of the game – it’s my thing. For our Quinn, I just think it will be amazing for him to look back on. I know he’s only two now but at least I’ll have a great story to tell him. It’s better for him to believe he can do anything.“We as the women’s international team have made our dreams come true in what we have achieved. I think it’s important for him to see his mum achieve what we have achieved and hopefully that will inspire him when he’s older.”As Quinn chats away in the background Marissa reveals he’s already showing some promise with his feet.“Quinn loves football. We have footballs of all sizes and shapes here. He’s ‘mama football’ and we play away. He does associate football with me so when football is on TV, he’s ‘mama, mama.’”As for now Marissa is the first to admit she’s “living the dream”.She has the Euros to look forward to and the World Cup qualiers coming up against Austria, April , and England, April .“We’re solely focused on getting into that squad and getting the squad prepared for those big games. They’re two unbelievable sides and two massive games so we have to make sure we’re fully ready for it,” she added.“The momentum we’ve built here within the women’s game here is incredible. If you look back three years ago, we would have had maybe  people watching us play. Obviously off the back of our success and qualying for the Euros there are over , tickets sold for the England game at Windsor. “It’s really hard to believe. I definitely think it’ll be an emotional day when we’re there at Windsor with that many fans.“There’s a lot to look forward to.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

It will still be available to support the small group for whom it is recommended for clinical reasons. The PCR home ordering service will remain available for the general public to support those for whom PCR is recommended.– Publicly accessible Covid- testing sites will close.

A plan to redevelop the venue into a ,-capacity stadium has been beset by delay and controversy.The contents of the letter provoked a backlash from other executive parties, including UUP MLA Mike Nesbitt who claimed Mr Lyons was acting prematurely in discounting support for the bid, and Sinn Fein’s John Finucane who said a “can do attitude” was needed.However, a Department for Economy spokesperson later told the News Letter that “departmental officials remain involved in the process,” and added: “The Minister fully supports our involvement in any bid, but, as Northern Ireland enters the pre-election period it will be for a new Executive to formally agree our participations.“While there are clearly obstacles in place at the moment, the Minister is confident these can be overcome.” Gordon LyonsNorthern IrelandIrelandDUPGAA  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularMothers Day : When is Mother’s Day  Why is the date dferent in the UK and why does it change every year Jamie Bryson rejects idea of cutting funding to UVF-linked groups after Simon Coveney security alertNorthern Ireland weather forecast: Hope you made the most of the weekend sun - snow could be on the wayWATCH: Crowd cheers for the destruction of the  Belfast Agreement at loyalist rallyUVF row: ‘Ignoring peaceful protests undermines loyalist leaders’ says LCC after Simon Coveney security alertMost PopularBeautul bouquets for Mother’s Day UK : the best flowers to have delivered to mum for Mothering Sunday best weighted blankets  for adults and kids: from Argos, Amazon, Wayfair and LakelandBike helmets UK : Eight best cycling helmets for womenRod Stewart tour : when tickets go on sale for extra UK dates - including London, Glasgow and BirminghamBest patio heaters UK : weatherproof electric heaters and coal firepits, from Made, Wayfair, Conran                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

But the point is we don’t want to take that option. We want to be in government,” Mr Eastwood said.The Foyle MP was speaking after he used his party’s spring conference this week to slam the record of the DUP and Sinn Fein in the Stormont ExecutiveHe told the BBC yesterday that the Northern Ireland Protocol, opposition to which led the DUP to pull out of the Executive earlier this year, was not a priority for most voters.“When I speak to people – and we’ve been knocking doors for months and I think we’re very plugged in to the community – what people are telling me is that they’re absolutely petried about the rising costs of fuel, food.“They can’t even heat their homes.“These are people who are out working every single day, have no ability to heat their homes, are worried about the food on the table for their children.”But Mr Eastwood was also quizzed about his own leadership since , during which time the party has failed to fully revive its electoral fortunes.Polls do not suggest any major boost in support for the party ahead of the election in little over a month’s tine.He pointed to the successes of his leadership, including ing two MPs to Westminster in the  general election with sizeable majorities.“I think any objective analysis shows the SDLP has stabilised on the leadership and will grow again in this election.“I don’t frankly care what a poll says. I only care what elections say because whatever you might think, whatever I might think, in that election you’ll have one vote, I’ll have one vote and everybody  will have one vote.”“People watching this TV programme aren’t interested in how many votes somebody got in .“What I want to talk about is people and the concerns that people have.”Mr Eastwood was also asked about his party’s relationship with Fianna Fail and the current status of a partnership agreement agreed between the two parties in .“This has been a policy partnership that has been about trying to change people’s lives. And let me give you the evidence of what has happened as a result of that. There’s € billion in a bank account in Dublin to be spent by the Shared Island Unit.“That was done as a result of the conversations I had with Micheal Martin.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityMr Drakeford was speaking while defending the news that compulsory mask-wearing in shops and on public transport in Wales will end on Monday - despite cases rising due to a new iant of the virus.During a press conference this lunchtime, Mr Drakeford said that, while people will no longer be legally required to wear masks on public transport or in retail settings from Monday, the Welsh Governments ‘strong advice’ would be to continue to wear them.He also confirmed that from the same date, there will be no legal requirement to self-isolate after testing positive for the virus, and issued the same ‘strong advice’ that people should do it.He said to help with people continuing to isolate, the £ isolation payment for families on low incomes would remain in place until June and that free lateral flow testing for people who think they have symptoms will also remain available.When askednow was the right time to do this considering the increase in cases relating to the BA strain of covid – which Mr Drakeford called “more transmissible than the omicron iant” – the first minister responded that it had previously been planned to end all restrictions in this weeks review, but he and his cabinet felt they were unable to do so due to the increase in cases.He likened the move to other viruses including measles.“We have to manage it like we would other conditions,\" he said. \"If you have measles, you wouldn’t go to work with it. That’s not law, it’s what is right.”He also called on the public to be sensible and use what they have learnt over the past two years. Mr Drakeford said: “For a disease that is moving from being pandemic to endemic, the public response has to move as well.“Because the cases are higher than expected, we are not able to move beyond that place and that is why we have not fully removed the restrictions..remove“People are able to do the right thing from their experience of two years of the virus and our strong advice as well.”MORE NEWS:Mr Drakeford also highlighted how, unlike in Wales, it was never a legal requirement to self-isolate after a positive covid test in Scotland, and yet isolation levels were not reported to be lower compared to other nations.He also urged employers to not force their staff into workthey test positive after the self-isolation period ends.“No employer should put their staff in that position,\" he said. \"They shouldn’t do it for all the public health reasons, but they shouldn’t do it for their business either.”He continued: “If you force an employee to go in, all that will happen is more people will get infected and then the business will be infected and affected.”What are the changes From Monday, March , it will not be a legal requirement to wear masks on public transport and in retail settings, although it is still strongly advised.From the same date, it will not be a legal requirement to self-isolate after testing positive, but again it is strongly advised.The £ isolation payment for low-income families will continue until June. It is hoped that this will continue furtherit is needed and the funds from the UK government allow.Free lateral flow tests will be available in Wales until around June but it is hoped they will be available longer depending on UK government funding.You must still wear a mask in all health and social care settings unless exempt.Businesses must continue to carry out risk assessments and implement measures to prevent covid spreading as much as possible.Bosses should not force employees who have tested positive for covid to go into work.Teachers, staff and secondary school pupils should wear continue to wear masks for the rest of the term.The next review will take place on Thursday, April . article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

What we’ve done as a team, with Rajeev, to be number one in the team rankings as well now, it’s pretty special.”Confirmation of Salisbury’s new status came after he and Ram defeated Feliciano Lopez and Stefanos Tsitsipas, while current incumbent Mate Pavic was beaten with his partner Nikola Mektic. vw,vw,px, px\"Britain’s Paul Jubb won his first Challenger title in Bolivia Salisbury and Ram have established themselves as one of the best doubles pairings over the past three seasons, winning six titles, including the  Australian Open and the US Open last summer.Last season was their most successful yet, with runner-up finishes at the Australian Open and the ATP Finals as well as a first Masters title in Canada, while Salisbury also won mixed doubles titles at the French Open and US Open.Meanwhile, the positive signs in British tennis continued with a first title on the second-tier Challenger tour for -year-old Paul Jubb from Hull, who triumphed on clay in Bolivia..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Joe Salisbury climbs to world number one by reaching doubles quarters in Miami article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe new study, from experts at the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, found that girls experience a negative link between social media use and le satisfaction when they are aged  to , while for boys this happens when they are older, at -.Researchers said the dferences may be down to changes in the structure of the brain, or due to puberty, which occurs later in boys than in girls.The study also found that increased social media use was linked to lower le satisfaction at the age of , while the link was not statistically signicant at other ages.Teenagers using more social media at  and experiencing lower levels of le satisfaction may be vulnerable due to changes at this age, such as leaving home or starting work, the study suggested.Rates of mental health conditions among children have been rising in the UK, with some experts saying social media use is linked to increasing anxiety and depression.For the new study, published in Nature Communications, experts analysed two UK datasets. These included , people aged  to  who were tracked over a period of time.The study further found that teenagers who had a lower-than-average le satisfaction also tended to have higher social media use one year later.Sarah-Jayne Blakemore, professor of psychology at the University of Cambridge, said adolescence is a “period of transition, both in terms of biology – things like hormones and the brain – but also psychologically.”She added: “We change a huge amount in terms of our cognitive abilities and our social cognition, our social awareness, and our emotion processing during adolescence.“The social worldchanges a huge amount in adolescence. We go from little primary schools to big secondary schools, we have a huge number of new people we have to interact with, peers take on heightened importance in adolescence, and young people have to work out where they are in the complex and changing social hierarchy..remove“This is a really vulnerable period of le already, and social media comes in and kind of amplies that.”Prof Blakemore said social media “is complex” and can be a force for good, such as helping young people maintain social contact during the Covid pandemic.“On the other hand, there are also negative aspects of social media, where the content of social media can be negative,” she said.“Whether it’s pornography, or things like graphic images of war that you can’t get away from as soon as you turn on your phone at the moment.“There’s also things like sleep. It’s not just about what people are doing with social media, but also when.“Young people’s lives are so full during the day of school, and then after-school activities, that the one time they have to communicate with their friends, to check out their social media, is often in the evening quite late at night.“We know that sleep is so crucial for wellbeing and mood and cognitive development in adolescence. So depriving adolescents of sleep because of their social media use is going to be a negative thing.”Askedthere is a message for parents, Prof Blakemore said there is a need to educate young people “about what they are inevitably going to see on their phones via social media”.She added: “Whether it’s things like social exclusion, not being invited to a party from someone in their class, or images that could upset them, or social pressure,educating them really as young as possible about what they might be exposed to on social media and how they should handle that.”Dr Amy Orben, from the University of Cambridge, who led the study, said: “The link between social media use and mental wellbeing is clearly very complex.“Changes within our bodies, such as brain development and puberty, and in our social circumstances appear to make us vulnerable at particular times of our lives.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title:  uParents should talk to children about social media at a young age u article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe minister said Russia, with its  million barrels of oil a day, is an important member of the global Opec+ energy alliance.Suhail al-Mazrouei said: “And leaving the politics aside, that volume is needed today.“Unless someone is willing to come and bring  million barrels, we don’t see that someone can substitute Russia.”Led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, the alliance has the capacity to increase oil output and bring down crude prices that have soared past  dollars a barrel.The United States, European nations, Japan and others have been calling on Gulf Arab oil producers to do more to help bring down prices.Prime Minister Boris Johnson paid an in-person visit this month to the UAE and Saudi Arabia, where he raised the issue.Mr al-Mazrouei described the Opec+ alliance as one that is here to stay and shot down any suggestion that the UAE would strike out on its own and increase production unilaterally. vw,vw,px, px\"Suhail al-Mazrouei doubled down on an oil alliance with Russia “Staying together, staying focused, and not allowing politics to kick in to this organisation … we always believe that whatever we do as countries when it comes to production and to this work, it needs always to stay out of politics,” Mr al-Mazrouei added.The Opec+ alliance has stuck with their plan for gradual oil production increases based on a deal struck during the height of the coronavirus pandemic lockdowns when producers made deep cuts to output to make up for plummeting demand for fuel.Higher oil prices have been good for oil producing economies.Despite efforts at ersication, Gulf Arab states continue to rely heavily on energy exports to fuel their economies.Mr al-Mazrouei also used his speech at the Atlantic Council’s Global Energy Forum in Dubai to press for greater investment in oil and gas, even as his country moves toward cutting emissions within the UAE’s borders and commits to its pledge of net-zero by ..removeIn apparent criticism of Nato policy, the minister said Russia’s war in Ukraine – which he described as a crisis – needs diplomacy to be resolved and “not by pouring more weapons into the situation, because basically the people are going to be the victim”.Prices have also risen as Saudi Arabia, Opec’s largest oil producer, faces continued cross-border attacks by neighbouring Yemen’s Houthi rebels who have used drones and missiles to target the kingdom’s oil facilities.Saudi Arabia has said it will not bear any responsibility for any shortage in oil supplies due to the attacks.Despite US condemnation of the Houthis and a US-supplied anti-missile systems for Saudi Arabia, relations between the US administration and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman remain tense and there has been no direct call between the two since Joe Biden took office.“We’ve been living in a roller coaster, seeing the prices going up and down,” Mr al-Mazrouei acknowledged.He gave no indication that Opec producers plan to change course, but noted that “we are in an environment where everyone is saying, ‘raise your production’.“We definitely at this time need all available resources,” he added, slamming efforts to pull back from investments in oil and gas..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: UAE energy chief doubles down on Opec alliance with Russia article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityWith Wales awaiting the winners of the delayed Scotland-Ukraine semi-final, probably in June, this fixture has been arranged at short notice and will raise funds for war-torn Ukraine.Here, the PA news agency looks at the main talking points surrounding the Cardf City Stadium friendly.Bale breather  vw,vw,px, px\"Gareth Bale scored twice in Wales’ World Cup play-off semi-final victory over Austria Gareth Bale has dominated the Wales headlines on and off the pitch this week. The Real Madrid forward went into the Austria clash with doubts over his fitness and criticism from Spanish media ringing in his ears. Bale responded with a brilliant brace that leaves Wales one win away from their first World Cup for  years. The Wales captain then went on the warpath, hitting back at a Spanish newspaper column which had described him as a “parasite” and saying he wants to use his profile to “change the way we publicly talk and criticise people”. Bale could probably do with a quiet night, and may get one ahead of histo Madrid by starting on the bench.Hennessey hundred💯 incoming#TogetherStronger pic jVSzoBB— Wales 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿March , Goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey will join an exclusive club by becoming the third Welshman to win  caps. Only record caps holder Chris Gunterand Balehave played more games for the Wales men’s team than Hennessey, who made his debut in May . Hennessey has spent most of the last  years as Wales’ number one and was a pillar of the side which reached the semi-finals of Euro . He has lost his place to Danny Ward over the last year or so, but injury to the Leicester goalkeeper sees Hennessey reach the three-figure landmark during this Wales camp.Young blood vw,vw,px, px\"Exciting winger Brennan Johnson could get another Wales opportunity against the Czech Republic .removeBoss Robert Page is planning to make changes after the physical and mental energy spent against Austria. Bale, Aaron Ramsey, Daniel James and Joe Allen could be candidates for breathers, with Page saying he has to be mindful of club situations. Dylan Levitt may be a midfield option and Cardf’s Rubin Colwill is hoping to play at his club ground with his three previous appearances all coming away from home. Exciting winger Brennan Johnson is a probable starter given outstanding form which has brought him  goals in Nottingham Forest’s Championship play-off push.Rodon motivation vw,vw,px, px\"Tottenham defender Joe Rodon has become a pivotal player for Wales despite a lack of action for his club Joe Rodon has started as many games for Wales as Tottenham this term – five each – but there the similarities end. Whereas Rodon has struggled for game-time under three dferent Spurs managers – Jose Mourinho, Nuno Espirito Santo and Antonio Conte – he is one of the first names on the Wales team sheet. Rodon made light of having less than three hours of first-team football since November’s international break to produce another eye-catching Wales display against Austria. The -year-old centre-back appears to be in the shop window on international duty and, unless his fortunes improve at Spurs, a summer move could be on the cards.Familiar foes vw,vw,px, px\"Daniel James, left, scored in Wales’ - World Cup qualying draw away to the Czech Republic in October This will be the third meeting between the two sides in the last  months. Wales and the Czech Republic were paired in the same World Cup qualying group and the Dragons had the better of the two games. James’ late header secured a - Wales win in Cardf last March. Ramsey and James were on target in a - Prague draw in October as Wales took second spot behind group winners Belgium. The Czechs’ only win in this fixture was a - home success in Euro  qualying, with two other games finishing goalless..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Bale may be rested as Hennessey wins th cap  u Wales talking points article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

There have been in excess of , objections to this application.”For more on this announcement, click herePoliticians from a range of parties have welcomed this latest development in the long-running story.South Antrim Alliance MLA John Blair said: “This is the right decision for residents both in Mallusk and further afield.“It is the result of sustained pressure by the local community and cross-party opposition across south Antrim and north Belfast. That hard work, led by the NoArc group, has now prevented this proposal going ahead and my thanks go to all who played a part.“While the technology may be acceptable, the location was not, given the inadequate local infrastructure and other issues.”Antrim and Newtownabbey SDLP Councillor Roisin Lynch said: “This is an incredible result for all of the campaigners who have tirelessly worked to protect communities in Mallusk and across Co Antrim that would have sufferedthis incinerator project went ahead.“The threat of this project has hung over our community for years. I want to thank Minister Nichola Mallon for taking this decision and every campaigner who has given their time, energy and commitment to this cause.”South Antrim UUP MLA Steve Aiken said: “The announcement by Nichola Mallon that she has refused planning for the Hightown incinerator is to be heartily welcomed. “However, today, I want to particularly pay tribute to NoArc and their steadfast campaign that today has been fully vindicated well done.”Alderman Mark Cosgrove, UUP group leader on Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council, said: “I’m obviously delighted at the decision by the minister which is vindication of the position I have held for many years. “I want to pay a personal tribute to NoArc in their steely determination to represent the views of the overwhelming majority of thousands of local residents.”UUP Cllr Robert Foster commented: “Hopefully this is the final decision in this long running saga and I pay a massive tribute to the tenacity and determination of NoArc who fought this project from day one.”Campaigners have been voicing opposition to proposals since they were first unveiled in March . Among their concerns are visual impact, light and noise pollution and health implications. They also question the economic benefit of the project.Reacting to the announcement on social media, a spokesperson for the NoArc campaign group said: “NoArc thanks Minister Mallon for her decision. Thanks to all for the continued support.”Following the collapse of the Assembly in , DfI announced in September  that full planning permission had been granted for the waste disposal facility at the Hightown Quarry site. However, the Court of Appeal subsequently ruled that Stormont officials did not have the legal authority to grant such permission.----Read More Read More£m Mallusk incinerator proposal update sought by Mid and East Antrim CouncilNichola MallonPoliticiansNewtownabbeyNorthern Ireland  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularPortadown man Matthew Crawford was a kind, caring man who al...NewsConcern for missing Lurgan man Ciaran Penny...NewsMallusk incinerator: Arc planning application refused by M...NewsMid Ulster police make drink drive arrests...NewsNo bin collections during Unite strike...NewsMost Popular                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us           \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

This resulted in shows losing the opportunity to raise vital funds that would help prepare for the  season. “Shows play a vital role in showcasing our excellent agri-food produce and supporting our rural communities, as well as boosting our economy and the additional tourism opportunities. These shows are predominately run by many volunteers who give of their free time and I would like to extend my thanks to them for all of their hard work. “Pre-pandemic agricultural shows attracted more than , visitors. It is essential therefore that NI shows have the opportunity to run a full schedule this year to promote and facilitate future economic growth for agri-food businesses and I am pleased that I can support their efforts through the provision of the pound, bounce back support scheme I’ve announced today, which will allow each show to claim up to a maximum of poundk for new or increased costs. “Departmental officials will contact shows directly in the next few weeks to assist them in availing of my support scheme.” Looking to the future, Mr Poots has announced plans for an independent review of local agricultural shows, which will explore the potential for longer term support options and help shows remain sustainable in the years ahead. He added: “Although I am providing support to our local shows this year, I am of the view that Government departments and local councils should consider options for longer term support. “I am therefore announcing plans for an independent review to commence in the next month or two which will aim to explore future support options and guide future policy, in addition to identying new and innovative methods which would be utilised by local shows to help safeguard their future.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cecbaaeefb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cebfbdbfebfefb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1635169051553.jpg--hargey_tackles_digital_exclusion_through_provision_of_free_broadband.jpg?163516905100","title":"hargey tackles digital exclusion through provision of free broadband ","story":"Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey has announced the provision of free broadband for those facing digital exclusion as a barrier to work.

The Fund can provide a non-repayable grant of up to pound,, in a  month period, to remove barriers to employment.
